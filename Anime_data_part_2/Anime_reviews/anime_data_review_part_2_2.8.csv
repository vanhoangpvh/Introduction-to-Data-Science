Wakakusa Monogatari: Nan to Jo-sensei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2558/Wakakusa_Monogatari__Nan_to_Jo-sensei,"[""Once upon a time, a woman named Louisa May Alcott published the book Little Women, and it wound up being a surprise hit, so much so that it spawned two sequels. It's popularity around the world couldn't be ignored. It was so popular in Japan that FIVE anime were made for it within three decades, two of those anime being part of the World Masterpiece Theater staple. The first series was made in 1987, and this version, based on the book Little Men, in 1993, the year I was born. On another related note, whenever a show or anime gets a sequel, usually it's just...for a cheap cash grab, and they end up not as good as the original version. However, there are extremely rare times when a sequel ends up not only matching the greatness of the original, but being better in both quality and execution thanks to a loving, ambitious staff? Funnily enough, Little Women 2: Jo's Boys, is one of those better sequels. (Note: the title for this show is very misleading, because even though it's called Jo's Boys, it's not based on the book its named after. Rather, it's an adaptation of the second book, Little Men. The reason for the translation is unknown. The Japanese title is Wakakusa Monogatari: Nan to Jo-sensei, making it less misleading. They probably chose the third book's title to show that it's really about the children Jo takes under her wing, the majority of them being boys)You don't need to know very much about the source material to enjoy this anime, but it's a little good to know what happened before so you know why these characters are doing what they're doing. Anyway, Jo March, the second child in her family, is now happily married to Fritz Bhaer, has two very young children way below school age, and started up a new school called Plumfield, hoping to encourage a new generation of children to fulfill their hopes and dreams regardless of the sexist, gender preferential social norms of the time. The story begins with a new student, Annie Harding, aka Nan, arriving at the school. She's quite the tomboy, like Jo was, and they wind up forming a strong bond, but not without some troubles along the way. Nan has no trouble making friends with the many colorful classmates like the prim and proper Daisy, her gentlemanly brother Demi (Meg's kids), the shy and gluttonous Stuffy, the timid but musically gifted Nat, and especially the school's class clown and prankster, Tommy, who isn't above picking on her and pressing her buttons for the fun of it. All of Jo's kids learn various lessons on life and hope to grow into good people.Starting in 1989, the budgets for WMT shows began shrinking with each passing year due to disputes with the TV station, but it didn't stop the producers from delivering good animation quality despite a few hiccups here and there. It's pretty much the same as other WMT anime: soft, fluid when it wants to be, and it does its job well. The soundtrack is okay, but engaging as it is, I didn't find it to be to my liking. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. I liked it, but some pieces made some scenes come off as kinda cheesy despite its intentions. It didn't bother me much, and I've heard MUCH worse, so I'll let it slide. Yeah, I don't have much to write about for this part.Once again, just like with every WMT anime ever, the characters are the show's strong point. Everyone has personality and character to them, and aren't just cardboard cut-outs. You have the tomboy who just wants to be accepted for who she is, the prankster who has some hidden depths to him, the young lady who feels like she can't be like her friends the way she is, etc. Nobody's bland or one-dimensional. Not only that, every character has subtle backgrounds, and even when you don't know who their parents are or what backgrounds they come from (Nan, Nat, Daisy/Demi, Tommy, Stuffy, and Jack are the only ones who have confirmed relatives mentioned, shown on screen, dead. No, it's not the same for every single one of them), you don't need to do a lot of guessing in order to figure out what kind of background they come from. Not only that, the episode's stories are decided by the characters, which creates good, interesting conflict, like Nan going past the fence to collect berries with Rob only to get lost during a storm, or Dan convincing Tommy and Nat to play poker in the dead of night. None of the conflicts come off as cheesy, melodramatic, or forced. They play out quite naturally, like they would in real life. Plus, isn't it fun to see a bunch of kids having fun and chasing each other around, like we used to when we were young? Also, Tommy is the most adorable thing ever, and the fact that he's voiced by one of the very first anime singers I've been exposed to isn't helping matters (it may be due to seiyuu bias! Sorry!).I originally saw the first ten episodes in 2011, when Licca Fansubs first worked on it, but I dropped it at episode ten for two reasons. The first being due to other obligations I had to attend to, like school. The second being...I found episode ten to be rather boring, and I kinda lost my motivation to watch the show after that, also because Licca Fansubs took a while to release episodes due to the translator's health problems. I got back into it a month ago, and by God, dropping it at episode ten proved to be a HUGE mistake, as it was the episode right before it suddenly grew the beard and became awesome, particularly with the introduction of one character named Dan Kean. Seriously, the show suddenly got awesome after that, as introducing Dan really opened many doors for the series, all of which were explored and executed wonderfully! It also paved the way for some of the best, most well executed conflict, internal and external, I've ever seen in an anime, and it never let up, reaching a whole new level. Since then I've been immersed like no tomorrow! THAT is what Growing The Beard (find it on TVTropes) is and how it's done! I really wish shows like these got dubbed here in the US, because I see no reason to think American kids won't love watching sweet shows like this about kids being kids, growing up, and learning important life lessons. Seriously, who says American kids HAVE to love only high octane action shows?If you're looking for something sweet and heartwarming that'll remind you of the good old days and keep you on your toes at the same time, this is one of those anime I wholly recommend. for a cheap cash grab, and they end up not as good as the original version.

Should you watch it? Probably notThe first reason is because there is a huge amount of content skipped (the entire book called “Good Wives”) making this anime feels like it shares almost nothing in common with the first anime and doesn’t even include a summary to help you know what happened to the four March sisters.The only recurring character is Jo who had a 180° change of character, from a tomboyish girl who didn’t believe in love and wanted to be an independent woman,...writing books for a living, she turns into a tender and caring mother figure taking care of problem children’s in Plumfield, making her feel like she’s just not Jo. There are some brief moments there and there where her former personality comes back to the surface but these scenes occur way too rarely to really matter which is a shame because they prove to be quite enjoyable.*Meg and John also make a brief appearance in the series but have so little influence on the plot they’re not really worth mentioningThe second reason would be its linearity and lack of progression. While essentially it can seem that it isn’t a big problem as a lot of WMT shows have plenty of stand-alone episodes that weren’t useful and didn’t contribute to the grand narrative, I can’t help but feel it was a waste being this way in this anime.The premise of the show I find is actually quite promising as it is good opportunity to build a coming of age story, the plot being actually similar to GTO with Jo acting as a special teacher for children and helping them overcome their problems. And this is where I was heavily disappointed, it spends so much time on random slice of life episodes that their development feels scarce and they get stuck in their basic archetype introduced at the beginning. When the end finally comes, it feels mostly undeserved as their aspirations and plan for the future are crammed into the last few episodes of the show instead of being gradual, the only exception being Dan.It feels even more of a waste by the fact that Little Women actually had all that, each of the four sisters personality felt complementary and the plot moved in a satisfying way, prioritizing their developments and reactions to the different events surrounding them.Had they kept the same approach and direction to the story, it certainly would’ve been much more satisfying to follow.This review probably sounds more negative than I want it to be, I think it stands perfectly average in the realm of World Masterpiece Theater anime so you can definitely have fun with it.Just try to keep in mind that if you want to get a better enjoyment of it, either consider it as a standalone or maybe read the missing part of the novel. writing books for a living, she turns into a tender and caring mother figure taking care of problem children’s in Plumfield, making her feel like she’s just not Jo.

Bible quotes aside, Wakakusa Monogatari: Nan to Jo Sensei is a great anime about teaching children to have a love of learning and to bring out their full potential. Of course, it is on the optimistic side, sometimes to the point of sacrificing some realism, but it’s a children’s show, the optimism is part of the charm. That said, the show doesn’t shy away from introducing some pinches of tragedy into the story, along with covering some more...mature topics regarding poverty and sexism in an era before women could vote.Set in the New England countryside just before the 20th century, the show is a nice change of pace from typical Japanese high schools, but that’s to be expected from a World Masterpiece Theatre anime. The open fields of grass and crops dotted with trees and ponds surrounding the wooden school really add the show’s magic and make it feel so cozy.Regarding the original Ai no Wakakusa Monogatari, this show is quite detached. It’s much more like its own thing that happens to have some of the original characters in it than a proper sequel, for better or worse. If all you’re looking for is closure on the original show, then you might be disappointed to learn how little continuation there is here. But on the other hand, it also means you can watch this show without seeing the original (I’d recommend watching both anyway). mature topics regarding poverty and sexism in an era before women could vote.Set in the New England countryside just before the 20th century, the show is a nice change of pace from typical Japanese high schools, but that’s to be expected from a World Masterpiece Theatre anime.

"Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san. Z",https://myanimelist.net/anime/16241/Yondemasu_yo_Azazel-san_Z,"[""A good gag anime is one that can make us laugh. A great gag anime is one that can not only make us laugh, but can creep on us with the unexpected.Yondemasu Yo, Azazel-san. Z is a sequel which you can expect the same things from its predecessor. More characters, laughs, slapstick, silly gory scenes, lewd jokes, the works, but one of the grand things about the sequel is not only the comedy, but the sudden twists in events. The sequel is a great addition with more antics and problems needed to be solved than before, by our cast.Story:If you've watched the...first season then you'll know what to expect. Our summoners and demons take on jobs, solving them in the most strangest of ways and doing even more hilariously bizarre things on their time off. However, unlike its predecessor, this sequel gives more to the viewer then before, thought all our demons were good for was some comedy? Think again, for unforeseen events take place that can make you actually wonder if you're still watching the same comedy-filled show you started.Art:The art and animation are nothing to glorify, but it all fits well for this anime when it comes to the slapstick and characters. Nothing has changed that you haven't seen before in the first season.(Which I hope you have done before coming here)Sound:What's a good gag anime without great sound to make the experience more enjoyable? To the over the top acting done by the demons, to the background music fitting in with a scene whether it be some sort of fierce battle, comedy and even depressing scenes. They most certainly took great attention to the sound and it came out great.Character:Character progression is not something to focus on when it comes to the humor. All we need to know is the personalities of each character and you're good to go. Whether it be a lustful demon, a shit-eater, or a masochist, the characters will play that part for the rest of the show. The characters are shallow with no real development, but that's not what is really important to this anime. What makes the characters interesting is their interactions with one another. The things they do and say to each other is what makes it great, making their pain, your enjoyment and with more demons then before, there's plenty of that!Enjoyment:While Yondemasu Yo, Azazel-san. Z is not the funniest anime I've seen it did not fail to make me laugh or even feel other surprising emotions later on. The episodes are short and sweet leaving room for more hilarity in every episode at the expense of just a little of your time. While the humor is crude, it's funny, but it isn't for everyone. However, those whom are okay with some good crude humor, prepare for a blast.Overall:Yondemasu Yo, Azazel-san. Z is what I'd like to say, a success to its prequel. It's not perfect, but it does its job in the comedy department and even tries to overstep its boundary and go the extra mile. If you're looking for something to kill-time and get a laugh, take a seat, 10 minutes is all you need. first season then you'll know what to expect.

Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! Precious Friends,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44141/Watashi_ni_Tenshi_ga_Maiorita_Precious_Friends,"[""Months ago, I decided to watch an anime called Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!, abandoning all the warnings about how degenerate Miyako has become. I, for once, did not like her character (despite having forgiven then disappointed time to time), but after seeing everything in this movie, she has gained a forgiving pass from me once again. This review explores the movie in a fundamental enough fashion, so I will try my best to keep it as simple and pleasing to the eyes as possible.The movie, titled Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! Precious Friends, ventures into Hana and the details about her little flower-shaped hairpin....Along with her group of friends, her unwilling-for-long-distance-travel Miyako and the parents, they have a field trip to the countryside where Hana's grandmother lives. Miyako's talents for excellent sweets baking and costume making concern the grandma, as she also finds ways to show the five adorable girls the ropes, despite not bearing any of Miyako's talents to begin with. Sweet-making helper of Hana's grandma, who is also a friend but way older, appears to have given her the similar hairpin in the past (a precious hairpin that symbolizes their friendship).Later on, the friends pay a visit to a local festival, and all of a sudden Hana's hairpin is missing somewhere. Miyako tries her most to find the hairpin and eventually she and Hana successfully find it. In a similar fashion to the elders, Miyako ties the hairpin back on Hana's hair, as a sign of their friendship might be changing, bit by bit but positively.Everything you love and laugh of from the main series is returning for a short-term reminiscence: five young girls walking and playing on their way to Hinata's house, the Mya-nee, Hinata having great sense of culture for calling Noa the cutest, among many other familiar banters that can put a smile on your face if you are in need of their presence. The movie did not have enough time (more likely, wasn't able to) for a more fulfilling, excellent experience, but it has accomplished enough given the plotless yet wholesome main story. I would give a greater appreciation to it if Hana were not as skeptical and enjoyed herself despite feeling uneasy around Miyako, or Hinata and Noa had more quality adventure. One positive plus from the movie was the way they changed [almost] completely my point of view to Miyako (from an insanely cosplay obsessed fanatic to an endearing friend of Hana that is willing to bring Hana back to a happier state at least).Colorful animation and pleasant music tracks are nice treats for Slice of Life fans and Doga Kobo anime fans as well. Doga Kobo's animation has been inconsistent and shifting a lot between quality and derp but its coloring theme always generates a cheerful and positive feeling to the watchers. And of course, when it comes to music, Takuro Iga keeps up their usual quality with the signature masterly composed soundtracks.Overall, Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! Precious Friends might not excel in any terms of a wonderful Slice of Life anime project, but it did many wonders for telling their audiences that a precious friendship comes from even the tiniest symbol/object. For me, the movie was a nice starting point for a busy working week to be experienced later on. Along with her group of friends, her unwilling-for-long-distance-travel Miyako and the parents, they have a field trip to the countryside where Hana's grandmother lives. Miyako's talents for excellent sweets baking and costume making concern the grandma, as she also finds ways to show the five adorable girls the ropes, despite not bearing any of Miyako's talents to begin with.

Zhen Hun Jie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33350/Zhen_Hun_Jie,"['Well this is the first Chinese anime I have watched and I have to say despite of not being used to hearing Chinese I found this anime very intriguing and I’d say any person who loves some good storyline, this feels and action packed anime is worth a shot.Before getting deeper into the review I would like to clear some points:1.\tYes it is a Chinese anime so getting used to the voice would be difficult.2.\tAfter the first episode the rest are on an average 11 minutes long but don’t let the episode length dissuade you, the anime offers a good quality content.Now since it’s my...first review I’ll be as concise as possible, I would say the story is still a diamond in making, also the plot development and the way the story has been portrayed will keep you intrigued throughout the series. Yes, the Chinese will throw you off a bit or maybe a lot but don’t give up on it because the story will compensate for it. The animation will also need some getting used to as it sometimes dwells into the 3D animation in some of the fight scenes where the CGI doesn’t gel well with the 2D animation. The action sequences might give you a little bit cringe for not being very well detailed but the overall artwork is considerably good. The opening and closing tracks are good with music tracks fitting well with the fight sequences. Also you might find the translations a bit off sometimes but despite the language barrier the story will get through.To sum it up I’ll say keeping aside the language cringe and bit of disappointment on the animation which might be probably due to not much funding the anime is worth giving a shot as I’m sure you’d find the plot very intriguing and the character development very well done. first review I’ll be as concise as possible, I would say the story is still a diamond in making, also the plot development and the way the story has been portrayed will keep you intrigued throughout the series.

The ""current"" part which would be considered to be the actual main plot follows a woman and the 2 brothers, where he woman after an introduction gets hunted by an organization who are after a power hidden within her.The show has 24 episodes, but only about 250 minutes of actual screentime, and this hurts the plot development speed quite a bit, since only about 140+- of those minutes are focused on the ""main plot"" while the rest is backstory, making it feel a bit slow at times.Another problem with the main story is that due to time limitations and the very elaborate explanations given throughout the show, the plot doesn\'t reach its\' end, this is a show that needs a 2nd season in order to flex it\'s muscles, and the ending hints that it might be produced in the future.Apart from these problems listed above, it\'s a good and well elaborated plot which actually contains a number of good plot twists and you can\'t guess exactly what will happen in the end - it keeps you interested as to what will happen.Art: 7The art in this show uses both 2d and CGI, and mixes them at times. There are very good moments of quality animation but also quite a bit of letdowns.A good example of the letdowns are the ""generic soldier"" enemies, as well as the hyper sped-up movements at times.Some character expressions are done very well and the show is consistent with both its\' good animation as well as bad animation.There is not much more to be said, it\'s not too generic, it\'s not too good, but it\'s certainly not bad.Sound: 9Here I have a couple of things to mention, and it\'s partly BIAS to my preference. The OP/ED track is very catchy, fits the show like a glove. praise.The same can be said about the soundtracks for battle etc. They fit the tone the show sets in the moments they are played.As for voice actors, they have their ups and downs - especially since they are chinese and I have no long previous experience with chinese voice actors.The baby voice in the early stages is despicable,  the main characters sound ""normal"" and the baddies have unique voices, fitting for baddies.There is also a small nitpicky problem with our girlie MC at times - there is a bit of static noise that can be heard at certain points with the microphone.I usually say that: Story sets the ""reachable level"" of the series, Art quality with help of good voice acting can make the show reach the level the story sets and a well written character can push the story beyond it\'s potential. However the sound quality and soundtracks is what you remember of the show after you watch it.This is true when it comes to this show, Both the story, art, character and voice acting are fairly in-line with eachother, but if I hear the first 5 seconds of the OP in a year I will know that it is from this show. I mentioned the word ""Praise"" earlier, and this was not an understatement. The OP/ED only needs a few great catchy seconds in the beginning for you to remember it.Characters: 8Without spoilers, some things will get left out.We have a generic superhero MC, a generic weak MC with hidden powers as well as superhero\'s brother who is quite strong himself.I\'m not sure which of these to regard as the real MC, but it doesn\'t really matter. Our superhero MC acts tough from the start, but we later get to know that he\'s mostly just acting, and everything he teaches and scolds our lil girl MC for are things that he himself has had to experience or had problems with in the past. The girlie MC has to learn to become strong in her heart and not rely on others for everything, however hard it might be. Good development throughout the show for these characters.Our villains are a bit of a mix, we have our generic villain and his army as well as the more fleshed out backstory villain and his guardian spirit, who actually defies his master in secret due to his master becoming more and more dishonorable and wicked throughout the story.Enjoyment: 10I watched this show in just about 5.5 hours, and it was worth the time. The main plot is pretty generic compared to other action/supernatural japanese animations but the execution is done very well, and it remembers its place as to how powerful a character is and the limits to what can be done in terms of villainous scheming. There are no superpowers that are not explained thoroughly and according to the ""laws of the storyworld"" nothing actually breaks them, and nothing is explained a minute before the MC gets some kind of superpower. In other words - It\'s not a generic shounen where the author had no more ideas and chose to 3rd level Bankai his way to safety. All the objects are already is place (some are obscured) way in advance of the actual events that happen.Overall 8: Good show, can definitely recommend if you can live with chinese voices. became the general of Rakshasa Street.

Each street is protected from evil spirits by a human General that has the power to summon spirit general guardians from Chinese history.Story: The show is actually split into two parts: Yin and Yang. Yang describes the journey of female protagonist Xia Ling as she discovers Rakshasa Street and finds her spirit guardian with the help of current General Cao Yanbing. The Yin part portrays the backstory of the Cao brothers. The two...parts alternate with one another so sometimes the transition can be a bit disruptive. The Yin part does a better job in terms of pacing while the Yang half suffers from repeated dialogue and filler comedy. However, the later episodes does a good job at piecing the two parts together. Unfortunately, because each episode is only around 10 minutes, the show sometimes does not have room to fully flesh out the story. For example, I would have liked to learn more about the world and the backstories of the spirit guardians. Given that there is a second season, it's possible these may be explored more then. Nevertheless, the show is hard to put down due to the excellent character development.Art: Word on the street is that the show had a relatively small budget and this can sometimes be evident. The animation is not always fluid and there is a good bit of scene recycling or stills. However, there were a few scenes where the animation was superb and shows how much Chinese animation has come along. The 3D fight scenes look a bit out of place and do not mesh well with the usual 2D scenes. The 3D by itself can be bad (sometimes to the point that it's funny) and the transition can be fairly jarring. Character designs, unfortunately, were a bit of a letdown especially when it came to the enemies. While the main characters have distinct enough designs, the enemy minions / evil spirits all share the same design so it's often difficult to tell them apart.Sound: The soundtrack has a a good number of memorable pieces and the pieces, in general, are very well done. I've really enjoyed the opening piece where flames rampage through the streets to form the title of the show. The background music does a good job of setting the mood for the scene but it does only that. It's not synchronized that well with the scenes so while it's there to amplify the mood, it's not completely one with the scene.On the other hand, the voice-acting is decent. For the most part, the voices fit the characters. I think Xia Ling's voice is the only one that doesn't quite fit. Sometimes the pitch of her voice fluctuates so you think she's being voiced by multiple people instead. On the other hand, a shoutout needs to be given to the voice actor for Xu Chu, who I think has had the best performance.Characters: All of the characters undergo a decent amount of character development. Xia Ling goes from someone that always relies on others to someone that can now work towards her goals independently. Meanwhile, Yanbing realizes that his current world is too small and needs to start his journey as well. Everyone is able to recognize their own and each other's flaws and overcome them in their own way.Overall: The best part of the show is it's attention to detail. Without revealing too much, the show sets itself up for a decent plot twist near the end. However, viewers should be able to figure out the twist if they pay attention to the various hints dropped throughout the show, from the voice acting to the art, and I've enjoyed the thought the writers have put into this. Overall, this show has proved to be an enjoyable ride and I'll be looking forward to the next season. parts alternate with one another so sometimes the transition can be a bit disruptive.

I would advice this for anyone who is willing to give a chinese anime a chance.Story: 9The story was outstanding, not only did it tell two stories but was blended together superbly. One episode was of the present time and as we learn about he characters and what drives them now, we also get another episode of years before and saw them develop to what they are now. It did not feel forced nor did it feel out of place. It was a smooth transition and I was looking forward to each episode to learn more of their past...as well as what's happening in the present. Otherwise the story is rather simple, does not get too complex but for sure had a great storytelling aspect to it.Art: 6The art was nothing great nor was it displeasing to the eye. It is a chinese anime and today's standards it wont be anything above sub-par. It does have some CGI scenes that I wasnt too thrilled about but, it didnt take away the enjoyment of the show for myself.Sound: 6Copy past what I said about the art for the sound. Nothing outstanding, but neither is it bad.Character: 9I really liked how they developed the characters the way they had. You get to understand the sibling's feelings due to the way the show paces itself. It took time to develop it's characters splendidly and did not miss a step in doing so. The show really has only a handful of characters that the viewers get to see but they try to really make you understand them. Well mostly with the exception of two people. But I am happy they did not try to go into detail about a couple side characters due to this story being about the hardships of the siblings and really tried to bring them to life to the viewers.Enjoyment: 10One of the very few anime's that I actually did not get bored at any moment. i sat here watching and loving every minute of it. When I watch a great anime there are always those filler moments or downtimes that makes me feel like I just need to grind through it. Alas with this show I had not felt any of these moments. Maybe because they were telling two stories at once, or its because they are mostly 13 minute episodes either way I loved it!Overall:8.5 - 9Worth a watch for sure, its getting a second season so it did something right. Again though, if you are not into chinese anime dont watch it, if you are able to get by the different language and the lower grade art/sound that we have been having the pleasure in experiencing as of late then you will be in for a treat. Where the show lacks n the eye candy, they make up in the heart of the material. Found this on a chance and happy I did! as well as what's happening in the present. Otherwise the story is rather simple, does not get too complex but for sure had a great storytelling aspect to it.Art: 6The art was nothing great nor was it displeasing to the eye.

Maybe because they were telling two stories at once, or its because they are mostly 13 minute episodes either way I loved it!Overall:8.5 - 9Worth a watch for sure, its getting a second season so it did something right. Again though, if you are not into chinese anime dont watch it, if you are able to get by the different language and the lower grade art/sound that we have been having the pleasure in experiencing as of late then you will be in for a treat. Where the show lacks n the eye candy, they make up in the heart of the material. Found this on a chance and happy I did!"", ""This was my first Chinese anime. I watched it for my 2018 Anime Watching Challenge and I am glad I picked it.Rakshasa Street follows two different story lines. On the odd numbered episodes, it follows the story of Xia Ling and Yanbing. Yanbing is a Spirit Host, which means he has a Guardian Spirit protecting him. Xia Ling finds out she is a Spirit Host too, and with the help of Yanbing and his brother, Xiao Liang, she begins to learn how to control her Guardian Spirit.The even-numbered episodes take place in the past and follow the lives of Yanbing and Xiao Liang when...they were children. It tells the story of how Yanbing becomes the Requiem General of their home.Rakshasa Street has a lot of backstory and world-building involved, but it does a great job of breaking it down into the short 11min episodes. I particularly liked that the storylines alternated. There is a very good twist in the story. I feel that if the episodes were chronological, it would not have gone as well as it did. The story is the strong point of Rakshasa street. It's interesting and compelling in some areas and it can be rather emotional. It covers brotherly love and forgiveness as well.The characters, however, can be kind of one-dimensional. They cover a few tropes. Yanbing is the cranky teacher. Xia Ling is a stubborn student. Xiao Liang is a wise prodigey. Throughout the show, you will come to understand why Yanbing is so cranky and why Xiao Liang is wise. Xia Ling can be annoying.The animation shifts between good and alright. There is digital animation and CGI. The CG is usually reserved to large fight scenes when many characters need to be animated. For the most part, it's not CG. The character designs are interesting, but there is a little too much family resemblence between Yanbing and Xiao Liang. They are practically identical, especially during the arc when they are children. A change in hair style would be sufficient. My favorite character designs are all the different Guardian Spritis in the show. Some have very traditional Chinese elements and some look like hideous monsters.Overall, Rakshasa Street was an interesting show. The ending hints to a second season, which I will definitely be watching. they were children.

At first glance Rakshasa Street, also known as Zhen Hun Jie, appears to be your basic Supernatural show (a la Bleach or D.Gray-man). But they’re a few quirks that make this anime stand out from the crowd.Story/Character: The title of the anime, Rakshasa Street, is quite misleading. Indeed in Hindu mythology “Rakshasa” are creatures comparable to demons in Christian beliefs. Thing is: this anime has nothing to do with demons, the show is more about “Spirits” actually. Between The Human World and the Spirit World they’re transition areas...where Spirits can wait to be dispatched later on to “Ghostdom”. These transition areas are called Requiem Streets. Each Requiem Street has a watchman guarding it from evil spirits. One of these watchmen, Cao Yan Bing, is the General of Rakshasa Street. To help him in this task he can summon a fearsome guardian spirit: Xu Chu. Cao Yan Bing can also count on his brother, Cao Xiao Liang, to keep Rakshasa Street safe. There is a strong bond between those 2. This is due to their troubled past, the brothers have been through a lot during their childhood. To reflect this Rakshasa Street alternates between Past and Present episodes to unfold its story, a one of a kind story I might add. Despite the fact that the anime is somewhat short (24 Episodes, each one around 10 min length, except for the first and the last one which are standard 25 min) the anime is very hard to put down. This is due to the quality of the story, the succession between Past/Present (known as Yin/Yang Episodes) and the excellent character development. These features will keep you begging for more. Also please note that the first episode is a mixed bag. It’s not bad per se but from Ep 2 and on the anime gets SO MUCH better.Animation: Well this is the main beef. You see Rakshasa Street is a small-budget anime. As far as I’m concerned the animation is decent (above average that is) except when the animators switch to 3D CGIs! In those rare instances the animation is plain ugly, quite reminiscent of the pathetic inlays that were so common during the early days of Animation (almost 1997 meh-quality to give you an idea). This is the kind of jarring transition that can turn off the casual viewer making him think he’s watching a worthless piece of junk. This is not the case let me assure you. And considering the animators had such a tight budget to work on I can be quite lenient about it. Because the animators still succeeded in making a mesmerizing anime.Soundtrack: the music of Rakshasa Street is fantastic. This is the kind of OST that grows on you and ends on you music player, \'nuff said. The anime rocks on its own but the music turns it into a real piece of badassery. The memorable music magnifies the epic scenes of the anime (and they are quite a few of these in Rakshasa Street).Language: Rakshasa Street is the vanguard of these new Chinese animes trying to make a foray worldwide. So the anime is dubbed in Chinese. At first I thought I needed a few episodes to adjust to the new language. Surprisingly only a few minutes were needed before I could get accustomed to these new accents/intonations.Conclusion: If you look past the few ugly 3D CGIs and the somewhat subpar first episode, Rakshasa Street is a memorable show. The gripping story, the badass soundtrack and the refreshing Chinese historical references thrown into the mix make Rakshasa Street stand out from your random Shonen of the week. Single-handedly this show succeeded in reigniting my passion for Shonens. Highly recommended.note: a second season has been announced for April 2018. Saying I’m pumped up for this S2 is the understatement of the century. ;DEdit 2020: So finally 5 episodes are available for Season 2 right now. This delay has apparently nothing to with the current health situation. It\'s just that they have decided to divide S2 into 2 batches. The second batch has been announced for this Summer.

I had never heard of this before, and just decided to randomly watch it and ended up binging the entire thing in one sitting.  It's a 3D Chinese anime, so perhaps that's why its not as popular as it should've been, I don't know, but it was absolutely fantastic and should be more well known.The story surrounds the bond of two brothers who grow up through hardships to fulfill their destiny of protecting Rakshasa Street from evil spirits and outside enemies.  In the first half of the anime, they do a fantastic job of making...you care about the brothers and the bond they have through it all.  In the second half, they are dedicated to swerving the hell out of you as the viewer, and twists are incredible.  It goes from tear jerking to jaw dropping throughout the entire series.  They add the humor through Xia Ling, a semi-air head who the brother's have to protect for certain reasons.The story is far and away the best aspect of this anime, which brings humor, drama, and action together in a near perfect blend.However, the anime isn't without its flaws.  Mainly in the 3D animation parts, which is usually where the action was happening.  There's no getting around it, the 3D animation here was absolutely atrocious.  Like straight out the 90s.  Fortunately, the entire anime wasn't created in that style.  In addition, due to the events of the anime, one of the brothers becomes a bit annoying, which kind of drags on the later episodes, but the story more than makes up for it in the end.This anime was an unexpected gem and I definitely think anyone who likes drama and action will enjoy it.Story: 10Art: 4Sound: 7Character: 10Enjoyment: 10Overall: 9 you care about the brothers and the bond they have through it all.

Well, let's start with the (not too) 'negative' aspects.CHARACTERS (6/7). Judging the characters is a bit difficult. I think the two brothers, that are the main male leads have a well defined personality; their choices and their opinions are coherent with their psychological evolution. The spirit guardians are also nicely scripted, and they have a sense of loyalty that makes me fell the historical Chinese warrior-lord relationship and which makes them more interesting than some narcissistic/stubborn/selfish servants of the Fate series (but I don't want to compare them...cause I love the Fate franchise and they are different things, it's just something I was thinking right now). It would be a 7 for them. What I didn't like is the villain and the female lead. I'm not going to spoiler, let me just say that I think the villain has a bit of a cliche-personality, that could have been more acceptable IF there had been a deeper psychological analysis or development (like their relationship with their guardian spirit). The female lead is also a cliche and she disappointed me. Since in several occasions they pointed out her idea of gender as an obstacle to find her place in society etc, I was expecting a development of the character; instead, in the end she is literally useless. I understand that she is new to this world, but even her dialogue make her seem like a complete idiot. I mean, c'mon, give her something interesting to say...she has only a passive role of running away, being treated as a nanny, being scolded, repeating what others tell her. She literally doesn't have a personality. For these last reasons, I would give 6 to the characters.ART (7) cannot compete with most recent Japanese productions, but it has nothing to be ashamed of compared to some American and French productions that have been aired on European TV channels. It is not my first donghua and, considering the current stage of development of the Chinese donghua market, this is a full 7 for me. 2D animation is absolutely enjoyable, but some fighting scenes switch to a cheap 3D animation, that kinda ruins the mood. But, again, overall this is a good product.SOUNDTRACK (9). I want to talk about the ost right after ART because the soundtrack is what made a lot of lower quality scenes enjoyable and powerful. I am really sensitive towards good soundtracks. I have to recognize it: I think I heard only 5 pieces throughout the donghua and they were perfect for the scene and helped setting the pace of many fights. The opening is short and gave me this 'yeah, let's rock and be strong together'-vibe. The ending is also well played and I love the integration of a few traditional opera notes.STORY (8). I can't say too much, because I want to avoid spoilers, but the last episodes set some turning points and reveal some unexpected truths that bring the plot to the next level, transforming an otherwise good but banal action in something a bit more intriguing.ENJOYMENT (8). I binge-watched it in three days during my lunch and dinner breaks from studying. It has been really entertaining and 'light' . The episodes are shorter than the usual 20 minutes ep, so you really want to go on to know what happens next. After the first episodes, the pace gets better and the past-present narration keeps your attention and interest high.OVERALL? I would use a 9 if I were being listening to my personal tastes and to the feelings I have after the last few episodes about the past (who knows will know), as well as to my recent desire to get to know Chinese donghua better, trying to be open-minded with cheap products or ONAs, and to the freshness this anime gave me. But, summing up all the marks I gave before and trying to be more objective, I would say an 8 is a fair grade.Sorry, that's my first review and I'm not good at being brief...Hope it was helpful!

It just felt very strange, very Christian purgatory for me, waiting to be judged.I hated the way the show unravels itself of showing basically one episode when they were young, then one when older as it spoiled that feel I enjoy when watching an anime, and put me off quite a lot.    For those especially who break up how...they watch anime even more so.I also wasn't keen on the idea people could screw around with spirits with no real consequence from some greater body.  It felt like the head of the street would keep order but if they never and generated massive problems, nothing happened.The stories are different, the characters are not the most in-depth, you don't really learn much about the enemies of the requiem streets,   You don't even know why some people die is the reality.

My Goddess is a great compliment to the first season.  With more characters, more romance, and more fun episodes, this series has definitely improved.StoryAlthough the anime lacks a compelling, overarching story, I find the 1-2 episode stories to be very fun and entertaining.  Each episode seems to center around a different character but shares a common thread of love and the importance of friendship and family.  There are many new romantic developments that occur for side characters, but the Keiichi and Belldandy's relationship does not seem to progress as much as you would like it...to.  Still, there are plenty of ooh and aww moments as the new relationships are very cute.Art and SoundAs expected, the art and sound haven't really changed much from the first season so there isn't much to add to this section.CharactersPart of what I like about the series this time around is that they made Belldandy's character more human and imperfect.  She gets drunk, her license is suspended, and she gets jealous and upset.  Another plus is that they really focused more on relationships and the growth of all the side characters.  For example, Otaki, Keiichi's senpai, was a very random character in season 1, but he actually shows a much softer and caring side when he gets a girlfriend.EnjoymentI found this season a lot more enjoyable than the first one.  With more growth, better comedy, and a lot of touching scenes, it really leaves you feeling satisfied.  Without a strong storyline and many characters to depict, the anime really focuses on creating a lot of fun situations so you cannot go wrong in terms of entertainment.ConclusionAlthough this season doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it serves its purpose well.  It is a very entertaining, light-hearted, comedy with plenty of feel good moments.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who watched the first season. to.

Keichi accidently phone calls the goddess agency and interacts with the goddess beldandy. She grants him one wish and his wish is to stay with her forever. This is just outlined on the first episode. The story makes you feel that its going to be a rather interesting romance between these characters but as you get further, there is little to no plot devolopment and the love theme that is used gets to be rather redundant over time.Animation:the animation was average at best and there really is no eye candy colors to be had...here.Sound:Probably the only great thing about this series is the opening theme song. The rest of the music played in the show is just boring and does not follow well with the scenes in the show.Character:There are few character interactions and love triangles that you will encounter, but its not very character driven.

Those who loved season one will enjoy Flights of Fancy even more.', ""*Minor Spoilers Warning*With regards to the second season of Ah My Goddess; does it really do anything new or exciting to make it better than the first season of ah my goddess? Unfortunatelynot, but it doesn't do anything worse either. It's pretty much the same thing as you would expect from the first season but some aspects of the storytelling are much more frequent while other aspects of the storytelling are less frequent.In this second season, Belldandy and Keichi have been together for a year and despite this season not having an overall focal point, not even at the very end of the second...season. It still takes its time with establishing the relationship between the Keichi and Belldnady because even though they are very well aware of their feelings for each other they still struggle to vocalize those feelings which may be frustrating to people who want to watch the show and see the relationship reach the next level. If your expecting to see the relationship reach the next level then your going to be sorely disappointed but despite the slow pace of the developing relationship it doesn't really detract from what makes the series so enjoyable.This second season does have an overall theme of conflict and what I mean by that is the majority of the episodes of this series focuses on seeing and exploiting the weaknesses of Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship. As flawless as we all see character Belldandy, we get to see some of the character flaws that she has, especially on the feeling of jealousy because there are several attempts that are made to disrupt the relationship between Keichi and Belldandy. There are several occasions throughout the entire season where a competing love interest is brought in in order to provide conflict in Belldandy's and Keichi's relationship. This is in the form of another Goddess by the name of Peorth from the Earth Help Center that Keichi calls accidentally and Hild who is known as the leader of Demonkind and is also Urd's mother. In a way, these new characters add some very much needed depth into the series and while they can act as a thorn with regards to the relationship between Keichi and Belldandy they are needed and their contributions to the overall plot of this series does ultimately help the evolution of the relationship between Belldandy and Keichi. With regards to the conflict our typical antagonists from the first season are still present in the second season of this series such as Sayoko, Toshiyuki, and Marller but they don't show up nowhere near as often as what they did in the first season.One of the biggest surprises that I found with the second season of this series compared to the very first season is that there is very little action in the second season of this series compared to the first but overall action is not really needed to strengthen this series, so if your expecting some action set pieces in the second season of this anime than your going to be incredibly disappointed. The lack of action in the second season of ah my goddess is more than made up by the amount of comedy in this series. The second season is absolutely hilarious especially when you have Keichi put in one embarrassing situation after another especially when other females start to take a liking to him. We also get to see Belldandy get drunk when she drinks Cola which leads to some awesome hilarity. It's the sheer amount of hilarity that this anime has is what keeps the pacing of this anime very consistent even though every once in a while it can still have that ability to have a very few heartfelt episodes as well.Urd and Skuld still have their moments to shine in this series as well. Their tiny little story arcs throughout the second season give us a much needed break from overall progression of Belldandy's and Keichi's relationship which can get a little frustrating from time to time. We get to see small plot points such as Skuld getting her very own angel, Urd being split into two beings because of her angel and demon half, and seeing some insight into urd's love life. Even side characters that didn't have much screen time in the first season of this anime, get their time to shine in the second season of this anime. We even get to see some history of the auto club.The art is still beautiful in this series, but unfortunately I did not find the music memorable in the second season.Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship is still quite endearing to watch despite how slowly paced it is, but regardless of how slow the progression of their relationship is, it is still ultimately the foundation of this entire anime and it is still enjoyable to watch. It is a nice feeling to watch them work out their problems and have their heart to heart conversations and there are quite a few touching moments in this entire anime. Belldandy's caring and patient nature is always refreshing to see and she is always the type of person to always see the good of any situation regardless if she loses her goddess license or even becomes a demon for a short amount of time. Thankfully Keichi's akwardness and shyness is a perfect match for belldandy's natural ability to be kind and thoughtful.Overall, the second season of ah my goddess is a perfect companion piece to the first season but it may sour some viewers based on the fact that not much progress has been made with Keichi's & Belldandy's relationship. However, it is still an enjoyable watch with a good mix of humour and heartfelt moments which contributes to the excellent sense of pacing that the second season of this series has as a whole.Favourite Character: BelldandyLeast Favourite Character: Skuld8/10 (I Recommend it.) season.

This is more of a supernatural romantic comedy intended for younger viewers.Aa! Megami-sama! is a fairly light-hearted show that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Goddess Urd’s main weakness is Enka music, First Class Demon Marller\'s (Mara) Kryptonite is rock music and lucky charms, and our main guy, Keiichi gets transformed into a motorbike in S1. There’s hardly any repercussion from the real world about the use of magic either. Human characters acknowledge that something happened, then ignore it altogether. As the insanity progresses, you\'ll have to start not caring about how ridiculous...the world is.Initially, I thought that the romance wasn’t bad, until it started to get redundant. Kei has a lot of weaknesses in the confidence department and it improves, but at a snail\'s pace. He still needs a ton of pushing from the goddesses to even attempt to do something lovey-dovey with Belldandy. It took Peorth four episodes in a row in S2 to get Kei and Bell to even manage a confession. What? Even through all the turmoil they went through to get closer in S1, I feel like both Kei and Bell should know what they\'re doing by now.As you\'d expect, most of the episodes focus on getting Kei and Bell closer. And then there\'s a handful of filler episodes with side-characters that we hardly ever see again. Queen Mishima made a lot of appearances in S1 and she vanishes after two episodes in S2. However, there are some pretty decent episodes that focus on other lead characters. I honestly feel like the episodes with the spotlight on characters like Skuld and Urd are far more interesting than the main relationship ones because hardly anything truly significant happens. Quoting the ninja in S2, ""Belldandy and Keiichi\'s romance is below elementary school level.""Honestly, I’m about half-and-half with the filler episodes. Some of them are fun, while others are downright boring. I wished AMG maintained focus with mostly Kei and Bell relationship episodes dashed with ones about Bell\'s sisters and their supernatural counterparts. I don’t know if the manga had these lame side-stories, but if they did, they should’ve cut some of them out. The fluff and the lack of solid progression in Kei and Bell\'s relationship weigh the story down and reduced my overall enjoyment of the show. Other than that, the animation quality is pretty good and the soundtrack is fitting for most situations.

The beginning was fairly funny and entertaining but it started to lack something as I continued watching. Keiichi in my opinion is what was making the series less enjoyable, his indecisiveness and not having a backbone at all made me really frustrated throughout the series. Yes, this does make things more interesting but theres a extent to how much of a coward you can be. I personally feel bad for Belldandy for all the emotional rollercosters she has to go through because of his indecisiveness. Overall though It was a good series, the art was great, story...lacked some more development in the romance, the opening song was unique, and the character development progressed really well. lacked some more development in the romance, the opening song was unique, and the character development progressed really well.', 'The other peripheral characters all make the odd cameo, but have such small roles itâ€™s almost considered a waste.

The characters from the first series return with some improvements and some not and their are some new characters too which are enjoyable.Unfortunately I found the relationship between Belldandy and Keiichi still uninteresting but at least Belldandy does a few things naughty even though she doesn't like it and I still can't stand Tamiya and Otaki though Tamiya does have a romance which is fairly amusing. We also get to meet the annoying get to meet the annoying ex boyfriend of Urd.On the positive side Skuld improves a lot....The episodes where Skuld gets a boyfriend are some of the best in the series. We get to see Urd go bad again which is always good. Also Mara has a bigger role in the series and one of her plans actually works YAY!With the new characters we are introduced to Chihiro the ex president of Motor club who has lost her love of mechanics since leaving university despite landing her dream job. She is a feisty and fun character who just needs help find out why she is a motorhead.The best new character is the Ruler of Demons, Hild (opposite of the Almighty).

Another Goddess came down from heaven, ready to please keiichi and hilariousness ensued. Soon after that though it became downright un-enjoyable for me. For starters, it felt like everything in this season was just a rehash of things we'd already seen in the first season. Not the episodes plots, but the character interactions and lessons. Nothing new ever develops. Keiichi and Belldandy's relationship gets really old when it stops progressing. All that ever happens is the two of them saying I love you over and over while their relationship stays in the same place. They're afraid...to kiss each other for christ's sake! What really disappointed me about this season though was that it was less funny than the previous. Since I find the romance in this show so poor I watch it mainly for humor, and this season was not funny like the first was. to kiss each other for christ's sake!

This second series continues a bit after the first series and introduces a lot more mystical elements, explaining ""heaven"" and ""hell"" in greater detail, and exposing possible flaws that might endanger Keiichi\'s contract. While most second series seem to lose the luster from the original, this series stands out as it builds upon the first series and expands in a meaningful way other than increasing the animation budget (SNS2).Animation:The animation quality is similar to that of the first series so if that was fine, then this will be...as well.

Continuing to adapt the large wealth of manga plot arcs, the series introduces the popular 4th Goddess Peorth and the mischievous Queen of the Underworld & Urd's mother, Hild to great effect in recurring roles throughout the season and followup Specials/OVAs/OADs. A noted shift in this season sees Belldandy being the more introspective part of the couple this time around, as she assesses her growing affections for Keichi in the face of some of the supernatural adversity they see, where the first season focussed...more on Keichi's internal thought processes in the face of challenges to their relationship. Many more supporting players are introduced and fleshed out as the season progresses and I found between the following OVA 'Fighting Wings' and the AMG movie, the series received a nice wrap-up. Especially considering the Judgement Gate from the film was later used as a plot element in the manga finale, which helped give the film a sense that it was a definitive 'end point' for the animation, which correlated well with how the manga wrapped up with a 'test of conviction' itself. more on Keichi's internal thought processes in the face of challenges to their relationship.

The character Marler is an antagonist who doesn't make much of an impact. While there are additional movies and the old series available, it's clear that the show's unique charm is beginning to fade.

Aikatsu! Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22819/Aikatsu_Movie,"[""It says a lot about how charming and entertaining Aikatsu, a simple, unassuming slice-of-life series is when I am consistently finding it more appealing than all the big story-driven anime of today. It may not be anything amazing if you look solely at its story, but as far as pure entertainment goes, it is something quite special.The main TV series has certainly seen its share of criticism over the past couple years, and I can't say that most of that criticism is wrong. But considering the main complaint regarding Aikatsu has been its repetitiveness over time, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise...that its movie is a far more exciting package than the typical episode. It is not constrained by the show's episodic formula, so there is much more freedom to explore the characters here. And it does so on a far bigger stage.It also helps that it focuses primarily on a central group of characters (the Ichigo, Aoi, Ran trio) rather than the dozens of side characters, even if they do all show up for a brief amount of time. Aikatsu has always been strongest when it focuses on those three rather than the side characters who are more or less just walking catchphrases. That's not to say that all of them are that way (Seira is a pretty interesting character, for example), but I can't say I ever enjoyed it all that much when an episode would focus on someone like Otome rather than Aoi and Ichigo. They're still here, but not really. It's Ichigo's story.The movie has its share of emotional moments as well. It isn't aiming to make anyone tear up, as it would rather deliver something heart-warming rather than sad or dramatic. It works best that way, too, I think. Compared to other idol anime such as Idolmaster which veer very much into drama territory at times (and largely fail at it due to the huge, jarring juxtaposition between happy-happy slice-of-life and the characters screaming in angst), Aikatsu feels far more honest with itself. It's precisely because the emotional moments are natural that they even feel emotional in the first place.I just wish they could have done this without relying on the Ichigo and Mizuki rivalry. It was a nice way to give Ichigo a push into the idol world at the start of the series, but this late into the game it just feels unnecessary. Mizuki isn't a very exciting character in the first place: she's 'perfect', popular, everyone loves her, blah blah-- the typical shoujo rival who lacks any real personality of her own. I don't think I'd be alone in saying that the series would benefit from her disappearing for a while. Ichigo is so far above her at this point that I honestly have to wonder if there's something wrong with Mizuki's in-show fans.Aikatsu's movie is oozing with visual charm, from its colourful art style to the girls' performance on the big stage. The movie's CG is a huge step-up from the TV series, and especially from its beginning episodes where it was genuinely distracting (and just a little bit creepy). It blends in just fine here. I'd even go as far as to say it looks nice. There's none of the usual stilted animation and abysmal frame-rate that you typically find from CG in anime; the girls move and dance naturally. There's also a few subtle details in the animation of the movie's quieter moments, like Aoi listening to a conversation and nearly spilling her ice cream, that add to the 'movie' feeling and help the characters feel more alive and authentic.The only real flaw with regards to the movie's presentation is that the music is largely the same as the TV series. Considering the massive episode count of the TV series and the fact that the girls perform a song at the end of each and every episode, the music does get pretty stale after a while. There's really not much that can be done about this with regards to the TV series (a new song every few weeks would require an astronomical budget), but it would have been nice if the movie had an all-new soundtrack, or at least something a bit closer to it. The few new tracks that are there, however, are among the series' best.I would not recommend watching this movie without having sufficient experience with the TV series, but I suppose it can be done if you're wondering what the hell the series is about and perhaps don't want to watch 140+ episodes in order to find out. Just do keep in mind that the characters are the source of the series' enjoyment, and without any attachment to them I'm not entirely sure you'll get all that much out of the movie.Compared to most shoujo anime which focus on teenage drama and abusive relationships, Aikatsu conveys themes far more valuable: friendship, family, and bringing happiness to others. I don't think Aikatsu is necessarily something you'll be watching for its themes (they're subtle enough that you may not even notice or care about them), but these details do succeed in making it a much more positive presence in the anime industry than most of what gets shoved at girls these days. And guys, too. The anime industry needs more Aikatsu and less harem-teenagers-superpowers-savetheworld nonsense that encompasses half of the anime airing today. Aikatsu is not deep or brilliant or anything of the sort; it's simply excellent entertainment, which is more than even most 'serious' anime can say.And really, Aikatsu is the kind of show that I could recommend to anyone without hesitation. Unless you value your masculinity more than anything else (in which case there might be some insecurity issues at play), Aikatsu being primarily aimed at 12-year-old girls shouldn't have any impact on your enjoyment of it. It's a better slice-of-life than just about anything that comes out these days, and the movie especially so. The idol aspect really isn't that important. Aikatsu is much more than that.There's also Aoi, and Aoi is a blessing upon the world. Yep. that its movie is a far more exciting package than the typical episode. It is not constrained by the show's episodic formula, so there is much more freedom to explore the characters here. And it does so on a far bigger stage.It also helps that it focuses primarily on a central group of characters (the Ichigo, Aoi, Ran trio) rather than the dozens of side characters, even if they do all show up for a brief amount of time. Aikatsu has always been strongest when it focuses on those three rather than the side characters who are more or less just walking catchphrases. That's not to say that all of them are that way (Seira is a pretty interesting character, for example), but I can't say I ever enjoyed it all that much when an episode would focus on someone like Otome rather than Aoi and Ichigo. They're still here, but not really. It's Ichigo's story.The movie has its share of emotional moments as well. It isn't aiming to make anyone tear up, as it would rather deliver something heart-warming rather than sad or dramatic. It works best that way, too, I think. Compared to other idol anime such as Idolmaster which veer very much into drama territory at times (and largely fail at it due to the huge, jarring juxtaposition between happy-happy slice-of-life and the characters screaming in angst), Aikatsu feels far more honest with itself. It's precisely because the emotional moments are natural that they even feel emotional in the first place.I just wish they could have done this without relying on the Ichigo and Mizuki rivalry. It was a nice way to give Ichigo a push into the idol world at the start of the series, but this late into the game it just feels unnecessary. Mizuki isn't a very exciting character in the first place: she's 'perfect', popular, everyone loves her, blah blah-- the typical shoujo rival who lacks any real personality of her own. I don't think I'd be alone in saying that the series would benefit from her disappearing for a while. Ichigo is so far above her at this point that I honestly have to wonder if there's something wrong with Mizuki's in-show fans.Aikatsu's movie is oozing with visual charm, from its colourful art style to the girls' performance on the big stage. The movie's CG is a huge step-up from the TV series, and especially from its beginning episodes where it was genuinely distracting (and just a little bit creepy). It blends in just fine here. I'd even go as far as to say it looks nice. There's none of the usual stilted animation and abysmal frame-rate that you typically find from CG in anime; the girls move and dance naturally. There's also a few subtle details in the animation of the movie's quieter moments, like Aoi listening to a conversation and nearly spilling her ice cream, that add to the 'movie' feeling and help the characters feel more alive and authentic.The only real flaw with regards to the movie's presentation is that the music is largely the same as the TV series. Considering the massive episode count of the TV series and the fact that the girls perform a song at the end of each and every episode, the music does get pretty stale after a while. There's really not much that can be done about this with regards to the TV series (a new song every few weeks would require an astronomical budget), but it would have been nice if the movie had an all-new soundtrack, or at least something a bit closer to it.

Yep."", ""This is a review of the movie that happens after the events of episode 112, I wouldn't recommend to watch this as the first thing you see of the series since you will miss all the attachment to the cast, but I can't recommend enough to try out the main series, the total amount of episodes might look intimidating but now that I reached the point of the movie I'm sad of being so relatively close to the end. The characters are so absurdly lovable and following them in their steps through the idol world and all the events that happen along the way is...tons of fun, I can't recommend it enough. With that said, let's start the review.At the start of this movie, Ichigo recieves a chance to take one big step in the world of idols with the organization of a super live event, and we follow her and all the friends (and somewhat rivals, but they are more friends than anything and I love that) that she made along the way to make it an unforgettable experience for everyone.The pacing of this movie was fantastic and kept me hooked from start to end, seeing them prepare everything, mixing the comedy from the characters, the heartwarming moments of appreciation between them (and the people, like the designers, who brings them all the help to shine), and the struggles that happen during the preparation of such events, all leading to to the fantastic live event that made me feel like if I was there with the rest of the audience between all the songs and some surprises along the way.This movie also touched a lot a theme that I love from this series: finding the inspiration for a dream thanks to another person. Mizuki is so important for Ichigo after changing her life making her want to enter the world of idols at the start of the TV series, and the appreciation and admiration that Ichigo feels towards her reaches me, we see that in a very satisfying way in this movie both for this two characters, and also for Akari towards Ichigo as the generations of idols keep passing and the younger characters find inspiration on the ones we have seen grow during the series.The visuals are an improvement in comparison to the main series, with the CGI of the dance scenes delivering hard as usual, the improvement the series made on this part from the start of the series to now is impressing. In terms of songs, outside of few (and great) exceptions, the movie reuses ones from the main series, I personally don't mind that at all since that made me sing along with the characters when they played, only making the “concert experience” even better.I really like pixel art and the movie caught me off guard with the ending, playing the main OPs and EDs that didn't show up before during the movie together with the pixel visuals, too good.This movie was everything I wanted it to be coming from Aikatsu and I couldn't be more satisfied. Definitely a must watch for any fan of the TV series. tons of fun, I can't recommend it enough.

For a person that is fan of the series is a good opportunity to watch in a rainy day or in an evening you don't have anything else to do.The story is really simple. Ichigo is planning and producing with her friends a festival with her name, so she has to search for a good song and a new dress. This time, is a good opportunity to see all Aikatsu characters all around at the...same time. So, movie is set up between season 2 and 3, so new characters like Yuri or Madoka doesn't count.Talking about the characters the only ones that have really development are two. The first one is Mizuki. In this movie for unique time we see what is afraid of and some of here doubts of being an idol. I can't say more because it will be some sopilers, so... let's continue. Ichigo is a person that anybody can admire. She knows that she can't do things alone, so, she accepts help of anyone so this is a good thing if you want to succeed, and she does in this movie.If I am honest the music is good, while watching the movie, a lot of Aikatsu past songs return, so, if you like idol music you can sing with the characters. Basically the festival is only to show how many song Aikatsu has. The music is enjoyable, fun and invite you to dance with the characters. But personally if you hear too much those songs later you can get tired.The problem with this movie is that it focused only on Ichigo and that's why I got mad with the movie at the first time I watch it. Why only Ichigo? Aikatsu have plenty of other Idols. Maybe a group festival... But thinking it, Ichigo is the first protagonist of the series, is her story, not the others (well, yes, but Ichigo is the important one). So, It is good that the movie protagonist is Ichigo. If you have this on mind you will enjoy the movie, just like me at the second round I watched it.Overall is a 7. It is good, have an average animation, not too different of the main tv series, it doesn't have anything new  things to anime. It is only a good opportunity to hear many Aikatsu songs all gathered. This and watch a conclusion on Ichigo and Mizuki idol activities, for now. same time.

Aa! Megami-sama! Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/304/Aa_Megami-sama_Movie,"[""My goodness, what an unfabulous piece of crap this was! This movie stunk, and I advise anyone with sense to avoid it.The romance is awfully cheesy and harem-y.The characters are bland and one-dimensional and totally predictable, especially those too brown-haired losers who are the so-called protagonists, tThe sound was unimpressive, and the animation was average. It played out to me as one extensive episode, not a movie. Movies have a certain feel to them, and it was severely lacking in this so-called &quot;movie&quot;.It just wasn't exactly easy to follow if you hadn't seen the series, but you would get it immediately that the...two main characters are in love, everyone else are side-kicks. That doesn't say much about how they work out the plot or anything about subtle nuances. Most of the drama was shoved in your face, and I can't say I enjoy anime that do that.One of the dumbest anime I ever had the misfortune of seeing; I was screaming, 'Ah! My poor brain!!' after watching it. two main characters are in love, everyone else are side-kicks. That doesn't say much about how they work out the plot or anything about subtle nuances.

It is always moving and you can't wait to find out what happens next.Art:This was made in 2000 so of course the art isn't going to be like what we see now-a-days in anime. The art looked like it was a mix between between the tv series and the OVAs. I...give this a 7.Sound:I kinda wish they would've had a better background score for this. The background selections were nice to listen to, but I wouldn't listen to them without the movie. The ending song that the Goddesses sang wasn't that good and the ending theme wasn't all that amazing either. But they did pay a lot of attention to sound effects. 8Character:If you haven't seen at least the OVA or the first season, you will be uterly confused. Seriously. If you have though, then you are in for a treat. All of your favorite characters are back and get further developed and then the new characters come in and they get developed fully. 10Enjoyment:As I said earlier, I wasn't bored for a second of this.Well maybe a second every now and then, but not a lot.

My Goddess"") OVA to have been unexpectedly pleasant, but was still somewhat skeptical about whether I would like this movie. God I was wrong. This turned out to be a far superior offering than the OVA and exceeded all my expectations.This was much better because the one of the main problem with the OVA is the outrageous story. The way Keiichi hooked up with Belldandy is totally absurd. But thankfully, with the movie, all of that are now bridge under the water, and we\'re now simply working on the basis that they are already a couple. With that...stumbling block out of the way, the movie was able to operate a lot more naturally and the story becomes a bit more convincing than the OVA. On the negative side, I was somewhat confused by all the sci-fi aspect that feels forced into the anime. The way heaven operates with cyber technology and with the Goddesses able to link up with the computer system as though they were digital beings themselves just comes off as a little odd.Compared with the original OVA, the animation lost its slightly dated look, and was a lot more polished and pretty in general. The music is still good, though not quite as catchy as before. The characters are just as likeable, if not more so than in the OVA. Emotionally, it\'s a lot more dramatic than the OVA, so was much more of an engaging watch. But one of the bad points is that Belldandy is still rather one dimensional. It doesn\'t help that I find her voice to be quite annoying. Another thing that bothered me was that the motivation for the actions that some of the characters took feels a little weak.Like the ova, this is a hard anime to hate because of the charm it possesses. But this was good from the beginning whilst the OVA\'s started off a little weak.

I\'ve never seen the anime nor anything else except for a few figures I happened to find of Belldandy that I did not buy.

He is released by a fairy by the name of Morgan le fay where he plans to plot his revenge against the gods but in order to achieve this he needs to use...Belldandy to do it. It is important to note that Celestin is Belldandy's former mentor and Belldandy's memories of her mentor were erased after the incident that caused Celestin to be sealed away to begin with.One of the biggest things to love about this film is how well it is animated. The film is absolutely gorgeous with regards to its character designs and environmental landscapes. In this film we get to see in great detail the world that Belldandy comes from in all of its splendor. The English voice cast in this movie is incredibly stellar with a good mix of new and upcoming voice talent from the time this film was made to some incredibly seasoned veterans of the voice acting industry.We have all the characters that make this series wonderful and memorable and for the most part their personalities are still accurate depictions of what we're accustomed to. The story of this film starts off strongly because we get to see all the characters that we have grown to appreciate still be the same way in which we last left them. Belldandy is always going to the main focus and strength of anything related towards the ah my goddess license and at the beginning we get to see Belldandy be warm and loving as always which is always a pleasant sight to see because we're all so use to seeing this character this way. Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship is still the central focus  of the overall film and its nice to see in the very beginning how their relationship has grown stronger and how much they ultimately care for one another.Unfortunately once Celestin enters the picture and starts to use Belldandy for his own selfish desires is when the film starts to fall apart because he infects Belldandy with a virus in order to stage an attack against heaven and as a result of this Belldandy loses all memories of her relationship with Keichi and for the majrotity of the film we see Belldandy as a shell of her former self and its a huge strike to do something to such a beloved character and the face of the ah my goddess series. As devastating as these series of events is to Keichi, he is always the type of character that tries to find the good in any bad situation and spends a good portion of the film trying to be supportive to Belldandy as much as possible with the help of Urd and Skuld. The more time he spends with her, Belldnady starts to have some faint memories of how much joy and happiness that Keichi has provided her in the past but its just devastating and more often than not frustrating to watch a relationship that we have grown to love and appreciate be set back to square one because we don't get to see Belldandy be the character that we're so use to seeing because she is infected with the virus that Celestin gave her.It makes things even more frustrating because they force two love triangles into this film to put Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship in more danger as these events are taking place. Celestin wants her former pupil all to himself, and the fairy Morgan who has her own tragedy in love to deal with is very jealous of Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship and tries to do things to make Keichi fall for her and be a part of her life. This entire plot point just feels tacked on and it really exists to take advantage of a bad situation because its simply not something I want to see. If the film focused more on Keichi trying to help regain Belldandy's memories instead of this shallow love trinagle nonsense than the film would of come across as more endearing.If its one thing that the ah my goddess series doesn't need is action. I love action in my anime as much as the next person but this is an anime that its strength is defined by its character development, its humor, and its unresolved approach towards love and romance. Unfortunately the humor that is known in this series is completely sacrificed for action because there isn't much in the way of humor throughout this film. The action looks nice because we get to see an extent of the power that some of these goddesses have and you have to find a way to stop the antagonist of this film. The surprising thing regarding this film is ultimately action is not the force that stops the antagonist, its making the antagonist see the error of his ways so that he sees things from the protagonists point of view is ultimately what stops him.Celestin wants to end suffering that humanity has had to endure at the mercy of the gods. He feels that the gods has not been doing its best to protect humanity and he wants to change that by rising against the gods to create a new earth free of suffering. It's a world domination plot point that has been recycled far too many times. Everybody has their own definition of how to change the world in order to better humanity in their image but one thing we all need to understand is that humanity is always flawed and in my opinion I don't believe a utopia should ever exist because society needs a perfect balance of good and bad in order to truly flourish. People will make mistakes, atrocities will happen, but we use horrible moments in history in order to better ourselves in society. You can't learn to appreciate the good in what humanity has to offer without enduring the bad.The ending while satisfying and endearing pushes a big reset button with regards to Belldandy's and Keichi's relationship which feels really cheap, but the endearing part of it truly shows that no matter what obstacles obstruct their relationship they fight these challenges together and their love ultimately comes out on top.Ultimately, the film does a good job on the world building of the ah my goddess world and the connection Earth has with heaven but it loses a lot of its charm by sacrificing some of the traits that makes these characters memorable by bringing in a student/mentor conflict that feels incredibly shallow and forced. It's a beautiful film to look at and a great film to listen to but hopefully you can forgive this movie for its shallow character development in order to look into Belldandy's history with her misguided mentor antagonist.7/10Favourite Character: UrdLeast Favourite Character: Morgan Le Fey Belldandy to do it.

Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship is still the central focus  of the overall film and its nice to see in the very beginning how their relationship has grown stronger and how much they ultimately care for one another.Unfortunately once Celestin enters the picture and starts to use Belldandy for his own selfish desires is when the film starts to fall apart because he infects Belldandy with a virus in order to stage an attack against heaven and as a result of this Belldandy loses all memories of her relationship with Keichi and for the majrotity of the film we see Belldandy as a shell of her former self and its a huge strike to do something to such a beloved character and the face of the ah my goddess series. As devastating as these series of events is to Keichi, he is always the type of character that tries to find the good in any bad situation and spends a good portion of the film trying to be supportive to Belldandy as much as possible with the help of Urd and Skuld. The more time he spends with her, Belldnady starts to have some faint memories of how much joy and happiness that Keichi has provided her in the past but its just devastating and more often than not frustrating to watch a relationship that we have grown to love and appreciate be set back to square one because we don't get to see Belldandy be the character that we're so use to seeing because she is infected with the virus that Celestin gave her.It makes things even more frustrating because they force two love triangles into this film to put Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship in more danger as these events are taking place. Celestin wants her former pupil all to himself, and the fairy Morgan who has her own tragedy in love to deal with is very jealous of Keichi's and Belldandy's relationship and tries to do things to make Keichi fall for her and be a part of her life. This entire plot point just feels tacked on and it really exists to take advantage of a bad situation because its simply not something I want to see. If the film focused more on Keichi trying to help regain Belldandy's memories instead of this shallow love trinagle nonsense than the film would of come across as more endearing.If its one thing that the ah my goddess series doesn't need is action. I love action in my anime as much as the next person but this is an anime that its strength is defined by its character development, its humor, and its unresolved approach towards love and romance. Unfortunately the humor that is known in this series is completely sacrificed for action because there isn't much in the way of humor throughout this film. The action looks nice because we get to see an extent of the power that some of these goddesses have and you have to find a way to stop the antagonist of this film. The surprising thing regarding this film is ultimately action is not the force that stops the antagonist, its making the antagonist see the error of his ways so that he sees things from the protagonists point of view is ultimately what stops him.Celestin wants to end suffering that humanity has had to endure at the mercy of the gods. He feels that the gods has not been doing its best to protect humanity and he wants to change that by rising against the gods to create a new earth free of suffering. It's a world domination plot point that has been recycled far too many times. Everybody has their own definition of how to change the world in order to better humanity in their image but one thing we all need to understand is that humanity is always flawed and in my opinion I don't believe a utopia should ever exist because society needs a perfect balance of good and bad in order to truly flourish. People will make mistakes, atrocities will happen, but we use horrible moments in history in order to better ourselves in society. You can't learn to appreciate the good in what humanity has to offer without enduring the bad.The ending while satisfying and endearing pushes a big reset button with regards to Belldandy's and Keichi's relationship which feels really cheap, but the endearing part of it truly shows that no matter what obstacles obstruct their relationship they fight these challenges together and their love ultimately comes out on top.Ultimately, the film does a good job on the world building of the ah my goddess world and the connection Earth has with heaven but it loses a lot of its charm by sacrificing some of the traits that makes these characters memorable by bringing in a student/mentor conflict that feels incredibly shallow and forced. It's a beautiful film to look at and a great film to listen to but hopefully you can forgive this movie for its shallow character development in order to look into Belldandy's history with her misguided mentor antagonist.7/10Favourite Character: UrdLeast Favourite Character: Morgan Le Fey"", ""Recently, I have been looking at various series films, without actually watching the anime beforehand. This was one of the films I picked on amazon, and it was the one and only anime that has ever made me cry. The film, while a little OTT in places, was so deep and heart wrenching that I couldn't help but shed a few tears for the characters.The story, while fairly simple, was charming and romantic. There were a few unexpected twists, some comical moments, and a couple of brief-ish fight scenes, but the main basis and theme here was romance.The animation, while not fab, was decent...and I found it to be quite watchable. Sure, it wasn't as artistic or as sophisticated as animes such as The Place Promised in Our Early Days, but it was decent and held all the charms of anime. I don't think I can knock it for that, so full marks.The sound was nice, and the music was beautiful; I downloaded the soundtrack after. Each song fitted nicely with the scene, helped to bring out the mood and made each moment feel complete. The dubs weren't too bad at all; Belldandy's voice fitted her nicely, wasn't whiny, but sounded perhaps a little bit vulnerable.The characters were nice. Belldandy was a rather hopeless female but the strength of the other female characters just about made up for that. I found that, after reading only book 1 of the manga, I understood the links well enough to enjoy each moment in the story and the relationships betweene each of the characters. It is necessary to know a little bit about how it all began, so I recommend reading the first manga or watching the first 2 episodes.Overall, it was very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the following:-The actual series- Love Hina- A.I. Love You- Chobits- Any other anime/manga with a strong love plot. and I found it to be quite watchable.

He is still going to university, still a member of the motor club and still living with Belldandy’s sisters. When a fairy releases a mysterious man from Belldandy’s past from his moon-prison, trouble is incoming.Unfortunately for this movie, the trouble is heading straight for its plot. The movie attempts a weird merger of rebellion against god, an 80’s hacker film, and a love triangle. Boy, does that not work out for me. The motivation of bad guy Celestin is never made clear, even though he spends a good bit of time talking about it. He wants to...end suffering by removing free will? Or does he want to enable everyone to have free will by removing the oversight of the gods? Or does he want to make everyone have the same level of happiness? The whole climax of the movie rests on his ability to explain his motives to Belldandy. She (obviously) sides with Keiichi, but it would have been nice if the viewers could see a case for the other side at least.We also do see very little of our main characters together. Belldandy spends most of the time in an amnesia-induced state. And when she is half-way back to her old self, Keiichi is either knocked out or mind-controlled. Due to the more serious tone of the movie, Urd and Skuld have to lay off their comedic routines, too. Oh, and what is up with Skuld not wanting to Keiichi to see Belldandy naked? You’d hope that they got past hand-holding after spending 3 years living together.The animation, on the other hand, is top. While the “heaven is a futuristic computer office” idea did not fit well, it at least looked good. And the ending is on the positive side of trippy.Overall, however, the good animation does not save the film from its plot. Someone who rebels against the gods’ order needs to be better at explaining his case to be interesting. I would have much rather seen a story that focuses on earth and leaves the heaven mysterious. The movie is not terrible, but a clear step down from the OVA. end suffering by removing free will? Or does he want to enable everyone to have free will by removing the oversight of the gods?

The movie is not terrible, but a clear step down from the OVA.', ""As another installation to the Goddess's series, this film pulls off a lighthearted watching with some intriguing highlights.The Story::..The film begins off the bat and I initially thought I was watching some visuals from Millennium Actress as a figure skitters across the moon's surface.  What an opening!  We see the usual characters and these are introduced very quickly before the main story gains momentum.  The first half seems to introduce a tangent universe where things between Keiichi and Belldandy might develop differently but despite the possibility of these two forging a new relationship, it focuses more on the detrimental effect of Belldandy's...lost memories.  Ongoing persistence is gold dust though, for their relationship is well and truly addressed by the end of the film in a manner resembling the bitter sweetness of an age old fable of star crossed lovers.As the plot breaks loose we get to witness the symbiotic relationship between Yggdrasil and our world.  But it is also worth mentioning that a surprising working concept comes to light regarding the existence and inner workings of the Gods and Goddesses themselves, it's worth observing these nuances when they come and go.Art::..Again you may be struck by the moon scene.  The film also gives us numerous chances to explore the scenery of the Gods' realm which is often strikingly beautiful in its magnificence and scale.  You will also find scenes involving intricate runes as well as some nicely integrated animation of the inner workings of Yggdrasil.Sound::..I recall some aptly placed classical style music which lends this film some strength.  The music resembles that of much of the series without anything that stands apart.Character::..A lot of credit goes to Celestin for providing a more Miyazaki-type villain, he tends towards both hero and villain, swinging often between the two.  He forms an interesting focal point for Belldandy's lack of resolve and raises some more interesting facets in Belldandy's personality.  We get to see a significant recount of Belldandy's past and learn of repressed memories which contrast with Belldandy's serene exterior.  Keiichi is agitated over Belldandy's state throughout but continues to show his best and most loved aspects.  Supporting from the sidelines, Urd and even Skuld get to flamboyantly show off great magical power in a couple of scenes.  Peorth shows sharp responses and leadership in an otherwise hopeless situation.  And the fact that the figure skittering across the lunar surface is from yet another realm shows that there is more to the series than simply Gods and Demons...Enjoyment::..For experienced anime viewers you may well come across references and concepts which give this film some greater fascination than you'd otherwise expect.  For instance the Evangelion-esque monolith near the end resembling Sachiel serves its purpose well if you're familiar with that specific franchise.  This film combines the most enjoyable elements of the series; overdrive-magic, a variety of costumes, Tamiya and Otaki in questionable garments, romance and adventure spanning the two (three?) worlds.Overall::..It's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the series and are particularly struck by the fated and star crossed love between Keiichi and Belldandy.  As it develops their relationship on a strong and colossal theme, this hints at a tale not merely confined to fantasy.  Man meets Goddess is what you see on the front cover.  What's weaved within?

The characters play their usual parts, act as they always do. Nothing out of the ordinary here.The art is where things take a turn for the interesting. It's something quite beautiful to look at throughout, and never...dips in quality for a second.But I still haven't got to the film's absolute best attribute yet; the music.

My Goddess' TV series!This film was the first piece of AMG animation that was seen since the OVA and Mini-Goddess Series back in 1990s and was a real delight with sky-high production values, grand scale, and modern animation techniques, as well as adding wonderful new characters/designs. The plot involved a threat writ large to existence itself and Belldandy & Keichi's love. At the time of it's release it was touted as a sequel to the 5-part OVA series, but has become retrospectively in my eyes, the logical theatrical sequel to the two-season TV series and 'Fighting Wings'...OVA/recent OADs. The TV series and follow-up animations mapped out approximately 2 years of Bell & Kei's time together, whereas the film solidly states that it has been 3 years since Belldandy had come to Earth, synching with the AMG TV timeline well. Another aspect of the film that helps identify it as a logical conclusion to the TV series is the film's plot device of the 'Judgement Gate' which was so well-received that Fujishima adapted the concept to his final manga arc, creating a nice parallel between the film's original idea and manga's later ending in a smart fashion.

Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28677/Yamada-kun_to_7-nin_no_Majo,"['In terms of an Honest review , This anime is pretty good , at first i thought it would be Alot of "" Ecchi/Harem""Type of  aspect in this anime  Judging it based on the english translation which is Yamada-kun and the seven witches . However, that is not the case as this anime has real potential on how the characters are developing and how the story is progressing as the series goes by.The negative thing about the anime is Body-swapping , Body-swapping in anime usually means one thing, and that’s fanservice. I’m not the world’s biggest fanservice devotee. Fanservice can devour an anime’s...plot and turn a show gross and mean in a heartbeat. In the worst cases, fanservice turns otherwise interesting characters into inauthentic caricatures of themselves, all in pursuit of the almighty panty shot.But, I am happy to say that the first two volumes of Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, at least so far, is just as good as people make it out to be; that’s a really big surprise, considering how a title like this could easily go wrong and end up a shallow fanservice style story. Yamada-kun is a very funny manga with a lot of heart and character that really all comes together in just the right way. There are flaws certainly, but the positives more than adequately outweigh the negatives.I have also watched the Last episode when it came out and i must say it ended pretty damn good for the first season which i will not spoil. Will see how the story progresses from there and will do another review on the next season?:PPositive thing which is really good about the anime is the :OpeningAnimationArt & CharacterStory sometimes can get off plot if you watch the anime you will know what i mean by this.P.S Please actually read the review throughly before ""Pressing the unhelpful"" button lol plot and turn a show gross and mean in a heartbeat.

Seeing it as one of the popular ones, and my favorite tags of comedy, school life and romance, I decided I would give it a whirl. Immediately hooked, I read about 50 chapters before stopping to go to sleep. However, after that, I was bogged down with school work and the like and I never got around to continuing it. I didn't have time for anime or manga at that point and went on about a 4 month break. However, recently the stars aligned and summer started and I had time to...watch. So with all the episodes out, I decided to binge the entire thing and be done with it, even if it isn't as good as the manga. So without further ado, here's my review of Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.Story: 7The story isn't unique, nor is it a masterpiece. However, it has its merits. The school romcom genre is already well established, and it isn't the first time that we've seen one mixed with supernatural. It also isn't the first time that we've seen an anime centered around kissing. And the characters in the harem (my opinion, others think that harem isn't correct) aren't the most unique either. But I can get to that later. The story, with only information from the title and the first episode, is centered around  our male protagonist, Yamada Ryu, the delinquent of the school. Upon his introduction, we are also introduced to Shiraishi Urara, whom I consider the female protagonist. Unlike Yamada, who is a violent, lazy delinquent, Shiraishi could be described as the ideal student: quiet, studious, and attractive. In essence, they are polar opposites. The plot arises when Yamada walks up the stairs and pushes Shiraishi aside. While doing so, they both trip and fall down the stairs. After blacking out, Yamada wakes up in the infirmary, only to realize that he is now in Shiraishi's body instead of his own. After some time, they realize that switching bodies is achieved through a kiss. Based on the title, we can assume that there are 7 witches, each with their own power. The strength in the story isn't the plot itself, but the execution of it. While the plot is certainly interesting, it's nothing we haven't seen before. However, the way it is executed is what sets it apart. The anime doesn't take itself overly seriously. It knows when it should be a lighthearted comedy, and it knows when to be a more serious, supernatural mystery story. Overall, the plot is interesting and is delivered well, but is no masterpiece.Art: 8Now I dabble a bit in drawing manga style characters, but I'm no judge of great art. However, even I can tell that this series looks good. Many of the backgrounds are well drawn, and the colors are typically bright and pop out. But the main point of this art score is the character design. The characters are all designed uniquely and are easily differentiated from each other. All the characters are designed in a way that makes them hard to forget, and they are all unique from the other students to signify their importance to the story.Sound: 7For me, the soundtrack was for the most part good but forgettable. I wouldn't mind listening to the soundtrack while watching, but I wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it again. So you would think that sound would be a bit lower, and honestly, I would put it around 5 or 6. However, the OP and ED are extremely catchy, and for those alone, I put sound at 7.Characters: 7As I said before, the characters aren't exactly original. You've got the tsundere, the kuudere, the loli, the older sister, etc. etc. However, for the most part, they are fairly likeable and undergo some form of development. Because the series is condensed into 12 episodes, the development happens much faster and sometimes feels awkward and forced. The only two witches who I think get any sort of notable development are Shiraishi Urara and Odagiri Nene, who is personally my favorite of the bunch. For the rest, their motives are typically defined by a single point, which is often just given rather than explained. As such, the characters are fun, but typically lack depth outside of this one point.Enjoyment: 9I try not to be the biggest critic, and there are merits to this anime. While there are flaws, if you go in with the right expectations and try not to think too much while watching, you'll come out most likely happy and satisfied. The ending resolves most of the problems, even though I could literally see it coming a mile away. Sure, it's predictable and cliche, but there is a lot of fun to be had here. Take it for what it is: a fun, supernatural romcom with a sprinkling of story. If you expect more from it, you will likely end up disappointed.Overall: 8Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo was a fun watch and had me laughing at times. It was a good experience, and I can happily say that it is most likely worth your time. It's no masterpiece, but then again, most shows aren't. It ranks fairly highly among my recently watched anime, even though I haven't watched that many recently. If you need a deep, plot driven drama, then this isn't for you. However, if you need a lighthearted romcom with supernatural elements, check out Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo. You won't be disappointed.~Thanks for reading my review! I'm still fairly new to this whole writing reviews business, so any advice or tips is entirely welcome. Also, rating helpful or not would be, well, helpful for me to see if I'm writing these correctly. If someone wants to talk anime with me, feel free to message me.

No really, I’m sure almost everyone at least had that thought once in their lifetime. So what happens when there’s a case of body swapping and you become a person of the opposite gender? I think that would be very peculiar experience. Yamada-kun to 7-in no Majo (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches) operates under circumstances where two main characters changes their bodies and well, you can guess from here that all sort of drama comes rolling.The series is adapted from the manga of the same name that runs...for over 160+ chapters and is still ongoing. Directed by Takuno Seiki, the show is a hit or miss. The hit part could be the comedy as the show really likes to play around a lot with itself. That’s because the body switching gimmick isn’t the only concept explored in this series. If you read the title, you’ll notice the word, “witches”. In a nutshell, there should be expectations that other sorts of magical or supernatural phenomenon will propel itself into the story. And that’s not an understatement. The miss part would be the storytelling. Before the series debuted, it was announced that the series would only be adapted into a 1 cour span of (12 episodes). It’s not a split cour, not a 2 cour, and definitely not a good piece of news to remember in mind.Make no mistake. The series takes off pretty quick as the pilot episode establishes the body switching gimmick quickly without wasting time. No more than 10 minutes into the series and you’ll see a guy (Yamada) staring into the mirror and realizes that he no longer has “it”. On the other hand, there’s the smart and beautiful Uraha Shiraishi who is now in the body of a delinquent. This all happened by a coincidental event when they landed on each other off a flight of stairs. While this all seems troublesome, they do discover that reversing the effect involves a kiss. This also revives the Supernatural Studies Club, a group of students dedicated in studying supernatural phenomenon. By this point, I think you can get adjusted to the idea of the show. It’s one of those series that really likes to play around with itself from the very beginning. In fact, almost every episode features some sort of unusual circumstance that ends up causing a lot of drama for the main characters.As a club composed of several members, the series gives the audience some insight on them. The titular character Ryu Yamada is easily noticeable for his delinquent-like traits and personality. Throughout the series, we see him as guy that uses his fist to do the talking although he does care quite a lot about his friends. Uraha is more of a polar opposite. Smart, beautiful, and stoic in a way, she often keeps to herself and is often thinks before she acts. The way the show formulates their relationship at first almost feels like it’s on auto-pilot. Since neither character are similar, they have to learn more about each other. In the story, we see how that progresses with each episode. Unfortunately, I can’t say that their relationship is really believable. While some series can easily capture the audience’s attention with polar opposite characters, this one just ticks a bit way too much with the comedy. Not to mention, we have the kissing part that is used as a plot device. The romance aspect of it feels forced and quickly rushed without developing much for our characters. However, I do have to say that the chemistry between Yamada and Uraha can be surprisingly charming. There’s a genuine mutual respect and feeling the two share as we can easily see that later on in the show. As for the other characters, we have Toranosuke Miyamura who serves more as a middleman, Miyabi Ito with her fascination of supernatural phenomenon, and Kentaro Tsubaki who happens to have a crush on Uraha. While not as prominent as Yamada and Uraha, they do play some key roles in the series. Unfortunately, some of them can be easily forgettable after first impressions.Then, there are the witches. There’s seven of them including Uraha. The series early on establishes the fact that all of them have a different power. We don’t know most of their powers or how they work until the witches reveal themselves. And as a 1 cour series, the show tries to seize every opportunity to capture that point. However, this is a really sour attempt to get screen time for them. The way the witches are introduced may leave some good first impressions but overall lacks development. Sure, some of them even get a decent characterization but by adaptation standards, too much is left out. The structure of the show suffers a lot from cramming and some episodes even takes a lot to get their own stories started. Also, relationship dynamics are played more for comedy so it’s hard to take it seriously. On the plus side, I have to give some credit to the clever powers that the series introduces. Each witch has a different power and all of them can create some rather entertaining storytelling. Additionally, each of the witches has different personalities so the story does feel a bit refreshing with such a direction.Despite having a lot of character and story pacing issues, one major aspect of the show that can win its audience over may be the comedy. The series isn’t a parody of witches but it can be genuinely funny. Yamada is a character that acts often in brash manners so his actions will definitely provoke some laughter if you see the trouble he gets himself into. Then, there are the powers. The concept of body swapping itself can be amusing to think about especially if a guy becomes a hot girl. Some of the other powers are troublesome but the show itself plays each gimmick cleverly to adapt with the developing story. There are also tons of kissing and although most series today makes it a highlight point between character relationships, this series does it casually and seems to be even self-aware. In general, comedy portrayal is a highlight and can be appreciated.Artwork in general is generic yet works well. The character designs is what is attractive for the overall adaptation. The guys hardly stand out; well perhaps except Yamada. However, the girls really are designed with attractiveness such as Uraha. In particular, the witches are all noticeable in some way or form with their hairstyles, figures, and even status symbol. Despite taking place in the school setting, there’s a load going on besides just in the classrooms. In essence, we see many places of the school explored with a fine degree of clever decorating. I also have to give some praise to the character expressions as it enhances the comedy aspect of the series overall.While I’m not a big fan of the soundtrack, the series does know how to utilize them. As the series portrays a lot of comedy, it’s important to capitalize on the atmosphere so the series makes use of more colorful OST. In most respects, it works well to get the viewers laughing. However, it’s nothing outstanding in terms of quality as it’s very standard. The OP and ED theme songs has a warm feeling to it though that is sung with a soft melancholic tone. But when it comes down to it, the characters’ voice mannerism will probably win you over. Yamada is a key figure to notice with his commanding voice as he gets into a lot of troublesome circumstances. Indeed, the series has this ability to communicate its gimmicks with the voices of the characters. Whether it’s the diverse voice mannerism of the witches, the Supernatural Club, or even the Student Council, it always seems to be noticeable.Gender bender isn’t a new concept used by the anime industry. Neither are witch powers, kissing, or a club that investigates unusual cases. Rather, I take this show as more of a comedy story with a bit of clever gimmicks thrown in at you on a weekly basis. The episodes themselves each tell a story with something that sticks with the overall theme of the series. Just note that by adaptation and storytelling standards, it doesn’t shine well especially with the structure, rushing, and is easily predictable. On the plus side, the comedy really can bring some laughs. Ever had a bad day and you wanted something to laugh about? Perhaps this series can be what you’re looking for. The series itself is like a personality. for over 160+ chapters and is still ongoing. Directed by Takuno Seiki, the show is a hit or miss.

The series itself is like a personality.', ""At first, i didn't have any interest to this anime. I was just picking some random spring anime to watch. I really didn't have any big hope for this anime. But surprisingly, it was pretty good.Story : 8/10Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a story about Ryuu Yamada, a second-year Suzaku High School student, who one day accidentally kiss a girl and later he finds out that he has Witch's power that is activated with a kiss.

As i went...through episodes, it became more interesting. In the middle episode of the anime, i started to read the manga. The adaption was really great.

The ending also was pretty good and well-executed, definitely it won't dissapoint you.Art : 8/10The art was pretty nice. It's pretty colorful, the designs were great, the animations, backgrounds, etc. All were well-animated. Your eyes will enjoy it.Sound : 8/10The sound was also really good.

The opening song was really great, it was nice to hear and pretty catchy, You won't even skip the opening song when the anime is played. The ending song was didn't really good, but still nice.Character : 8/10The main characters led the story pretty good. They were well-developed. The characters were funny, cute and lovely.

One day, he accidentally falls from a flight of stairs onto Urara Shiraishi, the ace student of the school. Yamada wakes up to find that he has swapped bodies with her! The two try to reverse the...change and discover that kissing triggers the body swap. Yamada takes advantage of this asking Shiraishi to take tests for him and discovers while in her body that she gets picked on for being such a model student. Yamada and his delinquent ways put a stop to the girls picking on her. Student council vice-president Toranosuke Miyamura, discovers this little event and recruits the two to revive the Super Natural Studies Club. Yamada and Shiraishi continue to use this exchange until an unexpected encounter with a certain girl reveals a another usual power activated by a kiss, in fact there may even be a few more....... thus the Super Natural Studies Club declare to discover the secrets of the Suzaku High School ""witches"". Although this task doesn\'t come with easy, nor does the situation turn out to be as simplistic as they thought.Characters: The characters all fall under hard personality tropes. No surprise there really, they are well written though. The cast is considerably large, all have some interesting backstory as well. Unfortunately because of time restraint, you only get a glimpse of these characters potential depth and with a flip of the dime, that\'s their character development. The best part of the show is the quality voice acting. The cast is great and their performances, especially Saori Hayami as Shiraishi and Ryota Osaka as Yamada are absolutely brilliant! Yamada is always late for school, naps in class and gets abysmal grades. His life is a dead bore. Even though he\'s a delinquent,  he\'s kinda a nice guy... for the most part. Urara Shiraishi is an exceptionally brilliant student known to be cold and asocial, due to her being ostracized by the students of Suzaku High. Miaymura is charismatic, be able to easily charm most people around him thanks to his look and being friendly in general. Despite this, he doesn\'t really have any friends. Miyabi is a considerably attractive and cheerful girl, due to her strange interest in the super natural, she is considered among her peers to be a fraud and a liar.Animation: It\'s pretty solid. The colors are nice and they move quite well. All the witches have a very distinct and interesting design. Some of their glamor drawings are absolutely beautiful. The OP was amazingly done. As was some of the faded frames during flashbacks and things of that nature.Sound: The music was pretty decent. Love ""Kuchizuke Diamond"" by WEAVER. Actually started listen to more of their songs. Choice of BGM was fun when it needed to be and dramatic when it should. It did it\'s job.Enjoyment: This is where I\'m torn. I thought is was really funny, I also thought it was very clever concept. I love the chemistry shown between our MC and lead witch. I also like all the characters and the story behind their personality and actions. But it wasn\'t nearly fleshed out enough to make the connection between Yamada and the witches, it was all really forced. And then the story was also incredibly rushed. The scenes were good but lacked any impact when they were so abruptly introduced and resolved. Near the end it almost became confusing, and not in a in-depth convoluted sense, but more like, ""well we\'re running out of time, so we\'ll skip the why and just go with the how"".So much was cut out, not just comedy but little bits of development that would make character relationships feel like they had a connection. And the quick pace eliminated any type of suspense or mystery to the development of the story. All of this could have been avoided with another 12 episodes and following the source material. This could have been an incredible show. As it is, it\'s merely fun. Definitely worth  watching.  7/10. change and discover that kissing triggers the body swap.

Spoilers ahead!)I think it is safe to say that everyone has a wish they want fulfilled. Money, power, and fame are the common ones, as they seem to be the most wanted. But money, power, and fame are not everything. More often than not, what we need most is not a shiny new car or rabid fans but instead something a bit more universal. A shoulder to lean on, a friend to hang out with, or a partner to hug; one of the greatest aspects in life are the relationships we share with the people around us....For it is these very relationships that do what those previous three wishes cannot: make us happy for a lifetime. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is all about relationships, wishes, and of course witches, that provides an average outing overall.STORYThe Seven Witches (as it will be named from here on out) stars Yamada-kun, a delinquent whose behavior makes him very difficult to associate with. One day, when walking up some steps, he falls, crashing into the top student of the school, Urara Shiraishi, which magically causes their bodies to switch. From there, the quest to find the other six witches begins.Perhaps the anime’s greatest strength comes in the form of the theme it tackles: the importance of relationships. Whether it is with friends, family, or anyone in-between, people are always looking to form a connection with those around them. This is the main point of the show, with the witch powers revolving around such a concept. For instance, Shiraishi is able to switch bodies because she always wanted to experience a different lifestyle, Nene is able to coerce others because she was looking to gain increased support, Maria can see the future in order to have others avoid terrible fates, etc. As the anime depicts, the girls have these abilities and use them on their fellow classmates not because they can but because they wanted to have everlasting relationships that they could not obtain otherwise. Scenarios like Noa dealing with some teenagers’ hardships and Meiko working with students to perform better on their tests showcase the differing ways in which relationships are formed and comfort is found in others.One of the best and simplest examples of the show’s emphasis on relationships that the anime employs is the kissing that is needed to use these witch powers. Kissing, be it on the hand, the cheek, or the lips, is a sign of affection towards another, and a known symbol of love between two people. Throughout the entirety of the anime, kissing is shared mostly between Yamada-kun and Shiraishi, but also between many more with gender being a second thought. Nobody thinks of it as anything more than a necessity until the end where Shiraishi clumsily goes through the act. She understands that now, after losing her power, the kiss’s true meaning is all that is left.But it took a lot to get to that moment; the girls, despite being granted amazing gifts, do not find immediate solace. In fact, while their status gave them interesting abilities, at the same time their powers actually prevented them from maintaining the relationships they so desperately wanted. Certain situations, such as Saionji’s ability causing everyone to forget about her and Maria being unable to have a boyfriend, made it impossible to create such relationships. Worst still, those around them were affected, too; Yamada and Leona experience this firsthand through the loss they undergo. In this way, the conclusion of the anime – where the characters discover that it was not their powers that allowed them to all become such good friends but the experiences themselves – is a simple message that finishes the narrative nicely.However, there is one glaring issue that The Seven Witches has, known as “firing and forgetting.” The anime follows usually the same sequence of events: learn of new witch, help this witch, and move on from said witch. There are minor discrepancies to this formula in the beginning (where the main group is being put together) and during one event in the middle (still dealing with forming the main group) but the show generally has the tendency to forego its most important aspect, namely the witches. Despite them all having interesting abilities, the anime refuses to use the girls in conjunction with one another or even after they have been discovered. This is strange because of the theme on relationships; one would think that, given the focus on it, such newfound relationships would play a more pivotal role in the scenarios encountered. Again, the non-witches are affected by this tactic as well because, after a certain point, cast members such as Miyamura and Miyabi are pushed to the side to make way for the anime’s next set of occurrences.ANIMATIONOne of The Seven Witches weakest areas is the art it utilizes. In short, it is boring; besides the characters themselves not visiting too many locations outside of their clubroom or other parts of the school, there is little in the way of detail. At the minimum, the show does use some pretty hysterical reaction faces – usually performed by Yamada-kun – that have the eyes bug out as giant, white spheres that have lost their pupils. It sounds scary but it works to make Yamada-kun seem even more incredulous.The character designs are very nice, especially for the female characters. While they tend to follow typical tropes for the medium – an uncommon hair and color combination – it fits with the uniqueness the girls have due to them being witches. Shiraishi’s long blonde hair and jewel-like eyes, Nene’s short purple hair, and Maria’s earrings with pink hair and ponytail, with each wearing their school’s uniform, is quite attractive. Yamada-kun’s spiky blue hair and unkempt attire also coincides with his overall demeanor.Actual animation is somewhere around average. There isn’t a whole lot of action within the anime itself and therefore little movement. Lots of dialogue and sitting around is had instead, with the characters really only being animated when going through those all-important kisses.CHARACTERSDue to the “firing and forgetting” method used on the characters, many of the witches only have minor background details given about them. There is very little in the way of development because the show just does not give them any time whatsoever. This is evident in characters like Meiko and Noa who, after their specific episode, have nothing else about them provided. Other characters, like Miyabi and Ushio, undergo the same treatment of initial divulgence on their persons followed by a stagnation of their character. Nene at least garners a bit more attention in the form of (ironic) unrequited love, but it is nothing worthwhile.Two arguments arise as to why nearly the whole cast is little more than their personality traits: the comedic nature of the anime and the size of the cast. Since the show is more about inducing laughter than enacting drama, it becomes understandable that the characters are not entirely complex. Instead, by being only known for their individual shticks, the comedy is easier to handle and therefore present. As for the large cast size, the bigger it is, the more resources have to be spread evenly between everyone, devaluing each of the characters to a certain extent. That is, it becomes unrealistic to expect every cast member to be entirely fleshed out. This type of logic can be seen in most comedies involving a sizeable amount of characters, meaning them not being the most compelling of people is not too much of a negative.The Seven Witches does put higher emphasis on two characters: Shiraishi and Yamada-kun. Shiraishi, as has been briefly described earlier, is the model student of the school. She is beautiful, gets great grades, and is respectful to those around her. Yet she has extreme difficulty connecting with others because many people are jealous of what she has, and for those that are not they cannot seem to understand the girl who hides behind her books. It is not until Yamada-kun shows up that she begins to open up. What is interesting is how the phrase “opposites attract” both does and does not apply. She is like Yamada-kun because they both find themselves unable to connect with people and she is unlike Yamada-kun because of her passiveness compared to his active behavior. That last fact is a constant factor, with her mostly tagging along for the whole season. To that end, at times she feels nonexistent which in turn stagnates her character, but at the minimum she opens up more so than she ever did before.As for Yamada-kun, he is arguably the strongest character the anime has to offer. Upon entering high school, he wanted to leave behind his old self in favor of a new one, but found that he once more could not find a place to call his own. It is at this point that Yamada-kun stumbles upon and on Shiraishi, with the rest of the season following. The further along it goes, the more situations he finds himself in and subsequently the more relationships he establishes with the people around him. He almost loses them forever, but his newfound determination fostered throughout the series pulls through, with him saving Shiraishi and the other witches with a wish that makes perfect sense; Yamada-kun already has everything he could ever wish for, so him unburdening the girls now and in the future to form their own relationships brings everyone the greatest amount of happiness. At this point, the reason for him having such a power to start with becomes clear: not only did he need friends and relationships the most out of anyone in the school but it was what he wanted more than anything all along. Meaning, he was granted all of the witch powers – which were designed to create these connections – to eventually achieve his wish, and achieve his true wish he did.SOUNDThe opening theme starts and ends nicely, but the middle is rather repetitive. Listening to the piece more closely, the vocalist does nearly all of the work, while the instruments are composed in such a way as to bring about a mysterious yet hopeful vibe befitting the anime well enough. The ending theme mirrors its opening counterpart in that the singer does the heavy lifting; she has wonderful range and really carries the piece despite the boring beat.The remainder of the soundtrack is nothing too notable. There are tracks that follow the feeling of magic through their strange-sounding instruments, hard-guitar riffs for Yamada-kun’s more rough-and-tumble encounters, piano melodies for the happy and sad times, and other tunes that find their place among the mystery that permeates many of the events. It is an OST that is not worth listening to outside of the anime itself, being little more than background noise.Voice acting for the anime is somewhere slightly above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Ryota Osaka as Yamada-kun for his accent and reactionary way of speaking and Saori Hayami as Shiraishi for her “manlier” way of speaking when Yamada-kun took over her body.ENJOYMENTLooking back through the anime, I found the first half or so pretty funny. Shiraishi was very cute, her interactions with Yamada-kun were always adorable, Miyabi and Miyamura were fun with their teasing, the body-switching created hilarious scenarios, and Nene’s embarrassment despite her confidence made for quite the happy times.But when the show moved away from its comedic roots and into the more dramatic elements later on, it started to fall apart. Due to the progression of the story, there were fewer cute moments between the main couple, the side characters were pushed to the sidelines, the powers were used less and less, and due to the shift in tone the anime was not looking to make Nene blush but instead have her cry. To put it differently, when the anime was trying to be funny, it was, and when it was not, it really should have been.The point about not utilizing the witch powers to their full extent, talked about here and in other areas, was also sad to see. When the anime places so much importance on the witches that it includes them in the title itself, and then proceeds to not do anything with them, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. It is even worse when the witches and their personalities added some spice to the mix. Noa’s clinginess, Maria’s assertiveness, and Meiko’s dual personality were all quirks that the anime could have leveraged but failed to do so.Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches has an interesting premise that ultimately does not go anywhere. Its themes are personable and some of its characters are interesting, but the misuse of its cast, the lackluster art, and the lame soundtrack bring the whole package down. While Yamada-kun and Shiraishi live happily ever after, this one still needs a wish of its own.SUMMARYStory: Fine, theme on relationships is executed nicely but “firing and forgetting” is rampantAnimation: Fine, boring art style, fitting reaction faces, nice character designs, about average actual animationCharacters: Good, Nene and the side characters are passable, Shiraishi is okay, with Yamada-kun undoubtedly being a strong characterSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, boring soundtrack, slightly above average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, Shiraishi is adorable, with the show being hilarious earlier rather than laterFinal Score: 5/10 For it is these very relationships that do what those previous three wishes cannot: make us happy for a lifetime.

Special shout-outs are deserved for Ryota Osaka as Yamada-kun for his accent and reactionary way of speaking and Saori Hayami as Shiraishi for her “manlier” way of speaking when Yamada-kun took over her body.ENJOYMENTLooking back through the anime, I found the first half or so pretty funny. Shiraishi was very cute, her interactions with Yamada-kun were always adorable, Miyabi and Miyamura were fun with their teasing, the body-switching created hilarious scenarios, and Nene’s embarrassment despite her confidence made for quite the happy times.But when the show moved away from its comedic roots and into the more dramatic elements later on, it started to fall apart. Due to the progression of the story, there were fewer cute moments between the main couple, the side characters were pushed to the sidelines, the powers were used less and less, and due to the shift in tone the anime was not looking to make Nene blush but instead have her cry. To put it differently, when the anime was trying to be funny, it was, and when it was not, it really should have been.The point about not utilizing the witch powers to their full extent, talked about here and in other areas, was also sad to see. When the anime places so much importance on the witches that it includes them in the title itself, and then proceeds to not do anything with them, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. It is even worse when the witches and their personalities added some spice to the mix. Noa’s clinginess, Maria’s assertiveness, and Meiko’s dual personality were all quirks that the anime could have leveraged but failed to do so.Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches has an interesting premise that ultimately does not go anywhere. Its themes are personable and some of its characters are interesting, but the misuse of its cast, the lackluster art, and the lame soundtrack bring the whole package down. While Yamada-kun and Shiraishi live happily ever after, this one still needs a wish of its own.SUMMARYStory: Fine, theme on relationships is executed nicely but “firing and forgetting” is rampantAnimation: Fine, boring art style, fitting reaction faces, nice character designs, about average actual animationCharacters: Good, Nene and the side characters are passable, Shiraishi is okay, with Yamada-kun undoubtedly being a strong characterSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, boring soundtrack, slightly above average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, Shiraishi is adorable, with the show being hilarious earlier rather than laterFinal Score: 5/10', ""SPOILER FREE REVIEWYou fap to Yuri shamelessly? You have diabetes because you overdose on Vanilla? You secretly worship Yaoi? You openly admit that you love all three? This anime basically is one-size-fits-all for everyone of all sexual orientations and preferences.Yamada-kun and the Seven Bitches (you read that right), or Y7 for short, is a surprisingly good anime with an actual, plot-line, legit romance and some interesting characters. The premise isn’t unique, ground-breaking or interesting at first glance, but it’s all in the execution. Yep people, shits actually get done in here, shits that are relevant to the story. It’s a rom-com with an actual plot...and story progression, what else could one wish for? Another thing I liked is that the anime stays true to its light-hearted theme and doesn’t try to creep into the realm of philosophy. Because it makes no sense for high school idiots to keep spewing out Aristotle crap about life and the universe unless they were tripping balls.I’m not too sure about the Harem tag being there, I mean a dude going around kissing and getting intimate with a bunch of Bitches isn’t Harem at all. Jokes aside, there aren’t any discernible Harem elements, at most a triangle but it resolved itself anyway.Plot 8/10The plot is essentially about our male lead going around kissing random Bitches and Hoes and Dudes to solve his life problems. One ticket to Y7-land please. The overarching plot isn't revealed half-way into the anime but it’s focused, doesn’t deviate to some stupid, pointless fillers. It gets somewhat darker towards the end as opposed to the usually light and comedic theme, but it has a good transition. The pacing is somewhat rushed but still slow enough for me to comprehend wtf is going on. In general, the execution of the plot was outstanding, you will be gripped till the very end. 11/10 would kiss again - IGNThe comedy aspect is simply fucking hilarious. I had many good laughs from this series, and even as much as rewatching certain scenes. The immaturity, dirty-ness and fan service is integral to the comedy and they were done to a reasonable extent, appropriate according to the situations, not overblown and redundant to the point of borderlining ecchi (looking at you, monogatari series). Let’s be honest that the first thing you’d do after switching body with someone of the opposite sex is touching yourself incessantly.The romance slowly and naturally develops as the story progresses and it actually makes sense, wasn’t too abrupt, full of retarded melodrama, crying or misunderstandings. In the end I genuinely wanted our main couple to be together. NOW KISS.Art: 7.5/10Eye-pleasingly bright and vivid (seriously, their eyes glow brighter than my future). Character art is relatively unique and appealing that I can distinguish one character from another with ease. The quality stays consistent throughout and doesn’t deteriorate like many other series at certain scenes. Overall the art and animation is excellent and worthy of praise.The OP animation killed some of the anticipation by giving away the identity of the Seven Bitches and the main couple pairing.Sound: 8.5/10The OP is fairly upbeat and catchy, I find myself listening to it occasionally but not the ED. There isn’t a wide range of OSTs, they're repeated but really add to the enthusiastic mood and are quite entertaining to hear.Special commendation goes to the voice actors as they’ve done a terrific job of voicing the characters especially when they switch bodies. The exceptional voice acting is a major source of comedy and enjoyability of the series.Characters: 6/10The cast is quite large for a 12-episode anime to handle, as such the characters’ background stories are barely explored, just enough to explain their motives and personalities. In the end, a lot of them didn’t receive development and was left out as it all boils down to our main couple, Yamada and Shiraishi.- Yamada: Introduced as an aggressive delinquent and is actually an aggressive delinquent, not suddenly turned into some generic nice, caring main lead over time. He’s a meanie that I can relate to, I mean he’s tired of school n shit, so true for me right now. On another note, he’s fucking hilarious.- SHIRAISHI BEST BITCH. Kuudere is the best dere and on top of that, she’s a busty, nice and caring blonde, who wouldn’t want a piece of that? She received the most development and obviously I was drawn into her. Speculatively she has a dark side as evident in her malicious glare on the stairs during ep 1 and the pics her picture book. This makes her somewhat more interesting, too bad it was never elaborated upon. Her apathy to things going on around her is fucking hilarious. Also, her gentle smile at the end of the OP animation totally got me.- ODAGIRI SECOND BEST BITCH because she received considerable development and has more depth than the other Bitches. If there’s a best there’s gotta be a second best and no one else is more deserving of this than her I guess. They see her triangle-in' they hatin'.Other Bitches and Hoes include:- Bitch who talks so much without even talking, why are women so noisy?- Bitch who can see your miserable future- Bitch who can see your fetishes because she can touch your heart (lol wut)- Bitch who can turn invisible because fuck you and your peeping- Bitch that I don't remember for some reasonThey don't stand out much from one another due to the lack of screentime because they were in the kitchen. They look gorgeous but sadly they have nothing else to offer but their voluptuous, inviting bodies. Heck there's even a Commando Bitch.Apparently there are more dudes and Hoes, they were even of some importance but for sure I forgot about them as quickly as I forgot about high school notes after graduation. I can understand Miyamura being in the OP animation but that green-haired-dude-who-doesn’t-swing-that-way-but I-forgot-his-name guy? Wtf was he doing there?Verdict: 8/10Y7 was so much better in many aspects than what I expected it to be, sadly it’s a little bit underrated among the anime community.Our couple didn’t kiss for real at the end do you know how much that destroyed my heart? What the fuck that’s dumb as hell, writers stop being incompetent. Whoever made it that way must’ve been a bunch of feminists opposing kissing because it’s oppression against women.TL/DR+ Shiraishi+ Everything is fucking hilarious+ Plot and theme stay consistent throughout+ Excellent animation, voice acting+ Interesting cast of characters, good interactions+ Shiraishi- Sporadic character focus. Little to no background and development- Little revealed about the school and how the Bitches came to be.- No s2 yet. I mean this is a good story, there’s gotta be s2 right? Right? RIGHT? RIIIIIGHT? *drowns in delusion*- Shiraishi isn’t real, just like your social life and good grades- The amount of misogyny in this reviewBy all means, watch this anime if you want to relieve stress from your pitifully abysmal amount of high school work (compared to my college work), arouse your weird fetishes, waifu (husbando) fishing or simply kill time because you aren't in college. and story progression, what else could one wish for?

From a cursory search, it seems they were also a 2nd on Arlsan Senki, also new this season. With that in mind, I have to say that this is a solid first outing for a new studio. The characters and backgrounds retain a consistent quality throughout, and while nothing was groundbreaking, it was very easy to watch. I never noticed any major dips in quality, and it moves fluidly.Sound and Voice Acting: 9The opening and ending themes are...rather catchy, upbeat J Pop tunes. Listenable, and set the tone for a lighthearted romantic comedy such as this.Saori Hayami (Hatoko, Inou Battle)  and Ryota Osaka head up the cast as Urara Shiraishi and Yamada-kun, and do a good job selling the quiet, cute girl, and the delinquent ruffian, respectively.The supporting cast usurps the spotlight some, though, with Eri Kitamura (Takagi, HOTD) as Nene Odagiri, Maaya Uchida (Rikka, Chuunibyou) as Itou Miyabi, and even All Hail Lelouch, Jun Fukuyama as the class president, Yamazaki. Overall a very good group of varied voices that give some personality to what may have otherwise been a real cookie cutter cast filling in blanks for a generic romcom harem show, which this is not.Characters and Story: 8, 6Yamada-kun has a decently small cast for a show that promises at least 8 characters in the title. We\'re introduced to Yamada and his friend Miyamura, the student council VP (who start up the Supernatural Studies Club again) first. The group grows from there to include the hyperactive geeky girl Ito and the quiet beauty Shiraishi. After Yamada finds out that with a kiss, he and Shiraishi are able to change bodies Freaky Friday style, he learns that there are other girls causing trouble at school with odd ""powers"", such as a charming power, telepathy, the power to give nightmares, and others.To further the issue, in order for Miyamura to get the nod from the current student council president to be the president\'s successor, he and Yamada, along with the Supernatural Studies Club are tasked with uncovering the identities of the seven ""Witches"" of Suzaku high school. However, Nene Odagiri, another candidate for the position, is also out to figure out the identity of these witches before Miyamura does.At first, I thought that this really was just going to be the anime version of Freaky Friday, with Yamada and Shiraishi swapping bodies and causing all kinds of trouble for themselves that way, but to my pleasant surprise, Yamada-kun really switched it up and kept the show fresh. With the addition of the other witches and their powers, along with how they affected Yamada and his friends\' personal lives, it really sewed the show up together nicely.The nearly constant addition of new characters wasn\'t burdensome to try and keep track of- and it gave the show a somewhat episodic feel, while still furthering the main plot. Some of the supporting characters were as interesting to watch interact with and scheme against Yamada as watching the antics of Yamada himself. I personally enjoyed that the antagonistic characters stayed true to form, even when they reached the ends of their respective episodic arcs. The characters, while not necessarily unique, were definitely entertaining. My personal favorite was probably Nene Odagiri or Tempura boy who cooks when he gets depressed. ""ANYTHING BUT THE TEMPURA!""There are some of the typical tropes in Yamada-kun, like the unrequited love, and the misunderstood confessions/wrong place wrong time mishaps, but it takes these and runs with them, rather than trying to spoonfeed the viewer a trite romance show. The powers that the witches have provide a lot of fun situations, and the powers themselves were interesting in how they affected the plot and how the characters went about solving the problems they presented, and by proxy- the problems of the witch herself. The show is a nice little slice of life with a decent romance plot, and some magic thrown in for fun.Enjoyment: 8Yamada-kun was definitely the surprise of this season. I started watching it the week before the final episode aired, and I found that I was more anxious to watch the next episodes when they were all right in front of me way more than if I had to wait a week! I really enjoyed the fact that the harem and ecchi factors were at an absolute minimum. I never felt like I was being beat over the head with anyone\'s body, and when the mild nudity did arise- it was played off as a gag, and not made into a point of the show.The romance itself was also pretty believable, and heartfelt. I wasn\'t being told repeatedly that Yamada and the girl were in love, but rather shown. Show, not tell- and it worked here. Despite that I almost never enjoy romance shows, I found myself fairly invested in the show, especially at/after episode 10.Overall: 8I have to say that I liked Yamada-kun a lot more than I thought I would when I read the premise. I\'m no romance fan, and I couldn\'t care less about whatever the hot new ecchi harem is, but I had several recommendations for the show from other users here, and I have to admit, they were right about Yamada-kun.

Definitely one of the best anime this season.', ""I'm glad I watched it, and, despite the fact that I absolutely loved it, this is one of the few times I'll say I'm glad there wont be a second season. The reason for this is because it's perfect as it is and I could only see more as detracting from the whole. If you're looking for a lighthearted rom/com I strongly recommend watching this, in fact, if you haven't seen it already stop reading and go watch it, like right now...Story 9/10: The main story line behind this anime is good but it's a harem rom-com and there's only so much you can expect...at the same time . While there are plenty of surprises it's not going to throw you through a loop anytime soon; however, the unique ideas and their presentation throughout the story wont leave you feeling like you just waited an episode to watch what you already knew was going to happen. Part of the reason I scored story so high was also because of the dialogue/situations which are so memorable and entertaining, in addition to very well done. To sum it up it's an interesting and funny story that sticks to being light-hearted in nature while throwing in just the right amount of drama to pull you in and keep you invested/wanting to know will happen next. Also, on a side note, while there is a harem tag for this anime the story goes very easy on this point and doesn't let it interfere with the story so don't be put off by it.Art 8/10: The art was well done both with the character designs and background and the animation was fluid. While there is nothing lacking on this front it's not amazing; however, it fits the mood of the anime to a point. While it may not be as detailed or crisp as some other anime I believe anything different would have only hurt the overall feeling this anime gives to its viewers.Sound 10/10: Shout-out to the absolutely amazing voice-actors/actresses in this anime they did a superb job. Due to the nature of the story the voices of the characters often have to represent the personalities of others and the talent and skill that went into portraying and nailing this perfectly didn't entirely hit me until later. The OP was amazing, I listened to it every episode (which is kind of rare, normally I skip them) The ED was good and it felt like it summed up the feelings of the anime, but I can't summon the same enthusiasm for it as I did the OP. As for the OST, I didn't really notice it... which is a good thing :D It wasn't spectacular but it fit the anime well enough that it was able to enhance/match the mood without distracting you from what was going on.Characters 8/10: I can't really decide if this was lacking or not so I'll have to settle for the fact that character development seemed a bit rushed. Aside from the MC, and in some ways the club members, the other notable characters don't get too much time, especially the other witches, while they do have enough back-story and depth to give you a feel for or understand them I kind of felt like if I'd blinked at the wrong time I would have missed something important. All the same though they were at least able to be developed to an extent, allowing distinct personalities/emotions to come through with a basis for where they came from.Enjoyment 10/10: The worst part about light-hearted rom-coms and especially harems is that they tend to use cliche scenarios without any care for uniqueness, It's like the directors expect you to have the same reaction to a situation every time you see it, and its because of this that I enjoyed this anime so much. The dialogue/scenarios are what set this apart from the midden heap that is slowly becoming the harem and/or rom-com genre. This anime will make you laugh, but most importantly it will leave you feeling complete, like I said in the beginning anything more would just detract from this anime. The story starts with a bang, sweeping you off your feet, and when it comes to a conclusion it sets you down so softly at the finish line all you can do is look back and smile.Overall 9/10: Worth every second and I hope the rest of you enjoyed it as much as I did, and if you haven't seen it yet I hope my review might make you consider watching it, Thanks for reading! at the same time .

Why? Well, it could be the fanservice. The fanservice they had was actually not as intrusive nor as obnoxious as some of the other anime to have come out recently. They had just enough that it was funny and flowed well with the story, but not enough that it destroyed the story itself. But then again, maybe it was the story that got me to love this anime.Ryuu Yamada is a punk. He shows up at school late, sleeps in class, and doesn't do his homework....He finds his opposite in Urara Shiraishi, a beautiful girl whose the top student in school and always seen studying. One day when they're both walking up a flight of stairs, Yamada trips and they fall down. When he wakes up, Yamada discovers that he and Shiraishi have switched bodies. I find this basic premise to be incredibly interesting. It's hard to find original themes and ideas in the entertainment industry. However, while I'm sure this idea has been done before, I'll confess that it is the first time I've ever seen a story where a guy and girl swap bodies - and it's definitely the first time I've heard of two people swapping bodies from a kiss.Aside form having an intriguing premise, I absolutely love the characters in this story. Each of them feel like fully-fleshed out people, the kind you'd see walking down the street. They seem to have their own story to tell, and unlike most anime of this genre, they're not just caricatures of specific archetypes. Ryuu Yamada is a perfect example of this. He looks and acts like a punk, but as the story progresses, you see that he's actually a compassionate and caring person. He always puts others before himself, and does his best to help people even at great personal risk. He also makes a surprisingly good tsukkomi. Of course, my favorite character in all this would definitely have to be Urara Shiraishi. Aside from being downright gorgeously designed, I really enjoy her character. At first glance, she appears to be a kuudere type of girl; quiet, unobtrusive and studious. As the anime progresses you begin to learn more about her, and Shiraishi begins to change. While her original of being quiet remains mostly intact, her development as a person is more than obvious and truly a joy to watch happen.Like all anime of the harem/romance/comedy variety, this one has its fanservice. Unlike most anime to have come out in recent years, however, the fanservice in Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches doesn't make me cringe. It's very light, giving you enough to laugh at and enjoy, but not so much that you feel like you're watching a hentai. It's funny and flows well with the story, but isn't overbearing. In other words, they have just the right amount of fanservice. A part of me wonders if the reason for this is because the writer/illustrator of the manga is actually a woman.All this being said, if I had to name one reason why I like this anime over others, it would be the kissing. I feel like this anime is trying to make up for the lack of kisses in every other romance anime out there. I've watched a lot of anime with romance and only a few seem to actually have kissing in them. I don't know why this is, but Yamada-kun makes up for it by having several kisses pretty much every episode. I'll admit, the inner romantic in me squealed every time I saw Yamada and Shiraishi kiss. What's more, the ending left me completely fulfilled. This was one of the few romcom anime where I actually watched it all the way through to the end and felt utterly satisfied.

Why? Because it was one-cour. The story arc that could be concluded with the manga as it is now is either over 80 chapters in or an original ending, and with the sweet spot of manga to anime adaptation being 2-3 chapters an episode, 80 could be a little too much in 24 episodes, even if filler is cut. Well, for better and for worse, Yamada-kun met and exceeded my expectations.But let’s talk about the good stuff first.Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches (which I...will abbreviate as 7 Witches) follows the titular Ryu Yamada, a second year delinquent who is all alone in a rather prestigious school. When walking up the stairs threateningly near the class genius and beauty, the diminutive Urara Shiraishi, he accidentally falls down the stairs on top of her. To their extreme surprise, they switched bodies. After walking in each other shoes, Yamada realizes Shiraishi is being bullied and, against her will, helps put an end to it. They then discover they can switch back by kissing. Subsequently, Yamada and Shiraishi get embroiled within the contest for Student Council President, create the Supernatural Studies Club, and search for the 7 Witches, who have powers similar to body-swapping.Premise aside, 7 Witches’ key strengths are its art and extremely ball-busting humor, drawing from ecchi, physical, character-driven, and wordplay based humor. The anime always succeeds here. Linden does a tremendous job in animating here, making the environments of Suzaku High School seem especially grand and high-class. Many girls have extremely strange hair colors (green, blue, pink, whatever), and while they appear strange in the manga, Linden does a pretty good job at making them seem less jarring in the anime. Facial expressions are rendered extremely carefully, elevating the humor, which is usually done right. Aside from kissing, there is some playful fanservice here, and while it does get grating, the anime, in adapting, skips out on some of the fanservice as well, which is actually a plus, especially for those who are averse to such elements.The true star of this entire anime is by far the voice work. I have to give amazing credit to the characters who generally swap bodies: Ryota Ohsaka (Yamada), Saori Hayami (Shiraishi), Toshiki Masuda (Toranosuke Miyamura) and Maaya Uchida (Miyabi Ito). When the characters swap bodies, each voice actor immediately switches their delivery to match the personality currently inhabiting their character. Hayami, who typically does quitter or gentler female roles, becomes bombastic and crude when Yamada is in Shiraishi’s body. Similarly, whenever Shiraishi inhabits Yamada, Ohsaka delivers in a very terse and gentle tone. Masuda and Uchida also do a splendid job when body swapping is going on, but Ohsaka and Hayami are, without question, amazing.The rest of the voice cast does an amazing job, because 7 Witches’ voice cast is stacked. To single out some of the biggest names here, Eri Kitamura voices Nene Odagiri, Aoi Yuki voices Noa Takigawa, Kana Hanazawa voices Mikoto Asuka, Daisuke Ono voices Ushio Igarashi, Miyuki Sawashiro voices Leona Miyamura, and Jun Fukuyama voices Student Council President Haruma Yamazaki.This is where the praise stops, because Linden decided to make this one-cour instead of two.The original 7 Witches manga had some filler that could have been taken out without too much trouble. A subplot with the girls’ archery club president, Karen Kimishima, was cut out, and ultimately, that does not matter. Some arcs could be cut a little shorter without too much trouble, such as the arc focusing around Maria Sarushima or the arc surrounding Noa. But 7 Witches wasn’t filled with so much fluff to be able to cut much more than this, so the amount of corner-cutting when it comes to plot make certain developments jarring and eliminates the impact of some of the arcs.(Some subtle foreshadowing sprinkled within the early chapters that reference the ongoing arc in the manga are cut entirely, so if that’s ever adapted, it will seem less clever and more out of left field.)The final arc of the anime was a rushed and hollow shadow of what was in the manga, which is a severe disappointment. Due to this corner cutting, all characters other than Yamada (and to a much lesser extent, Shiraishi) that had character development don’t have any. Admittedly, some characters don’t have much character development still don’t, like Ito, Kentaro Tsubaki, and a couple of the witches. However, other characters lose both their motivations and screentime, making them hollow shells of people and not actual characters. The best way to describe this is in quick list form.-Shiraishi loses her dry, cutting humor, making her more generic.-Toranosuke Miyamura’s motivation in the manga doesn’t exist in the anime.-Leona Miyamura’s motivation is heavily watered down.-Odagiri’s, Ushio’s, Noa’s, and Yamazaki’s cut scenes make them more one-dimensional in the anime.Yamada is pretty much the only major character to come through the adaptation unscathed, but with the other characters being rather weak, it prevents the anime from being a good adaptation.Many adaptations come in too soon and have to rush or make an original ending. This was not that. Linden’s rushed 12 episode adaptation of Yamada made it lose most of its plot and character based strengths. More than a faithful retelling, it often feels like a highlights reel of the plot. The presentation is beyond stellar, but when the plot and characters are diluted to such an extent, it’s hard to be happy with this anime.Story - 5 (premise is OK to begin with, anime cuts down on many strengths)Art - 8 (beautiful animation)Sound - 9 (music is forgettable but the voice acting is amazing)Character - 5 (all characters except Yamada are hollow)Enjoyment - 4 (as a manga lover, this rushed adaptation hurts)Overall - 6.2 (rounded to 6)Edit 7/6/15: Decided my score was a tad reactionary. will abbreviate as 7 Witches) follows the titular Ryu Yamada, a second year delinquent who is all alone in a rather prestigious school.

The ability to do all sorts of neat tricks beyond the capabilities of humans like fly, read minds, and fire laser beams from your eyes are something that everyone thinks of having at least once in their lives.  But if you really got them, have you ever thought about the kind of impact they could have on your life?  Here, a review of Yamada-kun and the seven witches, a show that features seven individuals with a similar predicament.Story (7.00/10): The story of Yamada-kun (that\'s the shorthanded...way I\'ll be calling this series) follows the life of a delinquent individual by the name of Yamada Ryuu.  Feeling a little bit frustrated with boring life at school, he has a chance meeting with one of the school\'s top students, Shirashi Urara, on a flight of stairs, where he accidentally trips and knocks them both to the base of the steps.  It is discovered a little later on that the two characters have now switched bodies all of a sudden through the method of a kiss (you can probably guess what Yamada did now that he was in a girl\'s body.), sending the two on a journey where they find the seven witches, six other individuals who have the same kind of mystical power.The story of Yamada-kun for the most part bases itself around a witch of the week style of storytelling, where every episode/few episodes are centered around one particular witch, then move onto the next one, until the series\'s ends.  Within each of these stories, Yamada is faced with a different problem, a situation that each witch needs to have resolved before they are able to live happily on account of their powers acting both as a blessing and a curse.  With this, the show provides character development for our main protagonist in particular, as he slowly begins to think otherwise of his ""boring school life"" and begins to appreciate and enjoy what he has built up, thinking about others rather than himself.  (It\'s a nice progression.)Also, because this series revolves around the idea of witch powers that are used/exchanged through the art of kissing people, no matter what kind of fan you are, whether it\'s yaoi, yuri, or vanilla, you\'ll be finding something you\'ll like.  (Service for everyone!!!)But here\'s the biggest issue I have with this series.  This anime features the story of the ""first witches arc"" in the manga, the first major arc of the series that takes up about 90 or so chapters to fill up, 90 very detailed and well written chapters.  As such, the anime takes a couple liberties to try and finish this arc within the small 12 episode timeframe.  This for me is a major flaw.  The reason for this is mostly to blame on the pacing, and how rushed this show is.  Because of its small timeframe, the show gets rid of quite a lot of important details to the storytelling, leaving the show to really just be the bare backbone of the original Yamada-kun story.  The events of the show are shown very quickly, before going into an awkward timeskip in order to go to move the story along.  As a result of this, the characters\' actions don\'t really have a greatly significant effect as they could\'ve, and some points in general are just thrown out the window.But in the end, Yamada-kun is a story that was in the end still enjoyable to watch.  While it missed a lot of important details within its storytelling, you\'ll still get a general gist of what is going on even without those little bits of information.  They\'ll be several cohesion problems as to why this specific action works to the characters\' advantage, or why this character suddenly has a change of heart, but if you don\'t let the nitty gritty parts bother you that much, then all will be good.  Sadly though, this is still a case of ""the manga is better than the anime"" so keep that in mind if you prefer to watch it rather than read.Overview:+ Good story idea+ Character development+ Literally EVERYONE kisses each other (That to me is hilarious)-  Rushed pacing-  A horrendous amount of missing plot detailsCharacters (7.44/10): Similarly, the characters in Yamada-kun have a problem identical to the problem that the story had.  The characters are great, but at the same time, a lot of them just don\'t have the same kind of impact.First we have Yamada-kun himself, the protagonist of this fine little story.  As a ""delinquent"" style character, Yamada is a very brash and loudmouthed character, always speaking in an angry sounding tone and frustrated by when things don\'t go the way he feels they should.  While hard looking on the outside, Yamada\'s actually a bit softie, going out of his way to help the witches with their problems using his own power in the process.  His development for the most part comes from him helping each witch in the series one by one, as he throws himself in the line of fire to help protect and help these girls that are dealing with their own personal issues.And then, we have Shirashi Urara, the main female protagonist of the series.  Shirashi is a very calm girl, someone who is very willing to do what is needed in order to help the situation and is never panicked whenever she is face with a problem.  As such, she serves as an aid to help with whatever problem that Yamada is trying to resolve and helps the series\' progression overall.  As a witch herself, she has a problem similar to the other six in the series, which, with the help of Yamada gets resolved and in the end, helps better her life.The side cast for Yamada is split off into two categories, the witches themselves, and the ""witch hunters"" as I call them, aka all the other characters in the series.  As for the witches, these characters are the centralized part of the story, utilizing most of the runtime in order to tell their problem, and have Yamada attempt to resolve it for them.  What I like about these girls is the fact that all of them have a look of progression with them, meaning that from the start of their story to the end, there is a significant change in most of them (since Asuka\'s a bitch...) and as a result, they all gain development and change towards their character.  As for the witch hunters, they vary in terms of importance.  Because it follows the story of the original manga, several rather important characters show up a lot later in the series on account of arc importance.  The issue with this is the fact that because they are delivered to us so late, they don\'t really get much importance or screentime as much as they should.  As a result a couple of them lack a proper character and the rushed feeling of the series is prominent with them.Overview:+ Good main cast+ Central characters get character development-  Most of the side cast are lackluster in terms of importance and/or developmentArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 8.10/10): The art for Yamada-kun was strictly made by LIDENFILMS.  The art for the series is a very light style, with the color palette of the series going towards a very white/light part of the spectrum.  As a result, the series is very whimsical looking and very bright.  The art for the series is what I would consider to be slightly above standard fare, as the quality for the series never seems to dip, and the overall look of the show is always very good looking with no glaring oddities and problems that I see.  Of course, it\'s not overly extraordinary, as they don\'t consistently have examples of outstanding animation, but it is still a very good look for the series.In addition, the art for the series has a bit of a comedic feel to it, with the series using exaggerated facial expressions for the characters, which brings a bit more life into the series and a nice bit of comedy that I personally feel fits with the show.As for sound, the OP for this series is one I personally find to be both fantastic, and very memorable.  It has a very original sound to it with its very flourishing sounds and bright tone which I personally find to be both enjoyable and something that I would want to listen to over and over again.  As for the ED, I personally don\'t find it to really be anything of any consideration.  It\'s nice, but it\'s a bit too generic for my taste, and it just doesn\'t seem to be all that memorable.  The rest of the soundtrack also falls into this category.Also, I have to give credit to the seiyuus for giving a great performance, since this series is one that requires one to play several roles on account of the characters in the series body switching and having to talk in more ways than one.Overview:+ Good quality art+ Great sounding OP-  Rest of the soundtrack is a bit lacklusterPersonal Enjoyment (7.48/10): While Yamada-kun is a series I feel is a great and well written, this anime adaptation simply just didn\'t pull off the best execution that I had originally expected.  While we did get a good start to the series with its first three episodes, the rest just felt a bit disappointing as it started to rush towards the finish.Did I like this series?Contrary to what I have been saying, Yamada-kun is indeed a series that I still did enjoy.  It was nice to see the series in animated form and I was pleased to see not only the characters, but the scenes that I enjoyed reading.  I thought the seiyuus did a wonderful job in their voice acting on account of having to basically play multiple parts, and I really liked the aesthetics and the opening.  (This opening is probably one of the better ones this season.)What didn\'t I like about this series?It was rushed, plain and simple.  Because the show wanted to finish a huge story arc in the span of 12 episodes, the enjoyment factor dipped significantly.  While yes, I have read the Yamada-kun manga, I was wondering for the majority of the time as to how the characters in the series came up with a conclusion or how they were able to do this.  I knew how, but seeing from the perspective of someone new to the series, I just didn\'t see how it would really make sense to come to this conclusion the characters needing to do something in order to come to this resolution.  There were important details, entire mini story arcs in fact, that were missing from this adaptation, and I really wasn\'t happy with how the show took far too many liberties in order to finish where they wanted it to be.  Kind of wish there was more runtime so that things could be fleshed out a little bit more.Would I recommend this series?All in all, I would still say that Yamada-kun is still a decent adaptation.  While it did miss a lot of things that I would say are essential to the story\'s explanation, the overall adaptation is still the bare backbone of the Yamada-kun story and as such, is still relatively good in the fact that you still get the general idea of the story and should have a rather enjoyable time watching it.Overall Score: 7.50/10 way I\'ll be calling this series) follows the life of a delinquent individual by the name of Yamada Ryuu.

While hard looking on the outside, Yamada\'s actually a bit softie, going out of his way to help the witches with their problems using his own power in the process.  His development for the most part comes from him helping each witch in the series one by one, as he throws himself in the line of fire to help protect and help these girls that are dealing with their own personal issues.And then, we have Shirashi Urara, the main female protagonist of the series.  Shirashi is a very calm girl, someone who is very willing to do what is needed in order to help the situation and is never panicked whenever she is face with a problem.  As such, she serves as an aid to help with whatever problem that Yamada is trying to resolve and helps the series\' progression overall.  As a witch herself, she has a problem similar to the other six in the series, which, with the help of Yamada gets resolved and in the end, helps better her life.The side cast for Yamada is split off into two categories, the witches themselves, and the ""witch hunters"" as I call them, aka all the other characters in the series.  As for the witches, these characters are the centralized part of the story, utilizing most of the runtime in order to tell their problem, and have Yamada attempt to resolve it for them.  What I like about these girls is the fact that all of them have a look of progression with them, meaning that from the start of their story to the end, there is a significant change in most of them (since Asuka\'s a bitch...) and as a result, they all gain development and change towards their character.  As for the witch hunters, they vary in terms of importance.  Because it follows the story of the original manga, several rather important characters show up a lot later in the series on account of arc importance.  The issue with this is the fact that because they are delivered to us so late, they don\'t really get much importance or screentime as much as they should.  As a result a couple of them lack a proper character and the rushed feeling of the series is prominent with them.Overview:+ Good main cast+ Central characters get character development-  Most of the side cast are lackluster in terms of importance and/or developmentArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 8.10/10): The art for Yamada-kun was strictly made by LIDENFILMS.  The art for the series is a very light style, with the color palette of the series going towards a very white/light part of the spectrum.  As a result, the series is very whimsical looking and very bright.  The art for the series is what I would consider to be slightly above standard fare, as the quality for the series never seems to dip, and the overall look of the show is always very good looking with no glaring oddities and problems that I see.  Of course, it\'s not overly extraordinary, as they don\'t consistently have examples of outstanding animation, but it is still a very good look for the series.In addition, the art for the series has a bit of a comedic feel to it, with the series using exaggerated facial expressions for the characters, which brings a bit more life into the series and a nice bit of comedy that I personally feel fits with the show.As for sound, the OP for this series is one I personally find to be both fantastic, and very memorable.  It has a very original sound to it with its very flourishing sounds and bright tone which I personally find to be both enjoyable and something that I would want to listen to over and over again.  As for the ED, I personally don\'t find it to really be anything of any consideration.  It\'s nice, but it\'s a bit too generic for my taste, and it just doesn\'t seem to be all that memorable.  The rest of the soundtrack also falls into this category.Also, I have to give credit to the seiyuus for giving a great performance, since this series is one that requires one to play several roles on account of the characters in the series body switching and having to talk in more ways than one.Overview:+ Good quality art+ Great sounding OP-  Rest of the soundtrack is a bit lacklusterPersonal Enjoyment (7.48/10): While Yamada-kun is a series I feel is a great and well written, this anime adaptation simply just didn\'t pull off the best execution that I had originally expected.  While we did get a good start to the series with its first three episodes, the rest just felt a bit disappointing as it started to rush towards the finish.Did I like this series?Contrary to what I have been saying, Yamada-kun is indeed a series that I still did enjoy.  It was nice to see the series in animated form and I was pleased to see not only the characters, but the scenes that I enjoyed reading.  I thought the seiyuus did a wonderful job in their voice acting on account of having to basically play multiple parts, and I really liked the aesthetics and the opening.  (This opening is probably one of the better ones this season.)What didn\'t I like about this series?It was rushed, plain and simple.  Because the show wanted to finish a huge story arc in the span of 12 episodes, the enjoyment factor dipped significantly.  While yes, I have read the Yamada-kun manga, I was wondering for the majority of the time as to how the characters in the series came up with a conclusion or how they were able to do this.  I knew how, but seeing from the perspective of someone new to the series, I just didn\'t see how it would really make sense to come to this conclusion the characters needing to do something in order to come to this resolution.  There were important details, entire mini story arcs in fact, that were missing from this adaptation, and I really wasn\'t happy with how the show took far too many liberties in order to finish where they wanted it to be.  Kind of wish there was more runtime so that things could be fleshed out a little bit more.Would I recommend this series?All in all, I would still say that Yamada-kun is still a decent adaptation.  While it did miss a lot of things that I would say are essential to the story\'s explanation, the overall adaptation is still the bare backbone of the Yamada-kun story and as such, is still relatively good in the fact that you still get the general idea of the story and should have a rather enjoyable time watching it.Overall Score: 7.50/10', ""Yamada-kun to 7-nin no majo aka Yamada and the 7 witches. i originally did not even notice this anime and wasn't gonna watch it i thought it was gonna be just meh and boy did i judge a book by its cover it was so under the radar for me that i consider it underrated also the best anime of the season in my personal opinion. If i had one major issue it would be the pacing it was a little fast.Story- I would have liked the anime to be longer but it definitely got to everything it needed in terms of the 7 witches...story.The setting is within the school premises for the most part and the story consists of a guy who is a delinquent who ends up accidentally trips from a flight of stairs on to a girl who is the best student in the school they end up kissing during the fall and then they body swap during the exchange and later on realize that the kiss triggered the body switch so fast forward they revive an old club and the club that is for finding the 7 witches and the wacky funny dramatic journey begins.At first glance it may not seem very exciting and enticing but its interesting and as you get into the story you realize the burdens the witches face because of the powers they possess and you also get just so much weird wacky moments overall the story really stood out compared to everything i have watched this anime season.Art- Colorful real shiny overall its just something really good that honestly it sticks out the drawings may not be wow but mixed with everything the vibrancy if the colors the rainy scenes it was just really good.Sound- not much to say everything fits within the anime it has an awesome opening and intro one of the best in the season imo and also has a decent ending. Character voices match the characters and the ost is fitting to say the most good overall.Characters- In terms of characters you get the 7 witches of course the 2 witch ******* and the student council along with some other characters you get an decent amount of characters that actually contribute to the story and you also get a crap load of character development within the 7 witches for their specific episodes once they are found and also get alot of development through the leading male character the witches powers creates for some funny moments and dramatic moments and pasts that  you might relate to irl or just sympathize with.Enjoyment- 10/10 like i said my personal favorite and best anime ive seen this season in terms of everything including other seasons of anime from b4.Overall- 9/10 was it perfect? no but it was really good. Was it satisfying? Yes it was but i would have liked to seen more but the ending was a perfect fit to end the series.The adaptation from the manga (never read will start reading) to the anime form wasn't good because based on opinions from the manga readers it is completely different but one thing ive noticed amongst the manga readers are that the anime even though it doesn't follow the manga it is still great on its own.

The main character (Yamada) is your average school delinquent who accidentally discovers that he could switch bodies with another person by the act of kissing them by the lips. Or so he thought..He later discovers that there are 7 other people who have ""powers"" within the school, hence the name of the anime. I\'ll stop talking about the plot now, the rest is up to you to see for yourself.I feel that there were some parts where you could see what was going to happen and the ending was very cliche (imo), however...the story made me keep anticipating for the next episode. Overall I would recommend this anime, it has a nicely mixed harem/romance/comedy feel to it, and I enjoyed it a lot myself. the story made me keep anticipating for the next episode. Overall I would recommend this anime, it has a nicely mixed harem/romance/comedy feel to it, and I enjoyed it a lot myself.', ""Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches was definitely one of the better anime of the Spring season. While the concept of supernatural elements in a school setting and body switching hijinks isn't exactly new, it was able to pull them off in an entertaining and charming way nonetheless.Story: 6The story revolves around the seemingly mean-spirited delinquent, Ryuu Yamada, and his complete polar opposite, Urara Shiraishi. The two students take an unexpected tumble down their school's stairs and end up kissing by accident, which causes them to magically switch bodies. When they discover that kissing is what triggers the strange phenomenon, another student discovers their little secret...and convinces them to help him revive the Supernatural Studies Club in order to find other girls with strange powers. While the plot itself isn't the best or original, it was still engaging to see the concept be played well. The pacing was overall okay, and it never felt too slow or dragged out. The ending wrapped up problems satisfyingly enough even though it was predictable. Overall, I have no major complaints with the story even if it had some minor flaws.Art: 7The art and backgrounds were colorful, vibrant, and well-drawn. It was nice and seemed to have a sense of effort put in. I thought the character designs were appealing and charming enough. The animation was decent, and it got the job done without any major flaws or hiccups. I never noticed a dip in quality, and it stayed consistent all throughout. As a newer anime, the art and animation was well done.Sound: 7The music was pretty good. I definitely enjoyed listening to the super catchy and upbeat opening every week. The ending wasn't that bad either. The background music was pretty standard and not particularly noteworthy. It did fit the tone of most of the scenes well enough. All the seiyuu were great. It was especially amusing how they changed their voices whenever a certain character swapped into someone else's body.Character: 6There are a slew of characters and the majority of them were likeable, interesting, and their backstories fleshed out just enough to care about them. Most of the focus is on Yamada and how he helps each witch from whatever complication they are facing, and their eventual involvement with the main group. The romantic relationship between Yamada and Shiraishi was executed fairly well. It didn't feel forced or unnatural, really. Unfortunately, one lacking aspect I did notice was that most of the side characters (mainly the witches) weren't fully developed due to the time constraints by essentially being one-off episodes. I felt we only got to see parts as it doesn't thoroughly delve into them. That said, each character had a purpose that helped push the plot along, so no character felt useless and seeing what power each new witch brought kept things fun. It was enjoyable to see the characters in the many comedic situations due to all the body swapping and other supernatural abilities.Enjoyment: 7I quite enjoyed watching Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches. It was a pleasant watch. The series was mostly lighthearted comedy, but it did sometimes get a tad more serious when it came to the more dramatic scenes revolving around the character conflicts. That helped keep things going without feeling stale. If you go in and watch the series for what it is, you likely won't be disappointed. Yamada-kun exceeded my expectations, and it was rightfully one of the standouts of its season. The comedy was on point, the romance was believable, the cast was solid, and the story wrapped up satsfyingly. It wasn't perfect, but the merits most definitely outweigh the cons.

Everyone seems to instantly respond to every action, thus losing much of the impact and emotion between exchanges. Some of the manga parts seemed to be added in just because it was in the manga, except some of the preludes were completely skipped which made it seemed very forced. Overall, I didn't really like this adaptation as it felt more like a summary of the manga than an actual fully fleshed anime.*Spoilers Ahead*Story: 7This comes from the fact that we seem to be missing a few chunks of the story here and there probably due to...the episode limitations. The whole searching for witches and yamada's reasons felt very superficial where he does things just because the story needs him as the protagonist, rather than him having actual reasons.Art 9:I felt that the art truly reflected the original's, not to mention that I feel it's actually a bit better. Miki (the author/artist) occasionally had some issues with the art, which I didn't notice here.Sound 8:Didn't really like the OP or ED songs. The voice selections suited their characters, though maybe the president could have been someone different, not really sure who, but I felt that his voice didn't really suit the character. For BGM, there wasn't much that caught my attention.Character 6:Like stated earlier, everything just felt rushed. Their characters don't really feel fleshed out and everything they do don't really coincide with their character because we weren't given enough information beforehand (e.g. Miyamura's sister was actually a secret he wanted to keep but just stated it to everyone without much of an issue). I really felt that they should have adapted less of the manga and do each episode more thoroughly.--Example 1: Yamada refuses to rejoin the Supernatural Club because he believes they're better off without him, but this isn't actually explained in the anime.--Example 2; Yamada also runs through a few thoughts before confessing to Shiraishi but this is skipped in the anime for some reason, which makes the confession really random/abrupt.Enjoyment: 7It wasn't as enjoyable as the manga as everything happened way too quick without much time for people to really grasp the mood. It really felt like we were just skipping from scene to scene and being fed the main points of each scene.Overall 7:First anime I've watched where I've read the manga beforehand, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh. But it was definitely less enjoyable watching the anime than it was reading the manga. There was a real lack of romantic atmosphere between Yamada and Urara kissing. Perhaps even the voice acting was a bit rushed.

Mm-hmm, I think I\'ve caught your attention now.Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my review of Yamada and the Seven Witches, also known in Japanese as Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is about Ryuu Yamada, a delinquent in...his second year at Suzaku High School. One day, he accidentally falls down a flight of stairs, crashing into the school\'s top student, Urara Shiraishi, in the process. When Yamada regains consciousness, he discovers that he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. When they switch back, they discover that kissing causes them to switch bodies. It is later discovered that there are seven witches at Suzaku High School, each of them possessing a unique power. Together with the newly-revived Supernatural Studies Club, they set out to discover the identities of these seven witches.Although I\'ve never read the manga before, I\'ve known about it for quite a while because of its popularity. That\'s why when the anime was announced, I jumped at the chance to watch it. I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I\'d hoped I would, but it still turned out to be a great anime in all other aspects.The story is well put-together, and I liked that it focused on powers other than body swapping. Each of the characters were developed quite well, especially the witches. You cannot forget the main characters, though. Yamada was a fun character from beginning to end, and Shiraishi was quite an interesting one. The other members of the Supernatural Studies Club, Miyamura (the student council vice president), Itou (the supernatural-obsessed girl), and Tsubaki (a transfer student who is introduced later), each have their moments of brilliance or hilariousness.The voice acting was done very well, and each voice actor fit their character as well as possible. I didn\'t care for the ending theme, ""Candy Magic"", that much, but I absolutely LOVE the opening, ""Kuchizuke Diamond""! It\'s very catchy and well-sung; it\'s easily one of the best opening themes of the season where it aired. The best part of this anime, though, was the animation. It was so vivid and well-done!Thinking about it, I wonder why I didn\'t enjoy Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches so much, because what is there not to like about it? I\'d recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the manga. Or maybe I should read the manga myself and see if the anime was any different from it? I don\'t know. his second year at Suzaku High School.

Which copys the power of the witch that he had recently kiissed. You get attched to all of the...characters after you hear their story and why they struggled and how they got their powers. In  the end he ends up with one girl when all of the other girls like him which is technically still a harem but it kind of isnt. lol My  favorite charcter was Odigiri the girl with the purple hair. She was too cute. lol This is a story of how a dilinquit boy comes out of being a loner and making friends along the way. It is quite a love story if you like that kind of thing.

She was too cute. lol This is a story of how a dilinquit boy comes out of being a loner and making friends along the way. It is quite a love story if you like that kind of thing. Would recommend.', ""It's pretty impressive to see how the producers condense all that material into just twelve episodes without feeling too rushed or weak ending.Story- 9/10Personally, I think the whole concept of witches and power are pretty interesting. The series is mainly comprised of introduction of the series/main characters, introduction of the seven witches, the conflict, and then the resolution to the conflict. As mentioned above, the producers somehow are able to fit them all into just twelve episodes, with a pretty nicely wrapped-up ending.Art- 9/10The art is superb. The details of the character traits are noticeable and the background is well done as well.Sound- 10/10The opening/ending...is one of the best if not the best this year so far in my opinion.

We've seen this kind of plot before, but I  myself am new to this. I gotta admit kinda liked how they went with it. It was very intriguing to me and it kept me hooked. The balance of comedy and getting to a bit of a serious tone was quite good for me. My problems with it is that I wanted to know more about the world. Where the witch powers comes from, the history of the Supernatural...club and the history of the past members. I think all this could've been solved if there were more episodes.Art- 8/10Bright colors, colorful characters and a pretty atmosphere. It felt lively when it needed, had the nice contrast when the characters are faced with dilemma and the emotions on the characters' faces are well illustrated.Sound- 7/10The OP is really good and really catchy. The ED is really cute too, both in terms of music and sequence. There were some nice background music that stood out but overall nothing memorable. It did, however, fit the series well.Characters- 9/10Shiraishi! The characters are definitely the reason you'd want to keep watching the anime. The MC Yamada is such a funny dude, but when things hit the fan, he doesn't mess around. Shiraishi is my favorite character in the series. She's so cute and adorable, and strong. I love how Yamada and Shirashi's relationship develop. The other members of the Supernatural Club were also very funny and interesting. The other witches were cute and had unique abilities too, and some of them stood out.That said, there are witches that only had one-off episodes. It would've been nice to know more of them, or atleast just see them interact with the main crew more often. There was one witch though (the 6th one) that I hoped they explored a bit more. Also, as mentioned earlier, I wish they told us more about the old Supernatural Club's past, as well as the 7th's mystery and all that. I didn't feel like the show's Antagonist really felt like one because of these reasons. Then again, one of the major reasons for these is that there is too little episodes. I wish there'd be a season 2!Enjoyment- 10/10Definitely one of my favorite I've seen this year! I love the characters, especially Yamada and Shiraishi, and the situations that they get into are all hilarious. I also enjoyed discovering the other witch's powers and was looking forward to seeing how Yamada would deal with them. I definitely wish there'd be a second season.Overall- 8.2/10Personally, I'd ignore all the problems I had with it and just blame it all on lack of episodes and give it a 10/10 but then again I believe that there may still be other things that I may have overlooked because I just enjoyed the anime so much.Overall, Yamada-kun is a very good anime for me. It's plot is nothing very new or unique but it's cast of characters are fun and interesting, and the it is a very enjoyable watch. It has decent animation, and really good OP with a cute ED. Also, Urara Shiraishi is reason enough to watch it. There are plot holes, characters that aren't well developed but it can be associated with the little amount of episodes that it had, though it is your prerogative if you want to make that the reason or not.To those who read this review, thank you very much.This is my first one, and I hope it was at least remotely helpful.If you have yet to see this anime, then I highly recommend it.If you have finished this anime and maybe trying to find an anime similar to this, I recommend D-Frag.Have a good day! :D club and the history of the past members.

It DEFINITELY is NOT a harem even though its tagged as that in the genres.  Second this anime exceeded all my expectations of a cheesy magic or plain gender bending anime.The anime has great:- Characters- Art- Plot- COMEDY- suspense...The characters actually all have different personalities and contribute to the story.  The art is pretty but also average, however,I believe that this aids the watcher in focusing on the story and the characters.  AND theres a strong Plot!(That's rare.) Along with tasteful comedy befitting this anime.  Plus the plot holds multi layers of story that are told in 12 short episodes.If you try this anime I am sure you will enjoy it but give it at least 3 or 4 episodes since it starts out slow introducing characters each episode, similar to most animes with a large character base.Also I have read that the manga is still ongoing and that the ending may be different from what the manga intended and is anime original.  I do not believe that the ending was bad if this is the case since it wraps up nicely and doesn't leave you with the WTF feeling most short animes leave you with.  I only feel the urge to read the manga to see how it is different from the anime and to see more of the characters.  The anime's ending did not leave me with the cliff hanger feeling where I needed to continue into the manga immediately to get the rest of the story.Hope this helps!PS: It's really great anime :D The characters actually all have different personalities and contribute to the story.

This sounds like at least a dozen bad harem anime we've all seen. The fan service going rampant, the characters completely forgettable, and the ending ambiguous at best, leading it up to the fans on who the main character ends up with. That, however, is not at all this show. I understand why it has the harem tag, however, it doesn't fit in that category as much as you'd think. It's a fast paced, action packed romance, filled with mystery, clever...plans, fighting, and of course, romance. And it had me gripping my seat at times, ready to watch how they got out of the next problem. Is it perfect, no, but it might just make it on my top ten, and that says alot.Characters: Let's start with the show's strong suit. Very few of these characters were cookie cutter, I'd argue none were. While no one character struck me as gold, all of them combined, each shining in their own way, made this series truly great.Setting: This is a high school anime. A setting we've all seen a crazy amount of times. But this time, something interesting is all the magic and weirdness comes FROM the school. Despite being one campus, it manages to keep coming up with new, fresh areas, avoiding too many of the same areas unlike some anime.Story: Now, this is normally a weak point of romance anime. Usually it just focuses on the love birds falling in love, being stopped by coincidence and comedic timing, climax of the story and a kiss (if you're lucky). This show laughs at such an idea and gives you kissing. Lots of it. Guy kissing girl. Guy kissing guy. Girl kissing girl. Guy kissing guy, again. And the story itself focuses on romance as a secondary, rather focusing on it's own story of a competition for Student Council President chair, discovering witches, and the budding friendships and relationships of ALL of the characters.I've heard complaints that the story is rushed, and yeah, you could argue that. It's a complex story already and it condenses way more manga than it should into 12 episodes. However, if you can follow along, it's a very good watch.THIS IS A COMPLETE STORY. Don't get me wrong, there is more after in the manga, but this anime actually has an end, with a full climax that wraps up most of the questions brought up in that season. The stuff afterwards is just more. I'm not sure where it will go, but you can bet I'm reading it after I finish writing this.TL;DR The story is top notch for harems, the characters are all fairly interesting, the series is one full story with a satisfying conclusion, and a ship actually sails in the end, with several hinting at having the chance to fly later on.

Shiraishi and Yamada look a lot like them and even their personality is alike.As in many other anime,the characters each had a color assigned to them.I'm surprised Shiraishi doesn't have white hair,most kuuderes have that quirk but this is in fact a good thing,it's overused anyway.Even if this is a harem and of course the girls are pretty,cute and have big plot,the guys don't look half-bad either.Especially Miyamura,I have a thing for silver haired boys.The character's design is what stood out the most,the backgrounds didn't really.Sound(7/10)The opening and ending are cuute and sweet,I like them but I don't think they are memorable or anything.The VAs fit the character's personalities even if none of them stood out for me or were my favorites.Character(8/10)For a harem anime,the characters were surprisingly well made.Though Yamada is incredibly stupid in school and doesn't have to much tact when it comes on how to treat a girl,he is NOT dense.He does realise he loves someone and I am proud of his decisiveness.Miyamura,his sidekick,of course is a pervert to boot but he has the talent to attract ladies more or less even with his lecherous attitude.I suspect something going on with Itou later on...Shiraishi is the quiet girl who gets bullied but because of Yamada's help her life gets better and she's able to enjoy her school life and make friends,thing which applies in the MCs case as well.The other girls were mostly there to advance the story,the only one who actually had a crush on Yamada was Nene while most only admired him because of his help.Even the president(and the 7th witch) who are intended to be the antagonists and to be hated have their reasons for doing what they do and are to be emphatised.Enjoyment(8/10)I have enjoyed this much more than I would have thought and I liked it.Probably my favorite harem series besides the reverse ones.Overall(8/10)Very good indeed for this genre.I recommend it to anyone who wants a good harem,comedy or romance series. is kind of episodic because of the discovering of the six other witches and the schools secret if I may call it so.The story objective was quite simple:find the witches,solve their problems and kiss them.Why that?Three of the characters:Yamada(the yankee MC),Shiraishi(the quiet bookworm and main love interest),Itou(the girl who joins them because of her intrigue with supernatural and want to be popular are curious.Miyamura though(the student council member who found out about their powers and initiated the club) wants to do that because he wants to be pres of their school.It was interesting though that it wasn't just all that because the witches powers come from the wishes emerged from what they lack:Shiraishi body switching because she literally wanted to be in someone else's shoes,Nene charm power because of her tsundere and self-centered attitude and so on.Surprisingly,even if it was simple,the plot wasn't exceedingly predictable.Because towards the end when the last witch was revealed,everything made sense.The president's motive for his obssesion on finding the witches was finally found out and even if our protagonist fails horribly at school he at least had the brains to make the right wish for everyone to be happy and regain what they lost.It's also very,very pleasing that it actually doesn't end abruptly and Yamada actually ends up going out with his loved one.Also bonus points for not overusing fan service.Art(8/10)It feels like Lucy and Natsu and Gray with Juvia made kids when we weren't looking!

Bored with school, and his life, from what the anime makes out, he has a sudden turn of events when he crashes into, Urara Shiraishi, the top student of the entire school. Falling unconscious during their crash incident, Yamada wakes up in the nurse’s office, later realizing he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. After countless tries to return to each other’s original bodies, other classmates, Miyabi Ito and Toranouske Miyamura, catch on to what has happened between Shiraishi and Yamada. Which later...they involve Yamada and Shiraishi in the rebirth of the Supernatural club at their school. Yamada and company realize that he has powers transferable through a kiss.Cliché? Or, a new type of romatic-school-comedy?  You be the judge on that.The club encounters other students with powers similar to Yamada and Shiraishi and then the Supernatural club takes a turn and becomes a club to hunt down the other students with supernatural powers, formally known as, witches. As the school year and their hunt continues, new students and witches make brief appearances to join them in their quest.ART & ANIMATION: The animation was brilliant. So far 2015 for anime’s animation and sounds have been up to their best potential. I truly enjoyed watching it. Everything was well drawn, the scenery was tasteful and the music brought ease and rage into my mood when watching this. All in all, this was good for sore eyes and deaf ears. The ending song leaves you stuck with a catchy tune, that you’ll even find yourself humming in the shower. Something you’ll grow to love and wish there were more anime with a high caliber as this. In terms of animation and sound, of courseCatchy music and sounds, with a nice crisp pen to paper to bring finesse and fluidity to an anime, what more can you ask for? Seriously?CHARACTERS: This is where this anime starts taking its toll on me, while the cast extends much more than your average anime, 7+ main and supporting characters. Their roles were butchered and taken out of the oven way TOO fast. The witches’ spotlight and backstories were bland and tasteless. Their character development lacked detail and consistency. Even Yamada’s development through the story got generic to the point where you’re asking yourself, “why am I still watching this”? I appreciate one thing, and that’s, his lack of being shy and an oblivious mess. But, confidence and assertiveness only takes you so far. While the chemistry between Yamada and Shiraishi was more thank believably natural, I still can’t get myself to enjoy their subliminal love for each other.CONS: There had to be more. Maybe it’s the time restraint this anime had. 12 episodes, they’re starting to become less efficient, either that or these publishers and authors are really looking forward to making a quick buck, so they forcefed this to us thinking we would indulge in such nonsense and laziness. So, yes, if you haven’t caught on, the rushed events between Yamada and each witch was poor and discouraging, the rushed and forced relationship between yamada and the witches seemed like a last minute add on. Their backstories had no consistency. I know a lot of people that read the manga, I am not included in this statistic, but I have been told that the manga is one million times better.  So much was cut out, not just comedy but little bits of development that would make character relationships feel like they had a connection.OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: With everything stated, it seems more of a rant than an actual review, but that’s usually what happens in anime adaptions. Unfortunately, not all 12 episode anime will get the justice they deserve. I enjoyed this to a certain extent. Up to episode 5, until each new witch had their backstories ruined and the character developments and connections shot. I would recommend this anime to those that have nothing else to watch, more for casual days. I would also recommend reading the manga over this, which I will later begin myself. So much potential ruined by unorganized and rushed plans.VERDICT: 6/10CHECK OUT THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR THE SAME REVIEW, BUT IN VIDEO FORM.youtube.com/projektbaka they involve Yamada and Shiraishi in the rebirth of the Supernatural club at their school. Yamada and company realize that he has powers transferable through a kiss.Cliché? Or, a new type of romatic-school-comedy?  You be the judge on that.The club encounters other students with powers similar to Yamada and Shiraishi and then the Supernatural club takes a turn and becomes a club to hunt down the other students with supernatural powers, formally known as, witches. As the school year and their hunt continues, new students and witches make brief appearances to join them in their quest.ART & ANIMATION: The animation was brilliant. So far 2015 for anime’s animation and sounds have been up to their best potential. I truly enjoyed watching it. Everything was well drawn, the scenery was tasteful and the music brought ease and rage into my mood when watching this. All in all, this was good for sore eyes and deaf ears. The ending song leaves you stuck with a catchy tune, that you’ll even find yourself humming in the shower. Something you’ll grow to love and wish there were more anime with a high caliber as this.

Although the art wasn\'t unique the show was really high-res and there were some animated moments that were stunning!  For example, in the last episode there was a sunset that was just gorgeous, and if that counts as a spoiler then I\'m gonna go ape shit crazy on...this place >:( .  Anyway, what I am saying is that though the art wasn\'t unique it deserves some credit for resolution and good animation and for that I give it an 8.2.Sound -   I loved the intro when I first heard it, it is just so awesome!  Other than that I never really felt like the soundtrack did anything special.  It interacted with what was happening in the story well but it felt like it was just, ""almost there"" in a sense.  I wasn\'t supper satisfied with the soundtrack but it was still good so i\'ll give it a 7.3.Character - One this anime did well was the romantic interaction between the main characters.  I often found myself getting hype when there was a romantic scene.  On the other hand, the characters never got a really good back story.  Sure, they did get a back story but it never really satisfied my taste and it left me feeling kinda like it was lacking a little.  The characters were not bad but they never were very likable to me.  I give a 7 for character.4.Story - This is the part of the review where I can say something good about this anime!  The story was a pretty good story, definitely not the best but very good.  The romance was spot on and I enjoyed that aspect of the story very much.  The other side of the story was also very good and I felt I was often drawn in to the main plot.  The story never left me in the dust but on the other hand, I still had to guess what the next plot twist was going to be so for this, I give the story an 8.5.Enjoyment - When I thought about reviewing this anime I just felt frustrated and it is NOT because it\'s a bad anime.  I felt this way because it is hard for me to explain how I feel about it.  It was good but it was not the really good.  It was ""almost there"" and that is how I feel about this anime.  It\'s like you were trying to do 30 jumping jacks but you only managed to do 29; UUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHH!

It was quite a treat and I really enjoyed it, and even recommended it to a couple of friends. But why? Well, just read below to find out.[STORY]Have you ever space out in class, only to find yourself thinking ""I wonder what I would do if I could switch bodies with someone?"" only to go on tangents that aren\'t MAL-appropriate to write? Because Yamajo explores just that idea, and it explores it in a strange way. The story is that the school that Yamada goes...to has a set of 7 witches that have all sorts of strange abilities, such as body-switching, force-falling-in-love, telepathy, freezing time, and precognition. He trips on a stair-case, and body switches with Urara Shiraishi (:3), and realises this when he wakes up in the infirmary. +40 points for the fact that the first thing he does is go to the bathroom and take off his clothes, which is what we all know we would do. The ending is decent and well done, and all the relationships (Ushio-Nene or Urara-Yamada) are really fun to ship. Any minor side stories (e.g. the school trip) were also a good watch for the plainly funny humour it involved.[ART]Something I found to be a pretty good factor in the series was the art. For example, the shade of Ushio/Miyamura\'s and Yamada\'s hair was strikingly better than what I would\'ve normally happened (grey and brown hair respectively) - because we all know that the art of a show can be judged solely by the hair colours of two characters. This isn\'t some sort of Sistine Chapel painting, but it has better animation than a lot of anime out there.[SOUND]The voice acting is pretty well done (especially that of Urara), but the OP theme is one of my favourites in anime as a whole. WEAVER really performed ""Kuchizuke Diamond"" excellently to the point that I bought their CD to be imported from Japan to the UK. The ED song is also quite good, although, in my opinion, not quite as good as the aforementioned OP. BGM is standard.[CHARACTERS]The characters involve :+ Badman McBadGrades - Yamada+ GoodGrades McWaifu - Urara Shiraishi (WITCH)+ Smugfuck Smartypants - Nene Odagiri (WITCH)+ Gaylord McHomo  - It\'s obvious if you watch it+ Nobodycares Weirdfacts - ItouAnd of course the witches themselves, which have very distinct and often well executed personalities + voicing and such that matches the character\'s appearance. Ootsuka best dandere.[ENJOYMENT]I definitely think it was a worthwhile watch and would recommend it to anyone new to anime. It might not be as known or popular as, say, DragonBall Z or One Piece, but it\'s well executed enough that it deserves a high rating and more viewership. I happily viewed the OVA (And super-short ONA) later, because I really liked the world that this was set in, and the environment of Suzuka High.[OVERALL]Definitely something I would recommend. It has lovable characters (besides the ones you\'re not supposed to like), an interesting form of telling the story, decent voice acting and you can see that work was actually put into this to make it good and worth watching.Rated ""U"" for ""Urara is adorable (and we need to make a real-life clone of her)"". to has a set of 7 witches that have all sorts of strange abilities, such as body-switching, force-falling-in-love, telepathy, freezing time, and precognition.

And that was about it. I went in with no expectations for a deep storyline or extremely compelling characters. I simply thought it would be cute and fluffy and I was looking for something light, but I started this with caution. And then, due to my lack of expectation, the show greatly surprised me and thoroughly impressed me.Character: 9I'm starting with character because this was definitely a place where the anime excelled. Yamada starts out as a scary, delinquent who no one, including himself, believes he belongs at the school. But he, along...with all of the witches, make clear strides in character development from start to finish. Yamada learns compassion, the importance of true friendship and empathy as he helps each of the witches along their journey.Shiriashi, who's a bookworm, barely participates and barely does anything besides study in the beginning, truly blossoms before our eyes. And it's mainly thanks to Yamada. It started with him and then it changed her everyday school life forever.And that's how it was for all the witches. He came in and made them happier. He helped change them all for the better and because of the situation they all made friends, real friends.Story: 9The story idea was cute: a delinquent who slowly makes friends and is accepted into this group because he's the one person who can bring them all together. And along the way he helps all of them see how they can survive without their power and empathizes with each of them.Also the student council president having so much power and knowledge of the entire situation was a good touch. It helped keep the story line to a more realistic path rather than being /just/ a cute story.Art: 7Definitely good. I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was just good. I really enjoyed the art in the opening sequence especially.Sound: 8Again, it was good. The opening and closing songs continued the cute feel to the show.Enjoyment: 10The show was very enjoyable. The character development was well thought out around the plot and the character dynamic was, at many times, comedic, but still realistic. The show wasn't entirely over the top at any given point.Overall I give it a 9 and one day I'll probably watch it again. with all of the witches, make clear strides in character development from start to finish.

The aesthetics of the character looks simply amazing. The storyline goes smoothly instead going randomly. Its impossible to drop this anime, it gives you nice sensation of school and heightens the benefits of school only if it happened in reality. The Opening Song was amazing, it had good vibe and it makes you listen to it every time even is sites like YouTube. However, some of the OST didn\'t really match the anime but most did. The Ending song however was...satisfaction. This anime is also filled with comedy that will make euphoric. Overall, I got nothing to say, I adore this anime, and you must watch it no matter what, I don\'t usually write reviews but this is anime might just be what you are looking for!Arigato satisfaction.

No style no creativity, just, cut and paste. Not to mention some of those harems they even ended up liking him for NO reason.The cool part about yamada-kun and the seven...witches is that Yamada (the heroine) isn\'t a dunce, in fact he\'s the one who thinks ""is it possible shes doing it cus she likes me?"" It also has interesting characters, their ""witch powers"" come from their ""deep desires.""

I\'m not really interested in the love story between Yamada and Shiraishi but i\'ve gotta admit that Saionji Rika was my favorite character though the fact the she is just a supporting character o(╥﹏╥)o but the art was quite great and the rest of the characters were well-made.  I must warn you there are lots and lots of kissing scenes which is the obvious for the story which you\'ll find out later...when you watch the anime. Sayonara!! ヾ(〃^∇^)ﾉ when you watch the anime. Sayonara!! ヾ(〃^∇^)ﾉ', ""If you are remotely interested in the premise of this show, and have yet to read the manga, I beg you, READ THE MANGA FIRST. Reading the Manga before or after watching an anime usually doesn't bother me, but trust me on this one. This adaptation has a really big problem, and it will affect how you enjoy Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches.The main problem? Pacing. This anime has a really bad pacing issue, maybe even one of the worst. The story arc that the anime is trying to adapt spans over a total of 90 chapters. Yes, nine-zero. Let me remind you that this...is a 1-cour anime, meaning it only has 12 episodes. And in that 12 episodes they have to cram the development of the 7 witches, numerous side characters, and surprising plot twists. It looks like the studio tried its best to adapt it to its fullest, but accomplishing a feat like that may be borderline impossible.Not to mention, Yamada-kun is a complicated enough story as it is. Cramming it into 12 episodes not only emphasizes its weaknesses, but develops new ones as well, like rushed developments and exposition dialogue. Giving it 2-cour may very well solve its issues, but the fact of the matter is they tried to cram a story as convoluted as Yamada-kun into 12 episodes.But does that mean you should avoid this show like the plague? Hell no! This anime is actually insanely fun when you get into the crux of it. The characters are all lively and hilarious. The interactions with the kisses is pretty cool, and can make you giddy from time to time. Though the music is not particularly outstanding, the OP, 'Kuchizuke Diamond', has to be one of my personal favorite OP's in anime. Every time I hear it I just have to drum my lap and tap my foot to the beat.Also, this show has to be one of the best demonstrations of just how talented Japanese VA's are. The show plays around body-switching, and the results produced when our MC and Lead Girl (both polar opposite personalities) are outstanding. How the VA's capture the personality of the person they switch it shows immense talent and mastery. I have to give special kudos to Hayami Saori as well, a VA that I've been fond of because of her recurring roles as an archetypal kuudere, one of my favorite tropes. This anime showcases that she actually has great vocal range, playing the vulgar MC easily. This is the show that made me put her into one of my all time favorite VA's.If you want the full Yamada-kun experience, please do read the manga instead. The story and character relationships are touched upon better there, and the pacing is a lot better. It's actually pretty good; you will not regret the time used while reading it.But if you have already read the manga and loved it like me, by all means do not let this pass. There is enough here to make you overlook its pacing issues, and by the end you will find this a satisfying adaptation of the manga. is a 1-cour anime, meaning it only has 12 episodes.

(Of course that's for you to judge)I'm not saying not to watch this anime, it's a very fun series to watch, with fun characters. The plot usually gets lost because of filler episodes but if you enjoy those type of slice of life highschool themed animes where the characters will eventually get back to the real plot, then this might be for you.Also,...I kinda recommend reading the manga. There are over 200 chapters in and it's still going. So. Yeah :) I kinda recommend reading the manga. There are over 200 chapters in and it's still going. So.

The series is mainly comprised of introduction of the series/main characters, introduction of the seven witches, the conflict, and then the resolution to the conflict.

Rather then sticking to making an interesting supernatural story and focusing on the main romantic pairing, they waste time having every female character magically fall in love with a fairly average/easily dislikable considering his attitude guy.When the show is on track, it's an interesting tale/study of how receiving supernatural power...could affect people, how people aren't always what they seem on the surface, etc. When it's wasting time having the other witches rub on Yamada and moan about the strange feelings they're having instead of actually developing them as characters, it significantly weighs down the anime.Recommended with reservations.

Harem anime likes to drag its own story to the point that it's super boring to watch. I don't watch anime for its fan-service and see cute girls doing cute things. I watch anime for its story.That's why Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo surprised me. A friend of mine recommended this anime to me and when I look it up, I saw 'harem' as one of its genre. But my friend who is a lot like me when it comes to our standard of anime likes this, so...why shouldn't I give it a try?Story 8/10The story is unusual--nothing like I've ever seen before. Magic powers that only activate through kissing? Wow. In the first episode, I found myself getting attached to this anime immediately. This anime tells its story with funny jokes that is not unnecessary nor it's annoying, that made me forgot that I was actually watching a harem anime.Later, this anime proved to me that it's more than just kissing anime. In fact, it's smart enough to make viewers like me to just think the kissing as something normal in Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo's universe--rather than something that's just there so the MC can have the excuse to kiss girls as many as he likes.Art 8/10I love the bright colors in this anime and other than that, there's nothing 'wow'.Sound 9/10Both the opening and the ending are very catchy. I really love the opening--it shows both protagonists' relationship and such. About the ending, maybe I jut have a soft spot towards the girl protagonist so seeing an ending which shows how she goes from a loner to a girl who has friends is really heart-warming, at least for me.Character 9/10Now, this is what I want to share with you guys. I've stated that I dislike harem anime and because of the MC never knows his *pardon my language* shit. He just blushes and such whenever a girl who likes him flirts with him, saying nice stuff to girls that makes them fall to him. And so on, you know what I mean.In Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo, the MC, Yamada, knows his shit. He wants to help. He wants to clear up the mess in his school, he knows the girl he wants. He also not the perfect boy. He's lazy, he's perverted, he loves to sleep, he doesn't have that many friends, but he has his own pros that make us see him as someone not just an anime character.Shiraishi, the main romance interest in this anime, actually does something too. Usually whenever there's a girl who's quiet, shy, smart, the typical perfect girl, she does nothing. The purpose for her is just so that the MC can help her somehow. But that doesn't apply to Shiraishi. She doesn't sit around sulking. She knows she loves to study and that's what she's going to do no matter the circumstances. Also, she stood up for others to Yamada at some point. This girl has a reason why she's worthy to be kept in this anime.Do you guys realize, that in harem anime, the MC has other guys friend to be his sidekick? This sidekick normally is not as good looking as the MC and the purpose for him is to be the comedic relief, and to make the MC look somehow perfect. Well, in Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo, there is no significant differences between Yamada and the other guys. Yamada doesn't look like Prince Ferdinand from Snow white and the other guys doesn't represent the seven dwarfs. The guys have their own storylines and we actually care about them.Last but not least, the other girls. The girls don't swoon over Yamada for some cliché reason (because Yamada is good, Yamada tells some wise words that is not possible for a high-schooler--trust me, I'm a high school student myself).

Sorry for grammar mistakes."", ""To be honest, i never wanted to watch this anime and i was a bit board of watching anime in general. Just thinking about watching anime at the time made my head hurt a bit. I only watched the first episode and i thought it was quite boring for an Anime with such a rare concept. To me first impressions mean a lot and i just found it to be not as funny or as romantic as i wanted it to be. After countless months of running away from this anime i finally decided to watch it and somehow i really really loved it.Story:...8/10I wanted to say that the story in this anime was perfect because that would have been my initial response but after watching the ending i could see little cracks and that didn't quite hold up this pillar. The good things about the story were that the concept was executed perfectly, the drama was done perfectly and that the surprise rift was a genius idea. I also liked a bunch of other things like how they did some cliche anime scenes like the visit at bathhouse, but they didn't make it seem like the average story you would get from the cliches ( They stuck with originality and still kept it in the boundary of tradition). I also like how the main plot began to develop from the beginning of the anime and that itself added 6 points to the story. The first and ONLY gripe i had with the story was the lack of romance between the Urara and Ryuu. I won't go as far as to say that i didn't enjoy those special moment they had but it was too little for me personally and it ruined the character of Urara. I don't know why but every time i see a dandere main in an anime, i tend to root for them but it never seems as though the writers are even trying to make a connection sometimes. In This anime they lack a lot romance scenes and some reviewers say that they make up for it with the memorable ones but that still doesn't hide the fact that their connection is a bit lacking. They could have easily taken advantage of the switching bodies concept and they did to an extent but not enough so that itself brought down my expectations and it took away two points from the rating.Art: 9/10The art is great, character designs were great, the colors were great, the scenes were great, EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF ART WERE A THRILL TO WATCH AND I THOSE REVIEWERS WHO GAVE IT A SEVEN CAN SUCK IT.

While the anime starts off strong and very entertaining to watch, it starts to taper off towards the middle and then turns into an absolute train wreck at the end.“Fighting is not about your body, it’s about your spirit!” - Yamada RyuuTL;DRStory: 4/10Art: 8/10Sound: 8/10Character: 8/10Enjoyment: 8/10...Overall: 7/10What’s Good?+ Large, varied, interesting cast of main and supporting characters+ Wonderfully hilarious character interactions+ Great emotion and romance+ Lots of kissing and pantsu+ Lots of cute girlsWhat’s Bad?- Very confusing and anti-climactic ending- Many unexplained plot points and unanswered questions- Lack of a meaningful overarching plot- Underwhelming antagonistic charactersWho should watch?= People who love cute girls and non-excessive ecchi= People who don’t want an anime that’s neither too serious nor too frivolous= People who have a limited amount of time= People who want to see yaoi and yuri all in one anime= People who want a good laugh***SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***Story: 4/10Yamada literally stumbles upon a beautiful girl, Shiraishi, at a staircase and accidentally ends up kissing her as he does so. This then causes them to switch bodies which is a result of Shiraishi’s witch power and Yamada’s innate ability to copy witch powers. As the story progresses and their romance blooms, they begin to find out more about other witches that exist in the school, with a total of 7, and embark on quest to find all seven witches in order to grant any wish they so please. The plot is hence subdivided into 7 different arcs based on each witch: Shiraishi Urara arc, Odagiri Nene arc, Ootsuka Meiko arc, Sarushima Maria arc, Takigawa Noa arc, Asuka/Tamaki arc and finally the Saionji Rika arc.I’m not very sure what to make of the overall story to be honest, since there is an absolute lack of any overarching conflict whatsoever and even though there seems to be a purposefulness in the actions of the main cast, they never truly amount to anything and seem slightly frivolous and trivial throughout the anime. Still, the anime did have its very gripping and exciting plot lines, in particular the one surrounding the old school building fire in the Sarushima arc. (+1 for excitement)Most of the arcs follow the same kind of pattern of meeting a girl, a witch who seems like a certain quirk on the outside. Then, through some situation or another, her weakness or vulnerability is revealed which not only helps Yamada better understand her, it also kind of makes the girl fall for him, in a classic harem style piece. Every witch seems to have a power that she wishes for or something that helps to compensate for something that she is lacking in everyday life, mostly revolving around the same few high school teenager problems like not being able to make friends in school, essentially. I can hardly say that any of it is original, even if they were entertaining.One of the key parts that really saved the plot of this anime was the unexpected twist at the end, where Yamada finally puts an end to all of the witches’ powers instead of merely just restoring everyone’s memories. That seemed like a fitting end to wrap things up, especially when things were just going all over the place and there were many plot lines that were introduced but never revisited or tied together at the end. (+1 for plot twist)At this point, I do want to point out that the anime did a very good job foreshadowing this, with an earlier scene where Sarushima asks Yamada to find a way to erase her witch powers so that she can “fall in love”. This parallels Yamada’s final arc quest the get Shiraishi to fall in love with him again, and hints toward the eventual erasure of all the witch powers because though they may seem useful at first, they are actually a hindrance to living out life to the fullest (+1 for deep meaning).In the logic department, I can give the anime a little hope because at least all of the characters stayed true to their character in the anime, and none behaved in a non-realistic manner. Also, most of the witches powers were fairly believable and even interesting to see played out, or at least all except for the last one. (+1 for reasonable characters and believable powers)Unfortunately, the final arc of this anime was so disappointing because it completely through common sense out of the window and introduced such an incredible amount of chaos that it became impossible to make sense of the anime after episode 9. As such, I have listed 8 plot holes in chronological order here, where it should be noted how most of them occur in the last few episodes:In episode 3, Shiraishi states that she doesn’t want to go to college because she wants to study on her own instead and doesn’t need college. But this makes absolutely no sense at all because a large part of college is essentially a self-motivated study and research anyway. Even if this was not the real reason for Shiraishi not wanting to go to college, the fact that none of the other club members call her out on this lame excuse is an outright inconsistency.In episode 5, the last page of Volume 1 of the Seven Wonders of Suzaku High School lists only 2 of the witches’ powers, stating that the others are to be revealed in the next volume. However, there is clearly a lot more space at the bottom of the page to at least write one or two more abilities. There does not seem to be any other reason than scripted unnecessary suspense to only list 2 abilities in the first volume and then continue with the others in the second volume, especially when there is still space left in the first book.In episode 10, Yamazaki states that they took special precautions with Yamada, but this means that Saionji Rika’s power is not to erase the memories of a person she kisses, but to erase everyone else’s memories of the person she kisses. However, we clearly see from Leona’s account of her power that it is definitely the former instead, which then explains my present confusion: Which is it, really? Both? I feel like the anime is just conveniently changing the rules regarding this power to work in the inverse manner, and this just adds a very forced and unnecessary climax to the whole anime. This confusion persists to the end of the anime.Also in episode 10, Yamazaki states clearly that only the student council president should know, but clearly his secretary Asuka Mikoto also knows and was not subject to the erasure since there are scenes where they clearly discuss matters about the seven witches in front of her.In episode 11, for strange reasons unknown to us, Yamada kissing a witch somehow restores her memories. For even stranger reasons, Rika’s memory erasure powers do not work a second time on the same person. The anime realizes these two plot holes are so huge that they don’t even bother trying to explain them whatsoever.In episode 12, Rika states that she felt very lonely in school simply because everyone else except the student council president forgot about her every time she used her powers. But remember that Rika’s powers only work once on everyone, and it’s only a matter of time for her to reconnect with the people she really wants to again. It makes absolutely no sense why Yamazaki is the only person who can relearn about Rika’s existence.Also, Rika states that time has stopped for everyone except Rika and Yamazaki. Again, the anime doesn’t bother explaining why Rika is the exception out of all the witches. Rika then says that this is similar to the General Theory of Relativity, which makes absolutely no sense because Yamada would then have to be under the effect of some really intense gravitational force or be traveling at the speed of light, which is certainly not the case. This is a classic case of an anime trying to sound smart but really isn’t.Finally, there are still a whole lot of other unanswered questions here. What really is the power of the seventh witch? Why are there seven witches in the first place and how did they come about? Where the heck is the rest of the student council and why do we only ever see 3 of them (Yamazaki, Odagiri, Miyamura) in the entire anime? What exactly does the second volume of the book say and where is it now? How did Tamaki and Yamada gain their special powers that allowed them to interact with the witches? Are these powers also transferable? Who did Sarushima want to fall in love with?This whole host of unanswered questions really put the anime to shame, because it was doing so well until the end. Well, it was altogether an interesting plot but one that completely crumbled the moment the anime tried to make it any more serious than it was. It honestly could have been way better if it just stuck to being funny, but the attempt at creating a seriously gripping climax completely backfired.Art: 8/10Animation: 2/3 - I really enjoyed the wonderful animations they used here to make the funny parts even funnier. There were just certain parts where the animation felt a little jumpy at times.Aesthetics: 3/3 - The art was really good, especially the character designs!OP Sequence: 2/2 - Really loved the OP Sequence!ED Sequence: 1/2 -The ED sequence wasn’t as nice, but it was still good.Sound: 8/10OP Theme: 2/2 - Really loved the OP Theme!ED Theme: 2/2 - Absolutely loved the ED Theme!Background Music: 4/4The background music here was really good, and there was not a point where I thought the choice of music was awkwardNo bonus points because there are no additional themes.Character: 8/10Overall, the main cast members were very well developed while there was a lot of room for development for the supporting cast. All of the characters however, were very varied and interesting while still being realistic.Yamada RyuuAs a high school delinquent, we are introduced to a Yamada who is uncaring about everything around him. He doesn’t care about his grades or about school in general and has a degree of crudeness that goes well with his tough guy attitude, intimidating many people around him with his fighting style (+1 for tornado kick). In spite of his apparent apathy towards many things, we slowly learn as the story progresses that Yamada actually cares a lot about food, and about the feelings of the girls around him, showing many times that he genuinely cares for each girl (+1 for multi-faceted nature). Also, his innate ability to copy witches abilities undoubtedly launches him into absolutely hilarious interactions with the witches in the story, and is incredibly entertaining to watch (+1 for interactions).Shiraishi UraraFrom the beginning, Shiraishi is presented as the top student of her school, though not everything is as smooth sailing as it seems. She is being bullied by others who are envious of her results and she’s also a bit of a social outcast because she consistently passes on school trips to spend time alone studying. She is incredibly calm and collected, being the exact antithesis of Yamada, and thus also his best match throughout the anime. It is not surprise then, that their relationship strengthens throughout the story and they bring out the best in each other, even to the point of self-sacrifice (+1 for relationship growth). It is also worth pointing out that Shiraishi also loves cute things, as shown through her cute-themed bedroom and the fact that she can stare at her own panties simply “because they are cute” (+1 for cuteness).Miyamura ToranosukeAlthough he does not have a special power in the story, Toranosuke is one of the most entertaining characters to watch. As the not-so-secret pervert who does hilariously funny perverted things, he is really the character that makes me laugh the most, and it would be an absolute loss to the anime if this character did not exist. From his signature obsession with panties, to his habit of attempting to undress Yamada in Shiraishi’s body, he really should be the one getting slapped by Odagiri instead of Yamada.Itou MiyabiAs another character who is powerless, Itou’s strengths lies in her partnership with Toranosuke to create humour in the anime. She is also the first one to have a touching backstory to her, where it is revealed that she is a social outcast because she spouts nonsense about the supernatural and nobody believes her, even to the point of nearly getting herself killed by a bunch of thugs (+1 for backstory). After being saved by Yamada though, we begin to see Itou as a very amiable and lively person who is always one of the few who injects energy into any situation they are in.Odagiri NeneWhile Odagiri starts off as the scheming rival of Miyamura, she eventually warms up to the rest of the cast after we begin to see a little of her vulnerabilities. She’s quite the tsundere and especially so when she was under the effect of her own charm power due to Yamada’s copying ability. Her role in the anime really goes beyond her own little arc though, as she becomes instrumental to creating a plan and finding a way to defeat Yamazaki in the final arc. Odagiri was even willing to suffer on her own for the benefit of Yamada’s happiness, which I really think was one of the most touching moments of the anime. It is no wonder that Ushio fell for her even without being under the charm spell. Nothing really brings you closer to tears in the anime than this purple-haired beauty (+1 character depth).Igarashi UshioSince Ushio is an old friend of Yamada and fellow tough guy, you’d expect him to at least be as interesting as Yamada is. Well, he is not. He betrayed him once to willingly fall in love with Odagiri Nene for very unclear reasons and in so doing, gave Yamada his bad reputation in the school. Ushio and Yamada kind of become sworn enemies from then on and although this was fixed in the Odagiri arc, nothing much else about Ushio’s character develops. From the start, we could tell that he was fixatedly loyal towards Odagiri, to the point of love, and it was very obvious that he would continue to do so whether or not he was under the charm effect.The rest of the witches, Otsuka Meiko, Sarushima Maria, Takigawa Noa, Asuka Mikoto and Saionji Rika are all relegated to the supporting cast and so we don’t get to see much of their backstories fleshed out. It is a little disappointing that I didn’t get to hear much about Sarushima’s after story however, because she was definitely the most interesting out of the 5 of them, having been the first one to ask to have her own powers removed because she wanted to “fall in love” and also the one with probably the most useful witch power ever (we are only left wondering why she did not use this power to win lotteries).Miyamura LeonaAt this point I really want to mention my favourite character of the entire anime, Leona. Leona is Toranosuke’s really hot sister who doesn’t mind stripping down to her underwear at a moment’s notice and that’s not even the best part of her. The best part is that she is probably the most useful character in the entire anime who essentially has all of the answers than Yamada and crew are searching for throughout the entire anime. She is also extremely clever, can throw scissors with excellent precision and is someone you absolutely do not mess with (+1 for badassery). It is really a shame that she is only a supporting character, because she has such a rich backstory that I think the anime doesn’t do her enough justice. From her brief mention of her previous involvement in the Supernatural Research Club with Yamazaki and her experiences uncovering the identities of the witches, it is certain that there is so much more depth to this character than what the anime has shown us. I would have liked to see a lot more of that Yamazaki - Leona interaction which would have really added to the development of both their characters.Yamazaki HarumaAs the pseudo-antagonist of the story, Yamazaki was admittedly disappointing. He initially seems like a mystical student council president with a mischievous yet sinister air around him and as the story goes, it becomes obvious that he seems to be hatching some evil scheme. While there is a certain backstory to him, we don’t learn this until at the very end when Leona reveals this, and so Yamazaki was always this spectre of uncertainty. Even in the end, when he had a change of heart from Leona’s words, the anime did not really bring out the emotions in him to actually convince us of his turnaround. In the end, it really felt Yamazaki had really poor motives of going against the club members, as simply trying to control the school isn’t really cutting it.The rest of the supporting cast, which includes Tsubaki Kentarou and Tamaki Shinichi are also very interesting characters, but they do not show up long enough in the anime to really make any impact. Tsubaki as a character seems completely random and Tamaki just seems completely underused although he has such a useful ability. It’s really a shame.Enjoyment: 8/10HumourThe anime was probably the most hilarious in the first few episodes where Yamada is still figuring out the extent of his powers. The funniest segment was most likely in episode 2, when the Supernatural Research Club members begin kissing each other regardless of gender and swapping bodies to absolutely hilarious effect with yaoi and yuri moments all rolled into one. All of Miyamura’s perverted antics deserve a mention here. Also, Yamada rearranging his name to become Dayama at the fortune telling booth was simply too much for my stomach to handle. I really enjoyed the comic aspect of this anime! (+3 for comedy)EmotionI especially loved the emotions that played in the Odagiri Nene arc, which lent itself very well to Odagiri’s own charm power. I also loved how we had the chance to see some romance blossoming in a total of three couples in this show: Yamada-Shiraishi, Odagiri-Ushio and Leona-Yamazaki. (+2 for romance)SuspenseThe anime also did an especially good job at building up suspense for the final arc, with progressively more and more interesting witch powers and the entire plot line about trying to find the second volume of the book but always failing. Although the suspense was futile, it was suspense nonetheless. (+1 for mystery)Pacing: 1/3The anime was very engaging from the beginning of the story until somewhere at the halfway point when we got to the supporting cast of witches. From then on, it seemed liked the anime was really progressing way too fast and the final arc was simply a haphazard mess with a rather anti-climactic and unsatisfactory ending. Although the resolution was good, how the anime got there felt like it was just cheating its way out of it.This anime also earns 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes.Overall: 7/10In closing, I thought that this anime had a very interesting premise and honestly could have gone very far if it weren’t for the very horrible final arc which raised too many questions and provided too little answers and left many viewers lost as to what was actually happening and why. Still, I felt that much of the anime remained enjoyable simply because of the many interactions and hilarious scenes that the characters had in each other, and it became immediately apparent that the strength of this anime lay in their diverse and impactful characters rather than the plot itself.Feel free to drop me a PM or leave a profile comment to let me know if you agree/disagree and why, and as always, thank you for reading through this so patiently. Overall: 7/10What’s Good?+ Large, varied, interesting cast of main and supporting characters+ Wonderfully hilarious character interactions+ Great emotion and romance+ Lots of kissing and pantsu+ Lots of cute girlsWhat’s Bad?- Very confusing and anti-climactic ending- Many unexplained plot points and unanswered questions- Lack of a meaningful overarching plot- Underwhelming antagonistic charactersWho should watch?= People who love cute girls and non-excessive ecchi= People who don’t want an anime that’s neither too serious nor too frivolous= People who have a limited amount of time= People who want to see yaoi and yuri all in one anime= People who want a good laugh***SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***Story: 4/10Yamada literally stumbles upon a beautiful girl, Shiraishi, at a staircase and accidentally ends up kissing her as he does so. This then causes them to switch bodies which is a result of Shiraishi’s witch power and Yamada’s innate ability to copy witch powers. As the story progresses and their romance blooms, they begin to find out more about other witches that exist in the school, with a total of 7, and embark on quest to find all seven witches in order to grant any wish they so please. The plot is hence subdivided into 7 different arcs based on each witch: Shiraishi Urara arc, Odagiri Nene arc, Ootsuka Meiko arc, Sarushima Maria arc, Takigawa Noa arc, Asuka/Tamaki arc and finally the Saionji Rika arc.I’m not very sure what to make of the overall story to be honest, since there is an absolute lack of any overarching conflict whatsoever and even though there seems to be a purposefulness in the actions of the main cast, they never truly amount to anything and seem slightly frivolous and trivial throughout the anime. Still, the anime did have its very gripping and exciting plot lines, in particular the one surrounding the old school building fire in the Sarushima arc. (+1 for excitement)Most of the arcs follow the same kind of pattern of meeting a girl, a witch who seems like a certain quirk on the outside. Then, through some situation or another, her weakness or vulnerability is revealed which not only helps Yamada better understand her, it also kind of makes the girl fall for him, in a classic harem style piece. Every witch seems to have a power that she wishes for or something that helps to compensate for something that she is lacking in everyday life, mostly revolving around the same few high school teenager problems like not being able to make friends in school, essentially. I can hardly say that any of it is original, even if they were entertaining.One of the key parts that really saved the plot of this anime was the unexpected twist at the end, where Yamada finally puts an end to all of the witches’ powers instead of merely just restoring everyone’s memories. That seemed like a fitting end to wrap things up, especially when things were just going all over the place and there were many plot lines that were introduced but never revisited or tied together at the end. (+1 for plot twist)At this point, I do want to point out that the anime did a very good job foreshadowing this, with an earlier scene where Sarushima asks Yamada to find a way to erase her witch powers so that she can “fall in love”. This parallels Yamada’s final arc quest the get Shiraishi to fall in love with him again, and hints toward the eventual erasure of all the witch powers because though they may seem useful at first, they are actually a hindrance to living out life to the fullest (+1 for deep meaning).In the logic department, I can give the anime a little hope because at least all of the characters stayed true to their character in the anime, and none behaved in a non-realistic manner. Also, most of the witches powers were fairly believable and even interesting to see played out, or at least all except for the last one. (+1 for reasonable characters and believable powers)Unfortunately, the final arc of this anime was so disappointing because it completely through common sense out of the window and introduced such an incredible amount of chaos that it became impossible to make sense of the anime after episode 9. As such, I have listed 8 plot holes in chronological order here, where it should be noted how most of them occur in the last few episodes:In episode 3, Shiraishi states that she doesn’t want to go to college because she wants to study on her own instead and doesn’t need college. But this makes absolutely no sense at all because a large part of college is essentially a self-motivated study and research anyway. Even if this was not the real reason for Shiraishi not wanting to go to college, the fact that none of the other club members call her out on this lame excuse is an outright inconsistency.In episode 5, the last page of Volume 1 of the Seven Wonders of Suzaku High School lists only 2 of the witches’ powers, stating that the others are to be revealed in the next volume. However, there is clearly a lot more space at the bottom of the page to at least write one or two more abilities. There does not seem to be any other reason than scripted unnecessary suspense to only list 2 abilities in the first volume and then continue with the others in the second volume, especially when there is still space left in the first book.In episode 10, Yamazaki states that they took special precautions with Yamada, but this means that Saionji Rika’s power is not to erase the memories of a person she kisses, but to erase everyone else’s memories of the person she kisses. However, we clearly see from Leona’s account of her power that it is definitely the former instead, which then explains my present confusion: Which is it, really? Both? I feel like the anime is just conveniently changing the rules regarding this power to work in the inverse manner, and this just adds a very forced and unnecessary climax to the whole anime. This confusion persists to the end of the anime.Also in episode 10, Yamazaki states clearly that only the student council president should know, but clearly his secretary Asuka Mikoto also knows and was not subject to the erasure since there are scenes where they clearly discuss matters about the seven witches in front of her.In episode 11, for strange reasons unknown to us, Yamada kissing a witch somehow restores her memories. For even stranger reasons, Rika’s memory erasure powers do not work a second time on the same person. The anime realizes these two plot holes are so huge that they don’t even bother trying to explain them whatsoever.In episode 12, Rika states that she felt very lonely in school simply because everyone else except the student council president forgot about her every time she used her powers. But remember that Rika’s powers only work once on everyone, and it’s only a matter of time for her to reconnect with the people she really wants to again. It makes absolutely no sense why Yamazaki is the only person who can relearn about Rika’s existence.Also, Rika states that time has stopped for everyone except Rika and Yamazaki. Again, the anime doesn’t bother explaining why Rika is the exception out of all the witches. Rika then says that this is similar to the General Theory of Relativity, which makes absolutely no sense because Yamada would then have to be under the effect of some really intense gravitational force or be traveling at the speed of light, which is certainly not the case. This is a classic case of an anime trying to sound smart but really isn’t.Finally, there are still a whole lot of other unanswered questions here. What really is the power of the seventh witch? Why are there seven witches in the first place and how did they come about? Where the heck is the rest of the student council and why do we only ever see 3 of them (Yamazaki, Odagiri, Miyamura) in the entire anime? What exactly does the second volume of the book say and where is it now? How did Tamaki and Yamada gain their special powers that allowed them to interact with the witches? Are these powers also transferable? Who did Sarushima want to fall in love with?This whole host of unanswered questions really put the anime to shame, because it was doing so well until the end. Well, it was altogether an interesting plot but one that completely crumbled the moment the anime tried to make it any more serious than it was. It honestly could have been way better if it just stuck to being funny, but the attempt at creating a seriously gripping climax completely backfired.Art: 8/10Animation: 2/3 - I really enjoyed the wonderful animations they used here to make the funny parts even funnier. There were just certain parts where the animation felt a little jumpy at times.Aesthetics: 3/3 - The art was really good, especially the character designs!OP Sequence: 2/2 - Really loved the OP Sequence!ED Sequence: 1/2 -The ED sequence wasn’t as nice, but it was still good.Sound: 8/10OP Theme: 2/2 - Really loved the OP Theme!ED Theme: 2/2 - Absolutely loved the ED Theme!Background Music: 4/4The background music here was really good, and there was not a point where I thought the choice of music was awkwardNo bonus points because there are no additional themes.Character: 8/10Overall, the main cast members were very well developed while there was a lot of room for development for the supporting cast. All of the characters however, were very varied and interesting while still being realistic.Yamada RyuuAs a high school delinquent, we are introduced to a Yamada who is uncaring about everything around him. He doesn’t care about his grades or about school in general and has a degree of crudeness that goes well with his tough guy attitude, intimidating many people around him with his fighting style (+1 for tornado kick). In spite of his apparent apathy towards many things, we slowly learn as the story progresses that Yamada actually cares a lot about food, and about the feelings of the girls around him, showing many times that he genuinely cares for each girl (+1 for multi-faceted nature). Also, his innate ability to copy witches abilities undoubtedly launches him into absolutely hilarious interactions with the witches in the story, and is incredibly entertaining to watch (+1 for interactions).Shiraishi UraraFrom the beginning, Shiraishi is presented as the top student of her school, though not everything is as smooth sailing as it seems. She is being bullied by others who are envious of her results and she’s also a bit of a social outcast because she consistently passes on school trips to spend time alone studying. She is incredibly calm and collected, being the exact antithesis of Yamada, and thus also his best match throughout the anime. It is not surprise then, that their relationship strengthens throughout the story and they bring out the best in each other, even to the point of self-sacrifice (+1 for relationship growth). It is also worth pointing out that Shiraishi also loves cute things, as shown through her cute-themed bedroom and the fact that she can stare at her own panties simply “because they are cute” (+1 for cuteness).Miyamura ToranosukeAlthough he does not have a special power in the story, Toranosuke is one of the most entertaining characters to watch. As the not-so-secret pervert who does hilariously funny perverted things, he is really the character that makes me laugh the most, and it would be an absolute loss to the anime if this character did not exist. From his signature obsession with panties, to his habit of attempting to undress Yamada in Shiraishi’s body, he really should be the one getting slapped by Odagiri instead of Yamada.Itou MiyabiAs another character who is powerless, Itou’s strengths lies in her partnership with Toranosuke to create humour in the anime. She is also the first one to have a touching backstory to her, where it is revealed that she is a social outcast because she spouts nonsense about the supernatural and nobody believes her, even to the point of nearly getting herself killed by a bunch of thugs (+1 for backstory). After being saved by Yamada though, we begin to see Itou as a very amiable and lively person who is always one of the few who injects energy into any situation they are in.Odagiri NeneWhile Odagiri starts off as the scheming rival of Miyamura, she eventually warms up to the rest of the cast after we begin to see a little of her vulnerabilities. She’s quite the tsundere and especially so when she was under the effect of her own charm power due to Yamada’s copying ability. Her role in the anime really goes beyond her own little arc though, as she becomes instrumental to creating a plan and finding a way to defeat Yamazaki in the final arc. Odagiri was even willing to suffer on her own for the benefit of Yamada’s happiness, which I really think was one of the most touching moments of the anime. It is no wonder that Ushio fell for her even without being under the charm spell. Nothing really brings you closer to tears in the anime than this purple-haired beauty (+1 character depth).Igarashi UshioSince Ushio is an old friend of Yamada and fellow tough guy, you’d expect him to at least be as interesting as Yamada is. Well, he is not. He betrayed him once to willingly fall in love with Odagiri Nene for very unclear reasons and in so doing, gave Yamada his bad reputation in the school. Ushio and Yamada kind of become sworn enemies from then on and although this was fixed in the Odagiri arc, nothing much else about Ushio’s character develops. From the start, we could tell that he was fixatedly loyal towards Odagiri, to the point of love, and it was very obvious that he would continue to do so whether or not he was under the charm effect.The rest of the witches, Otsuka Meiko, Sarushima Maria, Takigawa Noa, Asuka Mikoto and Saionji Rika are all relegated to the supporting cast and so we don’t get to see much of their backstories fleshed out. It is a little disappointing that I didn’t get to hear much about Sarushima’s after story however, because she was definitely the most interesting out of the 5 of them, having been the first one to ask to have her own powers removed because she wanted to “fall in love” and also the one with probably the most useful witch power ever (we are only left wondering why she did not use this power to win lotteries).Miyamura LeonaAt this point I really want to mention my favourite character of the entire anime, Leona. Leona is Toranosuke’s really hot sister who doesn’t mind stripping down to her underwear at a moment’s notice and that’s not even the best part of her. The best part is that she is probably the most useful character in the entire anime who essentially has all of the answers than Yamada and crew are searching for throughout the entire anime. She is also extremely clever, can throw scissors with excellent precision and is someone you absolutely do not mess with (+1 for badassery). It is really a shame that she is only a supporting character, because she has such a rich backstory that I think the anime doesn’t do her enough justice. From her brief mention of her previous involvement in the Supernatural Research Club with Yamazaki and her experiences uncovering the identities of the witches, it is certain that there is so much more depth to this character than what the anime has shown us. I would have liked to see a lot more of that Yamazaki - Leona interaction which would have really added to the development of both their characters.Yamazaki HarumaAs the pseudo-antagonist of the story, Yamazaki was admittedly disappointing. He initially seems like a mystical student council president with a mischievous yet sinister air around him and as the story goes, it becomes obvious that he seems to be hatching some evil scheme. While there is a certain backstory to him, we don’t learn this until at the very end when Leona reveals this, and so Yamazaki was always this spectre of uncertainty. Even in the end, when he had a change of heart from Leona’s words, the anime did not really bring out the emotions in him to actually convince us of his turnaround. In the end, it really felt Yamazaki had really poor motives of going against the club members, as simply trying to control the school isn’t really cutting it.The rest of the supporting cast, which includes Tsubaki Kentarou and Tamaki Shinichi are also very interesting characters, but they do not show up long enough in the anime to really make any impact. Tsubaki as a character seems completely random and Tamaki just seems completely underused although he has such a useful ability. It’s really a shame.Enjoyment: 8/10HumourThe anime was probably the most hilarious in the first few episodes where Yamada is still figuring out the extent of his powers. The funniest segment was most likely in episode 2, when the Supernatural Research Club members begin kissing each other regardless of gender and swapping bodies to absolutely hilarious effect with yaoi and yuri moments all rolled into one.

Readers of the manga will tell you the narrative is extremely rushed, and I agree, characters often drop in and out of importance unritualistically, and there's not enough time to possibly develop them all as the show makes a point of introducing new characters and supernatural every episode to...keep the fun moving. But that's the nice thing about Yamada, it's 12 episodes of charming and entertaining randomness spliced with romance and hints of ecchi that is easy to digest and is gone before you know it, and that's all it needs to do, as you never need to think about it again.It knows how to do its job and well, and though the job of a slice-of-life supernatural harem isn't one with many rewards in terms of deep characters or a plot that doesn't nearly completely rely on coincidences and contrivances, it still executes with contagious energy and a sense of self awareness. If you go into Yamada with the right expectations, you'll get exactly what you came for, and that's great; the show serving well as a breather in between more heavy and complex anime. It's not likely you won't find something to like: the characters have great chemistry even with the ever-growing roster, the animation is pretty and cute, and the opening song is actually quite amazing all things considered, at the very least, it's not something you'll want to skip often, even serving as a tool for emotional attachment in some cases.What's surprising is that the show actually finds its strength in the more dramatic moments as opposed to the zaniness of the everyday-life comedy. Character backstories are thought-out and effective, even if said characters usually drop out of the narrative picture once their one episode of focus is over, which nearly counter-balances what the show does well with the cast. Our two leads however: Yamada and Shiraishi, are surprisingly well developed and enduring, and if you're willing to give just a little emotional investment towards these two and the rest of the cast, the anime will pay you back in an emotionally charged finale that still remembers elation and hijinks are the real cores of this show, and never tries to stray too far from those roots and asks for the viewer to give unrealistic amounts of craps about what is happening. And don't too many craps either, because even if you're invested, don't ever forget what this show really is, because if you lose sight of that amidst the occasional drama, you're going to end up expecting what the anime can't give you: true depth and truly good writing. But despite that, Yamada is still one hell of a good time.Final Verdict: 5.5/10P.S: Yeah, she just wanted to kiss.For this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

(Link on profile)"", 'When it comes to a particular anime, there is always something special you are looking for in the show that makes it stand out, the reason that you are watching this instead of something else. A setting never seen before, a story full of plot-twists, unique characters are just a few examples but I think there is something else people forget. In my opinion in order to have a great show you don’t have to re-invent the wheel, instead you can break down your genre/characters to the core and focus on the good parts while avoiding most of the annoying cliches/stereotypes, thus creating a refreshing...and enjoyable series.Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches (referred to as YAT7W in the future) does exactly that and even more. If you are tired of dull characters, stories that go nowhere, distasteful fanservice, lack of kissing and/or any kind of physical interaction between characters in a romance then look no further. Should my overall score not give it away yet, let me tell you beforehand that I really love this show, but I think just because I like the series probably a bit too much doesn’t make my opininon any less valid and my rating is heavily influenced by my enjoyment. However don’t go into the show with very high expectations as that can ruin the entertainment completely and don’t take everything I say for granted even if this may sound contradictory to my previous sentence. So if you came for the short answer then yes, you should watch YAT7W. If that wasn’t convincing enough then behold the wall of text in which I explain what you can expect from one of my favourite entries of 2015.To start things off, I am not going to talk about the story much, you can read the synopsis yourself, but I think the body-switching plot element deserves a special note. In the slice of life, romance, comedy genres the most important thing is the characters, their personalities, development, goals, interactions. With that said, characters being able to switch bodies adds a whole new layer of possibilities, interactions and perspectives that hasn’t really been explored before and I am honestly surprised that so few shows tried this out, but hey, this makes YAT7W all the more interesting. I would also like to give credit to the voice actors, I think they did a fantastic job at capturing all the different personalities as a result of body-switching which made the immersion even more impressive.However, what made me fell in love instantly with the series were the characters. They really felt like actual people and it was so refreshing and nice to see characters that don’t act like frightened animals at the slighest contact with the opposite gender. On top of that every important character has depth and there is always something more to them than meets the eye even if they felt stereotypical at first glance. The female and male protagonist of the show, Shiraishi and Yamada were by far my favourite characters, they set perfect example of how to write good characters and I’m sure most of us can easily relate to them throughout the series in one way or another. Their relationship outshines every other character interaction and the development of these two is what drives the story forward. But because of this, some of the side characters don’t get as much screen time as they deserve and are quickly cast to the side after their initial episode, but being only a 12 episodes anime the creators had to move with the story if they wanted any kind of conclusion.This brings me to my next point; the pacing. This show is incredibly fast, which I really liked in the beginning since I didn’t have to sit through 10 minutes of internal monologues. There was always something going on and the characters weren’t just fooling around. However this quickly became a problem in the later half of the series where a lot of episodes felt extremely rushed, important details weren’t explained properly and a lot of things happened for the sake of plot convenience which makes me wish that this show had 24 episodes because I honestly think it deserved more than 12. This is also apparent by the length of the episodes (24-25min), which still wasn’t always enough to make certain episodes perfectly understandable, there were just simply too much content (I haven’t read the manga but I can clearly tell) to squeeze it into 12 episodes.As for the animation, it’s nothing to write home about the characters designs are very well done, the backgrounds are nice as well and the movements always felt fluid.The soundtrack on the other hand definetely deserves a lot of praise. The songs during the episodes always set the perfect mood during each scene, few of them especially stood out for me and when started playing I knew things were about to go down. The ending is nice, but the real deal is the opening. Very simple visuals paired with a calm and beautiful song made for a surprisingly addictive intro which also fits the show perfectly. Hats off to the opening, pun intended.Not to say that the series always had pink atmosphere of course. For a mostly comedy focused show there were a lot of serious moments especially towards the end, and I was very happy to see that YAT7W managed to blend humour and drama together very well. Furthermore there were moments in the show when I thought I was watching something like Code Geass or Steins Gate with all the crazy shenanigans going on, even though this show is nowhere near as serious and not as mind-blowingly complicated as those.While a lot of people label this show as a harem, I disagree with this. It’s true that Yamada is surrounded by female characters, but they aren’t that close to him like in other harem shows, and instead of love, I think it’s rather a healthy curiosity on the part of most of the girls, not to mention that Yamada has clearly set his mind on a specific girl, so the show feels a lot more like a romance instead of a harem.Before arriving to the conclusion there are some minor points I would like to touch on: First of all the fanservice in the show is just perfect. There are always at least 2-3 scenes per episode and it’s always noticable but very tame at the same time, it never gets in the way of the storytelling and isn’t distracting at all. The humour is also very clever, granted there are plenty of pervy jokes here and there but come on, when thinking about switching bodies with the opposite gender what comes to your mind first? There are also a lot of funny stuff hidden in the details and if you pay attention you are in for a treat. What you won’t find however is the awkward type of humour which shows like these are famous for and I was personally very grateful for this. What you will see however instead is chubby characters (!), and I think this deserves special mention since they are so rare. This also goes to show that the series is very realistic but still feels like an anime, and in my opinion this is something every show should try to achive no matter the setting. The ending of the show is also well done, the possibility of a second season is still there and I would very much like to see one, however it ended in a way that I’m satisfied even if there will never be a sequel which is not something I can tell about most 12 episode long shows.So as we approach the end of my review I would like to thank you for reading and for your patience, unless you just skipped here of course, then no cookies for you. I think this is as in-depth as a written review can be and I realize it’s probably way too long but I feel any less wouldn’t do the series justice and if I convinced you to watch the show then my job is done. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is a unique take on the slice of life romantic comedy genre in a way that it didn’t revolutionize anything, but simply did almost everything right, while getting rid of the annoying and immersion-breaking traits that other anime can’t seem to let go of. It’s not perfect by any means but I enjoyed the heck out of it, and that’s all that matters in the end. and enjoyable series.Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches (referred to as YAT7W in the future) does exactly that and even more. If you are tired of dull characters, stories that go nowhere, distasteful fanservice, lack of kissing and/or any kind of physical interaction between characters in a romance then look no further. Should my overall score not give it away yet, let me tell you beforehand that I really love this show, but I think just because I like the series probably a bit too much doesn’t make my opininon any less valid and my rating is heavily influenced by my enjoyment. However don’t go into the show with very high expectations as that can ruin the entertainment completely and don’t take everything I say for granted even if this may sound contradictory to my previous sentence. So if you came for the short answer then yes, you should watch YAT7W. If that wasn’t convincing enough then behold the wall of text in which I explain what you can expect from one of my favourite entries of 2015.To start things off, I am not going to talk about the story much, you can read the synopsis yourself, but I think the body-switching plot element deserves a special note. In the slice of life, romance, comedy genres the most important thing is the characters, their personalities, development, goals, interactions. With that said, characters being able to switch bodies adds a whole new layer of possibilities, interactions and perspectives that hasn’t really been explored before and I am honestly surprised that so few shows tried this out, but hey, this makes YAT7W all the more interesting. I would also like to give credit to the voice actors, I think they did a fantastic job at capturing all the different personalities as a result of body-switching which made the immersion even more impressive.However, what made me fell in love instantly with the series were the characters. They really felt like actual people and it was so refreshing and nice to see characters that don’t act like frightened animals at the slighest contact with the opposite gender. On top of that every important character has depth and there is always something more to them than meets the eye even if they felt stereotypical at first glance. The female and male protagonist of the show, Shiraishi and Yamada were by far my favourite characters, they set perfect example of how to write good characters and I’m sure most of us can easily relate to them throughout the series in one way or another. Their relationship outshines every other character interaction and the development of these two is what drives the story forward. But because of this, some of the side characters don’t get as much screen time as they deserve and are quickly cast to the side after their initial episode, but being only a 12 episodes anime the creators had to move with the story if they wanted any kind of conclusion.This brings me to my next point; the pacing. This show is incredibly fast, which I really liked in the beginning since I didn’t have to sit through 10 minutes of internal monologues. There was always something going on and the characters weren’t just fooling around. However this quickly became a problem in the later half of the series where a lot of episodes felt extremely rushed, important details weren’t explained properly and a lot of things happened for the sake of plot convenience which makes me wish that this show had 24 episodes because I honestly think it deserved more than 12. This is also apparent by the length of the episodes (24-25min), which still wasn’t always enough to make certain episodes perfectly understandable, there were just simply too much content (I haven’t read the manga but I can clearly tell) to squeeze it into 12 episodes.As for the animation, it’s nothing to write home about the characters designs are very well done, the backgrounds are nice as well and the movements always felt fluid.The soundtrack on the other hand definetely deserves a lot of praise. The songs during the episodes always set the perfect mood during each scene, few of them especially stood out for me and when started playing I knew things were about to go down. The ending is nice, but the real deal is the opening. Very simple visuals paired with a calm and beautiful song made for a surprisingly addictive intro which also fits the show perfectly. Hats off to the opening, pun intended.Not to say that the series always had pink atmosphere of course. For a mostly comedy focused show there were a lot of serious moments especially towards the end, and I was very happy to see that YAT7W managed to blend humour and drama together very well. Furthermore there were moments in the show when I thought I was watching something like Code Geass or Steins Gate with all the crazy shenanigans going on, even though this show is nowhere near as serious and not as mind-blowingly complicated as those.While a lot of people label this show as a harem, I disagree with this. It’s true that Yamada is surrounded by female characters, but they aren’t that close to him like in other harem shows, and instead of love, I think it’s rather a healthy curiosity on the part of most of the girls, not to mention that Yamada has clearly set his mind on a specific girl, so the show feels a lot more like a romance instead of a harem.Before arriving to the conclusion there are some minor points I would like to touch on: First of all the fanservice in the show is just perfect. There are always at least 2-3 scenes per episode and it’s always noticable but very tame at the same time, it never gets in the way of the storytelling and isn’t distracting at all. The humour is also very clever, granted there are plenty of pervy jokes here and there but come on, when thinking about switching bodies with the opposite gender what comes to your mind first? There are also a lot of funny stuff hidden in the details and if you pay attention you are in for a treat. What you won’t find however is the awkward type of humour which shows like these are famous for and I was personally very grateful for this. What you will see however instead is chubby characters (!), and I think this deserves special mention since they are so rare. This also goes to show that the series is very realistic but still feels like an anime, and in my opinion this is something every show should try to achive no matter the setting. The ending of the show is also well done, the possibility of a second season is still there and I would very much like to see one, however it ended in a way that I’m satisfied even if there will never be a sequel which is not something I can tell about most 12 episode long shows.So as we approach the end of my review I would like to thank you for reading and for your patience, unless you just skipped here of course, then no cookies for you. I think this is as in-depth as a written review can be and I realize it’s probably way too long but I feel any less wouldn’t do the series justice and if I convinced you to watch the show then my job is done. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is a unique take on the slice of life romantic comedy genre in a way that it didn’t revolutionize anything, but simply did almost everything right, while getting rid of the annoying and immersion-breaking traits that other anime can’t seem to let go of. It’s not perfect by any means but I enjoyed the heck out of it, and that’s all that matters in the end.', ""TL;DR versionFelt like it followed the unspoken formula for good modern anime, but with extremely good execution plot-wise.As confusing as it as first, it all comes together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.Gah!

I mostly just rate them on ""good"" or ""decent"" or ""meh"". However, this one is now easily my favorite anime of all time. First off, the MC is a very good break from the classic, goody two-shoes gentlemen who all the women throw themselves at him from day 1. In...fact, he\'s quite the opposite. He\'s a delinquent, who basically everyone stays away from. Good change of pace.As I stated, not all the girls are throwing themselves at him. Sure, it is a harem anime, so a small amount of stuff with most of the girls is to be expected, but not like ""OMG I LUV U LETS HAV SEX XOXO"". It seems like most of the relationships stay pretty basic, as friend or upper class man.The animation is very nice, from bigger scenes to smaller details (for instance a small line of saliva after a kiss). The music is on its own level entirely, I could write many sentences on the opening alone.So I will. (Feel free to skip this part if you don\'t care much about the opening song)The intro is soft from the piano and I think violin? However it gets more fast paced about half way through the intro, but not TOO fast like a rock song, but it can still work in the drums in for a beat very nicely. The voice singing sounds very calming, but not enough to put you to sleep, especially with the beat that isn\'t too slow, and isn\'t too fast. The animation that goes with it is very nice as well, with a slightly lighter tint, and showing basically just the main characters, with witch floppy hats (though the anime is notably missing any floppy witch hats).Back to the main review.The supporting cast is very nice as well, and they all have a main characteristic with them, that kinda defines them. For example, there\'s the pervert, the bookworm, and the liar (or as I prefer to call her, the conspiracy theorist), to try and not give away to much about them. Other than those main ones, the others do have things about them, but that\'s a bit more spoiler like, and I\'m writing this assuming that this is the first you are reading of this anime, so I won\'t go into that.One thing that isn\'t really a complaint, just something to note, is that while the anime is tagged with ""Ecchi"", the anime shouldn\'t really be categorized as such. The most that\'s really shown are a few bra and pantie shots and one spa scene, but that\'s about it. There is a lot of kissing, but, its just kissing.

And at first glance the premise of the show seems like it could have been really interesting. That premise was that Yamada switched bodies with a girl Urara Shiraishi. This, in itself, could have been a very interesting and comedic narrative. Actually, scratch that, it would have been the best romantic comedy ever.Unfortunately the narrative gets bogged down by introducing 6 other ""witches"" and an almighty student council. So it just becomes a paranormal investigation to hunt down and find the other witches.I feel like there was a missed opportunity here. Cramming all of this into 12...episodes was also a hatchet job.

I binged watched this whole season so i skipped the OP many times but after i was done with the whole anime, i found the song on youtube and started listening to it on repeat, and still do :-) the anime starts off immediately with the plot and basically pulls you by the arm into its own world. do NOT be put off by the quality and art style of...Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.

While it is pretty generic in a few character faces, each one feels unique and the story telling gives them each a great personality. Being able to have the bright and wonderful colors to differentiate between some of the characters, without it being over-the-top, really made it easy to keep the “who’s who” straight in my mind. While I did notice a similar face here and there, they are each drawn with a uniqueness to them, that as the story progressed, one could know what was happening. I really enjoyed just looking at this...show. While the characters are all pleasing and cute, the colors were never overly saturated or overly bright, but overall warm. While the fan-service is at a minimum, there is a bath scene or two and a main plot line of kissing, both man on man, woman on man, and woman on woman at times, but i’ll talk more about that in a bit.The music is something that, during the show, really helps to push the plot forward. There are scenes that the emotion is so rich and so important, and I truly feel that the music is what brings those scenes together. What is so important about the music is that it is part of the unexpected as well as the plot is. The music in the opening and closing however, while cute and catchy isn’t something I found myself watching often. I could hum along but I would just be waiting for the kiss at the end. As for other sounds, they felt pretty generic, door slamming, or punches to the face, there wasn’t much of a specific sound, but these things happen so quickly that one might not even notice if not looking out for it.The story, and what a story it is. I have to say there were times when I got so worked up that I had to yell out because something happened and I couldn’t hold my emotions in. This is a story about a delinquent student, Yamada, who after a turn of events falls into a girl who spends most of her time in solitude, Shiraishi, and I mean this literally because he slips and falls down some stairs and ends up kissing her. He wakes up in the nurses room, only to find out that he has switched bodies with Shiraishi! After figuring out what a little bit of what was going on, they are able to get switched back, but now Yamada has been thrust into a world he didn’t even know existed.To me, this show brings about a special kind of emotion, mostly one of anger at times and one of happiness at other times. I was a little confused about how the plot went from 0-60 in the first three minutes, but it took 5 episodes to explain what exactly was going on and that made things a little confusing. Because of this I felt like it kind of pushed certain characters more than others, which kind of disappointing me because there was characters that I really wanted to see more of. Another amazing thing that I found from this show was the actual conclusion that it had. Rather than leave the story open to possibly a squeal or something like that, there was a real ending and it gave me an amazing sense of closure, not many shows do this. While it made me want to scream at times, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches will go down on my list as one that made me feel, and took me to a world where anything is possible.Overall Rating: 9.7/10 show.

The story centers around Yamada and his ability to steal “witch powers” from the 7 witches that get special abilities triggered by a kiss. While the premise sounds really trashy, this anime was surprisingly not and instead a really chill school romance mixed with magic.For a harem anime with “7” in the name, I was expecting the girls not to have much attention paid to them, and while...there were obvious “main girls” and side girls like many larger harems, even the less important girls had their time and their arcs. This show had much more careful attention to how it treated its characters and their character development instead of just throwing in tropes and hoping they work out well. Shiraishi and Yamada’s character relationship is very well developed over time, while the character details of the witches  Odagoro and Saionji and very well done to feel like their actions had meaning. The supporting cast that was not a part of the “harem” was also well done, and though it makes for a cast that is a bit bloated it makes it feel like less of an unbelievable situation since there are girls specifically not in the harem and male characters that actually so more than just stand there and say tiny hints.Overall, the show feels much more like a realistic, character-driven romance than your average Harem anime, with more relatable characters and more realistically developed relationships.Score: 8.0/10 there were obvious “main girls” and side girls like many larger harems, even the less important girls had their time and their arcs.

Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo has an original story but its best part is surely the character's development and the way they make everybody attractive (in the meaning of 'I wanna know more about him / her'). Sadly but logically, only the main characters (count Yamada, Shiraishi, Miyamura, Itou & Nene later on) will be on the front of the scene. Talking about...that, the last 2 witches' background remained really unknown, compared to the other ones.In other words, the other witches will have their dedicated episode (full duration, fortunately) but some won't be seen before the final episode, or at least, seen for a second in any other one. I can't blame this choice because an episode only takes 24-25 minutes but still, I would have appreciated to see them again, to learn more about everyone. Even though, I can't say there is a lack of information of those, concerning the main part of their background (aka, how did every witch get her power).To be honest, it is a very good entertainment, mixed with both magic and realistic context... but when you think about it slowly, you can easily guess it could happen to anyone on Earth. To make it quick, every witch gains her power once she falls in a quite sad situation. For example, one wanted to be involved in groups, in a highschool regular life but couldn't, so she gained the power seduce anyone. In that way, she gained 'friends' (more like servants) and was able to become more important.But once we learn this part, we kinda feel sad for her, 'cause she was desperate. This is surely the routine of many students, no matter the age. You can only have empathy for all the witches, knowing that. The ending was really satisfying, considering it puts an end to a sad situation (in fact, everybody finishes friend with everybody and we can consider no one else inside the group will end up alone).So, I recommend this anime for its plot and the very good development of characters. But don't forget that even if it is only an invented story, it also represents the daily life of many people around the world, and they don't have magic powers to help themselves. All the witches are kinda left alone, either because of their inability to speak with strangers or because other people can really tough, especially with younger than 'em. So give a hand whenever you see someone in the same situations, eh ! that, the last 2 witches' background remained really unknown, compared to the other ones.In other words, the other witches will have their dedicated episode (full duration, fortunately) but some won't be seen before the final episode, or at least, seen for a second in any other one. I can't blame this choice because an episode only takes 24-25 minutes but still, I would have appreciated to see them again, to learn more about everyone. Even though, I can't say there is a lack of information of those, concerning the main part of their background (aka, how did every witch get her power).To be honest, it is a very good entertainment, mixed with both magic and realistic context... but when you think about it slowly, you can easily guess it could happen to anyone on Earth. To make it quick, every witch gains her power once she falls in a quite sad situation. For example, one wanted to be involved in groups, in a highschool regular life but couldn't, so she gained the power seduce anyone. In that way, she gained 'friends' (more like servants) and was able to become more important.But once we learn this part, we kinda feel sad for her, 'cause she was desperate.

But I couldn't help thinking that this was very similar to Kokoro connect, but instead of have some random alien mess with you, you have these witches that basically do the same thing. In addition, since there were so many characters and only 12 episodes, I felt like the story was rushed and I wasn't really able to get to know the characters --- I wasn't really able to get into it. The only thing I really ended up caring about in the end was the relationship between...the two main characters, but even that wasn't too well developed. Also, the flow was kind of confusing at times, especially with all the power stealing from the main character and the number of characters affected by these powers in one given episode. Art and music is good enough, not much to say as it didn't particularly stand out. I probably won't rewatch this anime again, but it's good for if you're looking for something cute and light hearted with a touch of magic. the two main characters, but even that wasn't too well developed.

Lots of kissing, tits, boy love, yaada. Don't take this the wrong way -- this anime was really fun to watch.Yamada-kun is a really bad kid who's been doing whatever he wants around school, until one day he falls down the stairs and crashes against his female classmate, accidentally kissing her and switching bodies.

Each episode jumps from one to another in a fast paced, leaving you wondering whether or not you may have skipped an episodes since the last one you saw -- and each episode, for the most part, deals with a certain witch and finding out about her powers. Yamada also admits to his own feelings, not hiding that he has fallen in love.The anime really picks up at around the eighth episode, where Yamada's behavior actually have consequences on the people around him, and the witches' power come in and play a larger role. It even gets emotional, and actually becomes well thought-out further than I expected.

Thankfully, it is not. Instead, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches sets about briskly extracting as much intelligence and wit out of its simple body-swapping premise as possible.Protagonist Yamada hides a good heart inside a delinquent streak bigger than his ego. Female lead Shiraishi is a quiet honor student whose good grades are a product of her shyness and isolation moreso than any kind of ambition. Student council member Miyamura is smart as a whip but cool as a cucumber, while Supernatural Club member...Ito’s obsession with the supernatural leads the rest of her class to shun her as a chronic liar (not to mention weirdo).Not only are the characters’ personalities different, there’s follow-through with that. Miyamura’s student council connections are explored, with his motivations for enabling Yamada and Shiraishi’s body swapping made an impetus for further plot movement. Ito is a weirdo who loves aliens and other New Age garbage, but Yamada uses his time in her body to help her, ultimately giving her a safe place to be her own weird self.My favorite moment that stems from exploring the characters’ personalities happens when Shiraishi swaps bodies with Yamada to avoid a cold. After Shiraishi states that she is only a good student because she has nothing else in her life but her grades and tells Yamada leave, Yamada instead stays to give her some comfort and company. He encourages her to go to college by saying that he, in all his delinquency and outbursts, will try to go to college as well, if she will. It was really touching and gave us new insight to both of these charactrs and the slow and tender growth of their relationship.Yamada can switch bodies with anyone, with a kiss. This premise could get played out in just one episode, but Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches has had four episodes so far and the premise remains interesting.For one, the show doesn’t always do the same thing with Yamada’s switching. When Yamada switches with Ito, he ends up kicking the collective ass of a group of rude jerks who were bent on exploiting Ito’s need for weird supernatural crap. But when Yamada switches with Shiraishi, it is just as often at her request as it is at his. She switches with him so that he can make friends for her, something the socially isolated and awkward girl doesn’t know how to do. He switches with her so she can take his tests for him, not (just) so he can grope himself. (She checks out what Yamada’s working with, too.)The last few episodes see Yamada’s body-switching power gone completely in favor of a berserk charm ability that overpowers the subject with a driving need to make Yamada theirs, an ability that appalls Yamada and leaves Ito and Miyamuri equally repulsed after he lifts it with a kiss.In short: Should you watch Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches?Yes: It’s fun, it’s funny and the characters are entertaining and relatable. Yamada reminds me very fondly of Yuusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho, another loud guy with skill in a fight and a good heart. If you’re in the mood for something light, this is perfect.

I mean if you really take a second to think about it, seven witches in a high school, okay sounds cool no biggie, but wait they can only use their powers by kissing someone? Okay now hold the bus... There is a club called the supernatural studies club and it starts investigating these seven witches, and their mission is to find all of them. How did this start? because yamada got jealous and annoyed by the honors student shirashi. Now shirashi has the power of body swapping. not that big...of a deal in the long run but in the beginning? oh dear. even though Yamada seems to be mostly respectful of shirashi's body, she does not help matters by saying he can wash her body for her while they do a body swap like really. But anyways even though there is obvious perverted potential Yamada kun and the seven witches is probably one of the most entertaining short anime's I've seen so far.~Art~ 8The animation is fluent, I haven't found to many errors with it, and the characters themselves look beautiful and desirable. You can tell what each character is supposed to be feeling just by looking at their faces.~Sound~ 7.5Opening song: 8This song is extremely upbeat and catchy, plus it’s a perfect fit for this anime. I could help but find myself singing along with my hands tapping out the beatEnding song: 6It’s a cute song and its sounds wonderful but it does not fit well with the anime in my mind. It's not very catchyVoice acting: 8The voice acting was very well done. Everyone fit with their character and it was funny to listen to how they changed their voice compared to who was in their body and what the situation called for.~Character~ 8Character development is something that tends to get left behind in most short anime's but this anime was different. Even though it was short there was most definitely development among all the characters. Yamada-kun who the story follows changes a lot through the twelve episodes mostly because of Shiraishi and the new friends he has made. But in all cases the seven witches and the mortals who are part of the supernatural studies club all have changes in their personality once they meet Yamada-kun.~Enjoyment~ 9I want to say that I'm rating my enjoyment a little high but alas I can't. This anime was funny and sweet and even thought the way for the witches to use their powers was a little strange I enjoyed the different powers that were displayed and the effects they had on the characters.

expectations as i would usually be betrayed by them.Tho that changed after i watched the 1st ep.Story: 7/10As of now i dont determine an anime's worth solely on the bases of its storyline,tho obviously i wouldnt watch one with a horrible storyline,so i didnt focus much on how well the story was executed.If i had to evaluate it  i would say the supernatural elements were quite interesting as...we get a glimpse of something i have never seen before.But thats as far as it goes.Other elements were pretty generic for a harem anime as we had the mc eventually having all the girls around him falling in love with him(possibly even the boys).It was up to the mc to save them by kissing them and as such the story followed by, which anyone could have seen through.Art and Animation: 10/10The character design and animation were perfectly executed in this anime.I cant standby watching an anime with 90s animation and having dull characters.In this anime, each character had their own unique hair colours and almost all of them didn't look out of place.'Almost all of them' not everyone.Their were some characters, such as that girl in class 1 who had light blue hairs, who looked pretty unusual for a highschool student and one would be wondering where they came from.Besides that, the animation was smooth and really good.Sound: 7/10The soundtracks weren't anything special and didn't appeal much to me tho at some points they fitted in perfectly with the atmosphere and enhanced the watching experience.Characters:8/10Initially, i was on the thought that we would once again have another dense typical mc who failed at almost everything in life but this wasn't the case.Yamada, the mc, as a character was interesting and it was really enjoyable just watching him being a complete savage.He was a somewhat empathetic person who was also strong-willed in his actions.He was a straight to the point guy who also happened to be a delinquent.Some of his actions were really hilarious like that one time were he was in the body of shiraishi and was going to punch her bully but all of a sudden his real body(who was mentally shiraishi) appeared and usually the character would stop just at the last second but he went full on and literally sent his own body flying.Ofc there were other moments like these too which left me laughing.Shiraishi, on the other hand, was a complete opposite of yamada.She respected her teachers and was top in her studies.If i had to choose a fav character in the whole series it would probably be her.At first one might think she is a cold hearted serious character(i dont hate characters like those, hell one of my all time  fav female character is cold hearted and serious),this is true to some extent, but after she spent some time with yamada she happened to be a cute and caring person who was really kind.Other then these two, miyamura,ito and odagiri were also likeable and funny character.Enjoyment:8/10At first i really enjoyed the anime as it surpassed my expectations for a harem anime but mid way it kinda got boring.Tho, in the end, it retained its title and the last arc was interesting.Overall: 8/10Taking everything into consideration, this would be one of the few harem-romance anime which i enjoyed watching and didn't regret it afterward.But i wouldn't rec this to those who want to watch an anime with an amazing plot and want action scenes as this rarely had any fight scenes since that wasnt the main focus. we get a glimpse of something i have never seen before.But thats as far as it goes.Other elements were

The general premise and character setup is interesting and could work well. The humor was also decent enough though not particularly hilarious. However, the main problem is that it has way too many characters with their own stories and backgrounds for a 12 episode series to handle effectively. The end result is that the pacing is...pretty bad with most of it being rushed through, not really developing most characters beyond their basic introduction and premise and also introducing a lot of important information just in passing. This latter aspect is especially evident during the final arc, where how the power works isn't really clear and feels largely inconsistent with how the powers have worked in general. It also feels like characters behave in ways that don't really make sense considering what they should know and how their character should be. Still, the cast of characters is pretty good even if it feels that most of them got no development, and I can understand why they tried to rush through so much in so little time. The anime goes through an introduction for each of the 7 witches and then goes onto a major finale. The finale itself, despite aforementioned issues, is largely pretty great, and where it ends especially is a fantastic place for the series to end on to the point I'm incredibly curious where the manga goes in the story beyond this as this was pretty much the perfect place to end. Hence, to rush through everything to hit this finale in a single season is a decision that I can understand, though ultimately I don't think it was worth it because while the ending is great, it isn't enough to make up for how underdeveloped most of the season felt.The art, designs, and animation were okay.

The minute I saw those videos, I clicked away from the anime. I disliked watching ecchi, since, almost all ecchi anime have dumb protagonists, weird plot-holes and a bunch of stupid shit that makes no sense. And to me, after watching those videos, I felt entirely the same.Cut to a few months later (according to the anime's release, an year later) I...got annoyed of people talking such good stuff about it, that I decided to watch it myself, despite knowing that it was (going to be) completely horrible.But, instead of finding myself annoyed, I found an extremely pleasant surprise. What this anime does best, is give itself interesting characters, and a captivating story line. Yes, the anime has ecchi, but not stupid characters. In fact, I believe, I liked all the characters introduced. Even the supposing'love rival'. But, I think a character everyone liked while watching watching this anime was shiraishi.I'm not one to give spoilers in anime, but unlike in other harems, the MC had a love interest, and this anime even tackled the problems faced in real-life relationships.All in all, I think this was an excellent anime, give the manga a read and this a watch, you definitely won't be disappointed. got annoyed of people talking such good stuff about it, that I decided to watch it myself, despite knowing that it was (going to be) completely horrible.But, instead of finding myself annoyed, I found an extremely pleasant surprise.

But in a way, my cautiously low expectations gave way to an unexpected delight.Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is not a romance, it\'s a comedy. Well I mean, sure, there\'s romance involved but if that\'s what you\'re looking for, then the one you find here is sorely lacking in terms of depth and chemistry. I\'d blame that more so on...the fact that our female MC, Shiraishi, is the definition of no personality. Unless you count her incessant obsession with academics and that one episode that addressed her social issues, she\'s got ""the emotional range of a teaspoon"" in Hermione Granger\'s words (yet another academically inclined character, but one with an actual personality). I don\'t know about you, but her rigid, expressionless exterior had nothing going for me.Now let\'s take a look at our other protagonist: Ryuu Yamada. While there isn\'t anything in particular to set him apart from other similar anime (no, not even his blazingly blue hair), he does a decent job of playing the likable MC. But the bigger reason why I enjoyed this one so much isn\'t our main leads, oh no; it\'s our side characters. People like Miyamura and Odagiri that dominated any scene they were in are what made this such a fun ride for me. Though I can\'t say the same for the entirety of the cast because a few of the witches were definitely more on the previously mentioned eye-roll inducing side— the playful humor, joyful atmosphere and light hearted comedy more than made up for it!And speaking of comedy, that element is precisely why this earned a solid 6.5 from me. When a show THIS predictable and THIS cheesy still manages to make me cackle at my screen, it\'s doing something right in my book.And if that isn\'t enough for you, then the attractive characters, the appealing art, and the unusually addictive opening should be reasons to give this one a shot in your free time. the fact that our female MC, Shiraishi, is the definition of no personality.

Like you would only need to the synopsis to know that there there are other two anime/manga that shares similar concept. Two well known anime/manga, one finished publication in 2014 and the other finished in 2012.Let me just say this out right now. The series is riddled with cliches. There\'ll be times where you\'ll might be doubting yourself thinking ahead of the episode and say to yourself ""surely, that\'s not going to happen. Surely not"". Well, I\'ll tell you one thing, my friends. This anime has...a way on making doubters becomes believers. After a few episodes, I went from ""will it happen"" to ""it\'s going to happen"".To extend upon the matter of cliches you\'re gonna have: a cliched MC, a cliched girl. A cliched encounter with cliched results. I mean, I could almost say that eventually at thisBut does anything I\'d said before make this a bad series? Actually no!I think it is because of these cliches, that drew so many people towards this anime. I mean, my film scoring studies teacher once told me that that a hook cannot exist without cliches. I know he said it in the context of film composition, but now that I think about it, this is true for anything related to artistic creativity. In fact, I will concede in saying that I wouldn\'t have been able to connect myself to the story if it weren\'t for the cliches.I also enjoyed the artwork. It is the sort of style that you would expect from 2008 and onwards. Whether or not that\'s a bad thing, is up to you to decide. The OP is great too. I really enjoyed the song. In fact, being a music students trained in piano, I really have a soft spot for OPs that integrates the piano - and strings too. Hence why my rating for sound is disproportionately higher. Oh come on! It\'s a breath of fresh air; so much of the anime\'s OPs consists of: a couple of electric guitars, an electric bass, drums and the vocals. I mean, that\'s not an entirely bad thing because it\'s the  J-Rock standard (which became global Rock-pop standard from the 60s thanks to The Beetles, but that\'s neither here nor there). But it is just simply cool to use OTHER instruments? Why because they also exist.Here\'s a fun drinking game: go through your anime list and for every series OP that uses the J-Rock standard, take a shot.The series also does great in developing the characters. Over time, we see changes in the characters that progress alongside the story. These changes are of course onset by the progression of the series. I think it\'s great too. I also loved their personalities and how the story establishes the relationship between themselves and the MC. Also, it\'s not some cheesy harem too. This gets a tick in my book. Why do I think like this? That\'d go under spoilers. All I can say is although relationships are established there is no line that\'s being crossed. Yes, for the more acute of you out there and those who reads synopsis before and anime or manga series, you will know that something more than just friendship develops between the two MCs. What sort of relationship? Well, you\'ll just have to find out. (to our benevolent MAL overlords: I\'m not really spoiling the plot. It\'s not really spoilers when correlatively, you can find out that much by looking at the synopsis and knowing that it\'s a freaking Romance anime.However, there are times where the anime falls short on me giving the ""凄い” seal of approval. These are leaning not too hard on criticism, just suggestions for changes.The first ""suggestion"" is that they explored concepts quite a few anime have failed to do and several other series chose to stay away from. All I could think was that in order to explore these concepts full and successfully, the amount of episodes for this series was not enough. Not only that, but they made the same mistake twice.Secondly, this might be just subjective observation, but the story itself is not fully fleshed out enough. I mean, for those of you who\'ve already watched this, there are quite a few character back-story. But hey, you only got twelve episodes.Thirdly. What\'s with that ending? I get that they want to maintain consistency with Yamada, but seriously, I really hadn\'t liked that the anime ended the way it had. I personally don\'t like it. After everything that the two MCs have gone through, are they really gonna end it like that? I think you\'re gonna have to accept it though, given the context:that everyone\'s in middle high. Romance in middle high can be an awkward thing.INTERJECTION: It has come to my attention that there is a manga for this. I didn\'t know! I watched the anime first way before i ever realized that I should\'ve read the manga part first. Once I found out, I know that clearly the manga will have way more in terms of character development. That was my fault and I apologize for this.So, would I recommend this anime for other people? Most definitely! Go watch this if you hadn\'t already and have nothing else. If you have another series that\'s like more than thirteen episodes long and goes really in-depth in its concepts, I think watch that first and then come and watch this anime. Unfortunately, they could only do with what they\'ve got. Yet in spite of this, I still think it\'s a really good anime. After you watch the anime, I\'ll then encourage you to then read the manga which I\'ll be doing. Because it\'ll clear up any confusions that you may have. All because I posted this review up before reading the manga. That\'s why my overall rating is an 良いですね out of 10. It\'s an anime that is good, but could be better. Yet in terms of the plot, will have to resort to the manga to get everything explained to you.

At first before watching this anime I thought it was going to be a supernatural fantasy world with witches, straight-up magic and brooms etc., but I was SO HAPPY by what this anime actually was! It\'s such a great take on supernatural phenomenons that happen within a school, where there are these 7 ""witches"" within the school that each have a special type of ability, with some exceptions that happen throughout the show. I pretty much liked every single character, and I loved the hilarious dynamic when it came to some characters interacting with each other....Really well put fan-service, anime was great, main character was HILARIOUS and not just him, EVERYBODY seemed to have some funny bits throughout the show. And what was really funny to me is that the main character has a ""copy"" witch ability to copy others abilities and use them, but guess what...he\'s gotta KISS THEM FIRST!!! Lmao the dude be kissing girls quite a few times in this show, but he be putting the LIP-SMACK on the dudes too which makes it even more hilarious! Overall, art/animation were great AND hilarious, characters were great ESPECIALLY when certain ones interact with each other, and the story was pretty intriguing and quite awesome, and the OP theme song was good, but that ED theme was a BOP! And one of my FAVORITE aspects of the show, is that the ROMANCE...ACTUALLY came TOGETHER AT THE END! Lots of series miss that opportunity, and it\'s rare which annoys the HECK out of me, so I was SO HAPPY when that happened at the end! Overall a fantastic series, especially if you love a supernatural school-life ROM-COM! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Overall a fantastic series, especially if you love a supernatural school-life ROM-COM! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!', 'At first glance, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches looks like a harem anime and while I don\'t outright hate this kind of shows, there are a few things I find heavily off-putting in many of them. The heroines are often plain stereotypes and get limited character development due to the scene being overcrowded. There\'s no real romance, so the show can just between girls on the scene-to-scene basis. The protagonist is either a wimp or an idiot, so the constant flux of flirting and shoehorned fanservice can be maintained without him committing to any of the girls...However, this show is none of these. It\'s a...genuine love story with mild harem elements, excellent chemistry between the main couple and tame ecchi that is either purely parodistic or made in a way that is actually kind of sexy, rather than gross and juvenile. That last part is strictly connected to the premise: the protagonist, a notorious delinquent named Yamada, discovers the power to switch bodies with anyone he wants by kissing them, and does that by crushing into one of his schools best students, Shiraishi Urara. The kissing scenes thus become a constant element of the show, leading both to quite holarious humour and the aforementioned fanservice moments - ecchi it doesn\'t go much further than that though and it is quickly established that Yamada and Urara are into each other, their relationship steadily developing throughout the story.The body-switching gimmick comes with another major upside, that is voice acting - every main character occasionally switches bodies with someone and their seiyuus have to pretty much play a few different roles - the stark contrast between Yamada\'s rash behaviour and Shiraishi\'s stoicism lead to some great performances and comedic scenes. Other than that, the production quality of the show is mostly just ok, but the things like subtle OP and ED sequences complement the overall fun and romantic climate of the whole experience.If I have to complain about something, it\'s the middle section of the season and most of the ""secondary"" witches - their stories felt quite rushed and they as characters didn\'t offer the genuine charm of the ""core"" characters (and by those I don\'t only mean Yamada and Shiraishi, but also other members of the supernatural club, Itou and Miyamura). In general, though, this show was a huge positive surprise to me - it was different than I\'ve expected from the tags and the title, but only in positive ways. I\'m not sure it genuinely deserves a 9, but I\'ll give it that as an appreciation of how it avoids the obnoxious shounen tropes, managing to mix fanservice that never gets off-putting, comedy that is amusing all the way through and romance that actually goes somewhere. It\'s something I see so rarely that I think it deserves extra appreciation - and if it sounds like something that fits your preferences too, definitely give this show a chance. genuine love story with mild harem elements, excellent chemistry between the main couple and tame ecchi that is either purely parodistic or made in a way that is actually kind of sexy, rather than gross and juvenile.

The show doesn\'t leave you wondering what happens next except for the ending where Yamada and Shiraishi have the final kiss of the show. Honestly the show in my opinion didn\'t leave me wondering because everything was straight forward. If you really wanted to get into it I guess a question you could ask is why were the witch powers in that school in the first place but i\'m pretty sure the show covers that as well. Also is adorable to realize the Shiraishi catch feelings for Yamaka. This is why (in my opinion) I...gave the story a 8/10.(Characters)Some of the characters in my opinion were a little boring or there just wasn\'t enough backstory for the character. That doesn\'t mean that the characters brought down the overall show if anything for me personally it made the experience of watching this show better. My favorite female character from this show Leona. There isn\'t much to her besides she figured out all the 7 witches and ran away to save her memories so in my eyes that makes her mysterious which wants me to know more about her. My favorite male character from this show has to be Yamada, somehow he makes everything workout and in the end he ends up with the girl he loves which is exactly what a sad person like me loves to see. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the characters a 8/10.(Enjoyment)I watched another anime before this and wasted 4 hours of my life and I was bummed out then I stumbled across this show and it made me feel so much better. I love anime that have something to do with either romance or supernatural and this show had both so i was able to really enjoy it. I never once felt like ""i dont want to watch this"" while watching this show and if your starting out with anime I would recommend this because its easy to follow and enjoyable. gave the story a 8/10.(Characters)Some of the characters in my opinion were a little boring or there just wasn\'t enough backstory for the character.

It's been about a year since I dropped the show and I can't just go back to it. Seeing how easy it was for him to treat his friend basically like trash and as if he never existed. Even bringing into account Nene, it still doesn't change it. I might pick up the manga later down the road, but until then I can't. Other than that the story seemed alright and the character development was decent, but I feel like the story could've...been told better than how it was at the point I dropped the show. I could be wrong and the story could've gotten better, but from what I've seen it's stayed between decent and semi-decent. been told better than how it was at the point I dropped the show.

Each witch has a unique power that will vary between them (read minds, change body, erase memories ...). He receives the mission of the school representative to find all the witches (I will not tell you why not to spoil the surprise).Overall it's a very entertaining anime, it has a well-built romance and good drama, good...characters with motivations and who are quite charismatic. The animation is cool and has a reasonable soundtrack. The only defect is that there for half the anime gets a little coiled, but this does not last long (thank God).The anime also has a great plot twist that I honestly did not expect. Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a light anime that will probably make you laugh, get excited and have fun. characters with motivations and who are quite charismatic.

As they get closer, their relationship will quickly develop.To summarize, it's...a good school life but with magic, in addition we have a good end.So I advise for those who are looking for short anime, with a good plot and a good end. a good school life but with magic, in addition we have a good end.So I advise for those who are looking for short anime, with a good plot and a good end."", ""This was one of my favorite fantasy animes and the main protagonist is actually a very cool guy, unlike some other harem anime characters. Overall, I really liked the plot and the art style and I hope a season 2 will come soon. The one complaint that I had about this show was that it was too short. They could have made more material (like 20+ episodes) based on the manga. I'm going to give this an overall score of 10/10 since the characters were well written and the story was flowing and not hard to understand. I really liked the way the animators decided...to draw some of the scenes since it made me not lose interest as I have in the past. Another thing that I liked about the anime was the sound effects used. These sound effects were funny and made watching the anime more enjoyable. I recommend this anime to anyone who loves the fantasy genre and loves harem animes. to draw some of the scenes since it made me not lose interest as I have in the past.

This is the first time I've watched an anime where the main character switched bodies by kissing. It sounded like a harem/ecchi when I first found out about it but it's really not. The story has some plot twists at some parts of the animes, it made me anxious for some parts and wheeze a lot. So for me the story is actually quite good with me not being able to predict most of it.Art: 8/10Well I'm not the best to judge art since I'm no artist myself. But just from someone who...watches anime a lot I find the art style quite modern with great quality. Keeping me entertained with some of the scenes and objects that I see, for the school setting and everything the art is pretty good.Sound: 6/10The sound was pretty normal. I didn't really find any of the sounds really unique it just sounded normal. Don't have much to say about it because of that but it was alright and all the sounds that were in the anime made sense.Character: 9/10I found the characters really entertaining. The character interactions made me wheeze a lot and were really enjoyable because it was just so cute for some parts. There all a bunch of characters who have different types of personality's who in the end all just connect while making sense. I didn't hate any of the characters or at least I didn't in the end I really enjoyed all of the characters.Enjoyment: 9/10I found this anime very enjoyable. Going from the last point all the characters made me enjoy the story so much more. I binged watched all of the episodes in 1 day because I enjoyed this anime so much.Overall: 8/10Overall with all the ratings I did for each category I found this anime to be a  8/10. I really did enjoy this anime and characters a ton. The story was pretty unique, The art and sound we're pretty normal but it really did fit in with the anime.

Thank you for reading my review :D"", 'There is no beating around the bush, it\'s a supernatural themed harem, it\'s kinda entertaining for some of the antics and some of the comedy is alright.The romantic progression between the main couple was enjoyable as well and I did like the characters when I watched the show.In retrospect the characters weren\'t done particularly well, they were barely characterized beyond the cliche of top of the class falls for deliquant and all the tropes and cliches surrounding that.The opening is really really nice tho, doesn\'t factor in a bunch when it comes to this review, but hey I can recommend the OP for sure.The story...does one of my least favorite tropes as a fake off or ""Mock"" ending twist, but it isnt really believable that it\'d really stay that way. The ""twist"" involves memory wipes and that just feels like a crux or poor writing to create a bit of articial tension or make you angry.On the whole it\'s a harem, ""romcom"", with a supernatural quirk about it, it\'s for the majority of the runtime mindless fun, but nothing too special.a 6/10 objectively, tho I kinda enjoy these kinda shows so it\'s more of a 7/10 personally does one of my least favorite tropes as a fake off or ""Mock"" ending twist, but it isnt really believable that it\'d really stay that way.

It\'s such a great concept to work with, it feels like a waste to only have twelve episodes, not to mention the amount of lost material to work with in the comics.As far as I\'ve seen, the comics get way more complicated than necessary, and that jumbles things a lot. However, even if they\'re jumbled and progressively get worse and worse in quality according to people, I feel like many people forget that things...don\'t have to be perfect. This show is by no means perfect, though it\'s very unique for the genres it inhabits. Since the show, as well as its ending, are already imperfect, what\'s the harm in making more of it. Even if it gets worse according to some people, just having content to consume that you can steadily count on being interesting and enjoyable, even if it\'s not perfect, is a gift in and of itself.

I really enjoyed this anime.  I went in expecting a pretty average harem anime with flat characters and lackluster jokes.  However, after the first 3 episodes, I was hooked, and I ended up finishing the whole show in a day.  The characters are all likable and well written, and the animation is very well done.  The sound design was also pretty good, although most likely the weakest part of the show.  The story was fun and simple, so it wasn't a total mindfuck....If you're looking for some complex plot and major themes, then maybe look elsewhere, but for anyone who just wants to enjoy some good comedy, I really recommend this show!

To see the dark side of a wish shows that power really does come with great responsibility.This show is very romantic at its core for Shiraishi and Yamada. It is also very funny and pushes forward the very quick realisation that many people in this show's world just kiss like it is nothing. It is actually somewhat unexpected since it happens so much and everyone just shrugs it off. You have various witches kissing various people and other people doing the same to spread the effects. At the same time at least Shiraishi is...fundamental in she will only personally kiss Yamada.That aside the show really does have a darkness to it. The witches wished for their problems to be solved and they were given the power to do it. However, it makes them run amok until they are pulled in and if it wasn't for how this timeline went it would stay with them for a while. It is almost more of a curse that gives a rose-tinted view of the world.The story itself toward the end was a bit rushed, but it was thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat as you would say awaiting its conclusion. It really threw unexpected hurdles that meant it has a very nice ending.The art of the show is of a great standard throughout. They do everything really nice and it was very consistent. It was nice to see the magic in a form that wasn't flashy per se.The OP is really nice and upbeat. It gives off a good vibe. The ED was much more a soothing ending and especially with the last episode was such a great fit.Characters develop mainly around the supernatural club, student council and the witches with some of their friends. The shocking revelations of how Yamada ended up in his horrible starting position in the school was insane. It fit so well in the story as well. Generally, the witches have an entourage that brings in supporting characters.I personally found Nao Takigawa to be an especially interesting story to deal with.In the end, I would say although the ending was rushed and it would have been better as a two-cour it was still a brilliant show. The story is a story in a story and that is really nicely done. The comedy is funny and the romance is heart pounding. It has a really satisfying conclusion.One thing that is abundantly clear is that it won't come back unless by some major exception.

Still, I jerked myself because the preview looked promising, and now I know that was the right decision.If you go in the direction of fiction, you should at least write the characters and their behavior realistically/plausibly so that the rest is just pretty fun.I also like that the story does not jump back and forth but always leads to the next with its plot points and ideas leads to the next piece of the puzzle which is inserted into the previous one and completes the picture.The body swap concept is nothing new...and everyone had the desire to swap with the best of the class to get better grades, or with the strongest to finally beat up the bullys. But these ideas are unsuitable for very long storytelling. I am pleased that they are picked up just long enough to get to the next story, than the next story, than the next story etc. They always go one step further to surprise you, yet you understand how everything is connected.Despite the very obvious titles, the concept of the other witches and their abilities surprised me only in a positive sense.And I'm really surprised that I really liked the romance aspect. I really wanted to see how the two main characters come together and I was really interested in whether Yamada confesses her feelings.And everyone who was in love with a classmate can understand many situations and decisions that were made here first of all and I like that the most.

I mean what do expect from an anime that starts of with a female and a male character body swapping? Ecchi and some cringe moments... but you don‘t get to see a lot of that. Let me explain why this anime is worth watching (at least in my opinion):You don‘t get a lot of ecchi moments, sure there are some moments that are cringe and expected due to the circumstances of the characters but it gets delivered in a humorous way. And this is actually what the show is about: Fun and humor.The story of Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches...is easy to explain and not hard to understand. It‘s about Yamada a student who is not good at school but one day gets involved in some supernatural activities that involves him and 7 witches in their everyday school life. I believe when you’re reading this review you know somewhat about the story due to its airing 5 years ago. So the story is not super complicated and not really interesting. It‘s not really about the story but about the characters.The characters are the strongest reason to watch the anime. All of the characters are in their own way unique and trying to live their way in their normal, boring lives. Once the supernatural activities starts you get to know every character and their problems with school and their way of handling things. The dynamics between the characters are greatly shown and sometimes one can get really emotional.Worth mentioning is the great opening and ending songs that are perfect for the atmosphere this show is trying to create. It‘s light hearted, funny and in some way romantic.What I didn‘t like was the fact that this series had not enough episodes to live up to its full potential. It seemed a little rushed and most of the witches were not introduced properly. They become the focus for one episode and disappear as a really minor character who appears at the end again to conclude the story. On the other hand, the characters who were introduced properly had a major character development which the show is about. It‘s about people who don‘t enjoy their school life (who are mostly outcasts) but get powers so that they come together and create a reason to go to school.To conclude, this is show is rather about individuals that come together to improve their own life to let life become a little enjoyable. This anime has something special, a special atmosphere filled with all kind of emotions depending on the episode. As an audience one can see special relationships und characters evolve and I think this is what the show is about. It‘s about having a community and share memories with one another (another topic which is captured really well at the end of the anime, so I‘m not going to talk about that). And obviously it‘s about love.I would recommend this anime for people who are looking for a slice of life anime with a sweet love story and want something to laugh for. I‘ve had a great time watching this and I‘m also considering to read the manga which narrates the story further I think due to its finish date.

The love story is really cute though and there's at least one tear-jerking scene related to it.I would say this show is more geared toward a female audience as there really aren't any fight scenes, mecha elements, pervy situations, etc. (The perviest thing that happens in this anime is just kissing and showing of panties.)I tried really hard not to put any spoilers in here.

However, that didn\'t pan out, and he has reverted back to his violent delinquent ways. After another office visit, he passes by Urara Shiraishi. Shortly after, a misstep sends them both tumbling down the stairs, ending with an accidental kiss. After waking up in the nurse\'s office, Yamada discovers he is in the body of Shiraishi! The two decide to become acquaintances, and use the forsaken Supernatural Studies Club room to continue their research into this odd power. In doing so they unintentionally attract new members to their...cause, and discover that there are six more powers within the school to be discovered. Now Yamada along with his club mates are searching for the seven witches of Suzaku High, which I honestly don\'t know why Yamada would care, but whatever.Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is a romcom anime that has not a single break, the pacing was simply way too fast even by comedy anime standards. It is a good anime, make no mistake, but if you\'re coming for anything other than comedy than you\'re outta luck. Aside from Yamada himself, not a single other character is given proper development. Heck, I could even make the argument that Yamada isn\'t very fleshed out either. The problem lies in that number, Yamada-kun and the ""Seven"" Witches. As a manga, I\'m sure everything came together nicely, Google suggests that the series was rather successful. As an anime however, the lack of development or screen time for 99% of the cast was too apparent. Especially when you consider that there was not only the ""seven"" witches that needed screen time, but nearly double that for the rest of the entire cast. All in all, no one got enough development, and in a harem style romcom, you absolutely need to develop those characters further than just being visual bait with a single personality trait.Earlier I mentioned that this was a good anime, and I still believe that. The comedy is solid, most of the jokes didn\'t work for me, but I can\'t say they were unfunny. Also despite being pretty much a harem anime involving a lot of kissing, there is a ton of equal opportunity in the fan service. As to whether or not you like the way it is handled though, that is ultimately up to you, I myself am rather indifferent about that part though. Sad to say though, that\'s pretty much it from me. This anime was an alright one and done experience for me, one I don\'t think I would bother to recommend. If you are legitimately curious about this series though, you should try it\'s written material instead. I\'d bet money that the manga is a much more complete experience, so don\'t hesitate to try your luck there instead. cause, and discover that there are six more powers within the school to be discovered.

The powers are somewhat unique, but there are tons of other anime with magical powers. However, the way they use their power by kissing is very interesting. There are a few fan service and ecchi scenes which were nice, and it has quite a lot of funny scenes. After finishing the anime, I felt that the story was a bit rushed. I wished they showed more of the side females rather than mostly just the main, some even appeared only in 1 or 2 episodes.Art (10/10):The art was good. All the female...witches are nicely drawn, all of them had distinctive hair colours so it was easy to distinguish them. Shiraishi is really cute looking as well. The art is definitely not as good as top-quality animes but nothing I can find to hate on.Sound (10/10):The OP hits, it's so catchy it's unforgettable, the lyrics are meaningful and sweet as well. The voice acting was good and able to convey feelings when necessary. Even when they switched bodies they still convey the voice needed to feel natural as if they still had the same personality.Character (10/10):The MC is a delinquent in middle school and wants something interesting to happen in high school but finds it dull till he meets the 7 witches and knowing that magical powers exist, it spices up his life and even getting a romantic interest.I think the characters are what makes this show enjoyable to watch. There are various characters that feature different personalities such as kuudere and tsundere-type personalities. There are interesting sad backstories that are thought out with depth for a few of the witches. This leads to the MC helping them (gaining a harem of both males and females lol) is nice and satisfying to watch.The MC by all means is not dense and a wimp, he will go out of his way to help out the 7 witches. However, he would sometimes force himself on a girl which may mean he is confident, and that's good, but may also mean another thing in real life.Enjoyment (10/10):Simple plot and easy to understand. It gets straight to the point and was very enjoyable for me.There's a sense of mystery on who the witches are, what are their powers, and how the MC would make use of their powers, making you want to binge-watch the 12 eps in 1 sitting.Overall (10/10):Would recommend watching unless you hate a lot of kissing or yaoi and yuri. witches are nicely drawn, all of them had distinctive hair colours so it was easy to distinguish them.

I love the main characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the personality of the super natural club members. The comedy was great and I really enjoyed the story. I did feel like the end was kind of rushed and the begging really out shined the ending episodes, but it came to a nice conclusion and did not leave on a cliff hanger. I felt like the presidents relationship in the story was kind of odd and felt like they could have tied him in better. Plus the random relationship...he had with some of the girls felt strange. I would have like hints to his pass maybe be layed out in the story to make him feel more connected. though his pass story was kind of bland too. he had with some of the girls felt strange.

The characters are designed very well and cute. That's what I like the most perhaps.Its basically a light mystery about witched and school.

I'd overlook it if said story has a decent story to it, which Yamada-kun certianly does.Yamada himself is that rebel without a cause, that just can't fit in with school (private schools right?) anyhow his life gets very interesting once he ends up accidential falling onto the most cleaverist girl in his year, Shiraishi.Now it has parts of crudish/ecchi content in there as you'd expect, what makes it funnier then otheres is the reversal on the humour invovled. Plus Yamada's a pretty solid reliable character...that hardly ever gets used outside thugish-punk shows where they're sluging each other that hardly ever gets used outside thugish-punk shows where they're sluging each other"", '""Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches"" was a series that with the title, I assumed there would be a lot of harem scenes with considerable amounts of fanservice (as is with many harems). Surprisingly this wasn\'t the case.Story: 8/10The anime revolves around a group of students in the school who contain magical powers that are used through kissing someone. The main male character called Ryu Yamada is a delinquent who discovers this after accidentally falling on and kissing the school\'s ace, a girl named Urara Shiraishi, and realizing they switched bodies. They then join the Supernatural Studies Club thanks to one of the vice-presidents, Miyamura,...and they go from there trying to find the other 6 witches and understand why they have these powers. The idea that witches are among the school is pretty interesting and the story had me pretty hooked and I liked the story overall.Art: 8/10The art style was very pretty, I liked the character designs, especially for the girls in the series. Specifically, I did like the designs of Urara, Miyabi, Meiko and Noa. There was some scenes of fanservice but it wasn\'t so cringy as I expected it to be.Sound: 8/10The OP was very catchy and nice and it really fit the series well. The ED was alright, but I felt it didn\'t fit the show, although it was nice. The songs throughout the show was also pretty nice.Character: 9/10What makes this anime great are the characters and the interactions they have with each other.

Not to mention, each of the characters have their own personality that sets them apart and it really makes them memorable- especially in moments where Yamada and Urara switch bodies.Enjoyment: 8/10This show was very enjoyable, having scenes that were humorous or sad, and I really enjoyed the interactions between the characters, especially those of Yamada. One thing I didn\'t like was the Yaoi/Yuri scenes that occurred, especially with the kissing and in general, I cringed and felt uncomfrable. Either way, I was hooked with the plot, the comedy and the character interactions and I enjoyed it very much.Overall: 8/10This was an anime that I enjoyed very much and it was filled with characters I enjoyed very much. If you want something that involves romance, comedy, and supernatural aspects, I recommend this anime for you. This is a series I enjoyed and I liked it. and they go from there trying to find the other 6 witches and understand why they have these powers. The idea that witches are among the school is pretty interesting and the story had me pretty hooked and I liked the story overall.Art: 8/10The art style was very pretty, I liked the character designs, especially for the girls in the series. Specifically, I did like the designs of Urara, Miyabi, Meiko and Noa. There was some scenes of fanservice but it wasn\'t so cringy as I expected it to be.Sound: 8/10The OP was very catchy and nice and it really fit the series well. The ED was alright, but I felt it didn\'t fit the show, although it was nice. The songs throughout the show was also pretty nice.Character: 9/10What makes this anime great are the characters and the interactions they have with each other.

I was expecting the basic 7/10 high school romance anime, which is kinda what I got ..but only at first.So like I said, the start kind of rubbed me the wrong way, some conversations seemed a bit awkward and the animation was a little clunky. There were also red flags of the typical fanservice. Luckily, it was still watchable so I gave it a chance. The middle of it, it got good. I enjoyed the humor, likable characters, and the way they handled the ""harem."" Tbh I didn\'t even notice it was classified...as one until the end. I mean, for me who utterly despises harem, I can safely say that wasn\'t the main focus (thank god). But then, this is what caught me by surprise. I was gonna write it off as sold 7/10 but then the ending happened. It had such a well built-up tension that I never saw coming. I won\'t say more but let\'s just say I genuinely felt concerned for the characters, and I won\'t lie, a little tear fell from my face.Lastly, should you watch this? Yes, if you like silly humor with a slice of cliche love stories. Even if you aren\'t one for slow starts you should give this a chance. Now, if you don\'t like, let\'s just say, fanservice and cliche animes, don\'t watch this. as one until the end.

Well the show tries to show the other witches as ""Attractive and Lovable"" in their own fashion i\'d never say they tried to make it look like a relationship was forming between them and Ryuu Yamada (Besides a friendship) They definitely forced them into some humorous generic harem style situations but they kept the whole ""A bond forming between characters"" to Ryuu and Urara. This romance aspect was enough to keep me watching even with the dull story (more on that later.) Yes I know other characters do start to fall for Yamada after a while but it wasn\'t as nearly as bad as in a generic Harem anime, not every single character wanted to date him by the end and only wanted to be friends...As for the story, while the story was different and more interesting than other animes, it still felt dull and like nothing much really happened until the last few episodes, maybe it was the focus on the Harem aspect that made the entire flow of the show seem drawed out but it just felt like nothing was really happening, nothing impacted the story at all until the last few episodes and honestly I don\'t know if the build-up was worth it. I don\'t think the plot was bad it was somewhat unique and pretty interesting but for the first 8-9 episodes or so I just felt like I was watching some mind-numbing filler.The characters we\'re probably the weakest part of the anime in my opinion, and surprisingly it wasn\'t the generic main male for once. I actually felt like the main male was the most interesting of the bunch and well he was a complete jerk he wasn\'t oblivious to everything and everyone around him. He slowly became more and more likable as the story progressed and honestly was probably the strongest character in the show, surprisingly the characters that were the least likable were all of the girls, they all just felt generic like some carbon fiber harem characters we\'ve seen over and over. You have your stupid, shy but incredibly nice girl, the rude but after getting to know her she starts to be nicer however she still continues to tease the protagonist despite obviously liking him, and the quite and ""not interested in anything"" girl that has a lovable personality despite not saying much or doing anything. They were all extremely cute so that alone might be enough to suffer through them despite being extremely generic.In all honestly this anime wasn\'t too great, if it wasn\'t for the ending it would definitely be below a 5 Stars on MAL but due to the plot picking up and the romance really building up towards the end it ended up being a decent anime, if you\'re willing to suffer through the starting episodes of just straight ""Borderline filler"" than i\'d say go ahead and watch it but the only way you are going to be able to do that is if you find the characters to be extremely cute and attractive and luckily they mostly all are. over one main male but it really felt more like a love story between the 2 main characters Ryuu Yamada and Urara Shiraishi.

The concept of a body-swapping, kiss-fueled high-school comedy/drama seemed like just one big awkward moment, and I as a viewer have a fairly low tolerance for awkward moments to begin with.It wasn\'t.  That isn\'t to say the characters didn\'t occasionally feel awkward -- in fact, they fairly frequently do but the audience is, I think by the quality of the voicework and writing, usually kept a step distant enough that it\'s easy even for someone like me to laugh instead of cringe.  That takes a good deal of...talent.I think the biggest point (or points) in the show\'s favor are the characters.  There are a lot of them that take to the limelight for at least an episode and all of them are at least decently entertaining to watch, being well-written, well-animated, and very well-voiced.  This is extra impressive because of the amount of body swapping and other magical character manipulation that\'s going on: the voices and movements are dead giveaways as to who is inhabiting what body right now and often if they\'re under any sort of altered status.  Sirashi, Yamada, and Odagiri are probably the best of the lot, as befits them getting a ton of screen time to show the depths of their character, but I find it hard to think of a character who wasn\'t at least a little rounded or who I never really felt any sympathy for.In the end, there are elements of the show, particularly the overarching story, that are only OK, but they\'re perfectly serviceable at worst, and the best stuff is very good.  This is a character driven piece more than it is a ""zany antics"" piece, and it can be very sweet, very heartfelt, occasionally dramatic, and usually at least a little humorous even if it\'s not going for laugh-out-loud comedy. talent.I think the biggest point (or points) in the show\'s favor are the characters.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StorySimply enough, it\'s unique, has its traits and for most part has fair enough development. But probably the aspect of casual kissing, even its purpose is power usage, it still annoyed me. Wasn\'t fond of it at all. This type of thing is fine in harem or ecchi shows because there usually all girls love 1 guy anyways and guy cares about them too. But this is more of a ""serious"" slice-of-life fantasy romance. Where only certain characters have romantic feelings for the main character. (or something...along the line, not expert at self-expression) Anyhow.. story might be unique, but wasn\'t as enjoyable for me. Plus  the aspect how casually after switching bodies were used/done/looked at or something along the line, wasn\'t fond as well.✦Art & SoundDid look great, subtle fanservice was also nice. Music was also quite enjoyable, soundtrack wasn\'t bad either.✦CharacterBunch of odd people, different base stereotypes.

The comedy isn't top notch per say, it is decent enough to get some guaranteed laughs though.  The power system is a great idea; it wasn't used to it's maximum potential, more ways to use powers than just kissing for example or a longer story could have presented a variety of situations where the powers were more than just a plot device.The story beats pass by way too quickly; this in turn compromises the mystery aspects and makes everything solvable before the show presents it's ta-dah moments.  I think...you can tell no-one took this project seriously when both sub and dub voice actors sound like they rushed through it and/or just kept their first take.I'm not suggesting a slow pace like Monster Anime; I'm just saying this story would have benefitted from the plot being taken seriously and more flushed out.  Although the aim may have been to use such a serious premise to present it in a more light hearted fashion or the manga may have had a plot that wasn't so rushed.Oh well; not like it's my demographic anyway, although I do remember being in that demographic and I would have thought the same then. you can tell no-one took this project seriously when both sub and dub voice actors sound like they rushed through it and/or just kept their first take.I'm not suggesting a slow pace like Monster Anime; I'm just saying this story would have benefitted from the plot being taken seriously and more flushed out.

It could have been rated an 8, and it could have been rated a 2, and it would have deserved either rating wholeheartedly for different reasons.  I settled on a 5, not because I thought it deserved that, but because I couldn\'t decide how far down or up to go.There are spoilers to this review, because they\'re necessary for an honest review.  They will be kept to a minimum.(since it\'s my understanding that they\'re pretty strict about that, let me repeat:  this is NOT a spoiler free review.  We...good?)Let\'s start with the good things to get them out of the way:  All of the technical aspects were fine.  I have no complaints. Voice acting was decent, character design was okay, sound and music were okay - nothing really to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.  It wasn\'t great, but it wasn\'t awful.  And these days, that\'s about par for the course for an anime, so that\'s good.  It was a well produced anime.Also, it seemed to have a rather strong message, and taken by itself, it was a rather nice message about relationships and dealing with relational trauma.  There was also no egregious or unnecessary fanservice, so that was welcome.If all of that were the only things to take into consideration, I could have scored it a lot higher.It\'s the plot and the characters that were, well... troublesome is a nice word for it.The plot was, to be frank, annoying.  At its core, it made no sense.  There\'s a ""school lore"" of sorts which says that there are, at any given time, seven ""witches"" which have their own powers, and these powers are transferred with a kiss.  It was just nonsensical.  The whole plot, from beginning to end, was just inscrutable.  It was basically like the mangaka (or whoever) took the notion of a crack-fic and turned it into anime.  By which I mean, they found the most absurd, inscrutable, and nonsensical plot point possible and sent a whole production team after it.  I am still not entirely sure, after watching the whole thing, whether the whole thing was just an excuse to have high school students kissing each other in as many permutations as possible.  In fact, I\'m pretty sure that was the case.  There were boys kissing girls, girls kissing boys, boys kissing boys, and girls kissing girls, all absolutely necessary to the plot, and it still somehow managed to feel like the plot was only there to facilitate that, oh, and there\'s kind of a story there too as an afterthought.  Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t think this could be classified as ecchi by any stretch, but it still managed to feel a little uncomfortable.But even if you take the plot for what it is, that wouldn\'t fix the structural storytelling issues.  This is an anime that doesn\'t know what it is, because right about in the middle, there\'s this massive tone shift that just ruins the whole thing.  It starts out kind of lighthearted and something like a rom-com or comedy.  There are some lighthearted moments, and I even laughed a few times.  But somewhere around ep. 6, give or take, it decided to heck with that, and turned into a rather dark drama that had me on the edge of my seat, and not in a good way, more like in a ""I hate where this is going, I want to see how it ends, but this is *painful to watch*"" kind of way.In the last couple of episodes, the plot was basically that the male main character had to kiss one of the female main characters, and some other characters were trying to prevent that from happening (I won\'t go into why, because I\'m trying to keep spoilers to a minimum).  If he had just done it without any preamble, it would have been fine.  But no, he had to stand there monologuing in his head about why he thought it was a good idea, and wasted so much time just staring at her lips that the other characters had a chance to prevent it.  I won\'t lie, I was yelling at my screen ""JUST KISS HER YOU IDIOT!!!"".  And it\'s not even because I was invested, it was because I couldn\'t believe the level of incompetence that was playing out in front of my eyes.And the ending itself, after all that, was amazingly disappointing.  It just all... went away.  It neatly resolved many of the plot points, but in such a way that I felt like I should have dropped the whole thing around ep. 6.  Somehow it managed to be a perfect resolution and utterly unsatisfying in almost every way.I think this anime would have been so much better if it hadn\'t pulled a bait and switch halfway through.  If it had started and ended as a drama, fine.  I would have at least known what to expect and probably have passed on it.  If it had started and ended as a lighthearted rom-com, I probably would think a lot more highly of it, and not hate-watched the last three episodes while yelling at my screen to get ON with it!  But instead, it pulled me in with a promise of one thing, and then abruptly changed tone and left me wondering what the heck I just watched.Despite all that, I didn\'t rate it a ""not recommended"".  While I personally hated this anime with the fire of a thousand suns, the point of a review is not to foist my opinions on you, the reader, and I would certainly have mixed feelings about recommending it for that reason.  If you\'re looking for a dark drama with a side of lighthearted romp, and you\'re willing to not look too deeply into the plot because ""thar be dragons here"", and you like lots of kissing in all sorts of permutations, then you might enjoy this.  But if you\'re looking for a good plot, good storytelling, and good characters, then maybe you should look elsewhere.  I wish I did.

On the surface, it seemed like it would abuse the ""Harem"" and ""Romance"" aspects, but it did the opposite.The story was very interesting. There were a lot of aspects and pieces of it that really stood out to me. Glossing over the synopsis really leaves you wondering what it all really means and what is done with it all. The body-swapping aspect stood out the most. The story is way deeper than it initially seems to be, and it was all attention-grabbing and leaves...you questioning and wanting more, from beginning to end. From the very first episode, it lays the foundation quickly and immediately establishes the overarching aspect that will propel the story as it goes. However, that is one of the issues of this anime: PACING. It\'s too quick at times and ends up being all over the pace. This isn\'t a huge issue, but it does ruin the story a tad. This anime is more comedic than serious, after all. Overall, a good story, but had the potential to be way better than it ended up being.The characters are pretty good as well. They all have a lot of heart and soul poured into them, and this is this anime\'s strong point. They all have their own vibes with each other, and all work incredibly well with one another. The main characters all stand out extremely well and can all stand on their own. There are a lot of characters, which kind of becomes overwhelming at times. However, the witches, all have different personalities, which keeps the story feeling refreshing as the story does fly in many different directions. You\'re bound to find a character you\'ll like. My personal favorites are Leona, Nene, and Miyabi.The animation is what you\'d expect from an anime like this. Everything is pretty average and generic but works very well. The character designs are all very well done. Sometimes it\'s hard for the guys to stand out as they all look the same (excluding Yamada). This is the complete opposite for the girls, however, as they all have aspects to their designs that help them stand on their own, such as their hairstyles and poses.Overall, this is a very entertaining anime that will definitely brighten up your day. From the very first episode, you\'ll be left laughing and smiling from the chaos. This anime is very comedic, while also maintaining its story very well. I recommend you give this a watch if you are interested. you questioning and wanting more, from beginning to end. From the very first episode, it lays the foundation quickly and immediately establishes the overarching aspect that will propel the story as it goes. However, that is one of the issues of this anime: PACING. It\'s too quick at times and ends up being all over the pace. This isn\'t a huge issue, but it does ruin the story a tad. This anime is more comedic than serious, after all. Overall, a good story, but had the potential to be way better than it ended up being.The characters are pretty good as well. They all have a lot of heart and soul poured into them, and this is this anime\'s strong point. They all have their own vibes with each other, and all work incredibly well with one another. The main characters all stand out extremely well and can all stand on their own. There are a lot of characters, which kind of becomes overwhelming at times. However, the witches, all have different personalities, which keeps the story feeling refreshing as the story does fly in many different directions. You\'re bound to find a character you\'ll like.

The story is serviceable, I would say it leans more-so into ""Good"" than ""Meh"" because it is fun and has a few things I find pretty interesting. The story follows the protagonist, Yamada-kun living through (delinquent) high school life when, suddenly, Shiraishi is praised right in front of him, pissing him off. He then proceeds to be an ass and falls down the stairs accidentally, knocking into her in the process. When he awake he realizes they switched...bodies. The entire first episode is them figuring out what the power is all about, Yamada is freaked out, Shiraishi is perfectly calm. As the story progresses, we get introduced to more witches and other colorful characters. Usually they are causing an issue that needs to be resolved, or Yamada needs to get their support.This summary was super duper ultra cut. People reading this have either watched it or plan to so going over *everything* is pointless.So, the witches have powers. What are they? How do they work? Shiraishi can swap bodies, obviously, but the other powers are Charm, Telepathy, Premonition, Retrospective, Invisibility, and Amnesia. These are all straight forward for the most part, excluding Retrospective. The cherry on top is how these powers are activated: kissing. It feels appropriate now to say this anime has a *lot* of fan service. It never really ruins serious moments, it\'s more used as a comedic tool (which works *sometimes*), but I felt it was necessary to point out with some not being fans of it; however, if your issue lies with it being solely for male audiences, the author of the manga added some yaoi in there as well as yuri. The powers are also used sometimes to assist fan service, episode one demonstrates this with body swapping but there are more uses with the other powers. It never gets egregious, but it could be depending on your tolerance.The characters are fun. Overall there isn\'t really a character that annoys me. Yamada is funny, Shiraishi is quiet but her replies can add to the comedy as well. Miyamura is a bro and is also really funny when paired with Yamada, and Ito is quirky also well as equally willing to do the silly things Miyamura does most of the time. Oh, and Kentarou is there too. The other witches/characters as they are discovered usually become side characters who are brought back for comedy or plot progression (with the exception of one or two). None of them are shallow either. They aren\'t super deep, they aren\'t super impressive feats that will impact you for life, but they aren\'t flat either. Nene and Meiko, the charm and telepathy witch, don\'t get their story told (Nene does, but not in the anime). Despite that though, you can figure it out by looking at their witch powers. That is something I can appreciate about this anime: that you can guess what kind of past/personality/other a person has simply by knowing their witch power.The art, music, and sound is all good as well. The opening and ending songs still have people like me to this day feeling nostalgic (mostly Kuchizuke Diamond though). The voice acting is well done, both sub and dub. The dub actually makes things more funny personally, the voices for the characters are very expressive and I love them to death. The music in the actual show is kind of cheesy sometimes and makes me wanna laugh (rock when Yamada gets serious), but it is also good.The comedy in the show isn\'t the typical ""you\'ve seen my body and therefore I will slap you"" type formula, though there is a bit of that. The show managed to actually make me laugh and chuckle several times, and as I said before, the performances of the voice actors really help out with that. The romance is also solid; however, this anime is also technically a harem. Harem is a genre a lot of people don\'t like primarily because of its formulaic story beats and how annoying the lack of progression is. Despite this though, this anime is pretty clear about the fact that Yamada and Shiraishi are going to get together, so even though it\'s *technically* a harem, by the end it is clear what relationship will develop.Overall this story is one that I have and will continue to enjoy for many years, something I have watched many times, and is well put together. While there could have been more mystery elements, the show has, and will continue to be, one of my favorites. bodies.

I\'m not positive what makes a show stand out in the beginning, however I do know what immediately turns me away. Fortunately, there\'s enough here to watch and find entertaining. I have an unfortunate tendency to try and see deeper than some stories go, it\'s honestly why I appreciate anime so much (the Japanese are great with storytelling and world building). This tendency often gets me in trouble if the anime is only surface level deep though. It feels incomplete because of it\'s lack of depth, but maybe that was the...intention of the creators. That concept is my basic review for this show... ""Pleasant on the surface, but lacks any depth"".The show itself is pretty unique in its conceptualization, but this isn\'t uncommon for anime. It seems more rare to come across a completely unoriginal idea if I think about it. Trying to stay out of spoiler territory, Yamada Kun and Seven Witches obviously follows Yamada Kun, go figure, as he tries to start fresh in a new school. Unfortunately for him, the new name he attempts to make for himself is sullied fairly quickly and his moniker from his old school, ""Thug""/""Hoodlum"", is quickly forced upon him again, at no relative fault of his own. To hurry this summary, he ends up having a supernatural experience with a girl named Shiraishi/Urara and they begin to bond on this basis, which is body swapping (he experiences her life, and she his...you get the picture...like Freaky Friday but with classmates). It gets a little deeper, but don\'t hold your breath for anything too wild. Honestly, with the existence of ""powers"" and ""witches"", I expected bigger reactions from the classmates, but they all treat it as if magic is commonplace in this world. Oh well, at least it skips any potential exposition with characters I couldn\'t care less about.Now it\'s not as if the characters themselves are anything particularly different from something else you\'ve seen, but the cast is cohesive in it\'s own way. As I mentioned, there\'s some kind of unspoken understanding of the powers previously mentioned, since no one is freaking out they\'ve swapped bodies or have seen the future. Again, this is a little strange, yet I appreciate not having the powers and the existence of powers explained to me every time a new character enters the picture. I suppose since all characters are equally strong, or weak, in their own way, I didn\'t really get attached to anyone in particular. None of them stand out from each other, except for Yamada maybe. I found myself laughing on occasion and also had particular couples I was rooting for, so they weren\'t too ""blah"" I suppose, but that\'s not an endorsement either.To reiterate from my opening paragraph, this show is pretty basic in it\'s design. The show never promises an in depth take at any point, yet I always found myself wanting something more. Additionally, there isn\'t much of a backstory...I still have no clue where the powers actually came from, or to which host they\'ll be attached and for what reason. There are quite a few missing pieces if you\'re not surface level viewing. With that said, I still liked what I saw. Characters are humorous in their own way and have enough of a personality to know what makes them different than the others, but that\'s about it. Oh and Yamada and Urara are cute together at the very least.Toward the end, and here\'s where I go into spoiler territory, I actually began getting excited for the ending set piece that was being built. At several points though, we the audience are told to just have faith in Yamada and hope for the best. I thought there might be larger stakes toward the end, but, to my dismay, the ending falls flat due to the lack of a serious threat and the inexistence of consequences. The largest disappointment being how anticlimactic the ending actually was. Sure it was sweet at times, and has a happy ending, but too much was put in that didn\'t need to be and little actually happened by the end... two episodes could have made one, or previous episodes could\'ve been forfeited for a better ending. Basically, everyone, including the ""antagonists"" all fall in line and it just ends there. I just felt it was too easy to truly be a victory in the story writing sense.When Yamada is forgotten by all his friends and classmates toward the end, I sat up in my seat hoping for it to be resolved with a fulfilling reunion. I became intrigued with the concept since being forgotten by everyone you care about is one of the worst things that could happen to a person. No one wants their friends or love interest to forget their shared events that brought them closer. I really felt sorry for Yamada. Even though my wish came true and everything works out, there didn\'t truly feel like there was any stake or potential loss. Yes the story hints at the recent events being a big deal, but it never actually felt like it. With Yamada\'s confident happy go lucky attitude toward the whole memory loss arc, his relationship with Urara never actually felt ""in danger"", and some of his friends regain their memories fairly quickly. I\'m happy with what happens, I\'m just not happy how they got there.When the student body and his friends regain their memories, there was a glimmer of hope that the reunion would be worth the wait and emotional. Unfortunately it\'s played out as a joke and little time is allocated for the audience to understand what kind of pain Yamada was actually feeling. This could\'ve been a heartbreaking scene where the friends and lover are finally reunited, while just barely making it out with everything intact as it was. instead we get a basic ""I knew it would all work out"" with a brief cut to a celebration of their victory. Similarly so, little time is allocated to Yamada\'s and Urara\'s relationship. It\'s more or less just established and it feels like a weak payout. What a waste of a potential powerful and emotional moment where two lovers come together after being separated by time, memories, and supernatural abilities. At least they end up together....A few small qualms I had were with some plot devices for the sake of providing reason, or just to move the story forward. It\'s revealed another character has fallen for Yamada, but she selflessly pushes her feelings aside to appease the one she loves and because she knows it\'s pointless since he\'s already in love with Urara. I just don\'t understand why this was included, it made zero difference in the story and served no purpose, nor did it provide any benefit. Another issue was with the Student Council President and his forgotten memory. It\'s never revealed as to why the President lost his memories in the first place, considering he\'s so close with the witch that has the ability to erase memories. What reason did she have to attack him and why are they now friends? This leads me to his lover, Miyamura\'s sister Leona. I see they have regained their memories and appear to be together again, but for some reason little to no time is provided to that. This is again a missed opportunity with two lovers separated by time, memories, and supernatural abilities. It could\'ve been such a heartwarming scene of the two of them finally coming together and hurrying to regain the time they lost. And of course, it\'s played out for laughs instead and is brushed over in a matter of seconds. The build up was too beautiful for such a lame payoff.  Lastly, Yamada ultimately wishes for the witch\'s powers to disappear altogether. I thought this was very presumptuous. Who is he to decide that the powers were overall a negative when he himself benefitted from the witch\'s powers existing, I mean he never would\'ve bonded with Urara had they not switched bodies to begin with. What if years later, another two students are in a similar situation? Is it only okay for Yamada and Urara to meet and bond on such a basis, yet others cannot? Couldn\'t they have used their powers or wish making abilities to benefit others somehow? It just irritated me that no thought or explanation was given on this.Overall this is a good casual watch, and the romances are cute enough to appreciate. Even though the ending was anticlimactic, I still was happy with how everything turned out. There are already too many emotional anime out there where someone inevitably dies or is never able to be with their true love. So many in fact, that I try to praise any shows that end on a positive note. That being said, this show clearly has it\'s flaws, but I enjoyed my time with it either way, and am happy with the ending\'s basic concept. Just don\'t be expecting the writing of the century. intention of the creators. That concept is my basic review for this show...

It’s beautiful to say the least. I haven’t watched something this funny, interesting and complex yet simple since a long time. Let’s start.Story: 9/10Loved it. It has drama, a lot of really funny comedy, romance and a little bit of action too. I didn’t read the manga so I don’t know if it’s a bad or good adaption, but it’s still really enjoyable.The only bad thing, is (in my opinion) the overuse of one resource. I’ll explain it later in the...characters section.The story is a 9.5 for me.Art: 10/10This was released 5 YEARS AGO, yet the animation is delightful. It has such a good quality. It surprised me.10/10.Amazing.Sound:10/10Beautiful OP and ED. Background sounds are good, but the OP is why it deserves a 10/10. This is very subjective though.Character: 8/10The characters were good, but some of them felt shallow(such as Sarushima and Otsuka), and I gotta say that I don’t remember the name of the brown haired girl that is with Miyamura most of the time, even if she is one of the main secondary characters.Now, remember about the resource I mentioned on the story section? Yes? Well, that resource I’m talking about are: the flashbacks and the “I forgot to tell you something”.Don’t get me wrong, it didn’t destroy the story, but it made me feel like the author forgot to order where some things were supposed to be said.It slowed down the story by a small margin, but it was pretty noticeable for me.Still, I’ll give the characters an 8/10. Yamada was the best male character and Shiraishi the best female character, in my opinion.Enjoyment: 10/10Even with the flaws I talked about before, the perfect mix between the drama and the extremely funny comedy made me love it. And it was just 12 chapters.Final score: 9 (9.5)/10This is the type of anime that I wont forget and that I’ll rewatch in a few years, maybe 2 or 3 years. Hearing the OP makes me feel nostalgic even tho I just finished the anime 1 hour ago lol.I’m sad that I finished it, but happy that I watched it.Recommended:->Absolutely (not a master piece, but definitively a top tier anime)-Yes-Maybe-Meh-No-Complete trash-Bruh y u watching disSee you another time!

If you read my review please consider following me please!', ""Wanna know what, I wasn't expecting an anime with a premise as corny as this one to be as enjoyable as it was, but my goodness, I had a great time while watching it. Maybe it was the characters or the mechanism of the supernatural or the wonky premise itself somehow, but I was super engaged during every episode, no matter what new characters came in or where the plot went. There are a few bits of this anime that I noticed hurt the watching experience a bit, but if I were to go off and read this manga, I don't think any of those...issues would be a problem.Since we should talk about those problems, I'll start with the first one: if you consider the conflicts these characters are going through, they're mostly melodramatic. There's a bit of seriousness toward the end, but for the most part, the conflicts in this anime were issues that weren't any larger than typical school stuff. Because of the supernatural element of this anime, those things got played up a lot. Normally, I didn't notice because the setup for the anime was interesting enough that I found the hyped up conflict rather fun, but sometimes the melodrama took me out of the experience a bit.The second big problem with this anime is its lack of exposition, which I suppose can be attributed to a lack of pacing. From what I've seen, the manga picks up around chapter 90 after this season; by the highest estimate of how that compared to other manga adaptations, I believe that means Yamada-kun was adapting at least 25 chapters more than is typical in a 12 episode season. Trying to cram that much material into this amount of time to tell a more concise story meant sacrificing time to properly delve into the world that these characters reside in. There were many times I had to pause and take a moment to connect the various dots that kept popping up one after the other; it isn't impossible to do, but having to take a break to wrap my head around the mechanics of the supernatural and plot elements is a big demerit for this anime.Now, onto the good stuff, which I can never seem to talk about for that long, even if I loved the anime, like I love Yamada-kun. As I said, I had a great time watching this. The magic is what brings these characters together, and that created so many fun and interesting scenarios throughout the season. Actually, that's why the menial conflicts didn't make much of a difference to me while I was watching this anime--the ever-increasing list of supernatural combinations that Yamada and his friends can use to solve their issues never got boring. As ridiculous as this series sounds on paper--really, as ridiculous as it actually is--it's super easy to have a good time while watching it.This anime doesn't just do comedy, either--though, admittedly, the rest of the elements weren't as represented as they could have been. Still though, when dramatic moments did come up or romantic scenes were thrown in, I thought Yamada-kun handled them very well. In terms of tonal pacing (rather than plot pacing), this anime is better than some more popular anime I've seen. The humor isn't ever misplaced, it knows when to get serious, and it doesn't pull out corny emotions to try and push the viewer into caring when that hasn't been earned. I'm sure all of these good qualities are amplified in the manga (and, again, I acknowledge that the anime doesn't perfect these elements because it rushed too much), but as Yamada-kun is, it still had a good flow right to the end. For the pure enjoyment of it, I think the ranking for this anime is far too low, so I'd encourage everyone to see if it's something you find as funny or engaging as I did. issues would be a problem.Since we should talk about those problems, I'll start with the first one: if you consider the conflicts these characters are going through, they're mostly melodramatic. There's a bit of seriousness toward the end, but for the most part, the conflicts in this anime were issues that weren't any larger than typical school stuff. Because of the supernatural element of this anime, those things got played up a lot. Normally, I didn't notice because the setup for the anime was interesting enough that I found the hyped up conflict rather fun, but sometimes the melodrama took me out of the experience a bit.The second big problem with this anime is its lack of exposition, which I suppose can be attributed to a lack of pacing. From what I've seen, the manga picks up around chapter 90 after this season; by the highest estimate of how that compared to other manga adaptations, I believe that means Yamada-kun was adapting at least 25 chapters more than is typical in a 12 episode season. Trying to cram that much material into this amount of time to tell a more concise story meant sacrificing time to properly delve into the world that these characters reside in. There were many times I had to pause and take a moment to connect the various dots that kept popping up one after the other; it isn't impossible to do, but having to take a break to wrap my head around the mechanics of the supernatural and plot elements is a big demerit for this anime.Now, onto the good stuff, which I can never seem to talk about for that long, even if I loved the anime, like I love Yamada-kun. As I said, I had a great time watching this. The magic is what brings these characters together, and that created so many fun and interesting scenarios throughout the season. Actually, that's why the menial conflicts didn't make much of a difference to me while I was watching this anime--the ever-increasing list of supernatural combinations that Yamada and his friends can use to solve their issues never got boring. As ridiculous as this series sounds on paper--really, as ridiculous as it actually is--it's super easy to have a good time while watching it.This anime doesn't just do comedy, either--though, admittedly, the rest of the elements weren't as represented as they could have been.

You might think you know how that will turn out, but the series quickly changes into something else and what could have been a predictable story about two different people forced to live each others lives turns into a search for...others with strange powers and the friendships that are forged along the way. There is an element of romance in it, but it's played out in a way that feels more natural and part of the character development and story rather than what the anime is all about. It's not a deep or thought provoking story by any means, but it's also not predictable or assembled from a blueprint.- Characters & WritingThere are no real tropes here, which is refreshing, and each time you think one might pop up you're soon treated to a step away from archetypes and each character feels like an actual person. While the supernatural stuff in the story surely isn't very believable the characters are and their behaviour is more often than not quite reasonable. Everyone is likable and relatable and there are a lot of good vibes. The protagonist is a delinquent, but that's not his defining trait and both he and everyone else develop their characters throughout the series.- Style & PresentationAnimation and design is good and functional, music and sound is the same. You're not going to find anything here that stands out but it's well done and fits into the rest.- ConclusionPerhaps the best way to describe this is comfort food anime. It's short, sweet and well done in all aspects. It's not an explosion of flavor or anything exotic or spicy, but it ticks all the boxes for a solid experience. I can recommend this if you want to watch a romance anime with some supernatural stuff and some good character development.

Awwwwww, and this is me were me likey see MC guy kissing girls, so what we have is an anime/ manga or Novel were it has a gender bender/Yaoi/ Yuri element in it, but then again in it\'s overall theme it more like a bisexual thingy were it involves magic , romance, comedy and some action and it involves the misadventures of the MC guy where it started him meeting witch number 1   Shiraishi Urara, and from there it goes to romance,, his meeting with the Supernatural studies club and Student Council President wannabe Toranosuke Miyamura is were the yaoi thingy starts....ok so in some aspects the MC guy is actually kissing a girl inside a boy\'s body, but it still disgust me out that it still makes me wanna puke, anyways with such unique plot , the part where the MC guy\'s task to find the 7 witches was an adventure on itself and plus the fact stick to just one of them was a real climax. Usually I avoid any animes or mangas with a yaoi thingy, this was the only one were I make an exception. So basically the story (up) itself is indeed very good. On the art category (up) I just gave it a ""Good"" for the fanservice and that\'s that. Sound(up) well Ryuu Yamada\'s voice has a bit of a mature tone in it, I guess his VA\'s doesn\'t have what it takes to do a delinquent\'s voice,  Shiraishi\'s voice if she is  Shiraishi, does have a cute tone , but in a masculine tone she sounded like a MILF.  Odagiri\'s VA Eri Kitamura no longer have the youthful tone and  so as Leona Miyamura\'s VA Miyuki Sawashiro, but then again the sound category it still ""Fair"" enough for me. On the character category(up), ok so the MC guy is a campus bad boy, but then again I like the way that he was portrayed as a double standard where at one point he\'s very aggressive but soft hearten, the comic aspect about him  was that he can be horny at one point, but is a pussy when seeing a girl\'s pussy, frankly he more like a reverse Snow White, let\'s not forget that this anime\'s title is ""Yamada and the 7 witches"" in it\'s English, in fact nearly every character\'s in this anime are seemly based on a classic fairy tale \'Snow white and the Seven  Dwarfs, so lets go over some of them:Yamada Ryuu- Like I\'ve said he\'s a reverse version of ""Snow White"" and unlike the classic fairy tale , we don\'t see him eat an apple and goes to sleep.The 7 witches:Shiraishi Urara - is this anime/manga\'s version of Dopey, remember in the classic fairy tale, Dopey is the closes to Snow White and just like the said character, she\'s very much receptive of the MC Guy.Odagiri Nene- is this anime/manga\'s version of  Grumpy, and it\'s obvious that like Grumpy she too is always in a bad mood and a typical quintessential tsundere.Maria Sarushima- like Doc from the classic fairy tale, she to mixes up her words, but unlike the Doc, she on the other hand supplements it wit a couple of English words.Noa Takigawa- she is like Sleepy from the classic fairy tale, but pretty much different, since in the anime/ manga she more of a reluctant type who wants to get rid of the witches power that retaining it.Meiko Ootsuka- well pretty much she does share some characteristic with Bashful from the classic fairy tale, since they both shy and don\'t speak a lot.Mikoto Asuka-  well in this anime she can qualify as Sleepy from the classic fairy-tale, but I can\'t say the same in the manga, since there are indications that she speaks.Rika Saionji-  I don\'t know if she can qualify as  Sneezy, but then again just like in the classic fairy tale they both have something extraordinary.Others:Leona Miyamura- she is more like the magic mirror.Toranosuke Miyamura- he is the Prince (Gay) Charming, eeeewwww.Miyabi Itou and Kentarou Tsubaki_- I suppose that they\'re the Humtsman.Haruma Yamazaki and Shinichi Tamaki- Well I\'m guessing that they\'re this anime\'s evil witch.Well, I guess with such character\'s being pattern after the classic fairy tale, I guess it\'s all good.Enjoyment(up), well aside from the trouble that the MC guy\'s getting into trouble with the witches were it was funny, there is also the fanservice that I like and it\'s all good. But in it\'s overall, it really wasn\'t original, when such concept was copied from the classic fairly tale with a twist, also the term witches was more of an overused terminology were it doesn\'t really comply with character\'s portrayal since their magical abilities were too limited, it was kinda odd that author  Yoshikawa, Miki has to exaggerated something that was too limited with the character\'s portrayals, the title itself was seemly a patsy , the author should have title his creation as ""The 7 Troublesome Magic Users of Yamada"" or ""The 7 Magical Gurls of Yamada.""  so I\'m really gonna give this anime a 3.

There were too many inaccurate things going on that I just couldn\'t just let it brush past me easily.Story: 7 It could have been creative and hilarious with its villains, instead it was just overall very poorly explained. I liked the fact that they kept the dream theme connection to the SuperS season, but it just makes the movie in general more confusing in a number of matters. One being Pluto\'s unexplained appearance.Art: 10 The art was very colorful, and rich. It\'s very obvious the movie was mostly...centered on Mini Moon or Chibi Moon with the young kids singing the theme, along with the candy and fairy looking villains.Sound 6: I overall always love the music of Sailor Moon, but the music in this movie was just fruity and overall childish. Asides from the transformation music, the rest of the songs were forgettable.Character: Again, this movie is obviously centered on Mini Moon, but while she is useful in the SuperS season, she\'s just a powerless princess in this movie. Sailor Moon, her team and Tuxedo Mask\'s appearance in this movie was to serve as the heroes that Chibi Moon wasn\'t being. I really expected Chibi Moon to be more of a help with the movie being centered on kids and dreams.As for her sudden new ""friendship"" with the movie\'s new character. With her constant interest in someone else in the SuperS season, getting a new crush out of nowhere in this movie just made me gag. His background wasn\'t explained well enough either.Enjoyment: 8 Although this movie had me laughing at it\'s villains and certain other moments.

Thinking one couldn't possibly tire of this pink-haired loud-mouthed girl, here is an enitre movie dedicated to her.The story is weak compared to its two predecessors. The idea of fairies that kidnap children seems pretty contrived... in regards to forcing a plot that will center around Chibi-Usa. It introduces characters such as Peruru and Badiyanu who are hollow...in character and mere plot-triggers.The art quality is superb. As the third movie with a large budget, animators can afford to try new and more complicated angles, which may bother some people as the shots can be considered a little too ambitious.The soundtrack is lacking when compared to the S or R movie. Badiyanu's persistent laughter is very irritating, moreso than what is usual for the Evil Villianess character-type. And she laughs so often you want to shoot yourself. The theme song &quot;Morning Moon&quot; is introduced and it is a light and fitting song, a great addition to the other movies' ending themes.There is virtually no Character Development.

A ton of little themes continued on from the associated season, especially in regards to what it truly means to ""grow up"", all tied together with this clash between one\'s dreams for what an ideal existence is and the reality of those compromises that come with life. That dream sequence near...the end was especially great because of that, combined with the overwhelming fairy tale imagery creating this utterly cloying atmosphere that perfectly played off the antagonists. The space lesbians also make a return here, so it\'s awesome based on that fact alone. the end was especially great because of that, combined with the overwhelming fairy tale imagery creating this utterly cloying atmosphere that perfectly played off the antagonists. The space lesbians also make a return here, so it\'s awesome based on that fact alone.', 'Even though this movie wasn\'t terrible, I find it to be an unnecessary inclusion to the Sailor Moon franchise. Looking at the release date, it\'s almost as if the employees at Toei Animation were like: ""Oh shoot! We almost forgot to make a movie for this season! Uh... let\'s make it dream themed just like the regular show! We got to get it done before Christmas Eve!""Putting my wacky theory on the movie\'s making aside, I do have to first address the obvious issue. Sailor Moon: Dream Adventure and its movie clearly focused way too much on Chibiusa. I don\'t hate this character. She was...introduced in the Black Moon Arc, so it made sense for her to get attention and her friendship with Hotaru during the Infinity Arc was so wholesome. Don\'t you think that\'s enough spotlight time for her? I get that Pegasus chose Chibiusa\'s dream mirror to hide in from the Dead Moon Circus, but they could\'ve limited her time to just her relationship with him. Seriously, I got mad seeing her get between Usagi and Mamoru over and over during the course of the Dream Arc. It was okay in the Black Moon Arc because it was yet to be revealed that she\'s their daughter, so there\'s literally no excuse to repeat this style of filler ever. And yes, I still refuse to call the fourth season its official name.This movie\'s plot does something different with the dream theme. The evil Queen Badiane plans to create a Black Dream Hole that will swallow the Earth and trap everybody inside Dream Coffins where they will all sleep for eternity. First, she will need to gather ""sugar energy"" from human children to power up the Black Dream Hole, so she sends her fairy minions Poupelin, Banane, and Orangeat to lure children with a melody and trap them inside Dream Coffins. Meanwhile, Usagi and her friends are baking cookies where Usagi makes cookies that look perfect, but taste terrible while Chibiusa\'s cookies are the complete opposite. The latter decides to give her cookies to Mamoru (Of course!), but she meets and befriends a boy named Perle and ends up giving her cookies to him.At night, Badiane\'s minions arrive to lure more children. This time, Chibiusa also falls for the melody\'s magic. Usagi and her friends noticed and Usagi was able to get Chibiusa back to her senses by span- oh wait a minute... people from Europe might be reading this, so I shouldn\'t use that word. Usagi was able to get Chibiusa back to her senses by slapping her rear end. Everybody transforms and they try to fight Poupelin. In the confusion, Perle appears begging his brother Poupelin to not go along with Badiane\'s plans. Having enjoyed his experiences on Earth and his friendship with Chibiusa, Perle has decided to betray Badiane. This causes Badiane to be interested in Chibiusa and orders Poupelin to seize her. From here, the Sailor Soldiers have to go rescue Chibiusa... AGAIN.This is clearly a case of lack of originality. For starters, the main antagonist is an evil queen, as if the series didn\'t have enough of those. I already ranted about the spotlight being given to Chibiusa, but there is more about her I need to point out. In the main season, she interacted with Helios a lot to the point he became her first real crush. Here in the movie, she also falls in love with a male character who is also up against the villain. Do you see the problem with the Sailor Moon: Dream Adventure - The Movie yet? Sure, the villains here are not affiliated with the Dead Moon Circus, but Toei Animation made them way too similar. On top of that, the fairies use airships to travel between Badiane\'s base and the Earth which is how the Dead Moon Circus arrive in Japan in the Sailor Moon manga.Now, I can forgive the Sailor Moon R movie for somewhat clashing with Usagi and Mamoru\'s childhood, but this movie pulls a move that basically proves that this movie is absolutely non-canon. Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, AND Sailor Pluto also join the battle. See how I put ""and"" in all capital letters? That\'s because near the end of Sailor Moon S, Sailor Pluto used Time Stop to save Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune from a helicopter explosion. When the spell ran out, she disappeared in the explosion and does not appear again until the final season where she retrieves the Baby Hotaru to help the Sailor Soldiers fight against the returning Queen Nehelenia. This movie clashes with this fact and because of it, we cannot pinpoint where it can possibly take place in. We can for the previous two movies: Sailor Moon R\'s movie happens after Usagi and Mamoru got back together and Sailor Moon S\'s movie happens right before Hotaru is revealed to be Sailor Saturn.One last gripe I have is how Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon defeat Queen Badiane. Sailor Chibi Moon gets her own Moon Kaleido Scope, which wasn\'t the case in the main season. Yes, she did get her own in the manga, but we\'re talking about the 1990s anime adaptation here. This clashes with how they fight Lemures. Sailor Chibi Moon would use the Crystal Carillon to summon Pegasus, who will use the Golden Crystal to power up Sailor Moon\'s Moon Kaleido Scope, so she can finish off the enemy. In fact, the issue I have with the Dream Arc is that this was required as the ONLY way to kill a Lemures. The Stars Arc has it too where only Sailor Moon\'s attack was the only method to defeat a Phage. I know she\'s usually the one to finish off an enemy, but in previous arcs there were rare instances that someone else other than Sailor Moon deals the finishing blow. Sailor Mars burned a Youma to a crisp in her introductory episode, the Inner Sailor Soldiers finished off some Cardians in early episodes of the Hell Tree Arc, Sailor Planet Attack was used on the final Droid, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune were the ones to kill the first Daimon, and Sailor Jupiter overpowers a Daimon later on in the Infinity Arc.So far, I\'ve been negative towards this movie. I must really hate it, do I? Well, I do have things I like about this movie. I really like the opening sequence where they show off the Inner Sailor Soldiers when they were younger. They\'re all cute scenes and I love Minako\'s the best where she pretends to be in a Wild West gun fight and lost. The cookie baking scene was fitting and resembles all the filler the anime is known for. I love the fact that Sailor Moon uses Moon Tiara Action showing that even when her powers are upgraded every season, she still does have access to older moves. The villains\' names are all French words. Badiane is French for Star Anise, Poupelin is a name of a pastry, and Banane and Orangeat are obviously based on fruits. Perle\'s name is also a French word, and it means Pearl. Finally, the ending song is good. I mean, all three movies have good ending songs. There\'s not much to say for openings as you can all guess, they all use Moonlight Legend. Voice acting for the main characters are the same as usual.This movie does have its own charm, but it does suffer from lack of originality and clashing with established facts from the regular seasons. Overall, it\'s a mixed bag just like its parent season. I\'d say 6/10 is the most fitting score for it. Seriously... how did we get this instead of an adaptation of Casablanca Memory? Oh well, if the Sailor Moon Crystal anime is going to do it, it will definitely be faithful to the manga version since it does take place somewhere in the middle of the Dark Kingdom arc as Dark Kingdom members appear in it.Also, apparently this movie was released with a short film called Ami\'s First Love that plays right before it. I\'ve seen it and I think it\'s just okay. I\'ll give it a 6 as well just because its contents are hardly relevant to the whole series. introduced in the Black Moon Arc, so it made sense for her to get attention and her friendship with Hotaru during the Infinity Arc was so wholesome.

Usagi was able to get Chibiusa back to her senses by slapping her rear end. Everybody transforms and they try to fight Poupelin. In the confusion, Perle appears begging his brother Poupelin to not go along with Badiane\'s plans. Having enjoyed his experiences on Earth and his friendship with Chibiusa, Perle has decided to betray Badiane. This causes Badiane to be interested in Chibiusa and orders Poupelin to seize her. From here, the Sailor Soldiers have to go rescue Chibiusa... AGAIN.This is clearly a case of lack of originality. For starters, the main antagonist is an evil queen, as if the series didn\'t have enough of those. I already ranted about the spotlight being given to Chibiusa, but there is more about her I need to point out. In the main season, she interacted with Helios a lot to the point he became her first real crush. Here in the movie, she also falls in love with a male character who is also up against the villain. Do you see the problem with the Sailor Moon: Dream Adventure - The Movie yet? Sure, the villains here are not affiliated with the Dead Moon Circus, but Toei Animation made them way too similar. On top of that, the fairies use airships to travel between Badiane\'s base and the Earth which is how the Dead Moon Circus arrive in Japan in the Sailor Moon manga.Now, I can forgive the Sailor Moon R movie for somewhat clashing with Usagi and Mamoru\'s childhood, but this movie pulls a move that basically proves that this movie is absolutely non-canon. Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, AND Sailor Pluto also join the battle. See how I put ""and"" in all capital letters? That\'s because near the end of Sailor Moon S, Sailor Pluto used Time Stop to save Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune from a helicopter explosion. When the spell ran out, she disappeared in the explosion and does not appear again until the final season where she retrieves the Baby Hotaru to help the Sailor Soldiers fight against the returning Queen Nehelenia. This movie clashes with this fact and because of it, we cannot pinpoint where it can possibly take place in. We can for the previous two movies: Sailor Moon R\'s movie happens after Usagi and Mamoru got back together and Sailor Moon S\'s movie happens right before Hotaru is revealed to be Sailor Saturn.One last gripe I have is how Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon defeat Queen Badiane. Sailor Chibi Moon gets her own Moon Kaleido Scope, which wasn\'t the case in the main season. Yes, she did get her own in the manga, but we\'re talking about the 1990s anime adaptation here. This clashes with how they fight Lemures. Sailor Chibi Moon would use the Crystal Carillon to summon Pegasus, who will use the Golden Crystal to power up Sailor Moon\'s Moon Kaleido Scope, so she can finish off the enemy. In fact, the issue I have with the Dream Arc is that this was required as the ONLY way to kill a Lemures. The Stars Arc has it too where only Sailor Moon\'s attack was the only method to defeat a Phage. I know she\'s usually the one to finish off an enemy, but in previous arcs there were rare instances that someone else other than Sailor Moon deals the finishing blow. Sailor Mars burned a Youma to a crisp in her introductory episode, the Inner Sailor Soldiers finished off some Cardians in early episodes of the Hell Tree Arc, Sailor Planet Attack was used on the final Droid, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune were the ones to kill the first Daimon, and Sailor Jupiter overpowers a Daimon later on in the Infinity Arc.So far, I\'ve been negative towards this movie. I must really hate it, do I? Well, I do have things I like about this movie. I really like the opening sequence where they show off the Inner Sailor Soldiers when they were younger. They\'re all cute scenes and I love Minako\'s the best where she pretends to be in a Wild West gun fight and lost. The cookie baking scene was fitting and resembles all the filler the anime is known for. I love the fact that Sailor Moon uses Moon Tiara Action showing that even when her powers are upgraded every season, she still does have access to older moves. The villains\' names are all French words. Badiane is French for Star Anise, Poupelin is a name of a pastry, and Banane and Orangeat are obviously based on fruits. Perle\'s name is also a French word, and it means Pearl. Finally, the ending song is good. I mean, all three movies have good ending songs. There\'s not much to say for openings as you can all guess, they all use Moonlight Legend. Voice acting for the main characters are the same as usual.This movie does have its own charm, but it does suffer from lack of originality and clashing with established facts from the regular seasons. Overall, it\'s a mixed bag just like its parent season. I\'d say 6/10 is the most fitting score for it. Seriously... how did we get this instead of an adaptation of Casablanca Memory? Oh well, if the Sailor Moon Crystal anime is going to do it, it will definitely be faithful to the manga version since it does take place somewhere in the middle of the Dark Kingdom arc as Dark Kingdom members appear in it.Also, apparently this movie was released with a short film called Ami\'s First Love that plays right before it. I\'ve seen it and I think it\'s just okay. I\'ll give it a 6 as well just because its contents are hardly relevant to the whole series.']"
Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha - Sakura no Hana no Mankai no Shita,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4182/Darker_than_Black__Kuro_no_Keiyakusha_-_Sakura_no_Hana_no_Mankai_no_Shita,"[""Diving straight into the review.Story: If I was to rate this OVA just from its own story, I would give it 2 because of its simplicity. But don't forget that you need at least 14 episode of background information from the normal DTB (best viewed after some time has passed after you finish DTB, good for some quick laughs.) This OVA is more of a side story to the original Darker than BLACK. A contractor was killed and supposedly his corpse or his belongings are hidden under the sakura tree. Centering around Mayu Otsuka, this provides a good deal of laugh and makes you remember...those good ol' times with DTB.8/10Art: Excellent art, neatly done and no details were missed. Everyone is well drawn and the background always mean something, they don't just stand there. On a side note, I really like how they draw the eyes (especially Yin's.) The same quality as the original DTB, maybe even better. Although I found it strange that there was no blood in the perverted contractor scene, it's not like some other anime that the blood is black and disappears in the very next scene.10/10Sound: I always liked the opening, and the fact that they didn't replace it with something irrelevant or annoying is just a plus. I like how they play with the background sounds, but it didn't feel really special to me. Good quality music, able to set the mood, and doesn't stand out, so it's good.8/10Characters: A pack of unique characters always does the job in here. Although nothing (except for some doujin-love) is explained about characters, you should've watched the anime before going to this, so no problem with that. SPOILER: I find it rather sad how that love scene was lost because of that so-called cure of allergy.END SPOILER10/10Enjoyment: Like I said before, this was a good way for quick laugh. Contractors don't dream and aren't allergic to pollen! I really had some great time watching this OVA. I'm kind of relieved that this OVA didn't contain any relation to the actual progress of the plot. I seem to like the side-stories of the action anime that contain a good amount of laugh.10/10Overall: For all of us who have missed DTB, we got what we deserved. An OVA that is just like another episode of DTB, with some comedy aspect in it. It's just like the feeling that I got from Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid OVA. When you miss a serious anime, it's best to remember it with it's funny moments. It's better for you to watch a comedy-based episode rather than a serious one.

Basilisk: Kouga Ninpou Chou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/67/Basilisk__Kouga_Ninpou_Chou,"[""I can actually make a 3 word summary for this anime. It would go like this : KILL, KILL, KILL.Heartless killing, endless dying. That pretty much made up the story. Almost every character was just blood thirsty, all except this anime&rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet, aka Gennosuke and Oboro. It&rsquo;s another story of forbidden love, I suppose. The forbidden love was a foot note for me &ndash; I was more engrossed by the fight scenes and the dramatic deaths of the ninjas.The concept was actually new to me, but I was able to understand most of it. I was familiar with Samurai &ndash; themed anime, but...I have never watched a serious shinobi anime like this one (that&rsquo;s right &ndash; Flame of Recca doesn&rsquo;t count). I&rsquo;m not sure what separates the two, but from what I notice, Ninjas are less moral and are more likely into killing, that&rsquo;s why the Iga and Kouga ninjas were chosen to fight it out with each other to come up with the decision on who will succeed the third shogun. I am not sure whether or not this really happened (I don&rsquo;t think so) but there were a lot of historical references that were explained (thank God!). It's another opportunity to learn about Japanese culture and history!So the characters ended up killing each other in the way they knew how &ndash; using their different techniques of course. They all had unique techniques, from super sticky phlegm to blood sucking skin to deadly glances. These techniques gave spice to the already violent carnage.Like their techniques, their respective practitioners were equally impressive and different (Although the girls looked alike, and Koshirou and Yashamaru as well). I was sad that some were only shown for a short time, because their personalities and character made it seem like they were going to stick around longer.I have to commend the voice acting for this one. Even though I&rsquo;m not that fluent in Japanese, I know well enough Japanese slang to tell that the language they&rsquo;re using was the one used in that era. They seem to say &ldquo;Gozaimasu&rdquo; a lot. Generally, the seiyus brought out the personalities of their respective characters, and that&rsquo;s always a good thing.The drawing style was pretty good, but I found that it can be a bit exaggerated sometimes. Body proportions were kinda weird. Everyone and everything seemed to be big. The women had huge, nipple-less chests (Found out from all the naked girl fight scenes). The men had overly large frames, but they are ninjas so I&rsquo;m not sure about that. The wrinkles on the elders were a bit too extreme. They were kind with Danjou, but poor Ogen. She was so beautiful in her youth and when she got old they made her look REALLY old. There were a lot of hair too - everyone just seemed so hairy. The landscapes and backgrounds were nicely drawn though, and I did detect a hint of CG just to compliment some scenes. I was kinda ticked that a lot of the scenes were in the dark, which made it hard for me to tell what was happening. Oh well, they didn&rsquo;t have light then anyway. When the scenes were during the daytime, you could tell the colors were done nicely and complimented each other instead of clashing with each other.I noticed there was a great variety of BGM &ndash; most of them were gloomy though. It did fit the series well, but that&rsquo;s about it. They didn&rsquo;t heighten the mood of the scene or anything like that. The opening theme singer&rsquo;s voice (which is actually Oboro&rsquo;s seiyu) sounded a bit operatic, so I didn&rsquo;t like the opening theme that much. I liked both the ending songs though, they seemed more current compared to the opening theme. Anyway, all in all the music fit the mood of the anime.Again I was hesitant with this one &ndash; Didn&rsquo;t really want to watch it at first since I thought it was going to be too serious, but it ended up to be very exciting and likable. Let&rsquo;s not forget the violence and gore either, It may seem like I like shojo more, but I actually love violent series just as much.

Don't let the simple plot fool you though, there is a forbidden love story thrown into the mix aswell, and that is pulled off well. The best way to describe this would be a ultra-violent Romeo and Juliet sort of story. I enjoyed the story very much, but it had it's flaws. Many of the characters that appear only last for a few episodes, and I felt that they could have been kept along just a bit longer. But, after all, the main premise of this anime is two ninja...clans killing each other, so I'm not really that upset.Art: (10/10) - OutstandingThis is some of the best art I have ever seen in Anime, period. I am not exaggerating one bit. Even if you don't like the plot, the sound, or the characters, you should watch this Anime just for the art. If I could rate the art eleven out of ten, I would. Simply epic art. Much detail is put into everything that you see. The backgrounds are rich and colorful, but not too colorful, and seem to pop out of the screen at you. The characters are well designed, and convincing. Even some of the CGI, although it is rarely used, is well done. The only bad point I would give the art would be that some of the characters were designed rather oddly, with massive deformations which takes away from the otherwise blatant realism of this Anime.Sound: 9/10 - GreatThere really isn't much to say about the sound. I watched this series dubbed for the first five episodes then switched over to subtitles. The dub is well done, but it is very strange watching Ninja's in seventeenth century Japan speaking English. The subtitles are well done, but they were a tad bit small for my taste, although I do have rather bad vision. The one bad point about the sound is that a lot of the characters that are voiced are given very unrealistic voices, and it is hard to see a character in real life speaking that way. Also, some of the sound effects are a bit overdone.Character: 8/10 - Very GoodThe characters aren't anything special in themselves, but a good amount of character development is done. As said earlier, the two main characters resemble Romeo and Juliet, in a forbidden love scenario. A complaint I have about the characters is also as mentioned before in the art section -- many of them are massively deformed with huge tumors and the like. I am not sure if they meant to do this to show that they had no modern medicine, but some of the deformations are so over the top that they would be almost impossible in real life unless the character was suffering from a severe case of elephantiasis. Also, some of the characters are killed off way too soon, and I feel that they could have had use in the plot.Enjoyment - 10/10 - OutstandingI watched this show in a matter of three days, which is pretty good if you ask me. This series if very, very enjoyable, one of the best around. If you have some spare time, I would recommend putting aside a weekend and marathoning it with some friends. This anime has a rather good re watch value also.Overall: 9/10 - GreatThis is a very good anime series, and despite some of it's flaws, is a must see for any fan. I would say that about 95% of the people who watch this will like it. I would say that this series is appropriate for children over the age of fifteen, because it does include violence, scenes of rape, nudity, blood, and mildly suggestive themes. Main Verdict - Buy, rent, or download this anime -- it is great! clans killing each other, so I'm not really that upset.Art: (10/10) - OutstandingThis is some of the best art I have ever seen in Anime, period.

I would say that this series is appropriate for children over the age of fifteen, because it does include violence, scenes of rape, nudity, blood, and mildly suggestive themes. Main Verdict - Buy, rent, or download this anime -- it is great!"", ""Oh my word, this has got to be the greatest ninja/shinobi anime ever made.It is romantic, gory, action-packed, dramatic, deep and beautiful in every way.The story is a revamp of the old Kouga/Iga ninja conflict. It is interesting and involving. The story is a historical piece, but it becomes so much more because it reminds you that the people involved were PEOPLE, who had lives and loves and everything in-between. The plot follows a bloody death match; there's execution-style story-telling, and it reels you in from the first episode to the chilling final one.The art was excellent. Couldn't do any better. It...has a unique style, the colour pallet  was amazing, the background art was gorgeous and the animation was astounding (excellent fight scenes).The characters were deep and three-dimensional. There are more than 10 people you will see who has the focus on the anime on them, but each is interesting and has a backstory to them so it helps us understand who they are.If you think Naruto is the greatest ninja anime ever, this isn't for you, because you wouldn't know quality if it stuck you in the eye with a kunai. There was nothing unfabulous about this anime, so do watch it. has a unique style, the colour pallet  was amazing, the background art was gorgeous and the animation was astounding (excellent fight scenes).The characters were deep and three-dimensional.

Firstly, it probably had the most beautiful and well designed graphics in all the animes i have watched. The characters are well drawn, and the backgrounds and sceneries are simply breathtaking. It is most certainly a breath of fresh air from lesser animes with low quality graphics.Secondly, Basilisk is extremely fast paced. Expect to see lots of action in every episode, and at least one person dying in each episode. This is widely in contrast with slow paced but highly raved about anime like Naruto. Furthermore, the fight scenes are well paced and thought out. It is anyone's guess who gets...to fight who next, keeping one in much suspense throughout the show.Also, this anime is not just about killing and fighting and killing and fighting. Because, underneath these violence belies the main crux of the story, which is the tragic love between both main characters of the opposing clans which spanned two generations. The final episode is a fitting albeit predictable (to most) ending to the story, and is simply touching. Expect to shed more than a few buckets of tears, if you are the emotional sort.Moreover, the reminiscence episode in the middle of the series brings in a tone of bittersweet happiness of the characters' past, which showed that the beginning of an acceptance of each clan before the killings started.Lastly, i have to express my surprise that this series is not more well known than it is. And has grown to become one of my favorite animes. Highly recommended to all. to fight who next, keeping one in much suspense throughout the show.Also, this anime is not just about killing and fighting and killing and fighting.

Highly recommended to all."", ""* CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS*I don't normally write reviews but i just finished this anime and now i only wish i could go back in time to warn myself to stay away from it. Let me say this, i don't doubt that many people enjoyed this very much and i am sure lots of people consider this to be a great anime. So i am writing this review for people like me, people that aren't soulless emotionless individuals who enjoy watching the suffering of others. After reading most of the reviews for this i was expecting to see an anime with a lot of good ninja...fights some tragedy and some romance. So i guess in that sense i was not disappointed. but there is a limit to how much tragedy i can see in an anime and still enjoy it. I guess i should have been tipped off when i read people comparing this to Romeo and Juliet, but i went ahead and watched it anyway, now i know better.Story: There may be reasons i don't like this anime but i am not here to simply trash it. So i will try to be objective here. I give the story an 8, aside from being thoroughly depressing the story was pretty good. It wasn't entirely unique but all in all they did a good job telling it. There was the initial romance which i enjoyed, the fighting was always intense and since you didn't know what everyones abilities were right from the start it kept you guessing at what was going to happen in each fight, and there were also some twists in it that i didn't see coming initially.Art: I gave the art an 8, it was good but like with the story not outstanding. My biggest problem here would have to with some of the character designs. The characters in this really varied in realism, almost like they took too different shows and combined them. One being more realistic and the other being more science fiction horror. A lot of the characters looked normal even more realist then other anime. But then you have characters that looked entirely inhuman, had grotesque deformities, or ridiculous abilities.Sound: Again i gave this an 8, it wasn't cluttered with a lot of unnecessary background noise or random sound effects and it did a good job staying consistent with what was going on in the anime.Character: The characters i gave a 6. this score is lower mainly because most of the characters die before you even really get to know them. Then they try to remedy this by having entire episodes devoted to these characters, in the form of flashbacks and such, after they have already died. I also would have liked more depth into Oboro and Gennosuke, but between all of the fighting and deception there isn't a lot of time for character growth.Enjoyment: There isn't a lot i can say here without revealing any spoilers, but i basically gave this a 1 because i didn't enjoy watching it at all. The fights were interesting but tragic and aside from Tenzen, who i was happy to see bite the big one, i never felt good watching these people die sad and tragic deaths. Then to top it all off, i am just going to say it this anime does not have a happy ending, and i am sorry but after 24 depressing episodes i would have liked to at least be able to walk away a little happy, or at least to have been glad that i watched the anime. Instead i was left thinking wow that was a waist time, hell if all i wanted was to feel like crap i could of saved some time and watched the news or pulled my own finger nails out.Overall: I gave this a 2 basically because for me what it all boils down to is wether or not i enjoyed the anime. I have watched a lot of anime that have been bad in one or more of these categories, and as long as i went away feeling glad that i spent the time to watch something, i considered it a good anime. This anime wasn't lacking in any particular category, but i thoroughly did not enjoy watching it so i consider this to be a failure of an anime. fights some tragedy and some romance.

Basilisk brings the viewers into a cycle of war between two powerful ninja clans. Throughout centuries, the Iga clan and the Kouga clan have known none other than animosity and vengeance towards each other. Amidst this purgatory, the head of Iga and the head of Kouga love each other and decided to end the centuries of conflict through the act of marriage.The story might sound familiar and you might have already predicted their vetoed aspiration to marry might not go smoothly, but Basilisk will still entertain you, not via its compelling...story, but the journey through its death valley and the flesh enriching characters walking on it.The highlight of the series is its character designs. The distinct physical appearances that match their unique fighting styles are visually pleasing. On the inside, their individual personalities and the way each character thinks and behaves are unexampled and unmistakably their own. People die mercilessly in Basilisk but none were discarded carelessly. It is clear, with much effort put into defining each of these characters; their deaths are as delineating as they were alive.“These are not samurais, they are ninjas, and they do not know honour.” A very harsh world is portrayed here. Behind the post of a ninja and their duties to their respective clans, their humanity and emotions surface between battles and through flashbacks. Each character is not just a chess piece to be manipulated at will. They fall in love; are fuelled by personal desires and self-esteem, the characters might not work under their clan jurisdiction in total faith. A lack of oversight from clan leaders might give rise to a costly mistake, for each individual will choose which choice to take themselves.The animation is great. The fighting is fluid but each move is profound and every contact is crisp both in visual and sound. The ninjas don’t wear bright orange jackets or have fancy haircuts that give them away like eyesore in the darkness. The art pallet in Basilisk is dark, gloomy and stays true to the hellish period with endless bloodshed when peace is an unobtainable luxury. The supernatural element added to the show makes attacks exciting and unpredictable. Many scenes are gory from decapitation to blood rivers and some rape scenes are present which need a pair of headphones if watching with other ears around. At times, it was irritating to not see clearly such fine animated choreography under a deservedly brighter spotlight.I watched this in English dubbed. It was pleasing to hear honourifics being spoken out loud comfortably. The voice actresses didn’t waver or fear screaming of pleasure in those sex scenes, and the males were never afraid to pronounce bizarre exclaims. However, the girls were too quiet in certain dialogue, but this is usual in English dubbed anime. Sound effects were good. Shout out to its latter ending soundtrack.Basilisk doesn’t cram fanservice but Gonzo certainly knows how to draw the female body parts, from lips to legs, in an erotic manner.

You have been warned. Do not read any further if you don't want to be spoiled.Basilisk has a simple plot. Two star crossed lovers with families that hate each other end up dying tragically. In spite of the simple concept it's capably done. The basic premise is that these two ninja clans, Koga and Iga, had a treaty that stopped them from killing each other for several years. This treaty is dissipated because the shogun is retiring and hasn't chosen a successor. He has two choices so the clan leaders...are asked to choose ten people each. They'll fight to the death to determine which of the two candidates will become the next shogun. This comes at a time when the clans are about to be unified by their next leaders, Gennosuke and Oboro, marrying. The fact that the clans start out in a truce and the tragedy comes from the truce being annulled and them allowing old hatreds to destroy their hope of peace rather than the two lovers not being able to get together is a nice change from the usual story and provides for some good tension. Tenzen makes for a legitimately creepy antagonist. The fact that he comes back to life whenever he dies makes him a significant threat and the fact that he attempts to rape several women and tortures Kagero makes him the kind of unapologetic git who you want to see die. The flashbacks are an effective way to help develop the characters, especially those who die early on. The only major problem with the story is that there's a plot hole. In the beginning Iga finds out that their clans are officially at war first. So they trick Gennosuke and Josuke, another Koga ninja, into visiting their village while five Iga ninja, Tenzen, Hotarubi, Nenki, Koshirou and Rousai, try to secretly kill as many of their opponents as possible. This is a good tactic, the problem is that they leave Gennosuke alive, in spite of secretly killing Josuke. The reason given is that Tenzen doesn't know what Gennosuke's ability is and wants to attack him with caution, but it's a weak explanation since Tenzen and his group attack several other ninja that they don't know the abilities of. They even sneak up to the Koga village where several ninja with unknown abilities are. So, they'll go to an area where there's a virtual army of enemy ninja but they won't execute a sneak attack on one solitary man who's surrounded by their people? That is idiotic and doesn't make any sense.Moving on to the characters. Most of them are pretty three dimensional and developed either through flashbacks or through the main narrative except for Josuke who's a perverted moron, Tenzen who's a complete sociopath and all of the female characters who fit simple tropes like the frail love interest, the woman defined entirely by her lover or the jealous girl. The character designs are varied, for the men, the women are all traditionally attractive with large breasts and full lips. The abilities are also interesting and range from being able to kill somebody by looking them in the eye, to stretching, to shape shifting to butterflies... Okay, the women have ridiculous abilities. Most of which are virtually useless from a practical standpoint. You have Hotarubi who can distract people with shiny butterflies. Akeginu who can slow people down but, for some reason, has to take off her top to do so, no that isn't a joke, Okoi who can drain someone's blood by entangling them with her body so that she touches their skin with as much of her skin as possible, I know that might seem useful but consider how unlikely you are to be able to do that during an actual fight, and Kagero, who can poison men with her breath when she's either having sex or aroused. We're told that it doesn't work on women, probably because they didn't want to introduce the possibility of yuri. I swear I'm not making that ability up either. You never see Ogen's ability since she dies in the first episode. Oboro doesn't actually have any powers. She can cancel out a person's ninja arts by looking at them, but it's made clear that that's just something she was born with rather than actually developing. They make a big deal about how Oboro tried to learn to fight but remained useless anyway. Okay, martial arts, throwing shuriken, and sword fighting don't work that way. These are all things that you learn through practice and dedication not through having some kind of inborn talent. But she's the frail love interest so she isn't allowed to be competent. All of this makes me think that Segawa Masaki is a misogynistic prickBasilisk earns a yuri factor of 1/10. All of the women are canonically straight and none of them get scenes that are even slightly suggestive with each other.The voice acting, at least in the Japanese version, is very well done. The art is incredible. The fight scenes are awesome, even though most of them end very quickly. My final rating for Basilisk is a 6.3. I considered giving it a 7  but the sheer level of misogyny is just so unpleasant that I couldn't do it. But if you can forgive the gross levels of misogyny it's worth watching once. are asked to choose ten people each.

It often symbolizes the cycle of rebirth, a cycle that constantly begins anew and never ends. Why am I referencing Ouroboros? I felt it was the only appropriate comparison to make with Basilisk, the story of hatred that is born anew every generation.Two rival Ninja Clans, the Kouga and the Iga, have been feuding for over 200 years and only 50 years ago, an anti-war pact was enacted to prevent any further bloodshed. No one remembers or cares to remember how the feud even started but in the...minds of both the Kouga and Iga, the reason doesn’t matter.  But now Gennosuke, young leader of the Kouga ninja, falls in love with the beautiful leader of the Iga, Oboro. Together, they hope they can end the longstanding feud between their two clans. However, the pact that prevented the clans from massacring one another just nullified. Will their love endure amidst the hatred and bloodshed that has plagued their clans for centuries?Basilisk is a show that will challenge your fortitude. The violence is visceral, and the story maintains a bleak tone throughout. Basilisk succeeds at showing hatred at its essence. Characters commit ghastly acts towards one another, throwing away any ounce of humanity they once had.  The story starts off relatively light in tone but gradually delves deeper murkiest parts of human depravity. Day after day, ninjas on both sides of the war are killed off like gnats in increasingly depraved ways. Ninjas on both sides are not afraid to use the vilest methods of torture and violence to make their enemies suffer. And each death not only puts a strain on their comrades, but also strains the relationship between Gennosuke and Oboro. The war causes a struggle between their hearts and minds as they ask themselves, “Am I able to kill the one I love?” They are stuck between their responsibilities as the leaders of their clans, and their romantic relationship. This dilemma makes the show much more engaging because it has a noticeable effect on both characters and makes it easier for the viewer to sympathize with them.Basilisk is, in part, an action show. However, the battles rely on wit and cunning as opposed to sheer brawn. The ninjas on both sides have a plethora of unique powers and abilities at their disposal and use them in interesting ways. Most of the battles are relatively quick but are very tense as it is hard to tell who will win or lose.Basilisk’s cast is quite expansive. It has a cast of over 20 characters with 10 major characters in each clan. Not every character gets development but in this story it isn’t necessary. Some characters die early on and as a result, we learn little about them and develop no attachment to them. But it is all purposeful because the deaths of these characters facilitate the development of other characters. Throughout the story, relationships between characters become increasingly complex due to their feelings towards one another becoming increasingly pronounced. The supporting characters themselves are all relatively simple in terms of depth but still memorable in their own right.The story centers on the romance between the main couple. Gennosuke is a stern, honorable ninja who will do what is necessary to preserve the peace and protect those closest to him. Oboro is a clumsy ninja who is inept at combat but has a strong will a maternal aura around her. And despite her being emotional and clumsy, she also has a strong will and will do anything to protect her loved ones. The contrast between these two characters creates for fantastic chemistry as the love they share feels real. The moments they spend together are heartfelt and intimate and add an extra layer of believability as they express their dreams and profess how much they care for on another.However, with all of Basilisk’s strong points there are undoubtedly a few weaknesses. I felt the world building wasn’t adequate. I felt the setting of feudal Japan needed to be fleshed out a bit more because there was a political subplot which was reintroduced several times in the story but not adequately expanded upon. This is a big issue considering politics played a pivotal role in the story. I would’ve liked two stories occurring at the same time, one dealing with politics and the other dealing with the ninja. I feel this is appropriate especially do the epic feel of the story. There is a lot of room for potential and it disappointed me to see it not taken advantage of. Another issue I had with the story deals with a particular character named Tenzen. The show tried to establish a backstory for him but it was done in such a muddled way that it was basically incomprehensible. When you consider that his motivation, backstory and origin of his unique ability were one of the major mysteries of the show, you would assume it would be handled more competently.Normally, I would give Basilisk a 7 but I am not going to. Why? Because it ended on an incredibly strong note that not only tied everything up, but it was also incredibly moving. The ending was handled with such precision and care that I couldn’t help but bump it up. It isn’t too often that show has such a phenomenal ending and I believe that deserves praise.Basilisk is a romantic tragedy that succeeds when it is at its darkest. It is unrelenting in its depiction of violence, perversion and brutality but it isn’t just cruel. At its heart, Basilisk is a tale of love and compassion that is being counterbalanced by hatred and animosity. By the end of the show, you will receive chills every time you read the words, “And so my beloved….please die.” minds of both the Kouga and Iga, the reason doesn’t matter.

This is a big issue considering politics played a pivotal role in the story. I would’ve liked two stories occurring at the same time, one dealing with politics and the other dealing with the ninja. I feel this is appropriate especially do the epic feel of the story. There is a lot of room for potential and it disappointed me to see it not taken advantage of. Another issue I had with the story deals with a particular character named Tenzen. The show tried to establish a backstory for him but it was done in such a muddled way that it was basically incomprehensible. When you consider that his motivation, backstory and origin of his unique ability were one of the major mysteries of the show, you would assume it would be handled more competently.Normally, I would give Basilisk a 7 but I am not going to. Why? Because it ended on an incredibly strong note that not only tied everything up, but it was also incredibly moving. The ending was handled with such precision and care that I couldn’t help but bump it up. It isn’t too often that show has such a phenomenal ending and I believe that deserves praise.Basilisk is a romantic tragedy that succeeds when it is at its darkest. It is unrelenting in its depiction of violence, perversion and brutality but it isn’t just cruel. At its heart, Basilisk is a tale of love and compassion that is being counterbalanced by hatred and animosity. By the end of the show, you will receive chills every time you read the words, “And so my beloved….please die.”', ""Right to the point: if you prefer either an uplifting ending or an ending that says the next season will be even better look elsewhere because most (not all) characters want to just kill.It's not a horrible series altogether but the journey is much better then the destination, not to speak too highly of the journey though.The action, animation, and character design are pretty good. However it's just not my personal taste to end a series with tragedy. If that's your thing though you'll likely enjoy this series.Also ninja fans should be delighted to hear that this series is pirate-free. "", ""I can't really think of anything to start off this review, so I'll just get right into what I think of Basilisk: Kouga Ninpou Chou.The show started off strong, with various characters being introduced with strange but interesting powers. Put in a Romeo and Juliet like love story in between two warring villages, and you have yourself Basilisk: Kouga Ninpou Chou.However, after everything was established, I quickly got disinterested with the whole story. This is due to almost all the characters having no depth or worthwhile personality attached to them. Many of them only had cool powers and an unexplained hatred for the other clan....This is one of the most crucial things to making a decent anime, and Basilisk gets it completely wrong. When characters start dying left and right, how am I supposed to feel bad for them if I barely know anything about them? A lot of them don't even have decent character relationships with one another.This leads to a story that gets increasingly repetitive, which ultimately reduces tension and increases predictability. If you ask me, a show that showcases two clans fighting to the death should create a good amount of tension to get you invested in what is being shown to you. I can't get invested into the story if all I am seeing are these meaningless characters getting killed. If Basilisk focused more on these various side characters, it would have been much better off.There are a few instances where the anime tries to make us care for these characters, sure, but many of them are not well-integrated into the story at all. Even these few backstories and flashbacks shown don't give us much to grieve upon with these characters, just a bunch of simple stuff that we have seen a million times and done better.The Romeo and Juliet storyline between Oboro and Gennosuke is handled decently enough. However, it's a Romeo and Juliet storyline, it pretty hard to make a bad Romeo and Juliet storyline considering how many times it has been done before. Hell, two years after this was released, Gonzo produced an actual Romeo and Juliet anime called Romeo x Juliet.Oboro herself is a pretty okay character. She has well justified reasons for her actions, and has a strong sense of compassion to make up for her lack of physical abilities. I don't favour Gennosuke as much though. He makes pretty confusing decisions, and other than that, he is a stoic character that doesn't talk much, which is pretty run of the mill if you ask me.I'll talk about one last character before I move on, and that is Yakushiji Tenzen. He is by far the best character in the anime. Talking about him in depth would bring about too many spoilers, but he is very interesting to say the least.The fight scenes in the anime are pretty entertaining to watch, and the animation holds up during these scenes. My problem with this is the amount and length of these scenes. Given the studio we are dealing with, this was probably the best course of action to have good looking fights but have them scattered around, but I guess I'm a little too greedy and would have liked just a little more. The artstyle is easy enough to look at, and the character designs were also well-done.As for sound, the only thing really worth mentioning is the OP, which is my favourite part of the show (which when you think about it, doesn't say much about the quality of Basilisk as a whole). I watched the show in sub, and the voice acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't up to par with many of the other things I have heard.Basilisk is a show that could have been so much more. I really only have one problem with it, which is the characters, but they are handled so poorly that it stems to many other parts of the show, including its story, making it a dis-interesting and borderline edgy mess. I get that the show was moreso trying to focus on the depravity of people when pushed into a situation such as this, but that message gets buried underneath the mountain of underdeveloped characters. I can't recommend this show to anyone really, but if it still piques your curiosity, maybe you will find that you like it a lot more than I did.

Incredible characters, incredible storyline and drama, with very intense moments. With that said what makes this anime so great? Its style is one thing, the show doesnt leave you a moment to breath, it immediately jumps into the conflict and pushes its viewers into the middle of a giant epic battle between two warring ninja clans.On one side is Genouske, the head Ninja of one clan and Oboro the head of the other...clan. The two love each other but now have both their clans in a battle with each other and no way of avoiding the inevitable clash.Basilisk is indeed my favorite Ninja anime of all time, for Naruto fans I will use both in comparison since many people know of Naruto. First of all basilisk gives the true real life sense of being a ninja. basilisk has fantasy like battles if you enjoy those,  but it primarily focuses on Ninja tactics of assassination and stealth. Naruto is more about a child looking to become the greatest(hmm pokemon? ).Every battle is eye popping violence with incredible animation and a very unique style of fighting. Even though its a Shonen, the show boasts a very strong romance story line which makes each episode that much better.If nothing else if you enjoy crazy fighting mixed with a very epic tale of two lovers, then you will really enjoy this show, basilisk is one of my favorite Animes and I recommend  you get your hands on it now if you wish to be blown away clan.

This conflict threatens to tear the whole of Japan apart if not settled soon. In order to settle this growning conflict it has been decided that the the peace agreement between the Iga and Kouga ninja clans be abolished in order to renew their ancient feud. Instead of this governmental dispute becoming a problem for the whole of Japan, a small scale war has been arranged. The ten top...ninja of each clan is to take part in this affair, and the clan to have the last shinobi breathing is the victor.The storyline plays out in this way. To begin the bloodshed, the heads of the clan (past lovers separated by trajedy and hatred) kill one another and the scene is set for the decimation of both clans. The Iga are able to intercept the news first, and kill the messenger of the Kouga clan. They take an early lead in the bloodshed, killing a number of Kouga members before Gennosuke and Oboro (the new clan heads and betrothed couple) are even informed. But when Gennosuke gets word not only is the union of the clans in shambles but the terrible power of his eyes is also revealed. Despite all this, he is a level headed man, yearning for peace. So he and the remanents of his people head out to confront Hittori Hanzo about the purpose of this conflict. The Iga (after Oboro binds her eyes which possess their own power) is led by the powerful and seemingly immortal Tenzen, whose goal is to stop them on their path. by the time both clans reach their destination there are only two members of each left fighting. And even in the last two episodes watchers are still left wondering not only which clan will be the victor, but even whether or not love has the power to blind the eyes of this ancient predjudice.I both loved and hated this anime. It was a simplistic story but brilliantly handled. Although the powers of the characters was a little far-fetched at times their development in the story was heart wrenching. This was one of those rare animes that get the watcher attached to every character, by inserting well-placed bits of character history and personality quirks; but at the same time does not lead to an anemic plot or boring fillers. I have to admit that i Cried over every death from Hotarubi until Gennosuke. I do not cry often but it was the product of brilliant story weaving, I am a sucker for good character development. The music of this anime was very good but it was missing a little bit of something, at one or two places the theme music for the characters and things did not fit as well as I would have liked. But, overall it was very appropriate for the time period and mood. This is a 10/10 for me. This is THE BEST ninja anime in a very long time; the pinnacle of this genre! The percentage of character development and fluff to fighting was perfectly balanced just enough to keep watchers on the edge of their seats at all times wanting more.

I also read all the glowing reviews about this show, so I gave it a go.Art- 3/10 Poor- The art style and character designs for several characters were so beautifully dramatic. They were probably the best things in this anime. If there there wasn\'t several characters that were freakishly deformed monstrosities and there wasn\'t so many close up shots of the nude curvy women (since the guys we...see nude are only the freakish characters), I would have given the art style a 8/10.Characters- 1/10 Pathetic - You don\'t get to learn much about the characters because there is so much death. Regardless, I didn\'t want to know about most of them considering how they were almost all ruthless killers.The bonds within each clan is hardly expressed and it seems fake when it is.Plot- 1/10 Pathetic -This show is much more violent than SNK. Not to mention there\'s very little lingering/remorse after a character dies. About 90% of it is violent, grotesque, and nightmarish killing/plotting and remaining 10%is about the star-crossed lovers who give the impression that they\'re actually bad actors pretending to be in love. I watched to the end because I thought there would be a bright ending for this show\'s Romeo and Juliet... *spoiler alert star* sadly they were just as dumb as Romeo and Juliet *spoiler alert end*. Some characters purposefully get into fights they\'re obviously not going to win by any means, which is frustrating. There was a ""purpose"" to the all the murders, but it seemed like blood shed for absolutely no reason other than blood lust. Also, I\'m not a fan of rape and attempted rape in shows.Music & Voice Acting- 4/10 Decent- Nothing really stood out to me, other than the fact that the voice actors and characters matched pretty well. The background music was okay.Overall enjoyment- 1/10 Pathetic- I didn\'t enjoy it at all. If someone wanted to torture me with a show, this is is the show they would use. I loathe for myself for ever watching this gruesome and pointless show.

However, the peace treaty that kept the peace was broken and they were ordered by the emperor to kill each other and the story focuses on the battles that take place and the characters in it.The story is a very dark and depressing story. That doesn't mean that it isn't good, in fact i thought it was a very meaningful show but it is quite mature.Those who are not fans of dark shows and prefer something more lighthearted, please avoid...this. Other than that the action in this show was fantastic as displayed through the numerous battles that take place. The romance occurs on a more suttle level but helps to add to the immense drama that unfolds throughout the anime. The story is very different from most animes because of the realism that is emphasized(WARNING:death is common in this show), it is filled with suspense and is unpredictable, definitely worth watching if you don't mind the gore and dark themes present. Another word of caution is that the story can be complicated and may take a while to understand so do give it some patience when watching the show.The art was quite good. Since the story takes place in the Tokugawa era, the setting and scenery is very different from your modern day anime. The characters are drawn in a different yet eye-catching manner with dark settings to enhance the atmosphere. Some may complain that the darkness in the setting acts in contradiction and may make it harder to see what's going on so do expect this at some parts. Otherwise the blood and gore may not be so appeasing to the eyes but nonetheless provide realism to the story.The sound was probably the worst area in the show. The voice actors were fairly ok. But other than that not much was done in the sound department. Only a little background music to enhance the depressing and eerie atmosphere from time to time.Characters might i say were the best part of this show. Each characters was given some depth and we get to see the story from these characters perspectives from tim to time not just the main characters' perspective. Each character is elaborated on to show their reasons for their actions and it also serves to create more drama in the show. Many meaningful and deep messages are embedded in the thoughts and actions of the characters. And from the sheer number fo characters that were present in the show i must say that the producers did a fairly good job.I enjoyed he fighting scenes in the show due to its more unique and lifelike styles, unlike the shonen styles. The blood(gore) makes the battles more real and life-threatening and therefore builds up the suspense that makes the audience hunger for more at the end of each episode(WARNING:can be addictive). Comedy is evidently absent in this dark and dramatic anime. Thus i found the story interesting and meaningful more than enjoyable in the sense of fun.In conclusion, This show is meant for a mature audience due to the violence gore and partial nudity. Besides that the dark tones make it unpleasant to the lighthearted but otherwise bring out a meaningful and engaging story. If you are looking for some action and drama then this anime may be worth trying, but be aware that it is complex and requires patient and deep understanding.And for those who do enjoy the anime, there is also a movie produced based on this story.

Their skills are all unpredictable and you wont know all the skills till the end. there isnt much things that are bad but if you have to say one it would be my favourite character died to early. ', ""First let me wipe up my tears.Basilisk: The Kouga Ninja Scrolls is beautiful and heartbreaking.The story can only be described as a much more bloody and violent Romeo and Juliet with ninjas instead. The main characters, Gennosuke and Oboro are deeply in love, but each belongs to a different clan. The Kouga and the Iga. The Kouga and Iga have been warring for more than 400 years and the hate between the two is stifling. The only thing that keeps these two clans from literally ripping each others throats out, is the no-hostilities act. But peace is only a fairy tale. This act...is nullified upon the decision that a shogun must be picked. And the winning clan, each who supports one future shogun, must fight to the death until only one clan survives. Thus begins a journey of no small amount of bloodshed.If you think this is just another prettied up Romeo and Juliet you should prepare yourself. Basilisk is full of violence and blood. Each of the ten members picked from each clan must fight each other. But these battles are heavy and brutal. In each episode someone dies and it is very quick. You meet the 20 people, and then you watch them battle to the death. This story is definitely not for anyone under 14-15 at the least. It is filled with blood, extreme violence, nudity, rape, and sexual themes. My downside with the characters is that you see only some of them once and them bam. Their dead. I was disappointed that a little more history wasn't put into some of the characters. I really wanted to see more of the ones that die early on in the series. But the series was fast paced and it worked well. I was never disappointed with an episode because each one was filled with something new or another battle. And most if not all of the battles ended in one episode. So they weren't prolonging them like most other animes. And the techniques of the ninja? Whoa. Some of them were far beyond what I thought they were going to be. Some were goofy, others were viscous but one person just really pissed me off throughout the entire series. I was happy when he died.Mwhahahha....haha....ha. Ahem.But behind all this is a tragedy with no mercy spared. The love was genuine between Oboro and Gennosuke and I hated watching the pain they were both being put through while having to fight each other. It was heart wrenching. I was dreading the end because I felt I knew how it must end. Let's just say that  I ended up shedding a few years worth of tears. So if your the emotional type of person, like me, then be prepared.The art of the story of beautiful when they used it, but otherwise some of the characters were, frankly, disgusting. The shogun in the first episode has this huge unreal disgusting growth or abnormality jutting out from his chin. And he's fat and ugly. I think it was detail that made everything about a character stand out. Old people had wrinkles out the butt and fat people had roles the size of Mt. Everest and it was just to the extreme. Most of the women (well the ninja ones) were sexy looking and it really bothered me that their hair covered up their faces like all the time. But otherwise I enjoyed the art style.Generally I'm a person who watches anime with romance and happiness. I was depressed when watching this, but also enthralled. I just had to watch to know what happened. The sadness that I felt while watching this series does not stop me from loving it. It is now my top favorite.This was also something that I finished in 2 days. Unless you'd like to account for the sleeping I had to do. But since it only spans 24 episodes its quick, enjoyable and well worth the time spent to watch it. A mere weekend would suffice to finish this series.My only complaint is that this anime (I haven't read the manga yet) is poorly advertised and known. I hadn't even heard of this until I went searching and saw recommendations for it. And still I didn't decide to watch it until now. Actually I bought it before I watched it (I tend to have good luck when deciding on buying anime before watching it) and I am so happy that I did. It was well beyond worth the money I spent on it. I would recommend this to anyone. Although I suggest you keep a box of tissue's with you on the last disc. is nullified upon the decision that a shogun must be picked.

But since it only spans 24 episodes its quick, enjoyable and well worth the time spent to watch it. A mere weekend would suffice to finish this series.My only complaint is that this anime (I haven't read the manga yet) is poorly advertised and known. I hadn't even heard of this until I went searching and saw recommendations for it. And still I didn't decide to watch it until now. Actually I bought it before I watched it (I tend to have good luck when deciding on buying anime before watching it) and I am so happy that I did. It was well beyond worth the money I spent on it. I would recommend this to anyone. Although I suggest you keep a box of tissue's with you on the last disc."", 'Normally when people say an anime has ""potential,"" I scoff and think that it\'s a total excuse for not being able to give it an honest rating. However, I cannot find any other word to describe this anime than ""potential.""Story: 7/10As the synopsis suggests, the story centers heavily on fighting and action, so there\'s not that much story development. All you need to know is that the two clans are trying to kill each other. This doesn\'t dampen the anime in any way since it was intended as an action anime, but I think there was a major issue with pacing. It was both rushed...and painfully slow at the same time. By rushed I mean the story needs to kill off 18 characters (there\'s 10 for each side and obviously it\'s going to be 1v1 at the end) in a mere 24 episodes. This means many of the characters barely contribute anything to the story (some of them honestly only appear for 10 min and then they die), and I think the story would\'ve been a lot better had they reduced the number of characters per clan. But I know the producers didn\'t have much control over this since it was based on the manga, but then I wish they would have extended the series to be longer to allow more story development for each character.But it was also painfully slow for the action scenes. You\'ll notice moments in the fights where the two foes just stand and stare at each other for way too long. Normally that kind of stuff builds anticipation, but here they exaggerated it way too much and it gets to the point where you just want the action to start already.If they had just fixed these minor pacing problems, the story would have been fantastic. And just keep in mind that this anime is dark; you won\'t find many comedic scenes that usually come with action anime.Art: 10/10I definitely liked this kind of animation style, even though this was my first time watching a historical anime. The people and environment are all nicely drawn, and there\'s definitely a focus on very dark colors, reflecting the tragic mood of this anime.Sound: 10/10I think the opening and ending themes were nice, as well as the various themes used in the sad moments. There\'s also a flute tune which serves as an emotional motif which I thought was extremely fitting of the story. Nothing wrong here.Character: 8/10I mentioned this previously, but there\'s very little character development save for 3 or 4 characters, and the other 17 or so are just basically ignored. It was strange because for the 3 or 4 that they developed, they did it extremely well and I found myself becoming pretty attached to the main characters, but the scenes with the minor characters just felt too filler-like because of how brief and undeveloped they were. It was almost like the producers were just looking for excuses to kill off the characters. But you won\'t be disappointed by the two main characters as you watch each one\'s love for another shatter from their clan clash and how they struggle between their love for each other and their duties to their families.Enjoyment:7/10The pacing kind of ruined the enjoyment for me, as well as the episodes where all you see is a bunch of minor characters get killed off for no reason. But the anime does pick up near the end however, since most of the characters are dead at that point which left a lot of room for story and character development, so I think the last 5 or so episodes were extremely well done.Overall: 7/10I understand a lot of the complaints I had were not the fault of the producers since they had to stick to the manga, but there definitely were some small things that they could have fixed which would have had a major impact. There really was a lot of potential for this anime, but I definitely wouldn\'t say they did a bad job. If you\'re looking for action and a dark story, give Basilisk a watch, but don\'t hope for too much in complex character development or plot twists. and painfully slow at the same time.

This was exactly the type of anime I needed to cleanse my palate after watching one too many Rom-Coms where the pairing I root for neglect to get together...AGAIN! This was a simple Romeo & Juliet story set in the Edo era, but what I appreciate is that the story doesn't necessarily revolve around the love of the couple. I mean, when there are...Shinobi with a bunch of different 'magical' powers, a 400 year grudge, and political manipulations the story has a host of other places it can veer towards. Don't be fooled though, NO ONE lives happily ever after. What really drew me in were the deaths: it was never as simple as a sword to the heart or even super ninja fighting. Each death was different and, dare I say, beautiful? Near the end when there are only a few people left on either side I was sad to see some characters go though. The only reason I didn'tgive this series a solid 10 was because (SPOILER ALERT) I felt that Gennosuke should have gone on a complete rampage once Oboro killed herself and killed all of those high ranking political manipulators in the Tokugawa  government. I know peace came to both clans after EVERYBODY died, but I still felt a bit gypped. Thanks to this series I won't be so reluctant to venture into historical anime with older design aesthetic.

Terrible, but decent. Probably the best way to describe this anime - lacking any sense whatsoever. Simply put, it has some great ideas but creators shown complete inability to make those elements work together therefore making it laughable at best.I couldve gone in depth and write 20 page essay, whats wrong, why plus some suggestions on improving. Not saying I could've wrote better one, but... Oh, cmon. Im so dissapointed in the way how this anime has been messed up that i feel I could actually write better one. Their...mistakes are basic. Watching some anime series I had sometimes that feeling 'it wouldve been better if...' But its nothing compared to what I feel watching this series.Great potential. Great animation. You MAY like it. Watch couple episodes, but do not expect series to get better with time as some do.Got here cause of some comparisions to Berserk and Samurai X. Not even close. mistakes are basic.

I wish other animes had such depth and strong storyline. It's amazing how authors pictured the phenomena of the blind hatred between people, when both sides think they're 'different' and treat the other side as animals rather than humans, although virtually being identical human beings and living their life the same way. This story is always present in real life, assuming the fact that the world is drowning in the hatred and blood.I absolutely love the connection between Gennosuke's idea (stopping pointless hostility) and his doujutsu. He's never harmful except when threatened. What I would also like to mention...is the balance between two rival sides, it's very important that in such kind of story there's no spoiled one -- both clans don't regret to use nasty tricks and all sorts of deception when it comes to slaying enemy ninja. So it's only a question of your choice which side to support.Finally, there's a special part inside my heart for Hyoma. Imo, this full of wisdom character is the authors gentle way to touch the topic of Zen. He's the image of absolutely enlightened person or absolutely Present, (if you know what I mean), so that he even doesn't need any eye vision. I would not disagree with people who call the part where Hyoma and young Gennosuke are practicing a 'filler'. The culmination of that episode is brilliant, when they reach the top of the mountain and young Gennosuke refuses to remove the eye bandage because he can feel and enjoy the moment without seeing details and analyzing them with his mind and that's when he obtains his real inner power.Generally, the idea of inner power is dominant in this anime. It's absolutely clear from the last episode and the end of that ninja scroll story and those who 'burst into tears' didn't actually get the main motive of the story. It can be partly gathered from Oboro's and Gennosuke's dialogue about their spirits as two parts of a single one. The ending says that the spiritual power of lovers is so great that there's no necessity to care about their Earth life that much. They finish it with honor and respect to the gore of fallen, doing their best for their loved ones and their clans, then passing away and slowly floating down the stream hugging, which is actually a very touching metaphor for proceeding their travel in the Eternal as the single entity henceforth.Basilisk deserves 10 out of 10 for each parameter. is the balance between two rival sides, it's very important that in such kind of story there's no spoiled one -- both clans don't regret to use nasty tricks and all sorts of deception when it comes to slaying enemy ninja.

However, the story continues and you see no real explanation for any of their actions, and all that's left is the lack of consistency in the story line and its characters.Personally, the only characters that I could say that has been explained, are firmly consistent in their actions, and have been developed during the show are Oboro and Tenzen. Why?, you could ask; because along the story Oboro and...Tenzen makes decisions that fits with her personality. Once you are watching the show you start to see flaws in a lot of the characters personalities, contradicting themselves and making the show really unpleasant to see. For instance, Gennosuke and Saemon Kisaragi during the show, they listen to things the other characters say or they make some statements, and you clearly see that they have change their mind, but in the end they make mistakes that they shouldn't really make, and have no real explanation.The art of the show is the only thing that seems respectable for me, it makes the combat flow and it fits very well the scenes. You know everything that is happening on the screen, and that's very complicated to achieve on these kind of animes.The sound is really mediocre, the only thing that stands out is the opening, but that's all, and for an anime of 24 episodes...

The best example of an ost well made would be the one on Rurouni Kenshin...After all, I saw the anime because I wanted to see how it could end, pretty obvious, but I encourage everyone to try it and watch at least 5 or 6 episodes, if you don't like it that's ok, drop it like its hot.Greetings!

One should never even wish for it to fell upon him or others. This show portraits the horrors of war in a really good manner. People lose ones they love, and the ending is not always happy.Unlike many other shows, this one does have the courage to show likeable characters die, and unlike sooo many shows it actually does tell you ""You don\'t forget the ones that died"".Wow, huge intro to this review, but I really felt that many shows just shrug off the ones that die, and that so many shows have characters that in the end just forget...all those they loved and lost. Luckily this is not one of those.Story [7]I wouldn\'t mind giving story a higher grade than 7, but I can\'t force myself to do so. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depends how you look at it) the story is pretty generic. It has been said million times so far. A story about two ninja clans in war, two people in love and their followers is nothing new, and if you\'ve seen one of them, you know what this one is like. The difference is how it is played. Luckily, this one doesn\'t go generic way of killing all but main characters. You will see characters you came to like die in a second, and the ones you expected to live through die next second. There is no safe character in this war/love story.Art [8]Meh. I can\'t say it\'s bad. But I can\'t say it\'s good either. While fighting is nicely done most of the time, characters are just out of proportions and unlike themselves (art meaning)  at other times. The colors, the reflections of sun, the colors of the trees and overall ""atmosphere"" art is really done great.Sound [9]Soundtrack for this one goes almost completely non-vocal style (I think only exception being op). And it hits top marks with it. Music never interferes with character talks, it never interrupts fights or bothers. It is there almost all the time, you can hear it and enjoy in it, but it\'s not going to distract you from watching the show. I gave it 9 just because of the fact many, and I mean many characters sounded so similar it was really hard to voice-recognize them. If you don\'t mind not recognizing characters by their voice, put 10 here.Character [9]To start off, huge cast. I see many people mention underdeveloped characters. But I disagree with that. I actually think characters are very well developed. The fact that I cared more for secondary characters than for the main ones tells a lot considering main characters have most of the screen time. 20 characters here in total (some minor ones in background). They go from harmless sexual maniacs to crazy old man. These characters have their emotions, they have their loves and their fears. One of my favorite characters in this shows acts all tough most of the time, but when shown with the one he loved in flashback, it is obvious even he enjoys peace when with loved one. Most of the characters in this show are like that. They are all strong and powerful, but they are also caring and gentle.When it comes to characters, this is closest to reality I\'ve seen so far. They are doing their duties flawlessly, but they are still people touched and hurt by the horrors of the war.Enjoyment [9]As always, I won\'t comment this one. Those who read this review probably noticed a lot of ""I this..."", ""I that..."". Enjoyment is different from person to person, the fact I enjoyed it doesn\'t mean others will too.Overall [8]With some art flaws, not so good voice acting and generic story, this show gets ""only"" 8.

To my surprise Basilisk turned out to be an incredibly enjoyable anime. It starts off a bit slow and even confusing, but after a few episodes you start to get the hang of things.The plot is basically a Battle Royale or survival game between two clans named Kouga and Iga. Each clan has 10 ninjas or elite warriors with supernatural abilities. Many of these ninjas are amazing characters. You have ""beautiful heroes"" and ""ugly monsters"" on both sides. No clan is fully good or fully evil, which is...something I appreciated a lot. It\'s up to the viewer which clan to root for. I am #TeamKouga for sure though, mainly because their characters appealed to me more and Iga had one too many rapists...(There\'s a central romance to the plot as well.)I caught myself cheering at times when Kouga used teamwork to outsmart the Iga or to kill them. Gyoubu, the psychically strong ""chameleon"", was involved in a few of those. He was probably my favorite character of all.

If you were a fan of Ninja Scroll then you will love this series. Once...the foundations have been set in episode one, what follows is an all out war between the clans. The sheer variety of ninja and their abilities make for some interesting battles. However what hooked me on this series was not the battles, but the step further Gonzo took, in terms of character development for each ninja. You get to understand the motivations of the ninja, why the hatred is there, the suffering some ninja have due to their particular art form. The series has an epic feel about it, due to the moving soundtrack, high quality animation and story. There are scenes which will make you have a lump in your throat - sorry as a man i will not publicy say i cried!! ;) and there is a scene which you will have hatred for one particular hairy ninja!! After all the entertainment of action, violence and nudity, the one thing i did take away from the series, was why? why the need for such bloodshed, such a war. The sacrifices people will do for each other and the love of their people. It also shows how such a war can destroy peoples dreams/lives for political justification, a theme we still see in our times.The anime follows the manga pretty closely, but i feel the anime slightly humanises some of the ninja more and in my opinion makes the anime superior. The anime is violent and has nudity, but nothing too excessive, and personally think of it as a mature anime. Animation quality is top notch and shows what Gonzo can do with the right budget.Opening and closing themes are pretty catchy, shame about the 1 minute speech every episode! Thank god for fast forward.All in all highly recommeded series and worth the investment in time if you enjoy historical action tragedy fantasy, with some moving drama.

Phew!!', 'Unlike many of the reviews prior to my own, the story here is a story that far surpasses what was understood.  If you have seen Ninja Scroll (movie & /or series) & The Blade Of Kamui, you can almost tie the 3 movies together.  Not only is there a forbidden, Romeo & Juliet-type love going on here.  This was a time when the government was trying to get rid of both ninja and samurai.  If you go through the characters of these 3 titles, you will run across similar names.  This particular story is indeed a bloody battle of the...2 clans, but if you are like me & truly get into the story, it is worth watching. 2 clans, but if you are like me & truly get into the story, it is worth watching.', ""The story of this anime is nothing new: it is basically a Romeo and Juliet setting. And that is okay! There are so many variations you can do with a well-known storylline, and warring ninja clans with super powers is a pretty cool one!The thing that grabbed me the most about this anime was the art. Goodness, have you seen these characters eyes?? And their luscious eyelashes????? It's incredible how beautiful anime can be.Everyone had some really cool powers too. I really enjoyed how (I forgot their names I'm SORRY) Romeo and Juliet's powers complimented each other, it really worked in their favor for their...romantic chemistry and the whole idea of marrying into each others clans in the first place.If we're gonna poll the Iga vs the Kouga clan uhhhh tbh both of them have equal footing when it comes to characters with cool powers and characters with LAME AS HELL powers. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the guy who can throw hands with the wires and the girl who can suck your life out with her skin. romantic chemistry and the whole idea of marrying into each others clans in the first place.If we're gonna poll the Iga vs the Kouga clan uhhhh tbh both of them have equal footing when it comes to characters with cool powers and characters with LAME AS HELL powers.

The fighting scenes and ninja techniques are phenomenal and there are no orange jumpsuits anywhere.  Real Ninjas.  As in all good anime there are some characters who you will be rooting for and others whom you can't wait to die.  I found myself torn halfway through the series. This anime does a great job of balancing the love story with the fast paced action of ninja combat.  One thing I did not like was the design of most characters the male characters are for the most part gross looking and...half of the female characters look like raccoons.  In spite of that a very good anime should please fans of many different genres. half of the female characters look like raccoons.

To me it\'s just the work of an author who\'s so edgy he might fall off a cliff like -spoliers-.Seriously, the train of thought of this guy was ""Ah.. I don\'t know how to make people feel sympathy for my characters.. I KNOW, LET\'S JUST RAPE AND TORTURE THE WOMEN AND THEN MAYBE THEY WILL FEEL SORRY FOR THEM!""!SPOILERS!""Eh, this guy has a sister, let\'s rape and kill her.""""Oh, and why...wouldn\'t we rape the main heroine as well?""""I got an idea, in the lasts episodes, let\'s rape AND torture this girl (10min strait each)!

To say that this anime has one of the worst introductions I\'ve ever seen would be a colossal understatement.The first episode is exposition from beginning to end, showing us scenes and characters with absolutely no context to back-up the action in front of us. It is the kind of episode that only makes sense after you\'ve watched the entire series.... and while I am not opposed to heavy exposition in the first episode(s) of a series, Basilisk takes it up to 11 with absolutely incomprehensible jibberish.... so disregard the...first episode for all that I will say after this point.STORY:The story is very flimsy and just an excuse to set-up the action of the series. To say that Basilisk\'s story is token once again, would be an understatement. The basic set up is this; Two rival clans are tasked to fight a proxy war of succession in the name of the Tokugawa Shogunate (Government) and the winner of the war will be rewarded whereas the loser will be destroyed (somehow). The set-up is meaningless and never properly explained beyond ""Fight in our name yata yata yata"".The story is not Basilisk\'s strong point.ART:The art of the anime is very strong, it has a very, VERY ""Japanese"" tone and feel to it, possibly the most \'traditional Japanese\' style I\'ve seen in an anime. The architecture is lovely and the scenery is often gorgeous. From the simple , almost hut-like inn rooms, to the salt-storage room... to the large Sunpu castle... to the small city structures of Manjidani and Tsubagakure... it is all wonderfully designed and displayed through gorgeous artwork.The animation can range from very good to \'just okay\' but not once did I ever see a major animation shortcut or significant drop in quality. The creators went to great length to show what they wanted to show as vividly as possible.If you care about artistry, this anime will not let you down.CHARACTER:This is where this anime truly shines above everything else. Every single character , and there are a LOT, is developed. Though we don\'t get into the backstory of each one, even the ones that are not given backstory we can have a pretty good idea of what they\'re about. Characters like Udono Jousuke, we know are rambunctious, but hilarious, jackasses... characters like Nenki are stuck-up, arrogant and prideful... characters like Gyobu are given brief glimpses of development which tell us exactly where he is coming from, what his motivations are and what his potential weakness is.The characterization is so strong that unfortunately, the two main leads \'feel\' very weak in comparison. Protagonist Gennosuke and Oboro , the leaders of their respective clans... feel very underdeveloped and underwhelming... their supporting cast is so much stronger and vibrant that we can only resent the show when we are stuck with Gennosuke and Oboro scenes, scenes that drag down the entire show.It\'s a bit hard to explain without revealing spoilers, but from a brilliant cast of grey-morality characters, we have a boring Mary Sue duo that produce almost nothing interesting.... that being said, the supporting cast is so strong that they carry the bland-as-hell leads which almost crush the anime with their dull, plodding George Lucas-esque love story.OVERALL:From a terrible beginning develops a fantastic anime which ends somewhat anti-climactically. That is to say, the beginning is awful and it drags a bit towards the end, but everything in between is absolute gold.I know this sounds like strange compliments but;The pacing in this show (Aside from the beginning and end) is absolutely perfect.The directing in the show is absolutely perfect.This show is very well done. The story is garbage, the two main leads are garbage, but everything else was done so well, so effectively that I can honestly give a positive recommendation despite that.Rundown;If you like action, especially ninja action, this is for you.If you care about art, architecture and traditional Japanese culture, this is for you.If you want a complex story with twists and turns; This is NOT for you, do NOT waste your time.If you want a strong lead and a deep, well-made love story; This is NOT for you.Overall, could have been wonderful but as it stands, it is only ""Good"". first episode for all that I will say after this point.STORY:The story is very flimsy and just an excuse to set-up the action of the series.

I really love historical fiction and its hard to find one that sticks to its period consistently. This one manages to make their supernatural characters feel like Edo period Ninjas in a pretty unique way. Its got a cast of pretty fleshed out characters which is impressive since there are so many. What I dislike about the story is how goddamn depressing everything is. I realize this is supposed to be a brutal tragedy but feel that it was just overdone. It feels like the writers are literally psychopathic sadists as...they find more horrible ways to treat the female protagonist. The poor girl can\'t catch a break and it veers on the side of fetishized abuse. The male lead goes through his own hardships as well, but nothing like the constant shitting on Oboro. To me the show was much too focused on the senseless violence and emotional whipping around. To really satisfy me, I need just  hint of positive consequence and Basilisk really never gets there. The end is *spoilers* the worst case scenario and any amount of development in the characters really doesn\'t matter. Development is very thin to begin with and I guess that\'s the point since the theme is something resembling the ""war never changes "" trope. Still, something should have come out of it besides the extinction of some trouble making tribes. For gore lovers, its great! Just don\'t go into it thinking its got some deep philosophical purpose or a twist that makes you think. Its a straight forward story about horrible people doing increasingly unspeakable things and receiving justice for it. If it were strictly a killing show, it would be a pretty fun hot-mess. If it were strictly a drama, it would make some pretty smart statements. But throwing the two together at this volume is really jarring and unsatisfying. they find more horrible ways to treat the female protagonist.

Thus when it comes to the plot of the anime, I doubt that any of it will seem significantly fresh or too unpredictable. If you are able to get past the unoriginal storyline, however, I think that there is still a lot to like about Basilisk.The story moves at good pace: fast enough to prevent any dull moments; but takes time to develop the plot. As this is an anime about ninja, there is plenty of the action and fight sequences that one may expect from a series from this...genre. I definitely feel my favorite part of the anime was probably the abundance of interesting characters. Although there were probably too many to fully develop, I thought that most of the Iga and Kouga ninja interesting and not too one-dimensional (except for the ones that die too early in the series).There were numerous things that I disliked about the anime. My biggest gripe is the gratuitous amount of nudity and violence. A lot of the time I found the blood and boobs a bit unnecessary, taking away a lot of the poignancy of certain scenes. My other complaint is the lack of elaboration on the sub-story of Oboro and Gennosuke. Other viewers seemed to find the underlying love story interesting but I found it a bit too underdeveloped.All-in-all, I liked Basilisk and would recommend the the anime to anyone looking for an action-packed, fan-service-filled, animated romp. The art is beautiful, the characters great and the plot not horrible. The story is definitely not a feel good anime, so anyone looking to find a happy-go-lucky series should probably look somewhere else.

It was among some of the first anime shows I watched when first getting into anime. Watched it on Netflix in dub and decided to watch in Japanese this time since Ive grown to like subbed rather that dubbed. I was very entertained even after a second watch and came to MAL to check its rating and was disappointed to discover its low rating.Basilisk is a pretty good watch. Yes it has the cliched Romeo and Juliet plot going on but Ive watched 2 versions of Romeo and Juliet and I would...rather watch Basilisk any day over those. There are a lot of elements that are differentiate the show from a typical R&J series. First Oboro and Gennoske are both the leaders of their respective clans which makes the pairing a little more difficult. Second the action is quite spectacular, both clans are literally in an official death match sanctioned by the late shogunate, if anything one could at least appreciate the cool fight scenes. The story also goes a little more in dept of supporting character roles. Its a bit more dramatic when each side suffers losses. Although the fate of the 2 doomed lovers is the same as R&J it feels a little more tragic and heartbreaking, whereas in Romeo and Juliet their deaths are somewhat accidental. (SPOILER) Oboro chooses to die for Gennoske rather than taking her own life because Romeo is dead already. Anyway its not a flowery end and kind of leaves a bitter taste but a feeling that lingers much more than a happy ending.Anyway Id give Basilisk a solid 8/10. I rated it 10 because I feel it deserves more than what it now has but in honesty its definitely a solid 8.Some of the flaws that might not appeal to people is the artwork, some of the characters have very unreal figures, however that didnt quite bother me, other than that the art was beautiful especially the landscapes. Pretty good considering its from 05.The music was pretty good, not a masterpiece but it captured the moments well, especially dramatic scenes. OP was OK, I liked the ED better though.Ive already gone over plot and how I feel about it overall, so I recommend Basilisk, for anyone who enjoys action (with blood), or romance (tragic). rather watch Basilisk any day over those.

This is a very melodramatic anime with plenty of death and disturbing situations for those who enjoy creepier adult themes. At first glance the storyline seems very predictable and linear but the more you watch, the more it slowly evolves into something more. With slow story progression, the series relies heavily on violent action scenes that assist in keeping the viewer entertained as the story unfolds. The ending is decent but leaves something to be desired.All of the characters are interesting and unique...but because the series is fairly short it doesn’t allow for very much character development, which is disappointing once you become invested in the show and its plot. For someone who appreciates delving deeper into the motivations and emotional states of characters, there is a lot of missed potential here.There is some fanservice in this anime that was likely entered to ease the often apprehensive mood. Despite clear objectification, the female characters display strength in their own way and are highly resilient. To that extent, there are some disturbing sequences in regards to how women are treated by the rest of the vastly male cast. Viewers beware, there is a rape scene.In the beginning I was not very fond of the artstyle but as the show continued I found that it does flatter the era that is expressed – dark overbearing lineart accentuates the turmoil and anger contained in this series. The animation is fairly fluid for its time but there are a few segments that are lacking. For example, during a specific running sequence the characters are only bounced back and forth to display movement which feels effortless when compared to other action scenes.An aspect of this anime that really drew me in was the music, it is so well-suited and enhances the mood; from passive to sorrowful, everything is expressed in flutes and unintelligible chanting. Unfortunately, the voice acting in the English dubbed version is subpar in regards to phrasing and the delivery of lines, and often the voice work is garbled by loud music and sound effects.Despite its faults I found Basilisk a good anime with strong action scenes and interesting characters. If you decide to try it I’d suggest watching at least 4 episodes before choosing whether to continue or quit. but because the series is fairly short it doesn’t allow for very much character development, which is disappointing once you become invested in the show and its plot.

Wow, I am so glad I did that because I would have been disappointed with the live-action because it does the anime NO justice.This series is definitely a LOT more mature with pretty gruesome murders/other mature scenes, lots of blood, etc. I'm not that squeamish and I had to turn off the sounds or turn away sometimes because it was kind of graphic and shocking, but that just means the creators did THAT good of a job with making you empathize with the characters.The story follows two lovers, Gennosuke and Oboro who are the...leaders of the Kouga and Iga ninja clans. The two clans have a bitter history and were ruled by an anti-war pact that was suddenly lifted along with an order to commence a ninpou competition, giving the ninjas of both clans an opportunity of a lifetime to start going at each others' throats. Ten ninjas from each clan have been chosen to take part in the competition and must fight to the death. For the lovers Gennosuke and Oboro, they are torn between their love and their duty to their respective clans.This anime is about CHARACTERS. I must say that some of the characters in this anime are very unique and some have amazing depth and quality to them that make them more than just blood-thirsty superhuman ninjas. I've been told that these characters are much colder in the manga, and I'm so glad that in the anime, they have some depth.There are so many beautiful scenes in this anime, not necessarily because it's well drawn or super detailed, but because they provide a moment of stillness and a time for reminiscence among the numerous bloodthirsty-action packed scenes. That's why I LOVE the flashbacks in this anime because they are absolutely beautiful and tells the backstory of these characters.That being said, my opinion is that the character depth was not extremely well distributed among the two clans, as one clan just seems to have more straightforward bloodthirsty members than the other.But watch this anime.

This concept may be a bit overdone, but Basilisk manages to get the balance just right, tempering the bouts of extreme and bloody violence with touching moments of humour and romance. I found the storytelling to be excellent and very well balanced – I got completely sucked into the word of the Iga & Kouga ninja’s and really cared about their fates.  Basilisk does an excellent job of its character development with lots of well-placed flashbacks. Unfortunately for most characters these flashbacks...are their death flags, but often they reappear in other characters flashbacks and so they continue to be developed even after they have been sliced into tiny pieces!That’s another striking aspect of Basilisk – the action scenes. As the setting is a ninja war obviously the fight scenes form the main core of the series, and they are spectacular! A broad range of unique ninja techniques makes for interesting and varied action scenes, but present throughout all of them is a huge amount of blood – the death toll is massive. There is also quite a bit of historical fact woven into the plot – the setting is quite realistic. However Basilisk is definitely for older anime viewers due to the gritty violence and mature themes that run throughout the series. The only gripe I have with the show is that my favourite characters were short-lived and I didn’t like Oboro at all – for a main character she is utterly useless for the duration and ate up too much screen time with her constant crying.ANIMATION: I loved the animation and the character designs. The animation is fluid with gorgeous and varied backgrounds – fight choreography is never dull or repetitive and makes for gripping viewing, but the slower reflective scenes are also presented well. The character designs are very striking and varied with lots of emphasis on the eyes and hair of the characters. Plenty of heavy shading is used and the characters facial expressions are extremely varied and add plenty of emotion to any given scene. Lots of attention to detail is on display with the historically accurate costumes and backgrounds too which all makes the viewing experience pleasurable.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I wasn’t much fussed on the OP but felt that it probably fitted well with the tone of the series – liked the ED though, even if it is quite typical of anime EDs. The score was also quite fitting as it has lots of traditional Japanese instruments and blends into the tone of the show extremely well. Voice acting was also superb. All the characters show a huge range of emotion over the course of series and the seiyuu all pulled off these extremes well. Very much an ensemble piece so it’s hard to pick out standout characters.Overall Basilisk falls into my ‘Good GONZO’ category, it has excellent visuals and storytelling and a very satisfying conclusion. The reason I marked it down is that I personally felt that the two main characters could have been better developed and weren’t as interesting as the short-lived side characters. I also felt that the show occasionally got a bit too wrapped up in its own melodrama and spent too much time on long lingering close ups of Oboro’s eyes! But these are minor gripes and more about my personal preferences than anything else. are their death flags, but often they reappear in other characters flashbacks and so they continue to be developed even after they have been sliced into tiny pieces!That’s another striking aspect of Basilisk – the action scenes.

Now at the beginning of the Edo period the retired Toguwara Ieyusu has revoked the anti war pact created by Hattori Hanzai that has kept the two clans apart. A list has been created with the 10 best ninjas from each clan must fight it out to the death. To the winner glory and the spoils of war. The problem is nobody has told  the two young heirs to the clan heads, Oboro and Gennosuke, who are promised to each other to be married and are determined to...use their marriage to end the feud between their two clans. However, why must the clans fight it out to the death and what is the real reason for the ninja war?There you have it a Romeo and Juliet story with ninjas. Awesome!The story is very good, however, it is a bit slow to get going. With the exception of the first episode which sets up the story very nicely, showing Oboro\'s grandmother and Gennosuke\'s grandfather in love until Oda Nobunga massacres the Iga village with ""Kouga help"" turning their love into intense hatred and when they die (sorry spoiler!) it gives one of the best scenes in the series, it takes until episode 7 for the series to get interesting and episode 9 for the story to get going.Up until then we\'re are shown fights between ninjas with super human powers, many with deformities, from the cool to the weird to the grotesque,fighting it out in spectacular sequences. However, once the story gets going it is highly addictive.We are treated to a couple of filler episodes, one which gives a recap which was useful as I lost tracked of who was dead and another which added nothing to the story.To be honest I didn\'t care for many of the ninjas if they didn\'t make it to episode 7 and once they were dead I was glad we wouldn\'t be seeing them again. However, once past episode 7 there is some proper character developments making the characters more human and turning inter clan feuding in to lusts for revenge making the death scenes more emotional and making you feel for the characters. Also to add a nice touch some of the surviving characters towards the end are shown to actually question why they are fighting.The animation is not bad with much of the scenes at night or in the shade. They are ninjas after all. The background music was very good and the opening and ending songs fitted the series perfectly.Obviously from the synopsis and the fact there are ninjas you are going to get blood, violent deaths and lots of it so be warned if you don\'t enjoy seeing that kind of thing. However, if you enjoy historical epics you will enjoy this but my advice would be to stick with it because you could easily drop it before you get to episode 7.

Whether it be the sheer agility they possess, their determination to succeed, the destructive apparatus frequently associated with them, potentially tragic backstories, or even simply their badass attire (seriously, where the hell do ninja shop for clothing?), I have yet to meet someone who would refer to them as lackadaisical or mundane. Pretend to play the devil’s advocate all you want, but we know what you’re thinking...inside.Onto today’s show of discussion, however, we are going to look at what has been commonly referred to as one of the bona fide ninja anime experiences. Produced by studio Gonzo and released over the course of 2005 with its fitting 24-episode runtime, a vast majority of people I have come across online seem to agree that Basilisk (sometimes referred to as Basilisk: The Kouga Ninja Scrolls) is an intense, action-packed show with little lacking in the story department. But why Basilisk? What is it that makes this spectacularly stellar Shōgun-centered story of sorrow so special to me and countless other people? How is it that Basilisk, a show seemingly chosen by aleatory means, quickly became my new favorite anime of all time? Fortunately for you guys and gals, that is precisely what I am about to explain.We begin with another continuous story, though the interesting thing to note about Basilisk is that most of the episodes actually start with a fascinating little introduction segment that I feel does a damn efficient job at explaining the basic premise.“Two tribes sworn to hate. Their bloodstained bodies left out in the open to rot. Their souls longing for a peace that they failed to find. As they sought to break the shackles of darkness and heal the wounds of the past, fate denied their quest, and thrust them into war. The bridges of hope some dared to build between them were torn asunder. Their dreams were ripped from their hearts with a sword, with a destiny revealed at last.”Sweet dreams tonight, by the way.*Story summary nullified thanks to MAL guidelines*The first aspect of Basilisk that I must commend rather auspiciously is that between the historical references, constantly rising tension, and depth of the story right off the bat (while still being surprisingly comfortable to jump into despite the mammoth-sized premise), all of the above strongly contribute to an engaging and original tale of tragedy and warfare from beginning to end. The story as a whole plays it surprisingly straight as well, seldom falling back on comedy since the main appeal lies in the serious conflicts and clashes that occur between the opposing factions.Another aspect that I find Basilisk to particularly excel in is the pacing department. For instance, virtually every one of the main characters is given just enough screen time to genuinely feel like a real character with their own personalities and motivations. I don’t say a real human because honestly, I would question if some of the tribes’ best fighters are even humans to begin with, but the development is strong and abundant here nonetheless. Perhaps the shining example of this statement lies within our protagonists, Gennosuke and Oboro. These two solemnly believe in a future where their factions can live in harmony, but as a result of the world they live in, they don’t get much of a say in the matter as they cannot change a 400-year long grudge overnight. Because of this, whether they like it or not, the former lovers must grow further apart from each other in their desperate attempt to control the war. Without the solid pacing, this conflict would feel far more trivial and/or less important than it actually is to the story.The independent elements of the narrative are also quite strong. To begin with, the main suspense of the story primarily comes from which characters are going to brawl next, and who out of them is going to remain alive. Here, it is predominantly thanks to the enticing scripting, well-established characters, and stunningly thrilling action that the suspense in Basilisk remains as strong as it is.But what makes the action in Basilisk work so well? While the fight scenes can border on the short side, whenever they occur, the cinematography thrashes out at the viewer with gory, fast-paced mayhem as the opposing ninja tribes lash out their many attacks and cunning surprises in the process. In that sense, I honestly find Basilisk as the damn poster boy for bloodbaths such as Castlevania, Drifters, and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Another point of interest is that it can actually be quite difficult to tell which characters are going to survive in the numerous battles, similar to Akame ga Kill. Furthermore, building upon the compelling cast and noteworthy action is that each of the 10 Kouga and Iga ninja have their own special ninja arts, with each characters’ being distinct, memorable, and most certainly destructive.To illustrate this point, take Koshiro Chikuma’s ability. While it is true that he is fantastic at dual-wielding kama (essentially weaponized sickles), Koshiro can also summon what I can only describe as miniature black-hole projectiles simply by softly blowing the air toward his targets. He must have grown up in Black Lagoon’s Roanapur to learn that shit, and here I was hoping he’d be giving out free concussions. At any rate, seeing and learning about each ninja’s signature technique is honestly one of the most fun parts of the show, but for now I shall digress.Additionally, the animation and art direction of Basilisk is as tight as 2005 could possibly muster. For starters, the artwork is surprisingly realistic overall, even for some of the tribe members that aren’t meant to be. The backgrounds are also very distinct, as each highly detailed backdrop of the series is carefully crafted around this ancient Japanese flair that I simply cannot get enough of. Moreover, the surroundings are constructed around Japan’s Sengoku period, which end up fitting the theme of Basilisk’s earlier, vicious world incredibly well. That is also to speak nothing of the creative, fitting character designs and fluid consistency all across the board, which provokes me to say with my utmost certainty that the animation in Basilisk spared no expense whatsoever. In fact, if you had told me the show had aired five or so years later, I probably would have believed you.To add upon the excellent animation and artwork aspects, cinematography is something I always consider quite heavily when it comes to anime, and Basilisk doesn’t slouch here either. Countless scenes in the series are presented with such visual flair and effort (probably a result of the phenomenal animation), showcasing quickly moving artwork alongside everchanging environments. From forests to dojos, oceans to towns, there exists plenty of variety within the world of Basilisk. These hold particularly true when you get to the copious amounts of fight scenes, which blitz through frames of animation like a cheetah on roller blades.The fact that Basilisk gets the sound department as its own talking point really illustrates how strong this aspect of the series is. Starting with the music here, while taste in composition is obviously subjective, I’d imagine it difficult to speak ill against the soundtrack of Basilisk. Above is the opening to the series, which features seamlessly transitioned shots on top of solid choreography all throughout. Good examples of this are Tenzen’s chilling moment in the spotlight around forty seconds in, or Gennosuke playing his recorder with Oboro’s hair blowing against the wind around a minute and twenty seconds in. The song itself is also fantastic, with a nice pace to it that really kicks in around two-thirds into the opening.I’d imagine it difficult to speak ill against the soundtrack of Basilisk.

The song itself is also fantastic, with a nice pace to it that really kicks in around two-thirds into the opening.Another stellar example of Basilisk’s soundtrack is the ending theme, of which there are actually two of. I’ve always personally preferred Hime Murasaki, as I think the instrumentation and tone better match the theme of the show. The other is called Wild Eyes, which sounds surprisingly optimistic for a series such as Basilisk, though it is still a good tune nevertheless.Of further notice is the spectacular background music which lies within Basilisk. I mentioned earlier the ancient Japanese flair I enjoyed from the backgrounds, and the music aims for the same dartboard in that sense.Finally, the voice acting I found pretty impressive as a whole. I watched the English Dub to be precise, and despite what some others may tell you, I strongly enjoyed the dub’s voicing of Basilisk’s colorful cast. Each actor matches their respective character role conspicuously well and range from decent to outstanding performances, with my favorite being Mark Stoddard’s take on the mendacious, cruel Tenzen. I have also heard many positive words regarding the Japanese voices, even though I obviously cannot speak for that myself.As if Basilisk didn’t have enough going for it already, the series has to be up there with shows like B: The Beginning, Black Cat, and Future Diary as one of my personal favorite casts in the anime world. While the number of supporting characters in Basilisk almost rivals the amount of terrible jokes in 2002’s The Master of Disguise, they are actually rather nicely balanced in terms of screen time and development. I have touched upon Basilisk’s pacing and its impact on the characters earlier, but also worth noting is how unique, relatable, and important most are to the story. C. Jarrett, an Amazon user, has to say about the cast as follows:“They’re all characters you can buy into. Not one-dimensional heroes who would never exist in the world we live in, they’re characters that have very human flaws, something that’s sorely needed in animated shows in general, and deal with very serious issues in a human and believable way. Gennosuke of the Kouga has a very mature yet zen energy. His unknown ability is revealed in the most shocking and dazzling of ways, frightening the Iga clan into helplessness in one of the most badass anime scenes of all time. Oboro is the perfect compliment, though not to imply she exists to compliment Gennosuke. She’s an incredible, fully-fledged character. Sweet, naive, and gives the story a warmth and innocence the other characters continually take away from the world around her. Her presence is like a personification of their world being torn apart and seeing her lashing out at the inevitability of it all is truly sorrowful. This is how main characters should be. They show insecurities, strengths, weaknesses, and a perseverance at the notion of getting to overcome their situation and see each other again as friends instead of enemies. I bought into them wholeheartedly. You will root for them the whole way which is what makes this a tragic anime through-and-through.”If I had to pick a favorite character, I would go with Koshiro Chikuma. I won’t regurgitate his already explained fighting capabilities, but in terms of development, Koshiro is way up there out of the supporting cast. He puts his life on the line to protect Oboro, the Iga heir, but is commonly being pushed around by Tenzen (also of the Iga clan), who we quickly find out to be the primary antagonist in this show. I really sympathize with Koshiro because he is among the most humane members of the Iga tribe when you get down to it (albeit for spoilerific reasons presented further below), but pitted against the Kouga, it’s like his only purpose in life is to kill or be killed. And despite Koshiro’s status as a veteran fighter, the mental pain he is forced to endure as the story progresses really makes the viewer feel for the lad.*MINOR SPOILERS HERE!*However, it’s when the story picks up after the first third that Koshiro really starts to shine in my eyes. The poor man is utterly blinded after Gennosuke of the Kouga uses his ninja technique on him, and from this point onward his character changes rather conspicuously from a threatening warrior to a thoughtful, emotionally destroyed soul with cognitive dissonance. Koshiro also begins to question Tenzen’s malevolent actions, and whenever Oboro is threatened or put in harm’s way, he practically falls to the ground in a state of melancholic defeat. There is also an incredibly cheerless scene with Koshiro shortly after he’s blinded where someone is approaching him near a river, completely unable to identify who it is. In a state of panic, he attempts to assault the unknown figure, only to figure out that it was only Akeginu of his fellow Iga clan. This emotionally demolishes Koshiro, as losing his vision had almost made him harm one of his own tribe members. Because of these moments and more to come, I feel that he is among the most strongly developed characters in the show and I always enjoy seeing him on screen.*MINOR SPOILERS END*One tangent to note that holds true for both sides, however, is that the more comrades they lose in battle, the tribes don’t just lose offensive support, but legitimate friends as well, with a dedicated flashback episode later in the show exemplifying this perfectly. And while Basilisk makes this incredibly evident for many of the lives lost, further contributing to the tragic aspect of the series, the clans still choose pursue this violent path of chaos that neither side truly benefits from. This is, however, entirely justified within the context of the show.To quote ThatAnimeSnob on Reddit, “You aren’t supposed to take the conflict at face value, but rather consider the following: The two factions were training all their lives for fighting. (Jared’s Note: This is illustrated very well regarding one scene in particular, with a discernibly young boy training outside with his mother, albeit against a mere fly.) Due to the 400-year long grudge, they hated each other and wanted to kill every member of the opposing clan. What with the next Shōgun being decided based on who would win, it was important to fight to the death. The ninja weren’t just following these orders, but were happy with them too…Honor was more important than life for them.”Despite the notable strengths of Basilisk, no piece of fiction on this planet is what I would consider flawless, and even this series is unfortunately not an exception to that rule. Despite this, the drawbacks to Basilisk are thankfully not too severe in the grand scheme of things, I state while desperately attempting not to use the word “however” for the novemdecillionth time.To preface this series of points, easily the most heinous of Basilisk’s crimes (in my opinion) is that the tenth episode is a rather ridiculously redundant recap of the show thus far, with some of the elder characters not in the Kouga or Iga reminiscing the current situation in the show. Not only is it presented far too early to leave much impact, but a distinctly minimal portion of the episode is actually dedicated to new information. Toss in the fact that many of the shots are reused animation, and you have bar none the worst episode in the entire series. It’s not abhorrent or anything, and seeing Lord Ieyasu or Masahiro (son of Hanzō the 1st) interpreting prior events is actually quite entertaining, not to mention the brand new parts not being half bad. But countless scenes from prior episodes here are replayed and rehashed pretty shamelessly. Therefore, I must question, the hell was the point of this?Another problem I experienced with Basilisk is that I feel some of the characters could have benefited from additional screen time and/or development, such as the blind and commonly silent bodyguard of Gennosuke, Hyouma Muroga. For a vast majority of the early story, he’s just sort of there with the Kouga, which acts as quite the juxtaposition compared to the rest of the clan at that point in the narrative.In addition, it’s interesting I bring that up because I have heard a complaint by one person online that Basilisk shouldn’t have focused on story to begin with, but rather the action. This reminds me of a time when I discussed Black Cat with one of my friends, with him stating that if it had focused more on thrilling fight segments rather than dreadfully discombobulating attempts at story, then it would have possessed far more merit. However, while I can agree with the argument a reasonable amount for a show like Black Cat (where the middle can drag on and the ending being somewhat confusing and unneeded), in Basilisk, the entire driving point and area of audience interest comes from the story itself, so I cannot agree with that sentiment for this particular series. Removing the plot in Basilisk would be like reading the text of a Shakespeare play as opposed to watching a live performance of one.I’ve even heard one person online argue that certain development is “wasted” on certain characters, Gyoubu’s relationship with his father being the example used. And I’m sorry, but I fail to see a world where developing a character and their backstory is a bad thing. Plus, learning more about the ninja and their motivations against each other is one of the biggest aspects of Basilisk storywise, which is why I consider this an especially weak argument.*Quote nullified due to MAL guidelines*When all is said and done, despite a few shortcomings with the development of some plot points and characters alongside a near pointless recap episode, Basilisk still manages to break through those chains on virtually every other front. The melancholic, action-packed story references history now and again to create an interesting, fictitious twist on a time period that actually occurred in our world. The presentational aspects are phenomenal, with fluid, creative, and consistent animation, artwork, cinematography, and sound design far ahead of its time. Basilisk is also paced very nicely, going quicker than most but remaining engaging in spite of this. And while the characters hold some flaws, their discernible personalities, inherent uniqueness, fantastic designs, and relatability make for one of my favorite casts in all of fiction.From rewatch value to impact, or memorability to sheer enjoyment, Basilisk is a show that I enjoyed on a near unparalleled level as of writing this. Top that off with one of the most bittersweet, heartfelt, and well-written endings that I’ve ever had the pleasure to experience, and you have one hell of a fulfilling great time, with no alcohol required.Basilisk (2005) can easily be watched for free on Funimation and Crackle’s official websites, the latter being where I watched it, for reference. It is also viewable on Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, though you do have to pay for those. Also be sure not to confuse Basilisk with its supposedly god-awful follow-up made in 2018, Basilisk: The Ouka Ninja Scrolls. For some reason, the ratings all across the board for that one are downright laughable, so avoid running into that mess if you can help it, but I’ll digress there.“We are all the same in birth and in death. All of us are human. We need to break these bindings of hatred and revenge which hold us. We need to open our eyes to the other side. To the Iga, even if it is only one of them. Then that one we’ll try to know and better understand.”-Gennosuke Kouga, from Basilisk inside.Onto today’s show of discussion, however, we are going to look at what has been commonly referred to as one of the bona fide ninja anime experiences.

But why Basilisk? What is it that makes this spectacularly stellar Shōgun-centered story of sorrow so special to me and countless other people? How is it that Basilisk, a show seemingly chosen by aleatory means, quickly became my new favorite anime of all time? Fortunately for you guys and gals, that is precisely what I am about to explain.We begin with another continuous story, though the interesting thing to note about Basilisk is that most of the episodes actually start with a fascinating little introduction segment that I feel does a damn efficient job at explaining the basic premise.“Two tribes sworn to hate. Their bloodstained bodies left out in the open to rot. Their souls longing for a peace that they failed to find. As they sought to break the shackles of darkness and heal the wounds of the past, fate denied their quest, and thrust them into war. The bridges of hope some dared to build between them were torn asunder. Their dreams were ripped from their hearts with a sword, with a destiny revealed at last.”Sweet dreams tonight, by the way.*Story summary nullified thanks to MAL guidelines*The first aspect of Basilisk that I must commend rather auspiciously is that between the historical references, constantly rising tension, and depth of the story right off the bat (while still being surprisingly comfortable to jump into despite the mammoth-sized premise), all of the above strongly contribute to an engaging and original tale of tragedy and warfare from beginning to end. The story as a whole plays it surprisingly straight as well, seldom falling back on comedy since the main appeal lies in the serious conflicts and clashes that occur between the opposing factions.Another aspect that I find Basilisk to particularly excel in is the pacing department. For instance, virtually every one of the main characters is given just enough screen time to genuinely feel like a real character with their own personalities and motivations. I don’t say a real human because honestly, I would question if some of the tribes’ best fighters are even humans to begin with, but the development is strong and abundant here nonetheless. Perhaps the shining example of this statement lies within our protagonists, Gennosuke and Oboro. These two solemnly believe in a future where their factions can live in harmony, but as a result of the world they live in, they don’t get much of a say in the matter as they cannot change a 400-year long grudge overnight. Because of this, whether they like it or not, the former lovers must grow further apart from each other in their desperate attempt to control the war. Without the solid pacing, this conflict would feel far more trivial and/or less important than it actually is to the story.The independent elements of the narrative are also quite strong. To begin with, the main suspense of the story primarily comes from which characters are going to brawl next, and who out of them is going to remain alive. Here, it is predominantly thanks to the enticing scripting, well-established characters, and stunningly thrilling action that the suspense in Basilisk remains as strong as it is.But what makes the action in Basilisk work so well? While the fight scenes can border on the short side, whenever they occur, the cinematography thrashes out at the viewer with gory, fast-paced mayhem as the opposing ninja tribes lash out their many attacks and cunning surprises in the process. In that sense, I honestly find Basilisk as the damn poster boy for bloodbaths such as Castlevania, Drifters, and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Another point of interest is that it can actually be quite difficult to tell which characters are going to survive in the numerous battles, similar to Akame ga Kill. Furthermore, building upon the compelling cast and noteworthy action is that each of the 10 Kouga and Iga ninja have their own special ninja arts, with each characters’ being distinct, memorable, and most certainly destructive.To illustrate this point, take Koshiro Chikuma’s ability. While it is true that he is fantastic at dual-wielding kama (essentially weaponized sickles), Koshiro can also summon what I can only describe as miniature black-hole projectiles simply by softly blowing the air toward his targets. He must have grown up in Black Lagoon’s Roanapur to learn that shit, and here I was hoping he’d be giving out free concussions. At any rate, seeing and learning about each ninja’s signature technique is honestly one of the most fun parts of the show, but for now I shall digress.Additionally, the animation and art direction of Basilisk is as tight as 2005 could possibly muster. For starters, the artwork is surprisingly realistic overall, even for some of the tribe members that aren’t meant to be. The backgrounds are also very distinct, as each highly detailed backdrop of the series is carefully crafted around this ancient Japanese flair that I simply cannot get enough of. Moreover, the surroundings are constructed around Japan’s Sengoku period, which end up fitting the theme of Basilisk’s earlier, vicious world incredibly well. That is also to speak nothing of the creative, fitting character designs and fluid consistency all across the board, which provokes me to say with my utmost certainty that the animation in Basilisk spared no expense whatsoever. In fact, if you had told me the show had aired five or so years later, I probably would have believed you.To add upon the excellent animation and artwork aspects, cinematography is something I always consider quite heavily when it comes to anime, and Basilisk doesn’t slouch here either. Countless scenes in the series are presented with such visual flair and effort (probably a result of the phenomenal animation), showcasing quickly moving artwork alongside everchanging environments. From forests to dojos, oceans to towns, there exists plenty of variety within the world of Basilisk. These hold particularly true when you get to the copious amounts of fight scenes, which blitz through frames of animation like a cheetah on roller blades.The fact that Basilisk gets the sound department as its own talking point really illustrates how strong this aspect of the series is. Starting with the music here, while taste in composition is obviously subjective, I’d imagine it difficult to speak ill against the soundtrack of Basilisk. Above is the opening to the series, which features seamlessly transitioned shots on top of solid choreography all throughout. Good examples of this are Tenzen’s chilling moment in the spotlight around forty seconds in, or Gennosuke playing his recorder with Oboro’s hair blowing against the wind around a minute and twenty seconds in. The song itself is also fantastic, with a nice pace to it that really kicks in around two-thirds into the opening.I’d imagine it difficult to speak ill against the soundtrack of Basilisk.

The song itself is also fantastic, with a nice pace to it that really kicks in around two-thirds into the opening.Another stellar example of Basilisk’s soundtrack is the ending theme, of which there are actually two of. I’ve always personally preferred Hime Murasaki, as I think the instrumentation and tone better match the theme of the show. The other is called Wild Eyes, which sounds surprisingly optimistic for a series such as Basilisk, though it is still a good tune nevertheless.Of further notice is the spectacular background music which lies within Basilisk. I mentioned earlier the ancient Japanese flair I enjoyed from the backgrounds, and the music aims for the same dartboard in that sense.Finally, the voice acting I found pretty impressive as a whole. I watched the English Dub to be precise, and despite what some others may tell you, I strongly enjoyed the dub’s voicing of Basilisk’s colorful cast. Each actor matches their respective character role conspicuously well and range from decent to outstanding performances, with my favorite being Mark Stoddard’s take on the mendacious, cruel Tenzen. I have also heard many positive words regarding the Japanese voices, even though I obviously cannot speak for that myself.As if Basilisk didn’t have enough going for it already, the series has to be up there with shows like B: The Beginning, Black Cat, and Future Diary as one of my personal favorite casts in the anime world. While the number of supporting characters in Basilisk almost rivals the amount of terrible jokes in 2002’s The Master of Disguise, they are actually rather nicely balanced in terms of screen time and development. I have touched upon Basilisk’s pacing and its impact on the characters earlier, but also worth noting is how unique, relatable, and important most are to the story. C. Jarrett, an Amazon user, has to say about the cast as follows:“They’re all characters you can buy into. Not one-dimensional heroes who would never exist in the world we live in, they’re characters that have very human flaws, something that’s sorely needed in animated shows in general, and deal with very serious issues in a human and believable way. Gennosuke of the Kouga has a very mature yet zen energy. His unknown ability is revealed in the most shocking and dazzling of ways, frightening the Iga clan into helplessness in one of the most badass anime scenes of all time. Oboro is the perfect compliment, though not to imply she exists to compliment Gennosuke. She’s an incredible, fully-fledged character. Sweet, naive, and gives the story a warmth and innocence the other characters continually take away from the world around her. Her presence is like a personification of their world being torn apart and seeing her lashing out at the inevitability of it all is truly sorrowful. This is how main characters should be. They show insecurities, strengths, weaknesses, and a perseverance at the notion of getting to overcome their situation and see each other again as friends instead of enemies. I bought into them wholeheartedly. You will root for them the whole way which is what makes this a tragic anime through-and-through.”If I had to pick a favorite character, I would go with Koshiro Chikuma. I won’t regurgitate his already explained fighting capabilities, but in terms of development, Koshiro is way up there out of the supporting cast. He puts his life on the line to protect Oboro, the Iga heir, but is commonly being pushed around by Tenzen (also of the Iga clan), who we quickly find out to be the primary antagonist in this show. I really sympathize with Koshiro because he is among the most humane members of the Iga tribe when you get down to it (albeit for spoilerific reasons presented further below), but pitted against the Kouga, it’s like his only purpose in life is to kill or be killed. And despite Koshiro’s status as a veteran fighter, the mental pain he is forced to endure as the story progresses really makes the viewer feel for the lad.*MINOR SPOILERS HERE!*However, it’s when the story picks up after the first third that Koshiro really starts to shine in my eyes. The poor man is utterly blinded after Gennosuke of the Kouga uses his ninja technique on him, and from this point onward his character changes rather conspicuously from a threatening warrior to a thoughtful, emotionally destroyed soul with cognitive dissonance. Koshiro also begins to question Tenzen’s malevolent actions, and whenever Oboro is threatened or put in harm’s way, he practically falls to the ground in a state of melancholic defeat. There is also an incredibly cheerless scene with Koshiro shortly after he’s blinded where someone is approaching him near a river, completely unable to identify who it is. In a state of panic, he attempts to assault the unknown figure, only to figure out that it was only Akeginu of his fellow Iga clan. This emotionally demolishes Koshiro, as losing his vision had almost made him harm one of his own tribe members. Because of these moments and more to come, I feel that he is among the most strongly developed characters in the show and I always enjoy seeing him on screen.*MINOR SPOILERS END*One tangent to note that holds true for both sides, however, is that the more comrades they lose in battle, the tribes don’t just lose offensive support, but legitimate friends as well, with a dedicated flashback episode later in the show exemplifying this perfectly. And while Basilisk makes this incredibly evident for many of the lives lost, further contributing to the tragic aspect of the series, the clans still choose pursue this violent path of chaos that neither side truly benefits from. This is, however, entirely justified within the context of the show.To quote ThatAnimeSnob on Reddit, “You aren’t supposed to take the conflict at face value, but rather consider the following: The two factions were training all their lives for fighting. (Jared’s Note: This is illustrated very well regarding one scene in particular, with a discernibly young boy training outside with his mother, albeit against a mere fly.) Due to the 400-year long grudge, they hated each other and wanted to kill every member of the opposing clan. What with the next Shōgun being decided based on who would win, it was important to fight to the death. The ninja weren’t just following these orders, but were happy with them too…Honor was more important than life for them.”Despite the notable strengths of Basilisk, no piece of fiction on this planet is what I would consider flawless, and even this series is unfortunately not an exception to that rule. Despite this, the drawbacks to Basilisk are thankfully not too severe in the grand scheme of things, I state while desperately attempting not to use the word “however” for the novemdecillionth time.To preface this series of points, easily the most heinous of Basilisk’s crimes (in my opinion) is that the tenth episode is a rather ridiculously redundant recap of the show thus far, with some of the elder characters not in the Kouga or Iga reminiscing the current situation in the show. Not only is it presented far too early to leave much impact, but a distinctly minimal portion of the episode is actually dedicated to new information. Toss in the fact that many of the shots are reused animation, and you have bar none the worst episode in the entire series. It’s not abhorrent or anything, and seeing Lord Ieyasu or Masahiro (son of Hanzō the 1st) interpreting prior events is actually quite entertaining, not to mention the brand new parts not being half bad. But countless scenes from prior episodes here are replayed and rehashed pretty shamelessly. Therefore, I must question, the hell was the point of this?Another problem I experienced with Basilisk is that I feel some of the characters could have benefited from additional screen time and/or development, such as the blind and commonly silent bodyguard of Gennosuke, Hyouma Muroga. For a vast majority of the early story, he’s just sort of there with the Kouga, which acts as quite the juxtaposition compared to the rest of the clan at that point in the narrative.In addition, it’s interesting I bring that up because I have heard a complaint by one person online that Basilisk shouldn’t have focused on story to begin with, but rather the action. This reminds me of a time when I discussed Black Cat with one of my friends, with him stating that if it had focused more on thrilling fight segments rather than dreadfully discombobulating attempts at story, then it would have possessed far more merit. However, while I can agree with the argument a reasonable amount for a show like Black Cat (where the middle can drag on and the ending being somewhat confusing and unneeded), in Basilisk, the entire driving point and area of audience interest comes from the story itself, so I cannot agree with that sentiment for this particular series. Removing the plot in Basilisk would be like reading the text of a Shakespeare play as opposed to watching a live performance of one.I’ve even heard one person online argue that certain development is “wasted” on certain characters, Gyoubu’s relationship with his father being the example used. And I’m sorry, but I fail to see a world where developing a character and their backstory is a bad thing. Plus, learning more about the ninja and their motivations against each other is one of the biggest aspects of Basilisk storywise, which is why I consider this an especially weak argument.*Quote nullified due to MAL guidelines*When all is said and done, despite a few shortcomings with the development of some plot points and characters alongside a near pointless recap episode, Basilisk still manages to break through those chains on virtually every other front. The melancholic, action-packed story references history now and again to create an interesting, fictitious twist on a time period that actually occurred in our world. The presentational aspects are phenomenal, with fluid, creative, and consistent animation, artwork, cinematography, and sound design far ahead of its time. Basilisk is also paced very nicely, going quicker than most but remaining engaging in spite of this. And while the characters hold some flaws, their discernible personalities, inherent uniqueness, fantastic designs, and relatability make for one of my favorite casts in all of fiction.From rewatch value to impact, or memorability to sheer enjoyment, Basilisk is a show that I enjoyed on a near unparalleled level as of writing this. Top that off with one of the most bittersweet, heartfelt, and well-written endings that I’ve ever had the pleasure to experience, and you have one hell of a fulfilling great time, with no alcohol required.Basilisk (2005) can easily be watched for free on Funimation and Crackle’s official websites, the latter being where I watched it, for reference. It is also viewable on Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, though you do have to pay for those. Also be sure not to confuse Basilisk with its supposedly god-awful follow-up made in 2018, Basilisk: The Ouka Ninja Scrolls. For some reason, the ratings all across the board for that one are downright laughable, so avoid running into that mess if you can help it, but I’ll digress there.“We are all the same in birth and in death. All of us are human. We need to break these bindings of hatred and revenge which hold us. We need to open our eyes to the other side. To the Iga, even if it is only one of them. Then that one we’ll try to know and better understand.”-Gennosuke Kouga, from Basilisk', 'This anime seemed more realistic to the point of having ninja clans battle each other for the Shogun\'s enjoyment or to settle a score. This also screamed Japanese Romeo&Juliet and it made me wonder why didn\'t the two clans, who are obviously big enough together, attack and defy the Shogun\'s wives, more so than him. But the artwork was amazing and again, realistic, the music was catchy and the characters well developed as well as some of their backgrounds and relationships.Over-all it was a good anime that truly says ""Ignorance Is Bliss"" and ""Keep your friends close...But Keep your Enemies Closer"". ', 'Ok, so I figured this series would be a hole in one for me... a romantic (whether that be tragic or not) historical, ninja-drama....is right up my alley.  The overarching story is good, one you\'ve heard before ...forbidden love, warring clans, etc... With a slight twist on the reason why, but familiar grounds.Based on all those things...again normally this would be a home run but ....it was not.  I COULD have been, but wasn\'t....**Potential minor spoilers ahead**So...considering how truly difficult it was for me to watch this show for pretty much the ENTIRE first half....I mean I literally almost stopped watching it numerous...times .. I feel my rating of 7 is pretty kind.  And below is where I will tell you what the turning point was and why, etc...So for me the story and all that are fine...right, they are good. Sound was fair, art was fine, etc... That leaves the main focal points being characters and story...and we already said story was fine.The concept of supernatural abilities and ninjas ...sounds AWESOME to me.  BUT, what failed for me MAJORLY was how it was implemented....to me they took over the top ridiculous ass characters and shoved them into this serious and dramatic show...and if they were meant to be funny, ok, maybe but they just friggin sucked and made me want to stop watching.  It was not until most of those ridiculous ass characters were killed off that I could finally get into the show and enjoy the other really neat characters and story.For me the spider/phlegm ninja (really...phlegm, and a spider ball on his back...WTF), a hairy ass ...hair ninja, slimer...literally was like a damn rotten corpse walking around that could turn into ooze, a balloon man, and 90 year old rubber man....  I HATED these characters...every second of screentime they had made me want to rate this damn show a 2 and stop watching it.  The one guy literally had tufts....tufts of hair growing out of his nose, and he could use it to fight with....LOL.  I mean, soooooo stupid.  This TRULY almost killed this show for me....it was just beyond awful.So....my advice for anyone wanting to watch a cool supernatural ninja historical drama...is if you like ridiculous ass characters (think One Piece characters - which let me be clear....they WORK fine there...it\'s a totally different kind of show), maybe you\'ll LOVE this...but even then, I honestly don\'t see how anyone could enjoy those chars....  If you\'re like me though and felt that was over the top stupid to even have those in the show...and you can make it through like 10 or more episodes because you\'re super persistent....then there may be a silver lining for you.  I will talk about that below...So again, for me the above literally RUINED the entire first half of the show for me.  HOWEVER, don\'t think all the characters were pulled out of the trash like those...others had legit super interesting abilities and were interesting characters....they didn\'t feel like damn mutants or aliens that found there way in to the wrong damn show.  They had abilities that fit with the setting / story, and were still unique and intriguing.  Some of those great characters though, had WAY too little screentime, while the ones that made me want to shoot myself for watching this seemed to have WAY too much...BUT my point is hang in there, there are really interesting and cool chars.If you can get over that first half or that sort of thing doesn\'t bother you, this really does get much better toward then end.  It\'s more focused on just a few chars, who are cool, but not alien mutants in a ninja show... so the story really starts to shine a bit better and let\'s you appreciate the existing chars much better.I won\'t speak of the end, as I don\'t want to give anything away though, but let me just say that if I were to have rated this after the first few episodes...it would\'ve got like a 2...it just seemed over the top stupid to me.  If I would\'ve rated it halfway through, I would have at least gave it say a 5....I started to appreciate the things that I did not loathe more by that point.  BUT....if they would have made the first half more focused on legit ninja/powers and those type of chars.....this show may have got like a 9 from me....maybe....it was great at parts for sure.  BUT I cannot ignore how grueling it was to make it through the first part, so I really do think my 7 is a pretty ""nice"" rating considering that....but I am glad I watched this as the second half had lots of feels, focused on the much better chars, and so I really did enjoy that portion.If you decide to watch this...good luck. I think if you love ninja shows, and can get past the oddities that someone decided to throw in here, I really do think you\'ll enjoy it.  Just hope you are a patient person... times ..

The ones I liked the most died way too soon. Some of the more boring ones lived too long.As for the death scenes, they are powerful and wonderfully executed. Bravo.Here is what annoyed me though: It is usually a cheap tatic in anime to show a bland charcters sad backstory right before they die to make the viewer more sensitive to his/her death. Its cheap manipulation that is sometimes necessary when the directors want you to...feel sad, but the character might not be good enough to evoke that feeling upon his/her death.The above is exactly what happens in Basilisk. I lost count of how many times a death scene or a fight (that leads to death) is interrupted for MINUTES just to tell the dying characters little sob story to manipulate their death into being more emotionally powerful. Here is the thing though IT WASNT NEEDED. Some characters are better than others, but pretty much all of them were good enough to have an impactful death, especially when such death scenes are well directed.Other than that, this is nicely animated, story is cool, dark and aimed at adults.

I want to hate it but frankly there is no better way to end it. They both knew that if they escaped the ninja war would have been pointless, their clans would be targeted by the government, and the non decision with respect to the heir would cause a civil war.

None of them wanted to kill the other but they couldnt escape the situation, so oboro ended her life.

It is the excellent characterisation that makes Basilisk stand out; nearly all of the individuals appearing in the story are two-dimensional and have more depth than you would suspect at first glance. While the plot itself is relatively simple, the series is worth watching because of how it is handled. The repercussions of someone being hurt are not glossed over and the anime is much, much more than just a blood-fest. If you are looking for something that is just about the action,...then this story is not necessarily the right choice because you are forced to sit down and think about what is transpiring on-screen. Though not incredibly complex in nature, the series does raise a few questions about vengeance and corrupt politics.Another highlight is that the animation remains relatively consistent and the musical score is nice. then this story is not necessarily the right choice because you are forced to sit down and think about what is transpiring on-screen.

What makes _Basilisk_ special is that it resists the trend towards dilution of the \'ninja\' concept into just super-powered samurais throwing chi-balls and shuriken in the vein of _Naruto_ (although there are still plenty of bizarre powers and characters such as the snake-like Jimushi Jubei) but takes a much more brutal and yakuza-film-like approach: ""all warfare is deception"". _Basilisk_ plays with deception, information, and vision to an extent I can\'t remember seeing in any other series. For example, based on the first episode, one expects...a quick descent into all-out warfare, and the tragic Romeo & Juliet ending of our two protagonists blatantly foreshadowed and my own reaction was to wonder how this plotline could possibly take up a full 2 cours/24 full episodes and whether I had perhaps made a mistake - and episode 2 totally confounds my expectations by *one side stealing the announcement* while the other side remains totally unaware that there is even a war on! This provides tremendous dramatic tension as they must balance the reward of ambushes and surprise attacks against the risk of alerting the others that they are no longer at peace. The issue of knowledge remains a theme throughout with shapeshifter Saemon\'s many appearances, particularly in impersonating a dead ninja and fooling his girlfriend Hotarubi; cruel as that was, the knife is twisted even further in one of the most memorable deaths in _Basilisk_. The protagonists are too good and pure to be at all sympathetic or interesting, but thankfully they only occasionally take center stage and the other characters get ample time on screen, the better to enjoy the twists and well-animated violence. (While many ninja shows set the action at night almost to a fault, _Basilisk_ fairly evenly allocates day/night scenes.) Overall, definitely one of the best ninja anime I\'ve seen. a quick descent into all-out warfare, and the tragic Romeo & Juliet ending of our two protagonists blatantly foreshadowed and my own reaction was to wonder how this plotline could possibly take up a full 2 cours/24 full episodes and whether I had perhaps made a mistake - and episode 2 totally confounds my expectations by *one side stealing the announcement* while the other side remains totally unaware that there is even a war on!

Overall, definitely one of the best ninja anime I\'ve seen.', 'Dark, violent, and tragic, Basilisk tells the story of two warring ninja clans during the era of the Tokugawa Shoguns.  The plot picks up immediately and is fairly fast-paced.  Between intense action sequences, however, is also an exploration of the motives (both personal and political, petty and profound) behind the struggle, as well as its very real human cost - especially in the case of two star-crossed lovers.  Beneath the surface, the story lends itself a very Shakespearean air.One caveat is that you\'ll have to suspend disbelief when it comes to their ""ninja skills,"" some of which come off more like ""super...powers"" than anything a ninja could possess - acquired or genetic.Another notion viewers may find difficult to grasp are some of driving factors behind decisions characters choose, or seem forced, to make.  It is just as much an expose into historical Japanese culture, which - unlike the highly individualistic West - emphasized duty and obligation over personal feelings or desires, seen as ""selfish"" or even dangerous to society.  Also, they are much less likely to verbally express emotion, so expressions and gestures - even small ones - communicate much.  Some touching moments betray more than words ever could.The animation, of course, is top-notch.  Everything is beautifully illustrated with clean lines, deep shades, and vibrant hues.  Especially striking are the full moon and falling sakura in the opening and ending credits.  Breathtaking!The show is definitely for mature audiences, featuring bloody violence, nudity, and sexual content.Deeply compelling from start to finish, Basilisk is very highly recommended! powers"" than anything a ninja could possess - acquired or genetic.Another notion viewers may find difficult to grasp are some of driving factors behind decisions characters choose, or seem forced, to make.

Believe me, I'd love to make a great review, but this entire series really WAS nothing more than mindless slaughter.Story - 3. They give extensive background and put great effort into the details of the story; however, the story did nothing to build on the events that took place. In fact, so much so that the background seemed more like it was shaped in order to try and make sense of why there'd be nothing but death. This series really does show that there is...no such thing as good and bad in war.Art - 10. Though I gave a poor rating for the story, I was fascinated by the art. Basilisk did a great job pulling off actions which I questioned the possibility of achieving.Sound - 5. Really, they had no real soundtrack, the opening was the same throughout the entire series, and it rubbed me the wrong way.Character - 10. Great Character development, they all had expressed background history and how they related to one another. Basilisk also did a good job in showing that everyone really does have two faces. Everyone had a face they'd show towards their enemy, and a face they showed towards friends and family.Enjoyment - 2. Awful, As much as they story was developed, I've already written, that nothing goes on but fights, death, and hell. It may have a tad bit of romantic love, but it really was nothing more than foreshadow and buildup towards the climax. In the end, love is tossed aside in this show like it never existed.Overall - 6. That's what the average is, a fair 6, but this really isn't a series worth watching, unless the watcher has a twisted obsession for watching the darkness in humans who know nothing but war against each other.EDIT: I will give them props however, for they did create quite a touching ending in the last episode before the final battle. I was unaware that the maker could do such a thing at the time because I've only seen until episode 23 when I wrote this review, and I've seen nothing less than bloodshed and hell bent warriors. no such thing as good and bad in war.Art - 10.

The inherent problem they have is that they are never about the story or the characters; it’s about seeing people die and, supposed, feeling sad about them. Only thing, you can’t feel sad about them because they die too quickly, too close to each other, and you already know that they will die at some point, so who gives a shit? It ends up becoming more like a game where you are cynically trying to guess who...will die next. And even that becomes boring after awhile because as the contestants lower in numbers, it becomes easier to guess right, while at the same time, more apparent to tell who is clearly better than the rest or more favored by the story writer and is going to win at the end.Battle Royale is a very old manga by now, and yet nobody figured out all these years why it works so well, despite suffering from the same issues. It’s because its contestants have no superpowers. They had talents which, for the most part, where within the realm of reason, and felt very plausible. Said talents were not giving them that much of a head start over everyone else, and were still things everybody knew they possessed right away. All other death games fail because they try to throw in so much supernatural nonsense it becomes impossible to take the whole thing seriously. One can teleport, one can fly, one is immortal, and nobody knows the other guy’s powers until he is about to die. Although keeping your powers secret is fun, if keeping them hidden is the only thing that makes them work, renders pointless the kind of power you have in the first place. It doesn’t matter what strategy you use to exploit the other guy’s weaknesses, it only matters if you keep it a secret. So what’s the point of having crazy powers? You can have something as simple as a hidden dagger in your sleeve, and it wouldn’t make any difference next to a guy who shoots lasers from his eyes.Not only Basilisk made that grave mistake, it also made it worse by having characters that look like monsters. Despite being a colorful bunch the series revolves around just 3 of them; the main romantic couple and the imba immortal. They are the only ones you care for, not only because they matter to the plot but also because they look normal. The rest of them either are useless cannon fodder, or look like ugly mutants, accompanied by a silly voice and some really crazy ninja power. You cannot see them as people with some sort of drama surrounding them; you see them as Pokemons. Oh look, it’s the scaly guy who turns to water, and the bald guy who can walk through walls. It makes the whole thing seem like a silly kaiju movie from the 60s.Even if you try to watch the anime as a spectacle full of action and gore, Basilisk is still pretty bad but not because of pretty colors and nice sounds. Visually and acoustically the series is quite good, with detailed characters designs, magnificent sceneries, moody music score, and interesting battle choreography. What ruins it, is the two ninja clans that are fighting each other to the death not being balanced at all. They keep saying that they have equal chances of winning, and yet you constantly see the Kouga being obviously stronger and smarter than the Iga.1) The Kouga lost half their people because the Iga kept the order of annihilation hidden for several episodes. As soon as the Kouga found out about it, they even the score, despite being outnumbered and unprepared.2) The Iga were not wiped out right away, only because one of them is immortal. Half of the Kouga were killed only because they could not kill this guy no matter how powerful they were.3) Two of the Kouga can kill anyone they want by simply looking at him. No Iga had the slightest chance against that.4) The leader of the Iga is a crybaby who refused to do the slightest thing until the final episode. The leader of the Kouga is a badass who kicks ass right away.You know which team is going to win right away. And no, death games are not meant to be fair, or to have only balanced participants. It’s just that there is no challenge if it’s so obviously one-sided. And yes, there are many cases when the weaker guy wins, and it’s always because he kept his power a secret, or back stabbed a completely unsuspected opponent. It’s not a worthy victory, you cannot cheer for him, because he didn’t deserve to win. Not to mention how pretty much everybody in this show dies in a miserable way. There is no catharsis, they just die and kiss personal goals goodbye. And I am not saying that everyone deserves a heroic death, but it really makes the viewer not give a shit if the whole series is a monument of unfairness, based on imbalanced power levels which eventually mean nothing and overshadow any attempt at drama.And wait, it gets even worse. Eventually you realize that none of them have control over their actions. They are all peons, controlled by the nobles. They never chose to fight each other, they were ordered to. Yeah, they did hate each other but they never took the initiative; they were always waiting for orders. And if you think that makes them noble because they were loyal to their masters, that assumption crumbles as soon as you see how they try to kill their opponents by cheating. As for their masters, it’s not like they are better either. Aside from being nothing but an excuse for the whole extermination to happen, they don’t even care about their ninjas. In fact, the real reason they want the two clans to fight each other, is so they can exterminate both, as means to not be a problem in the future. Meaning, there was never supposed to be a winner in this stupid war; they were all meant to die at the end. So why were we even watching this show? To watch mindless drones killing each other because nobody wants them? What is the point of all this?Even the show becomes worse as it goes on. The pacing slows down more and more, because the amount of people left alive becomes smaller as time goes by. It was fun at first because of the variety and the mystery surrounding their powers, but then you get to see less and less things, about less and less people, of which you already know everything about. Even the ending is a mess. You don’t really understand what exactly happened. All three remaining warriors were so hax (and so painfully obvious they would be the ones in the finale) that it’s hard to figure out how their powers worked against each other. And it’s not like it matters much either, since by now you feel like shit since you know you are watching people die because of orders by leaders who don’t care.It’s so easy to figure out a way for how all this mess could have worked much better. If we had the stupid Iga being wiped out in a few episodes by the superior Kuga, and if our two lovebirds had run away from all this mess, we would have an actually good story going on, where they are chased by the Kouga, who are still supposed to be annihilated by the shogunate. It would still leave the show as a death game, while spicing things a lot, even after most of them would be dead. But nope, instead of this obviously better story I came up with in 5 seconds, all we got was a lukewarm death game, with Pokemon ninjas, unfair battles, and a boring finale. will die next.

Last time i gave up on the show because the art was looking to old for me. But recently i have been looking at older animes and wanted to give it a second shot.The first few minutes of the show got me hooked. You can witness a great fight scene with some special ability, but noting to extreme.Then as the show went on, i started to look at the clock. The story didnt seem to move and the character where a bit...plain. Well i am happy that i stick to it as the show got better after the 6-7 first episode.So should you watch it or not ? Well don't go into it expecting a good story, but if you are looking for good fight and someting different than the usuak tournament style fight we see, then Bacilisk can be a good option. plain.

This anime is sad and is intended for mature audience to watch. it has blood and some gore in it but if you are over 18+ and looking for some mature romance anime then this might be a good one for you.in...my opinion it deserve a better score but since it has so much blood i can understand some people got turn off by that. my opinion it deserve a better score but since it has so much blood i can understand some people got turn off by that."", 'Without expecting much i ran into this anime ...There are several ways one can feel about any piece of entertainment, like anime series, game, movie or novel.Amongs thouse we liked there are pieces who are simply decentThere are pieces we enjoyed watching but we forget about them 5 min later as we move on to other things and diffrent titles.And there are some that we enjoy that much we actualy seek anything ralated to it desperatly trying to prolong that experience.Basilisk isnt series that qualifies to eighter to this categories.It is one of thouse rare masterpieces - completed within its form - that...burns a mark on souls of thouse who choose to expeirence it, lingering in ones hart, cousing unrest of the spirits withing ourselfs.It is a rare trait to any piece of movie, anime, game, novel to be able to tough ones innermost feelings, to apeal to emotions and values hidden in day-to-day lifes.

The first few episodes I was expecting a real sympathy for either Iga or Koga, but I gathered that I could not have real sympathy for either side. My attention focused more on the fights than the story which was not the thick plot I expected beforehand. The story\'s entertaining but don\'t expect a very original...plot.Art: The visuals are really stunning. Nice use of panoramas and the fights are really well executed. I like the Edo era and its authenticity is something I appreciate. Some characters look strange though such as Shogen and Jingoro. This diminishes the otherwise realistic representation of the environment.Sound: The sound itself is realistic, even the gorey sounds. The music fits really well and makes use of classical instruments which makes you feel you\'re really in the past. None of the music really stands out for me, so it can\'t earn more than a decent 7.Character: This left me wanting more. Most characters had one particular character trait and it was just repeated over and over again. Some of the men were perverts and they stayed that way, some of the women could fight but were actually squishy. Even from the two main characters we don\'t learn that much except that they were always good persons, why they want peace was never really clear. Well there\'s this mantra about stopping the endless cycle of hate, but you don\'t really get any further than that.Enjoyment: I\'ll be short on this one, the fights are great and the background stories entertaining.It did lack this ""I gotta see the next episode right now"" feeling but the series is definitely not a bore!Overall: I was expecting an anime like ""Samurai Champloo"" providing an alternate history on the Tokugawa era. But that wasn\'t really the case. With great art and exciting fight scenes I could enjoy myself with the series.It\'s unconventional to have an anime without a clearly distinct good vs evil story, I give the writers props for that.  For entertainment value, it\'s a solid 8. plot.Art: The visuals are really stunning. Nice use of panoramas and the fights are really well executed.

Contrary to popular belief- Quality samurai anime are hard to come by, and few in number. Certainly, the number I can count is less than ten. For my part I can only come up with six, no, make that seven other ""great"" samurai anime: Rurouni Kenshin, Katanagatari, Samurai Seven, Samurai Champloo, Mononoke, Shigurui: Death Frenzy and Ninja Scroll. Sword of the Stranger and can be added onto that list too based off preference, but that\'s really it. Afro Samurai has great swordplay and animation but, well, a very lackluster...story. Berserk, Claymore, and Attack on Titan (Akame ga Kill can be thrown in there too, I guess, at least until Episode 19 or so.) are fantastic swordplay fantasy anime that aren\'t based in Eastern Tradition. Knights, rather than Samurai. Thick western-style claymores rather than Katanas and Kunais and Shurikens. You get the idea. Characters like Guts and the premise/world of Claymore & Attack on Titan have much more in common with mythical western cannon like Beowulf than they do The Book of Five Rings. I disagree with the idea that Fate/Zero is a ""classic"", but even so it\'s still an urban fantasy which means, based off that fact alone, that it is western based. There\'s always Mushi-Shi, I suppose, but anyone that\'s seen Mushi-Shi (or its recent sequel season) knows that Mushi-Shi constitutes a separate and unique category of anime in and of itself. It does have enough to stand among the seven other shows I mentioned earlier, however.With all these criteria and conditions in mind- it doesn\'t leave us a lot left to work with. But that\'s exactly my point. Quality samurai anime, again, contrary to popular belief are very few in number. Fortunately, Basilisk can--and should-- be considered as one of those greats. I\'ve noticed many other reviewers on here have criticized Basilisk (particularly its story) as being cliché and whatnot. While I would agree that anyone familiar with Ninja Scroll would find striking similarities: I\'d like any of those viewers to provide a single Eastern-based anime series that supplies a set of characters and isn\'t afraid to whittle them down to nothing. Of the seven shows I mentioned, the only other show to do this is Samurai Seven. (Which, coincidentally, was made the previous year by the same studio as Basilisk: Gonzo.) Every other show mentioned, in traditional Western storytelling tradition, follows one or two ""epic"" characters on a series of miscellaneous adventures. Fate/Zero and Akame Ga Kill do follow the outlined principle sort of, but everyone that\'s read the latter\'s manga knows that the ending of Akame ga Kill is completely contrived in relation to its source material. While in Fate/Zero the ""actual"" story happens after the events of series. Many would claim this argument as nickpicky: I\'d like to remind them that the qualities we take for granted as ""cliché"" and ""archetypical"" are because of shows like Basilisk. The show came out in 2005, people. Basilisk is important because it provides a unique contrast to the shounen like Naruto and Bleach which are plagued by tropes that, in my opinion, hold the shows back from ever being ""truly"" great. Basilisk may not be perfect, but the show does represent a step in the right direction that has enough merits ""right"" with it to stand out as one of the best anime of the early 2000s. Since Basilisk, very few (if any) shows continue the ideas presented within its 24 episodes. For this reason alone, I\'d recommend Basilisk over Naruto/Bleach any day of the week. Fortunately Basilisk also has a lot else going for it.Let\'s get some fundamentals out of the way: For those unfamiliar with Basilisk- it is a story of two would-be lovers who are the heads of their clan who, tragically, are separated by an outbreak of hostilities between their two factions. Each side has ten ninja that, including the two main characters, must fight each other until the death to help decide a successor to the retired shogun. (As to avoid a civil war.) Basilisk, at its heart, is a story that brings back sword-action to its Ninja Scroll basics: ninjas killing each other with a variety of techniques. Some fantastical. Some not. In any case- each scene is very graphic and tense.Basilisk stands up well to any modern anime in the technical department. Granted, I watched the show in 1080p from a blu ray (released courtesy of Funimation) played on a 50 inch Sony at night. For anyone fortunate enough to have a similar set up, it is quite an amazing experience that I do recommend. Basilisk is quite astounding in that regard, and--at the very least--pleasantly surprising. It does have that ""roo-rah!"" high-octane action sequences (particularly in the beginning) of unique characters fighting and mauling and killing each other in every episode. These characters and scenes gave me something of a Black Lagoon type of vibe. Many of the characters, for their part, condone the extreme violence against their enemies. But the core ""backbone"" of Basilisk is a combination between Romeo and Juliet and anime movie Ninja Scroll. For those select few that aren\'t familiar with Ninja Scroll (or haven’t watched it) I\'d firstly recommend you watch it before watching Basilisk. It isn\'t necessary, per se, but to be quite frank the two productions complement each like opposite sides of the same coin. Basilisk is a spiritual successor of sorts to Ninja Scroll. The reason why they’re so similar is that the movie Ninja Scroll, released more than a decade before Basilisk, is a loose rendition of the same source material: a novel called The Kouga Ninja Scrolls that was released in Japan in the 50s. Instead of showing two warring ninja factions like Basilisk, however, the movie takes a Die Hard approach as a small group of unlikely heroes/heroines overcome a criminal conspiracy composed of another group of evil rouge ninja. The tragic romance is still there- in a different sort of way. Many people who witness both productions prefer Ninja Scroll to Basilisk, but from what I understand Basilisk is an almost word-for-word recreation of the original story in the anime medium. A more faithful rendition of the source material that so many other anime are lambasted for failing. The two are similar, but still different enough to warrant separate viewings. In my case I enjoyed both equally, and I for one am glad that Basilisk was created. Many other reviewers on here, in their clamor to forewarn of the distinct similarities to productions like Ninja Scroll, lose sight of the important differences between Basilisk and most other conventional anime series. Differences such as the violent and graphic deaths most of the characters endure. Differences such as the fact that Basilisk wasn’t afraid to, with purposeful intent, leave plot lines hanging in the wake of character deaths. Differences in the action sequences- which are bloody and believable which compared to more mild shows like Naruto do not feel contrived. For example, characters do not stop time to chant their ability. Characters that are stuck in sticky situations usually do die in said sticky situations- there’s very few (if any) Deus Ex moments that characters “magically” come up with a new solution. Each character has a unique technique, which, upon being presented to the viewer, is kept consistent for the rest of the series. I for one think that as a major plus.To be frank, the show just fundamentally works. The sound. The visuals, Everything comes together for a quality production that presents an experience that nearly any action-oriented viewer can immerse oneself in. Even those that are “into” more modern anime series like Black Lagoon or Hellsing Ultimate. While the ultimate outcome of Basilisk’s story seems obvious and is presented in almost any description of it- the show has a deeper web of intricacies that are a joy to uncover. From the very first episode the show makes it a point to foreshadow to the viewer the imminent outcome. While there are still some tropes the show does follow. Aggravating tropes such as having the female protagonist be subservient to the point of near-absurdity. Tropes of body figure where some characters appear to be designed unnecessarily malicious or villainous compared to how they are later presented in the story. The English translation is at best bearable, but at worst horrible. Finally, the story does sometimes feel as if it was meant to be grander than the confines of 24 episodes. I agree with other reviewers’ criticisms in character development; some characters do not get enough screen time. But my issues with Basilisk’s character development are to a much lesser extent than others. The story’s first five episodes are a stark vision to how the rest of the show could have been given a longer (or shorter) timeframe to work with. Some parts do seem to drag at times. But a viewing of any of the show’s many action sequences will remind the viewer again and again of just how high the show reaches from these mellow lows.Basilisk stands out. There’s no question about that. It stands—and will continue to stand—the test of time. Go watch it. Or better yet- go buy it on Blu Ray. Know, however, what to expect. A classic though this may be it does have its flaws, but with a moderate level of patience and time investment will mean any interested viewer will not leave disappointed. The legend of the Kouga and Iga clans will live on in the reaches of your imagination for a long time following this.Thanks for reading,Blitzburns4 story.

I generally enjoy any media about ninjas, and this “supposedly” had a Romeo x Juliet love-story. Of course, I was sold! Unfortunately, the execution, flat characters, and the general angst and unwarranted bloodiness the show is drenched in turned me off. For starters, I was surprised by the ninjas' zany, X-Men-like abilities, but I let it go. Some historical fantasy can be fun.First, I fully understand a show about ninjas could (and probably should) get bloody/realistic, but, here, the deaths hold no weight. Characters die gruesomely (some worse than others), but I...feel nothing. The show doesn’t develop any of the characters, save for one flashback at the most, so no amount of blood splatter, shocked faces, or sad music in the background can save a lifeless corpse of a character. The death toll kept rising, and I kept shrugging.Admittedly I liked Gennosuke’s bushy eyebrows and mysteriousness, but there wasn’t much to him. He didn’t want any more war, and he seemed kind. Great. Oboro, the female love interest, is utterly useless. All she does is CRY, and the one ability she has gets locked away by her own doing. Bruh.This show doesn’t deliver on the romance either. Where is the yearning? The kiss scene(s)? I need to believe these two are in love, but their only moments together are Gennosuke playing the flute and Oboro dancing around. Perhaps, the time period and arranged-marriage makes them so chaste and distant, but you could at least hold hands. Or look into each other’s eyes, or something substantial. Is this the woman you love so much you would defy a centuries’-long resentment, or is she a lampshade with lipstick? Answer quickly.Also, I don’t care if the creator never admits to it. A character that consists of raw demon trash is the show’s favorite character/creator’s pet. There are definitely heinous characters who would try to sexually assault a character. My problem is the continual parading him around in our faces. This character literally tried to raped his own comrade, not just a woman from a rival clan. He had no limitations. I hated seeing this character be a part of the main cast. Usually, rapists in anime are filler characters or outright villains, and usually it’s one and done. There were too many rape scenes here. His death is so prolonged it feels like torture.In addition, the way female ninjas were handled bothered me. One character has such a sexist suffering. She’s tied up, fully naked, has been raped, and brutalized. No other ninja is treated like this (maybe Okoi to a lesser extent). I'm not so naive to think women, who are prisoners of war, don't get treated as such, but it felt majorly gratuitous. Akeginku’s titties stay out for no other reason than fan service too. Yes, I’m aware female ninjas often used seduction tactics/sex, but the execution here felt cheesy.::MISCELLANEOUS::The pacing seemed unbalanced. Clan A has the upper-hand for over 7-8 episodes. Talking. Clan B eventually finds out, but they already have a huge deficit. Clans try to outdo each other. Oboro cries. Filler episode that should have been in the beginning. Flashback. People be dying. Rapist dude doesn’t get his comeuppance. People be dying. Rinse. Repeat until the last two episodes.I watched the Japanese dub, and I have no qualms about the voice acting. It’s very good. One character sounded like literal gargled death. Very talented performance from his voice actor, but I definitely muted him.The music was forgettable. I didn’t pay attention to it.The animation was fine. No wacky in-between shots and it looked pretty fluid. Because the show is SO angsty, the coloring appeared ashy at night. Very dark gray or blue. Again, I liked Gennosuke’s bushy eyebrows. He looked very dashing. Hyoma had an interesting design. The ladies of the show were pretty. The more mutant-like ninjas weren't cool to look at, but they served their purpose.::POSITIVES::I liked Saemon. He was a ninja who had some empathy. As the show progresses, he doesn’t stop killing, but he’s able to see the other clan as human beings. A nice touch to show both clans had desires/dreams/loved ones, but they were too fixated on a dumb war.Gennosuke and Hyoma had nice designs.Koushiro had a fun power. I would’ve liked to see it more.Overall, I don’t recommend. For me, I had no enjoyment from this show, and I shouldn’t have wasted my Saturday binge-watching it. feel nothing.

I can\'t believe how much I fell in love with this show and characters! The characters and story will have a special place in my memories for a very long time and it\'s a show that I can easily re-watch, even with knowing who dies.Story: The death battles really are engaging and something that Basilisk deserves props for is that it\'s not afraid to kill off it\'s characters. There were many characters that I thought would make it to the end, or at least, not die so early. Having those stakes makes the fight scenes, which are...animated beautifully, even more exciting! Before reading the rest of the review: If you want a good action series please watch this!Art and Animation: Now the first thing I took notice to were the character designs and visuals. I can tell the artists in charge of this show are talented and put a lot of craft into it because the quality was crisp, clean and beautiful consistently throughout 24 episodes. Not only is it incredibly gorgeous from 2005, but I would say it holds up even better than shows made recently in the 2020s.Characters: The character designs are pretty unique for the most part, however, there are a few characters that look too similar (Akeginu and Kagero for example). I\'ve seen others complain about the less humanoid looking ones, however, I think that adds to it\'s charm and diversity in designs.The characters themselves I found to be enjoyable, likeable and loveable. Oboro and Gennosuke are two likeable protagonists and lovers, however, with how timid Oboro is I can see her putting a lot of people off. The side characters are engaging and all have their own unique traits in terms of personality and/or abilities that make them great to seen on the screen. I can guarantee that if you watch this you will love at least one of them, if not a handful.Sound: The Japanese voice acting was pretty good, and I don\'t remember there being a character that was bad. Nana Mizuki absolutely takes the cake for the best acting. She is gentle when she needs to be and will pull on your heartstrings whether it\'s through sadness or anger.I don\'t think I\'ve never heard a voice actor/actress give me chills like she did in certain scenes.The music is good and the sounds fit the scenes they\'re intended for, however, I wouldn\'t say any of them stuck besides the ""Hime Murasaki"" song that plays at the end of certain episodes.Overall: Please give Basilisk a view if you\'re still not sure. I wouldn\'t say it\'s the most polished in terms of story, the last few episodes didn\'t hold up to the rest of it, which it what brought my score down a little bit. The ending seems to divide the community, however, I do believe it fits the story. animated beautifully, even more exciting!

Not only is it incredibly gorgeous from 2005, but I would say it holds up even better than shows made recently in the 2020s.Characters: The character designs are pretty unique for the most part, however, there are a few characters that look too similar (Akeginu and Kagero for example). I\'ve seen others complain about the less humanoid looking ones, however, I think that adds to it\'s charm and diversity in designs.The characters themselves I found to be enjoyable, likeable and loveable. Oboro and Gennosuke are two likeable protagonists and lovers, however, with how timid Oboro is I can see her putting a lot of people off. The side characters are engaging and all have their own unique traits in terms of personality and/or abilities that make them great to seen on the screen. I can guarantee that if you watch this you will love at least one of them, if not a handful.Sound: The Japanese voice acting was pretty good, and I don\'t remember there being a character that was bad. Nana Mizuki absolutely takes the cake for the best acting. She is gentle when she needs to be and will pull on your heartstrings whether it\'s through sadness or anger.I don\'t think I\'ve never heard a voice actor/actress give me chills like she did in certain scenes.The music is good and the sounds fit the scenes they\'re intended for, however, I wouldn\'t say any of them stuck besides the ""Hime Murasaki"" song that plays at the end of certain episodes.Overall: Please give Basilisk a view if you\'re still not sure. I wouldn\'t say it\'s the most polished in terms of story, the last few episodes didn\'t hold up to the rest of it, which it what brought my score down a little bit. The ending seems to divide the community, however, I do believe it fits the story.', 'Story 5/10The worst part about this anime is just how predictable and straight forward this story is. It almost feels like watching a ""let\'s play"" video of a fighting game where each episode should be titled something like Jingoro vs. Gyoubu or Nenki vs. Hotorubi.This anime definitely has a cool premise, but where it fails is its execution with every episode just being another long fight scene making the story feel like mindless violence. There are a couple of scenes where we see the characters not fighting and just relaxing together, but it just feels like an intermission between the fights that adds nothing to...the plot.Furthermore, another problem with this anime is its lack of world building or exposition. All of the ninja have these crazy powers, but it\'s never explained where their powers come from or how they work. For example, Kazamachi is like this half-human half-spider thing that spits acid and eats people\'s brains, but it\'s never explained why. Was he bit by a radioactive spider? Is he possessed by some spider demon? Is he a mutant born with those powers?Characters 7/10Not just the story, but the characters too feel like they\'re right out of a fighting game where all we learn about them is their name, what attacks they can use, and nothing else.Part of the reason for this problem is this anime has such a big cast of characters and they all get such little screen time. A character maybe in one or two episodes and then they die. This problem is made even worse by the fact every character has the exact same motivation which is revenge. Why do the Kouga hate the Iga? ""Because the Igga killed our ancestors!"" Why do the Iga hate the Kouga? ""Because the Kouga killed our ancestors?""The only characters who we learn anything about and go through any kind of development are Gennosuke and Oboro, but they\'re both far from ideal protagonists.While I do like the drama of this forbidden romance Gennosuke and Oboro have, it\'s undermined by how quickly Gennosuke turns his back on Oboro when he learns the peace treaty has been dissolved and how little emotion he shows. Seriously, it looks like he doesn\'t even struggle with his decision; it\'s like he hears ""we\'re at war with the Iga"" and then says ""well, I guess the weddings off. Bye.""Oboro is even worse with how it seems like she\'s trying to best Sakura from Naruto and steal her title as the WORST NINJA EVER! Oboro is such a burden to the other characters who constantly risk their own lives protecting her. Furthermore, I don\'t know if you can call it taking the moral high road to just do nothing and close your eyes as your friends and family are dying and you have the power to help them.Art 8/10While the story and characters maybe unimpressive, one thing that does stand out about this anime is it\'s art.The fight scenes are really cool with the ninjas having all kinds of different powers and the ninjas themselves having interesting character designs like Jingoro is like a human-slug and Josuke being a human-blob.Another aspect of the art I liked is the backgrounds. While other anime like Naruto are set in their own unique world, the animators clearly were striving for more realism here while doing a good job depicting 17th century Japan with the clothes the characters wear, the architecture of the buildings, and other things like the boat and the palanquin.Overall 7/10While I do really like the idea of a ninja war, this anime really should offer more than just have one fight scene after another while leaving no room for character development thereby making the story just seem like mindless violence.However, the fights scenes are really good and there is some character development between Gennosuke and Oboro.

The animation was great overall, but phenomenal in some places especially with the backgrounds and man did the wolves...look majestic as hell.Will definitely recommend anyone to check it out since the characters grow on you a lot as you story builds up. look majestic as hell.Will definitely recommend anyone to check it out since the characters grow on you a lot as you story builds up."", 'This donghua is an adaptation of a novel, and has a manhua adaptation as well. While I have not read the novel, I did a quick skim of the manhua adaptation to get a feel of the story. I will make some comments on what I felt were the most obvious changes in the donghua adaptation.Plot Summary: Ren XiaoXu, our MC, is a refugee class person, living outside the walled enclaves in a post-apocalyptic dystopian society. The harsh lives that he and his brother lead causes him to strive to enter the city as an actual citizen. Toward this goal, he works hard to earn...money and master his supernatural power/system to strengthen himself while protecting himself and his family. Follow Ren XiaoSu as he navigates this world and slowly strengthens himself with his supernatural power/system.The First Order is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world, where around 200 years have passed since the fall of the greater civilization. We follow Ren XiaoSu, our MC, in his journey to navigate the world while protecting his family and friends and learning about his ""superpower"". Yes, there are a small percentage of people who have awakened a kind of supernatural power that cannot be explained with ""science"". The story in this first season depicts Ren XiaoSu as he starts to navigate his superpower; his superpower resembles the classic system or game quest system, which is used to great or comedic effect. We as viewers are much like the MC in that we know very little about the world, so we learn about the world through him as well. The plot presentation is great this way, as the info dumping that we usually see in cultivation donghua is not here; this makes the story easy to follow and understand.Starting episode 4, there are some ending segments that ""talk"" to the viewers, kind of like a Q&A that helps flesh out the world a bit without being too much of an info dump; it is a nice touch to help out the world/history building in this donghua.Each of the important characters are unique in their own way. The MC is a survivalist and displays the necessary skills and knowledge that is consistent with what his background suggests. The others have their own quirks or characteristics that define them, making them easy to identify and/or relate to. I think most of the important mainstay characters have been introduced in this season, though that remains to be seen, given the ending. The characters give much life to this donghua.The animation for The First Order is actually pretty high quality. The choreography of fights is good, the fluidity of the normal character movements is high, and the facial expressions are nice. The character models are also detailed and realistic and the environments and beasts look great. The animation quality for this work so far is top notch.This donghua is highly enjoyable, it blends many different things together that may not seem compatible in a way that feels natural and not cliche. The comedy is great, though may not be as good if you don\'t understand Chinese, the characters are fun and quirky, the environments/animation and world are lively and interesting. While I am not a fan of ""system"" stories, the ""system"" in this story doesn\'t feel out of place or like plot armor. If you like post-apocalyptic setting type stories where there is a mix of intrigue and comedy, this is a highly recommended watch.Score: 8/10Adaptation Remarks:The First Order is set in a post-apocalyptic, post-modern ""Earth"" so we can recognize some of the ""lost"" technologies and aesthetic. However, since it is set in a post-apocolyptic setting, there are some rather ""unclean"" or themes and displays. In the manhua, and likely the novel as well, we get to see some of the more degenerate aspects of the post-apocalyptic era. These things have been cleaned up for this donghua, likely to make it more age-appropriate for the younger target audiences. The comedy that I saw in the donghua is mostly consistent with what I saw in the manhua adaptation. I enjoyed the comedy, as it has gags, plays on common idioms, andIn regards to more specific and obvious changes, depiction of age of the characters and their behaviors/world have been changed. The most obvious one is regarding XiaoYu, who is depicted as much older than her model suggests. In the manhua, Ren XiaoSu, the MC is 15-16 years old, and XiaoYu is supposedly early to mid-20\'s which is why she just ""considers him a little brother"" during that comedic moment in the first or second episode. Xiao Yu is also an smoker and she is implied have engaged in some questionable activities to get by, considering she is a single woman in a harsh post-apocalyptic society who lives alone. This clean up of her image makes the show more age-appropriate for younger audiences and promotes her to potential romantic interest, despite what the show depicts for now, which could win over some fans. It also causes some of the dissonance that happened when originally discussing the recruitment of XiaoYu into their ""family"".Overall though, I\'d say this is a great adaptation so far of this work.

Doraemon Movie 33: Nobita no Himitsu Dougu Museum,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15925/Doraemon_Movie_33__Nobita_no_Himitsu_Dougu_Museum,"[""I found this movie randomly on Youtube and I started watching it out of curiosity.Story 7/10Well it wasn't that great at first but it got better and better. I really liked how everything was building till the end. The story still wasn't that special and some parts were confusing because I haven't seen the original series. The end was touching though.Art 9/10I thought that the animation was very good. I mean it looks like some old western cartoon but with an anime vibe. Backgrounds are much more detailed than the actual characters and I really like this style.Sound 8/10I guess it was pretty good....Some voices were just plain average but there were a few voice actors whose voices I really liked. Music was ok but forgettable. Sound works and I have nothing to complain about.Characters 9/10I liked almost all the characters. They were all well written. At first I thought that Doraemon looked pretty stupid but I started to like his design later. Of course there were a few characters that were very flat and boring but most of them very actually good, likeable and funny.Enjoyement 8/10As I said earlier the beginning was pretty boring but from middle to the end it was just so epic and I really enjoyed it. It was funny at times and well there isn't much that I didn't enjoy.Overall I think this is a great movie and worth watching. You will like it for sure. It was much better than I expected.

I give it 8/10"", 'My overall take: Decent use of a unique setting and genre for a Doraemon film, but had even greater potential still.In this movie, Doraemon\'s bell gets stolen, and he really wants it back. Nobita and his friends track it to a 22nd Century gadget museum, where they have to find the bell and figure out who took it. Whereas most Doraemon movies use Doraemon\'s gadgets as a means to transport the main characters to classic science fiction or fantasy settings, a museum that displays these gadgets is a location that can essentially only exist in the Doraemon universe. Combined with the fact that the Doraemon...films have not yet done a proper detective story up to this point, and the premise of this movie looks very attractive indeed.For all that, however, I came away from this film somewhat underwhelmed. Maybe it\'s the fact that, despite an ideal setup for showcasing previously introduced gadgets in fresh and creative ways, much of the main plot ultimately hinges on new gadgets and additions to the lore. Make no mistake though, this movie does not skimp on giving cameos to established gadgets. Probably the best use of the museum locale is the scene where the protagonists and law enforcement are confronted by the gadget thief in one of the exhibits. The ""duel by proxy"" between the thief and the inspector investigating the case, in which they simply show off the gadgets they have on hand to counter each other\'s strategies without actually using them, is pretty amusing, but makes sense in a setting where gadgets are widely available.The mystery story itself is decent for a children\'s movie, though I found the handling of the aftermath to be unsatisfying. To make a long story short, it is eventually revealed that Doraemon\'s bell and several other items were stolen on behalf of a disgraced scientist, who hid microchips in those objects to preserve his life\'s work on developing a sustainable metal for use in manufacturing gadgets. By the time the movie ends, the scientist simply goes back into hiding, with no apparent opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of the relevant authorities nor any clear headway made in addressing the metal sustainability problem.I also felt lukewarm about the revelation that Doraemon exhibits more cat-like behavior without his bell, which came across as more of an easy excuse to make visual gags than a natural extension of the lore. I did appreciate that everyone in the main cast contributes at one point or another, even though the story focuses most heavily on Nobita and Doraemon. Additionally, this movie features one of the few times (if not the only time) that the Restoration Light is used in a Doraemon film, which is a gadget I\'ve often thought should be acknowledged in the movies more often considering how frequently Doraemon\'s gadgets break! films have not yet done a proper detective story up to this point, and the premise of this movie looks very attractive indeed.For all that, however, I came away from this film somewhat underwhelmed.

Also, congratulations to the franchise for lasting 50 years! Hopefully we\'ll see that blue tanuki in real life by 2112.', 'My overall take: Differentiates itself from similar stories in the franchise while taking inspiration from recent scientific advances.In this movie, Nobita revives a fossilized double-yolked egg that hatches into two feathered dinosaurs. As a paleontologist, I appreciate that this movie clearly took notes on the latest paleontological science and incorporated it into its story. No, not everything in here is scientifically accurate, and there is definitely some embellishment for the sake of entertainment. However, it\'s evident that the filmmakers went the extra mile in their background research: for example, the dinosaurs that we think almost certainly had feathers are all shown with feathers, the end...of the Cretaceous is said to be 66 million years ago and not the outdated 65 million years ago, and there\'s a scene showing the footprints of a pterosaur and they\'re obviously referenced from actual fossils of pterosaur tracks (that one really impressed me).As for the story itself, I was originally apprehensive about how this film would be able to distinguish itself from Nobita\'s Dinosaur (1980). However, though the beginning plays out in a similar way (probably intentionally so), I felt that the second half of this movie carves out its own niche quite nicely. If anything, the climax here has more parallels with Nobita and the Knights on Dinosaurs (1987) in how it involves the end-Cretaceous mass extinction and reveals that there\'s no true villain in the story. In a way, I think Nobita\'s New Dinosaur combines the narrative strengths of those two previous Mesozoic-themed tales. Nobita raising two dinosaurs is a more engaging setup than Suneo running around under the impression that he\'s hallucinating in Nobita and the Knights on Dinosaurs, whereas the protagonists\' actions turning out to have a major impact on the history of life on Earth gives the plot slightly more depth and complexity than the straightforward ""boy and his pet"" story of Nobita\'s Dinosaur.If I have any (non-scientific) criticism for this movie, it may be the cameo from Piisuke, the plesiosaur from Nobita\'s Dinosaur. Although touching and well-intended, Piisuke\'s appearance raises some confusing questions about continuity. Some parts of this movie (such as Nobita\'s friends lacking faith in the possibility that he could find living dinosaurs) imply that it takes place in a separate continuity from Nobita\'s Dinosaur, but Piisuke showing up, complete with Nobita getting a flashback to their time together, seems to run counter to this premise. The fact that Nobita never fully realizes that Piisuke is there (as Piisuke rescues him while he is drowning and departs before he regains consciousness) might also be disappointing. of the Cretaceous is said to be 66 million years ago and not the outdated 65 million years ago, and there\'s a scene showing the footprints of a pterosaur and they\'re obviously referenced from actual fossils of pterosaur tracks (that one really impressed me).As for the story itself, I was originally apprehensive about how this film would be able to distinguish itself from Nobita\'s Dinosaur (1980).

Boku no Hero Academia the Movie 1: Futari no Hero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36896/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_the_Movie_1__Futari_no_Hero,"[""Not the greatest anime movie I've seen, but definitely far from the worse. The plot is kind of predictable but the fact that it's not a filler movie that pulled a plot out of its arse, it actually provides us some background story of All Might and adds to his characterization earns an 8/10 from me.Story: 8/10 Plot didn't really get me super excited as I watched (maybe I was expecting too much after seeing the plot of this series). The movie's plot is rather simple. Twists are predictable. But the fights and character interaction makes up those flaws.Art: 7/10 some part of the art...gets super bad, like those screenshots of Naruto va Pain where the character faces are all messed up and weird. But for the most part the art is pretty good, especially for the final battle. Man, it's great! The California Smash is epic too!Sound: 9/10 Even till now, the ending song's still stuck in my head. I can hum it right now if you want... and the voice actors are great of course, as always.Character: 9/10 Younger All Might.

Particularly that Theme Park place looks interesting, deffo wanna go if possible. That's perhaps the part I enjoyed the most, watching Bakugo, Kirishima, Todoroki, and Izuku fight their way to the top spot and all those cool gadgets Izuku tried on lol.Overall: 8/10 Not bad for a first movie. Definitely worth the watch. You'll learn quite a lot about the bnha world. Still, I'm hoping the next movie will be better. gets super bad, like those screenshots of Naruto va Pain where the character faces are all messed up and weird. But for the most part the art is pretty good, especially for the final battle. Man, it's great! The California Smash is epic too!Sound: 9/10 Even till now, the ending song's still stuck in my head. I can hum it right now if you want... and the voice actors are great of course, as always.Character: 9/10 Younger All Might.

Melissa despite being a little bland you can get behind her actions. Dave as well, when you find out his motivation and relationship with All Might.Though I find the movie gives quite a bit...of clunky dialogue with the characters, and at times it seems awkward, as it feels like the characters are just speaking ""exposition"". There\'s also a large beginning portion of the movie in the first act dedicated to the  same flashbacks you\'ve seen a hundred times in the anime.I think the story\'s main problem is adding almost too many of the classmates, some of the kids from UA just happen to be on the Island, and aren\'t intricate to the plot at all it\'s just a shot of them in the hotel room, and it\'s kind of a pointless addition. The characters who take part in the final fight have a purpose, and as they move up the floors you can get behind their actions, but it almost feels they brought to many of them, and would have done better with a tighter cast of just five of them.The other problem is, a lot of the plot is just predictable at the end, you can almost see every turn coming. The final fight also used \'the power of friendship\' trope that I often find the show usually doesn\'t resort to, making the final encounter almost a bit redundant as it keeps going.The use of the soundtrack to kind of felt like they were checking off items in a box, making sure to hit every one of the classic music from the series. At times these are used epic, other times though it feels really out of place and like they should have used an original track and not tried to force one we\'ve already heard that doesn\'t quite fit the scene.Overall it is a good movie with a few quick laughs (also a lot more guns than ever seen before, they really are in America now, huh), but the art almost makes it feel like a TV special and like the movie was rushed because of all the hype going on with the series.

In some scenes they used really ugly looking CGI which didn't fit at all and somehow it...feels like they just didn't cared about the movie at all and just wanted to get it quickly released to cash in on bnha fans which is a shame because the main series looks actually amazing at parts.SoundThe OST in the movie is good and it has a lot of nice tracks which all fit to the scenes in which they play and there isn't much more to say about the OST, but it is the strongest part of the movie.CharacterThe movie features for the most part the same characters we know from the series and it mostly seemed like rather bland fanservice that everyone was coincidentally there and the new characters in the movie were all pretty 1 dimensional and really nothing note worthy.Enjoyment/OverallI absolutely did not enjoy this movie and it is beyond me how anyone out there could enjoy it if they watched the same movie as I did and it even makes me sad that the movie was such a disappointment because the main series had a lot of really good moments, but this movie didn't had any.Overall the movie is a 1/10 for me and I guess the movie was just a quick cash grab from studio bones so they have budget for Mob Psycho S2. feels like they just didn't cared about the movie at all and just wanted to get it quickly released to cash in on bnha fans which is a shame because the main series looks actually amazing at parts.SoundThe OST in the movie is good and it has a lot of nice tracks which all fit to the scenes in which they play and there isn't much more to say about the OST, but it is the strongest part of the movie.CharacterThe movie features for the most part the same characters we know from the series and it mostly seemed like rather bland fanservice that everyone was coincidentally there and the new characters in the movie were all pretty 1 dimensional and really nothing note worthy.Enjoyment/OverallI absolutely did not enjoy this movie and it is beyond me how anyone out there could enjoy it if they watched the same movie as I did and it even makes me sad that the movie was such a disappointment because the main series had a lot of really good moments, but this movie didn't had any.Overall the movie is a 1/10 for me and I guess the movie was just a quick cash grab from studio bones so they have budget for Mob Psycho S2."", ""This movie is what you would expect from a MHA movie. It centers around the lovable and diverse cast of characters, all in a self-contained arc of heroism and villainy. I walked into this movie expecting well animated action scenes mixed in with fun character interactions and dynamics. The movie did indeed match my expectations in that regard.Story: 7Not the strongest aspect of this movie, as it was pretty predictable and cookie-cutter for a movie about heroes. The plot can be basically boiled down into good guys hitting bad guys - which pretty much completely sums up the content of this show. Not all...is as mundane as I am making it sound though, as the movie also contains some narrative points involving All Might that I'm certain many would find interesting. Additionally, there were some genuinely thoughtful and cute scenes scattered throughout which stands out amidst the simple (but by no means bad) storyline.Art: 9Yet again, this is the same art style we are used to seeing with the TV series. It doesn't seem like any extra effort or time was put into the drawing and framing of each shot. The art was great to begin with, so no complaints here. We got more of what we already love. Oh, and I can't talk about art without mentioning the fight scenes. I'm not going to spoil anything - but trust me they seem to have went the extra mile with those.Sound: 9The classic MHA soundtrack. I think most, if not all of the OST is used somewhere in this movie. Once again, the OST is great. So no complaints here either.Character: 8Not all the characters from Class 1-A is focused on in this movie, which is reasonable considering that it may turn out to be an animation and narrative nightmare for the staff over at BONES to include and do justice to so many of the characters we know and have grown attached to over time. The movie still faces this problem of no real 'character development' and I use this term loosely because it can be argued that there is. However, the point I'm trying to convey is that nothing much in this movie is consequential in affecting the wider narrative. The movie chooses to base the character's conversations on pre-established character dynamics instead. With a weaker cast of characters, this may prove to be a problem. But due to the sheer charisma and good pre-established relationships, this doesn't serve to be much of a problem in this film.Enjoyment: 9I got to watch this movie in a Japanese cinema, which definitely played a part in affecting my enjoyment of it. The characters were fun to watch, the fight scenes were exciting and clever, and the fan-service uh... was there (it honestly got to the point where it was straight out cringy at times for me, but I'm sure people would enjoy it nonetheless) - what more could you ask for.TL;DRMy Hero Academia The Movie, is by no means groundbreaking or remotely close to it. It is pure fun. If you like the series already; watch this movie.

Even tho I clearly understand It\'s pretty cliche and by-the-books, it\'s been overall nicely paced and competently directed. So, when I saw they were going to make a movie I became very excited. A movie has the perfect runtime to present a self contained story, where we can get to know our favorite characters in a more intimate way. The anime follows the events of the manga religiously, so I understand why there\'s no much room to improve upon...the source material.That\'s why I really looked forward to this movie. Right from the start we know this film it\'s pretty much strictly tied to what it can and can\'t do. This happens between the 2nd and 3rd season, so pretty much nothing of importance can happen during it\'s runtime, as it needs to left us right where we were at the beginning. And because of that of that the scale and scope of the events presented don\'t really have much impact in the universe. However, this necessarily didn\'t had to be bad, as it may not had an impact in the world but in characters of this universe.However, this is where the movie fails for me. this feels like 4 episodes stitched together. events just happen one after another with not much rhyme or reason. Just like in the show, there\'s no much depth to our cast at all. All of our dear students are the same archetypes we know. This is not itself bad, however, this felt like a really missed opportunity to flesh out those that we don\'t know very well beyond face value. Just like in the show, we\'re just there to watch Midoriya save the day and in a more minor way Todoroki and Bakugo being cool and stuff. Everyone else is just a backdrop nedeed in order to shove them in the promotional material.Ultimately this doesn\'t feel like it had any right to exist beyond banking on the popularity of the show.Maybe you could say, ""Hey, that\'s pretty stupid. 99% of the anime out there exists only because of committees wanting to make some bucks.""And in a certain way, you\'re right. Money is the motor that moves the anime industry. However, I just can\'t let this movie go without guilt. There\'s so much media out there that exists with the sole purpose of making a profit on an already established franchise that is also very well made and has some value beyond the monetary gain.Something like Gundam 0080 War In The Pocket (Which I recently reviewed, *wink wink*) comes to mind. Not driven by the major events of a story we have been told already (The O.Y.W.) but by a cast of characters that are developed, that we root for and like.  None of this can be found in Futari No Hero. I can\'t recommend it if you\'re not a fan. Hell, I can\'t recommend it even if you are fan. There\'s nothing to be gained from this watching experience.TL;DR: Imagine 4 bland forgettable shonen anime filler episodes.

If you know of a convention near you that will be airing the movie I highly, highly recommend checking it out there.  The movie was pretty much made to be watched in an expo sort of setting.  I can confidently say that if I was not in a room of screaming fan girls and boys it would be far less enjoyable.  The movie overall is quite fanservicey, when the team enters the expo area that the movie takes place in they mostly end up splitting up in pairs....Pretty much every time Bakugo and Kirishima were on screen together the audience erupted into screams.  In terms of visuals the sakuga in the very beginning battle with young All might and the very ending were absolutely spectacular.  Especially the ending.  Over time I've started to lose interest and the hype of bnha however watching that finale battle gave me goosebumps especially with everyone else cheering a long and doing the attack names.  There were some parts I didn't like.  For example, if you are someone who has not seen my hero academia yet, do not watch this movie.  The very beginning portion of the movie spends about 5 mins recapping both season 1 and season 2.  Unless you want to be spoiled on the series I recommend watching at least the first two seasons before going into this.  In terms of characters, again this movie was mostly very fanservice and is pretty much the same characters and bnha fan has come to love over time.  I have to say though the girls in this movie did not get much time to shine, especially compared to the male characters like even Mineta had more time to show off then Uraraka.  However, that is a problem with the overall series and not just this movie.  I also have to say that I didn't care that much about the character motivations, in terms of the added characters it just felt like any other sort of filler characters.  These ones they tried to connect them more to Deku and All Might to make them seem empathetic but it didn't really work that much for me.Regardless of my complaints though I still found it an incredibly enjoyable experience.  I doubt my rating would still be an 8 if I saw it again in theaters (which I will anyways since they said at ax there are extra scenes in theaters) but I do appreciate what the expo watch experience brought to my overall enjoyment of the film and do encourage everyone else to also watch it at conventions.

Plot twists that anyone with an IQ above 30 could see coming just from the characters on the poster. Stupid plot armour power-ups that will have no reflection in the series as a whole ETC.Just awful writing in general, however the animation and art are a notch above the anime series and just barely made this a worthwhile experience. ', 'For several decades now, it has seemed like the classic shonen series (battle/fighting tournament) have been used to test out viewers just to see how shitty of a side story movies the industry can sell for fans without getting shit on. Needless to say, I was expecting the same from Hero Academia, but it actually end up being better than the entire 3rd season. I am beyond surprised.*contains spoilers*Story:Our movie takes place in this place called I-Island in where people can freely use their quirks unlike in Japan. Our main characters, Deku and All Might, head here because reasons related to All Might\'s health which...connects our story with All Might\'s friends, Dave and Melissa Shield. This soon splits our story in two half: in the other, All Might starts talking with Dave about his health while in the another, Deku and Melissa start hanging out in the I-Island just to find out 5 seconds later how every single relevant hero-student is located on this island as well. Almost every single character introduction seen here is comedic and following the trademark sides of the cast where they pull off some characteristics related goofs, show off their skills and in generally, create slice of life type of content where our cast practically just ""hangs out"" together like any friends would. This side of the story is clearly fanservice, but it is rather well made considering it focuses on the personality traits of our cast and not some comedic animation sequences or lewd/awkward feelings remarks.The actual plot centers around this evil dude who does evil things and kidnaps the entire island. Yup. Next gen stuff, his hostage is a whole damn continent. Heroes such as All Might all are left hopeless because magic ropes, but there is no reason to worry because our heroes-in-training are here to save the day. All they have to do is hit the highest floor of this building they are all located at because there is some security system up there that they can go to overwrite. It\'s always the top floor in these situations, but especially in this case, it turns out to be a real challenge to go there because the building is like 100 floors in height and the architect who designed the damn thing was clearly suffering from schizophrenia. Villains who appear like the assholes that they are and slow us down, are not helping either, but at least Kacchan can get pissed as fudge at them so that was kinda cool.Characters:Let\'s make few things clear. Sticky Hair Dude is the real hero and real MVP of this movie. He creates the good stuff here with his respect for beautiful women, by throwing those hairballs at every godddamn villain he sees and even by climbing a wall like Usain Bolt hitting 100 meter dash because he is so motivated by the idea of having his own harem. And another important note: Melissa Shield is now the best girl. That\'s right. Uragravity, Ribbitfu (who isn\'t even in this movie) and Momo with her fabulous hair can all make way now, new besto girl is way more mature and adorable than any of the former, moreover, she looks hot as hell. Not to say that any other girls didn\'t. In this movie, the entire cast is wearing their best suits and dresses, all new haircuts and some extra makeups, too. Hotshit. I guess the dudes are also handsome, dunno I don\'t swing that way. The main villain is actually the metal-controlling freak from X-Men, shoutouts to him for giving his time and participating in this crossover. Sick, overpowered mofo, but damn even dudes like that can\'t beat the power of friendship which is the biggest badassery on earth / any other planet.Production:Based Bones, no compromises have been made. Few things stand out, especially the final move and the whole scene where All Might and Deku run side by side is awesome as fudge. Bit more music would have been nice, but the atmosphere was achieved without so I guess can\'t complain too much. Pacing wise, this thing is incredibly well-balanced, smooth and build with clear vision on how the story should change from slice of life fanservice to more serious writing. Comedic reliefs are especially well-timed here. Another great example of this is a scene where All Might gets drowned in puss.. kisses. Overall, this movie reminded me the most of Shokugeki no Soma\'s style with its way to offer character centric comedy while holding its serious side. Smart stuff, especially when considering that the cast has always been the strongest side of both of the franchises.Conclusion:This is fanservice heavy movie, but it is the type of service that respects the series fans and doesn\'t come off as out of character behavior. In fact, it respects the cast and deals with them more honestly/genuinely than season 3 which made the cast comedic devices and blatantly used them in melodramatic crying scenes. This thing is also quite generic on paper, but the cast and the not-so-serious approach make the thing highly entertaining to watch. I hope S04 will be more like this and less like its predecessor. Ideally, more like S02, but this is surely a better option than S03 route. connects our story with All Might\'s friends, Dave and Melissa Shield.

In fact, a lot of this is like you\'d see in a normal episode... it almost seems like IT IS A NORMAL EPISO-The sound... what sound? Oh, you mean the amazing Soundtrack I expected to hear throughout the movie? Yeah... almost nonexistent. Where was it? IDK. It seemed like the sound designer took...a fiesta for this one. Bits of dialogue with no background sounds whatsoever. Complete silence that, in a theater, was actually jarring to hear. Maybe Funimation screwed up the dubbed version and the subbed is a million times better (or it could have even been the theater for all i know) but from what I heard and saw, the sound design in this film was pitiful. Felt like no original music whatsoever was used, All-For-One\'s theme was used for a bit during the villain fight (which was alright in context but felt like they could\'ve done something different here) (Note: the villain of this film is NOT all-for-one, hence why it\'s strange to hear a theme for a villain whose given less than 20 seconds of screen time).The characters are the same characters you remembered from Season 2 with the addition of a few new ones that were fine.

This doesn't make me change my mind about how season 4 will be though I'm still looking forward to that.

This is a crucial move to do as it can be the defining factor of a lot of potential fans to get in the show and many franchises fail at delivering the awaited experience. And it was about time “Boku no Hero Academia” made that move,...and it scored like a Detroit Smash.Story (8/10):A lot of Movie adaptations of already established shows, be them great or not fall short on keeping on the same track and reserving the identity of the parent show as they carry on Movie's original story, and it ends up with either creaking plot holes or being anything but the original show it stands in the shoes of.The story of this movie feels like something you'd get on a canon arc in one of the seasons, it discusses familiar problems to the show and tackles everything carefully so as not to contradict the main story.What started as a fun trip to a VIP party that had all of class A present turned out to be a planned heist on a large scale that put several hostages on the vacation island in danger, until, of course, the day is saved by our boys and girls, a pretty linear and self-contained plot to sit through in an hour and a half long seat that doesn't bore you due to the great pacing that shifts the focus around so as to limit repetition and grind and take carry in the important part of the story.Art (9.5/10):And we thought some of the fights that lasted at best 10 minutes in the parent series looked this good, a movie really does bring the best quality in term of visual production.Sharing the same studio as its parent series, Studio Bones, the art style didn't differ at all from what we're quite acquainted with, but we do get quite a boost in fluidity in animation, it was like upgrading from an old gen console to the latest beastly gaming computers in the market.Sound (8.5/10):The voice acting cast behind the characters in “Boku no Hero Academia” have always done an exceptional job at performing the emotional and crucial moments of the story, the cries of a desperate teenager or the screams of a doomed victim, only your ear can truly appreciate.I'm very glad that the original soundtrack was still present and with an extra emphasis on how much action the movie had packed up.Characters (7/10):The movie had some pretty interesting characters involved that related to All Might's backstory way back before his debut as a pro-hero which alone helped explain a lot of questions that the main story asked. Dr. David and his daughter that aspires to be a great doctor just like her father are both the first characters aside from Deku that we come to know are quirkless which puts a lot in common with our already protagonist, Deku, and these new faces that ARE a protagonist in this movie.I kind of wanted a lot of involvement from the rest of class A, but as always, Deku took all the spotlights as a jerky main character and the rest ended up being kind of neglected in comparison, going to an extent of only featuring some of them in a mere 3 seconds or less screen time, not a cool move at all.Enjoyment (8/10):Watching the first movie of a great series was a blast, experiencing a new take on the show that feels like starting off fresh from zero but not at the same time, the fights were amazing and the action kept consistent all the time.The flashbacks involving All Might are something the main story lacks the most and being able to see some of them in here was just so worth it.Overall (8.2/10):Just watch it, and dare I say, even if you're not caught up, it does spoil some minor details, but unless you were super attentive to the dialogue, you won't even notice, it was truly meant to be that one movie that gets people into the series without showing too much. and it scored like a Detroit Smash.Story (8/10):A lot of Movie adaptations of already established shows, be them great or not fall short on keeping on the same track and reserving the identity of the parent show as they carry on Movie's original story, and it ends up with either creaking plot holes or being anything but the original show it stands in the shoes of.The story of this movie feels like something you'd get on a canon arc in one of the seasons, it discusses familiar problems to the show and tackles everything carefully so as not to contradict the main story.What started as a fun trip to a VIP party that had all of class A present turned out to be a planned heist on a large scale that put several hostages on the vacation island in danger, until, of course, the day is saved by our boys and girls, a pretty linear and self-contained plot to sit through in an hour and a half long seat that doesn't bore you due to the great pacing that shifts the focus around so as to limit repetition and grind and take carry in the important part of the story.Art (9.5/10):And we thought some of the fights that lasted at best 10 minutes in the parent series looked this good, a movie really does bring the best quality in term of visual production.Sharing the same studio as its parent series, Studio Bones, the art style didn't differ at all from what we're quite acquainted with, but we do get quite a boost in fluidity in animation, it was like upgrading from an old gen console to the latest beastly gaming computers in the market.Sound (8.5/10):The voice acting cast behind the characters in “Boku no Hero Academia” have always done an exceptional job at performing the emotional and crucial moments of the story, the cries of a desperate teenager or the screams of a doomed victim, only your ear can truly appreciate.I'm very glad that the original soundtrack was still present and with an extra emphasis on how much action the movie had packed up.Characters (7/10):The movie had some pretty interesting characters involved that related to All Might's backstory way back before his debut as a pro-hero which alone helped explain a lot of questions that the main story asked.

The story is simple, straightforward, predictable, and inconsequential. It all takes place on a far off island that we’ll probably never see again in the series. Since there are zero real stakes involved, it makes it hard to feel invested in what’s going on. I suppose that is what is to be expected with Shounen anime movies, though. The opening scene has a young All Might apprehending a villain which was probably the most exciting part of the whole movie. If the rest of the story were just young All Might adventures, I think I might have enjoyed that more.The art...doesn’t seem to stand out from the original anime up until about the last 10 to 15 minutes of the movie, where it seems like most of the budget went. The fight scenes are nothing unique and interesting, except for the final one, so you won’t see the characters doing anything different with their powers than you would see them do in the show. The students’ colorful hero outfits are traded in for boring formal attire for most of the movie, which is disappointing since it gives the whole movie a very gray and sanitized look.This was my first time watching these characters voiced by their English VAs, and I have to say, I’m impressed. Each character sounded completely natural and their voice actor fit their personality to a T. The music was fine, but not memorable.The two original characters introduced in this movie are essentially the poster boy and poster girl for quirkless heroes. As father-daughter-combo scientists, Melissa and Dave use their inventions to help the heroes save the day. On the one hand, their presence is appreciated since it adds a new layer to the world of MHA we haven’t seen before. How much respect can you gain as a quirkless person in this world? The answer is: quite a lot, it seems. On the other hand, their presence is a detriment because they can essentially invent anything that can solve any of the heroes’ problems. And in this movie, they actually do invent devices which would greatly help our main characters. But of course, such devices are not meant to last and will never be spoken of again. As characters themselves, I think I will forget about them soon, given their generic personalities and bland design. Melissa is your typical one-note optimist while Dave is only slightly interesting because of his friendship with All Might. The villain is also pretty forgettable, he’s your vanilla bad guy that’s barely worth mentioning.Overall, the movie was a fairly enjoyable ride that I think other fans of MHA will enjoy, since it technically delivers the stuff that MHA is known for - big heroic fights involving characters we love. That being said, I don’t think it comes close to matching the emotional heights that the original anime has reached. As a one-off filler movie, it’s impossible to do that. Still, I would have hoped to see something new. A young All Might was fun to watch, but beyond that there is not much to this movie, and I don’t think fans would miss much by not watching it. doesn’t seem to stand out from the original anime up until about the last 10 to 15 minutes of the movie, where it seems like most of the budget went.

It was amazing though.Story: Overall, the story is nothing surprising, (but as far as anime movie spinoffs go it’s a 10) the plot points are well executed and the pacing seemed to have a similar fast pace as the series is known for, although some parts had me internally complaining it was a little too slow (some of Act One), it managed to slow down as much as...necessary to not feel rushed. And the best part is, it’s canon (although timeline placement is a bit messy)! An 8/10 for story.Art and Animation: It was almost a 10/10. Almost. The climaxes and fight scenes were legendary, but there were a couple points in the non-action scenes where it is too easy to see where some corners needed to be cut (to make those scenes as good as they were), so unfortunately, it’s knocked back to a 9/10.Sound: This one is sitting on about an 8.5/10, rounding up. The score was well done, implementing many of our well-known pieces wonderfully, and underscoring the scenes they were placed in very well, not to mention the use of the lack of sound in some scenes to further provide a sense of gravity to the situation when it was needed. The voice acting for all recurring characters was up to standard, and for the movie-only characters, it was superb and utterly convincing regardless of the character’s emotions. In all, well done.Characters: The characters in this film; the expression of the characters, the character designs and the voice acting, of characters new and old, stayed faithful to our views of them, and the film-only characters were well-fleshed out and came to life during the short run of the film. No one suddenly acted out of character, and existing characters weren’t broken at all during the run of the film, making it feel much more authentic and immersive. A 9/10 for characters.Enjoyment: I loved this movie and as I walked out I wanted to immediately go back in and watch it again, especially in dub (which I haven’t seen of the film but would like to). The absolute best moments had me in awe, and I even managed to laugh out loud at a couple of the jokes made, not to mention how amazing it was to see some scenes of Young All Might in action! If I keep talking, I’ll start gushing because 24 hours isn’t enough to kill the hype train in me yet. A 10/10 for enjoyment.Overall: Overall, this was a very good movie. As both an extension of the existing series, and as a stand-alone film (as it gives a quick overview of the general plot to give new viewers context, but not to annoy the old viewers). I would recommend it to all fans of the series, and whilst it is somewhat suited to newcomers, in the sense of recaps for context, I would not recommend this be someone’s first introduction to the series (although it wouldn’t be bad, but it spoils S1 and S2 plot points). My overall score for this anime is a solid 9/10. necessary to not feel rushed. And the best part is, it’s canon (although timeline placement is a bit messy)! An 8/10 for story.Art and Animation: It was almost a 10/10. Almost. The climaxes and fight scenes were legendary, but there were a couple points in the non-action scenes where it is too easy to see where some corners needed to be cut (to make those scenes as good as they were), so unfortunately, it’s knocked back to a 9/10.Sound: This one is sitting on about an 8.5/10, rounding up. The score was well done, implementing many of our well-known pieces wonderfully, and underscoring the scenes they were placed in very well, not to mention the use of the lack of sound in some scenes to further provide a sense of gravity to the situation when it was needed. The voice acting for all recurring characters was up to standard, and for the movie-only characters, it was superb and utterly convincing regardless of the character’s emotions. In all, well done.Characters: The characters in this film; the expression of the characters, the character designs and the voice acting, of characters new and old, stayed faithful to our views of them, and the film-only characters were well-fleshed out and came to life during the short run of the film. No one suddenly acted out of character, and existing characters weren’t broken at all during the run of the film, making it feel much more authentic and immersive. A 9/10 for characters.Enjoyment: I loved this movie and as I walked out I wanted to immediately go back in and watch it again, especially in dub (which I haven’t seen of the film but would like to). The absolute best moments had me in awe, and I even managed to laugh out loud at a couple of the jokes made, not to mention how amazing it was to see some scenes of Young All Might in action! If I keep talking, I’ll start gushing because 24 hours isn’t enough to kill the hype train in me yet. A 10/10 for enjoyment.Overall: Overall, this was a very good movie.

Not too unique or twisting in terms of story but it gets the job done.Art - 5/10It doesn't look bad per say, but it arguably looks worse than the show and uses some effects that the show doesn't that kinda stand out, in a bad way.Sound - 7/10MHA has a good soundtrack, difficult to mess this up, however the music seems crammed in at points, almost as if they kinda wanted to put in every OST just for the sake of it, which does detract.Character - 7/10The characters from the show/manga...act mostly like themselves. And the new characters are not bad, though they are not exactly compelling either. Not much to say.Enjoyement - 6/10Besides the first ~15-20 which had some recap, probably because they wanted the movie to be somewhat accessible to people who hadn't seen the show (though I don't know why people who doesn't watch it would like to see the movie), it was a good time. Never did I feel like checking the remaining time of the movie or like I wanted to stop watching, but I also never felt super compelled.Overall - 6/10It's worth watching. I don't know if I'd ever buy it as a Blue-Ray or DVD, well actually I know I wouldn't, however with nothing better to do and a streaming service you might as well. act mostly like themselves.

It shows that it knows what it needs to be and what it needs to not be in order to satisfy its audience, and it delivers on that with enough enthusiasm and self-awareness to overcome its lack of any real substance.Story:Futari no Hero isn't about the story it tells as much as what the story allows the writers to make the characters do. This is a simple movie. It sets up a bare-bones premise and then it cuts loose  and only worries about...balancing three things:1. Shoving much action as it can comfortably fit into the runtime.2. Keeping up enough tension to get its audience invested and hyped for its climax.3. Fanservice for its characters.Hey, it's a popcorn flick, and it's a popcorn flick that is based on an established property. These aren't unreasonable goals, and the film has the right idea of what to sacrifice to meet those goals. It just sacrifices too much.The film has the right idea. When the plot gets rolling, the stakes are established with little fanfare, and the film puts in the time to build tension before the fighting starts. However, once the focus of the film shifts to paying off that tension, it evaporates. There's just too much fighting! The film loses itself in cutting back and forth between countless action scenes and the plot gets stretched thinner and thinner the longer it goes on. I never felt like the fights had any real consequences to them until near the end of the film, and there are only a couple of times when I felt the characters were in any danger at all. More than once, I wondered, so what if the characters lose this fight? Why is this scene even happening?Those fight scenes seem to be there because of why the middle of the film is there: for the writers to give us Class 1-A showing off why we love Class 1-A. Everyone has to show off the qualities that make people find each character so endearing. Everyone gets to see the characters fight. The fighting gets tiring, but the focus on its characters doesn't.  It's part of what everyone who is a fan of a franchise wants to see in a film based on that franchise, and it serves as a strength in its own right. That focus hides the cracks in the story by being entertaining enough in its own right to maintain the interest of the audience right up until the climax begins, and that's just enough to carry it for me.This doesn't mean that there's nothing about the story that's noteworthy for its quality. It's just that little what stands out has to do with the plot or premise of the movie, unfortunately. First is the utterly charming first section of the movie. It throws a gag a minute at you while keeping up a goofy and light-hearted tone that gives it a homey feel. It makes you want to smile even when you're not laughing out loud (which will happen more than you'd think!). Second is the ending of the film. I'll spare you any details except to say that it's action-packed and the level of intensity and emotion and energy surging through it all makes it feel like they kicked it up to 11 for this one.Lastly, the humor. There isn't much time dedicated to comedy scenes after the action starts, but enough care has been taken to make you laugh every minute or two. It's the perfect accompaniment to the action, and it helps distract from the issues in the middle of the film, which is all you can ask for.Down to the less-bad-but-still-annoying-stuff. This is what you'll notice in the film more than anything.Flashbacks at the start and climax of the movie seem unnecessary and waste too much time. Kaminar and Mineta are comic relief characters that aren't funny. A couple of the fights had opponents that weren't very interesting. Some of the dialogue is just classic shonen cringe (Take a shot everytime someone says 'hope' or 'peace' at the start of the film or at the end!), and the moral of the story actually makes no logical sense (I wish I could explain that here, but no spoilers!).None of this crops up too much, but these things are all very, very noticeable and, if there was much more of any of those things in the film, I'd cut the rating down to a 7 or even a 6.Art:You can tell that the budget for this got sank into the action and nothing else, but it was a worthwhile investment. Given the sheer amount of action in the film, it's worth mentioning that all of it is movie quality, and the film manages to make the ending fight look even more polished and fluid. They really had their priorities straight here.Sound:This is a category that you'd expect My Hero Academia to ace, and it does so effortlessly. Music is used in all the right places to enhance each scene and get you hyped for the triumphant moments, but there's real restraint on display in how often the film just doesn't play any music at all. It's not something you're going to notice unless you're paying attention, but it is something that you can appreciate once you do.Character:The highlight of the film for me. Class 1-A are all likeable and the film dedicates itself to being a showcase for its characters. That means that everyone gets the chance to play hero. Everyone gets to look good. Everyone gets to make the audience laugh. Even the villain has more going on with him than you'd expect. More than being an action movie, this is a character-oriented movie, and if there's one thing this property has going for it, it's character.Enjoyment:The film is just plain fun. It's so comfortable being whatever it wants to be and doing it in style. It's made to be seen in theaters. It's a spectacle meant to be enjoyed on the biggest screen that you can watch it on and with the biggest audience you can rope into seeing it with. It's not meant to be rewatched or examined as anything other than as a shonen movie, and what qualities make this a strong film don't lend themselves well to either. What it does lend itself to is making the experience of watching it as intended an absolute joy from start to finish. balancing three things:1.

They had quite an epic ending battle scene that faintly reminds me of the ones in One Punch Man and numerous small battle scenes along the way. However, not every one from the class was shown in battle and this was a little disappointing, you can see that the directors only had intent...of using only the more ""main"" characters for this movie.The art and sound were just like any other BNHA anime episodes, skillfully done. Especially the inclusion of the famous ""You say Run"" in the last fight scene which really helped brought up the hype. Looking at those fight scenes really made me feel like a 12 year old, cheering for the good guys. The end credits also included a pretty decent soundtrack.This movie really solidified the feel in me that BNHA is the Naruto of this generation,  making all of us teens/adults hyped up like children in the fight scenes.

I have to say this one the use of CGI in that final battle is one of the greatest use of CGI that I\'ve ever seen in my whole life.

You do a good job guys.Beforw I end this review let me say thisSORA NI MUKOE E PURUSUU URUTORAAAA!!!', ""All right, so I recently watched this movie and need to get my thoughts out, cause this movie was lit.First thing I noticed was the increased quality of the visuals, compared to the TV-series, in its big opening scene. Multiple complex visual shots that all looked impressive and fluid. Especially awesome was All Mights first on-screen moment:So this big-ass villain jumps down from high in the air, speeding downwards towards a bunch of civilian cars. We see this movement from his perspective, and then switch to the civilians cowering in fear of their incoming doom. But then, for a fraction of a moment, a foot....A shining foot. After that, a fist. The clothing may be different, but you immediately know who this guy is. For a moment, there is a frame of the villains physique being bended by his downward momentum and the pointed force of the punch aimed at him. His body shoots backwards. Then we're shown a frame of the hero, his mighty posture visible against the background, as he turns around, and announces that he is here.What this movie keeps propping up is a level of excitement, one that you typically get from My Hero Academia: that almighty feeling of putting up this fight, mustering all you strength to lay down the villain, and in this series case, with a mystical energy beam of SMASH. Presented in high-tier visuals, for ultimate satisfaction and hype.Now lets calm down for a minute and look at the story. As this movie ties into an already existing world based on a manga series, it can't have too much of an impact on the overall story. So don't go in expecting lots of depth, character development or a great plot. It's a one-and-a-half hour superhero movie tie-in, what WOULD you expect?It's a fairly simple and straightforward plot, and to movie-veterans, probably very predictable. This doesn't make it less entertaining though. It's focused and decently paced, and pays off in the end.Similarly with the characters, most of them are just kinda there. The two titular heroes (which in my mind, is a combination of either Deku, All Might, David and Melissa) are the main characters, and get the necessary depth and development to make it work. Everyone else is just acting out their character, and doing not much beyond that. Of course, had the movie put too much focus on them, it would have become a clusterfuck, so I'm happy with what the makers did. What I appreciate though is that they all get to do something, they're never useless. If they are, then they have less than half a minute of screentime.The music... it's hero aca, all right. Greatly underscoring the big events, getting you hyped up. There were plenty of moments were I was feeling the excitement coming through.I feel like, should you get something out of it, then it would be fun and excitement. And it succeeded, as the narrative nicely builds up to it, and then lets things loose in an animated frenzy that goes beyond most of what I've seen in the series.Especially the very last fight, where it just goes tripping balls man. That's what I meant when I said a mystical energy beam of SUHMAAAAAAAAAASH.In the end, this movie was mostly a fun tie-in to a beloved franchise. While not going much in depth, and being just ok at times when there wasn't much happening, it also gave hella hype, the sort that people love the series for. A shining foot. After that, a fist.

The movie lasts around an hour and 30 minutes and is done by the animation studio Bones who have been doing the Boku no Hero Academia stuff so far so them making this movie isn't very surprising.Important Note: Since this movie is part of an existing anime series obviously you have to watch the TV stuff to know all the characters. But I doubt anyone would watch this movie without having watched the other series or who's reading the manga.Plot/Story: Hero Academia has since its first season been called a stereotypical...story that's been done right, and I agree with that. To start of, this movie happens after season 2 and before season 3 of the TV anime. The plot of this movie is that All Might invites Midoriya to attend a hero gadget exhibition on the self-sufficient artificial island I-Island. While on the island a group of villains breaks into the security and barrikades a tower where a gala is being held. Of course Midoriya and others have to best up villains and save the day. A very typical story indeed. An interesting thing is that at the start of the movie we get to see All Might in his younger days. I would lie if I would tell you that this movie's plot is very good. In fact, I was able to detect and call out the plot twists of the movie from the moment they were set up. Which is during the first 20 minutes, mind you. But this is not important since this movie is a franchise movie and just fanserive for people who like MHA and to earn a lot of money for the following fourth season of MHA. I'm pretty sure that's the case. Now I don't know if this movie is Canon but from past experiences it is most certainly not. A franchise movie such as this one cannot live off of the main cast, it has to bring up great new movie-only characters and a great contained story. Does this movie have this? Ehh, not really. There is a very interesting device in this movie that Midoriya uses which is probably the most interesting part, although it is in the movie solely for the purpose of that Midoriya can do what he does and to make the movie more interesting. Apart from that the movie fails in creating a story that is well written and crafted, as well as out of the ordinary for once. The plot is quite predictable and does not have any holding in deep questions or anything like that. A very typical hero movie with MHA slapped onto it.Art: It's Studio Bones, okay. From that alone you can at least give this movie 8 points. Notable in art and animation is the final fight and that's it. They really kept the animation to a more grounded level, possibly in order to not waste too much money so that there is still some left for the next season and to further increase the amount of profit generated from the movie.Sound: Normally I would give them credit for using the very popular and good MHA hype soundtrack. Yoh know, that one track that's really good and everyone knows it. Of course it is used in this movie, and of course it's a good song. But you can't just rely on already used songs and tracks. What I like to see are new compositions, but frankly, I don't remember any BGMs standing out enough that I still remember them after 1 day. As for SFX, of course they are there but that's to be expected. Nothing noteworthy here.Charcaters: Because this is a franchise movie none of the TV main cast can get seriously injured, or anything of that sort. So the main cast can't be touched basically. So the other way is to have a good cast of new characters. First there is David Shield, a gadget developer and friend of All Might. He's what you expect from a friend of him. However, that's all there is to him: A good guy. And while I liked the plot arc of him in this movie, it left depth to be desired. Im sure the story board lead could've done better. Now to his daughter, Melissa Shield and the much better character. All around one of the only reasons this movie even has people like it. I'm not going into detail what her deal is because that would be spoiler. One thing that I can say is that our boy Midoriya had a great connection to her and Melissa was the best character in this movie, period. Sadly I cannot go into more detail but she's a good girl. Now to the villains. They are villains. That's pretty much it. As one dimensional as All for One. Throwaway characters to fill in spots for a villain. And again, that is suchh a shame. You can make great villains, why not do something like making David and the main villain know each other or the villain having a personal vendetta against Melissa or All Might. But no. Nothing. And because there is nothing I will also not remain here.Overall enjoyment and verdict: Did I enjoy this movie. Of course I did, it's MHA. The characters we know and love are the reason we watched this movie in the first place. But that does not cloud my eyes from the mediocracy that is the plot and the much to be desired new characters. Would I recommend this movie? For people who like MHA, yes. They will like it. It s pretty much fanservice for us who like MHA and a money-maker movie, nothing more. I give this movie a 7/10 for being a MHA title and having a great final battle with great animation.And that's it for me for this review. See you in the next review. story that's been done right, and I agree with that. To start of, this movie happens after season 2 and before season 3 of the TV anime. The plot of this movie is that All Might invites Midoriya to attend a hero gadget exhibition on the self-sufficient artificial island I-Island. While on the island a group of villains breaks into the security and barrikades a tower where a gala is being held. Of course Midoriya and others have to best up villains and save the day. A very typical story indeed. An interesting thing is that at the start of the movie we get to see All Might in his younger days. I would lie if I would tell you that this movie's plot is very good. In fact, I was able to detect and call out the plot twists of the movie from the moment they were set up. Which is during the first 20 minutes, mind you. But this is not important since this movie is a franchise movie and just fanserive for people who like MHA and to earn a lot of money for the following fourth season of MHA. I'm pretty sure that's the case. Now I don't know if this movie is Canon but from past experiences it is most certainly not. A franchise movie such as this one cannot live off of the main cast, it has to bring up great new movie-only characters and a great contained story. Does this movie have this? Ehh, not really. There is a very interesting device in this movie that Midoriya uses which is probably the most interesting part, although it is in the movie solely for the purpose of that Midoriya can do what he does and to make the movie more interesting. Apart from that the movie fails in creating a story that is well written and crafted, as well as out of the ordinary for once. The plot is quite predictable and does not have any holding in deep questions or anything like that. A very typical hero movie with MHA slapped onto it.Art: It's Studio Bones, okay. From that alone you can at least give this movie 8 points. Notable in art and animation is the final fight and that's it. They really kept the animation to a more grounded level, possibly in order to not waste too much money so that there is still some left for the next season and to further increase the amount of profit generated from the movie.Sound: Normally I would give them credit for using the very popular and good MHA hype soundtrack. Yoh know, that one track that's really good and everyone knows it. Of course it is used in this movie, and of course it's a good song. But you can't just rely on already used songs and tracks. What I like to see are new compositions, but frankly, I don't remember any BGMs standing out enough that I still remember them after 1 day. As for SFX, of course they are there but that's to be expected. Nothing noteworthy here.Charcaters: Because this is a franchise movie none of the TV main cast can get seriously injured, or anything of that sort. So the main cast can't be touched basically. So the other way is to have a good cast of new characters. First there is David Shield, a gadget developer and friend of All Might. He's what you expect from a friend of him. However, that's all there is to him: A good guy. And while I liked the plot arc of him in this movie, it left depth to be desired. Im sure the story board lead could've done better. Now to his daughter, Melissa Shield and the much better character. All around one of the only reasons this movie even has people like it. I'm not going into detail what her deal is because that would be spoiler. One thing that I can say is that our boy Midoriya had a great connection to her and Melissa was the best character in this movie, period. Sadly I cannot go into more detail but she's a good girl. Now to the villains. They are villains. That's pretty much it. As one dimensional as All for One. Throwaway characters to fill in spots for a villain. And again, that is suchh a shame. You can make great villains, why not do something like making David and the main villain know each other or the villain having a personal vendetta against Melissa or All Might. But no. Nothing. And because there is nothing I will also not remain here.Overall enjoyment and verdict: Did I enjoy this movie. Of course I did, it's MHA. The characters we know and love are the reason we watched this movie in the first place. But that does not cloud my eyes from the mediocracy that is the plot and the much to be desired new characters. Would I recommend this movie? For people who like MHA, yes. They will like it. It s pretty much fanservice for us who like MHA and a money-maker movie, nothing more. I give this movie a 7/10 for being a MHA title and having a great final battle with great animation.And that's it for me for this review.

That is what I-Island is. An island for all scientists who are continuously creating support items to assist heroes and help the people in need. The setting of the movie starts with All Might, accompanied by Deku in this island, with the invitation of his friend's daughter. The story goes on with...most of the UA students that are also invited having fun with the exhibits, until villains who planned to make hostages of all the people in the island took action.People who believe in themselves, who are willing to take risk and stand on what they want in life is a sight to see. Most of the time, we're being blinded by the negative things in life that we failed to see that there's also hope in those things. At times, we tend to make decisions that we don't really think of the outcome and that's what happens on this movie. But I really love how the fight goes on at the ending of the movie and how every one of them is already capable of being a true hero, how they manage to act immediately on a dangerous situation, how they exceed their limit and how conflicts between them don't matter when in fight. Because they are a team. most of the UA students that are also invited having fun with the exhibits, until villains who planned to make hostages of all the people in the island took action.People who believe in themselves, who are willing to take risk and stand on what they want in life is a sight to see.

You can tell when animators get a movie budget, you could tell Yutaka Nakamura had a fucking field day on this one. It is not a perfect movie though, anyways on with the review!STORY: 5/10The weakest part of the movie, the entire movie relies in a single plot twist. The problem is is that you can see it from a mile away, and it is does not have the required impact cause the characters aren't built up enough for it to work. It's pretty cookie cutter and standard as a...plot in general, going into this I expected it too be the weakest part of the movie regardless.ART: 9/10Yutaka Nakamura, remember this name. The entire final fight was animated by him (as a key animator), I have nothing but respect for this guy. Everything he touches is turned to gold, but again that is my opinion. My friends do like his animation style, I personally love it, so it comes down to preference. You can also see the movie budget, in general it is definitely a step-up around the board.SOUND: 9/10Oh boy, prepared to get hyped, we have some throwbacks in this one.CHARACTER: 6/10They did a pretty good job at making the characters interesting/likable for the limited time they had. The villain is mediocre at best, but still pretty decent considering he has no development AT ALL. Technically speaking, it would be nearly impossible for this movie to have over an 7 in this category just from the situation it was put in. TOO MUCH MINETA ALSO );ENJOYMENT: 8/10Overall, it's just silly fun. You know nothings really at stake cause nothing important is actually going to happen. I have to give this a lot of props for being as good as it was considering the limited time it had to buildup it's setting and characters. Music is good, animation is good, what else can you ask for from a side-story movie!?OVERALL: 7/10Glad i was part of the few that got the chance to see this movie in theaters (: It is definitely worth the watch in a theater environment! This movie is going to be falsely praised due to the hype surrounding it. It is a great, fun watch!

BEST COMBO EVER! BEST MOVIE EVER!!!All Might’s and Dave’s time is of the past now... Now the time has come for a new generation of heroes.The movie has shown us the way with the Two Heroes. led to THE EXTREMELY DOPE FIGHT SCENE, probably the best ever in all of BNHA!The BEST ENDING SCENE EVER!

Now the time has come for a new generation of heroes.The movie has shown us the way with the Two Heroes.', ""tl;dr: It's a slightly above average shounen movie. The story was alright, but it felt like it could have been better. The art has its up and downs. Sound design was beautiful as always and the characters were well-represented. I came for MHA fanservice and I got that, even if I wished it was a little more.The animation felt at its best in the midst of a fight scene, which is when Bones typically shines with their dynamic/fluid style. Outside of that, it remained fine, even if it felt like one or two scenes were a little on the static side. I don't doubt Yaoyorozu's...physical strength, but I'm pretty sure making things float was Uraraka's job.If you've listened to the MHA OST before, you know what to expect here. Jet Set Run is a pretty great successor to You Say Run, and the other new themes felt right at home with the ones from the show.Some people have said that the movie would have benefited from less 1-A characters, and I don't necessarily disagree. Still, they did cut down the cast size to about half and did a solid job of showing off their personalities and abilities. At most I would have removed Kaminari and Mineta from the main plot for being gag characters, but I didn't hate them for existing (which is usually the case with Mineta). Things like Kirishima's friendship with Bakugo and Deku's fanboyish nature definitely made this work.SPOILERS STARTThe story was arguably the weakest point. Melissa wasn't a bad character by any stretch, but it feels like there could have been a lot more in regards to her Quirkless nature and desire to be a hero. They kinda glossed over that in season 1 of MHA as well, but it felt weird to bring it back and then not really do anything with it. David Shield was a little better than his successor, as his relationship with All Might felt properly utilized. The rest of the story was standard shounen movie plot, which was a bit disappointing, but the villain was slightly better than the usual fodder. The double fakeout towards the middle was well-executed and he was solid foreshadowing for what I think will be season 4 of the anime.SPOILERS ENDIt was enjoyable, yet flawed movie.

It may be a bit rote and clearly standing on the shoulders of giants, but overall the movie and series are enjoyable adventure stories with a strong ensemble cast and high technical quality.The story is an inverted take on Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo in that the Japanese heroes are traveling to a proxy America, whereas in that film the American heroes were traveling to Japan. It\'s a good way to expand the universe a bit - I often feel that the mainline...series is constrained somewhat by the constant tethering to the school setting. It\'s cool to see these characters in a new environment. At first, it is just Deku and his mentor All Might on the trip, as the purpose is to visit an old friend of All Might\'s. However, for various paper-thin reasons, all of the UA students we care about end up on the island. This is fine by me, as I enjoy these characters and the narrative is hinged greatly on the ensemble cast\'s interactions.Deku gets to meet a new girl this movie by the name of Melissa Shields. The ""girl of the movie"" is a bit of a cliche in these shonen movies, as I\'m sure many of us are aware. The perceived plausibility of a romance is in the eye of the beholder - for example, I enjoyed the relationship between Ichigo and Senna in the first Bleach movie, while others didn\'t. In this case, I find it somewhat hard to believe that the nervous wreck Izuku could charm the pants off of a confident, highly intelligent scientist\'s daughter like Melissa. I was much more interested in seeing All Might\'s past, and the flashback where he and professor Shields meet is one of my favorites in the film. Seeing All Might in his prime is fantastic and I\'m glad the movie took advantage of this opportunity, as I\'m sure many fans are interested in exactly how strong All Might was at his peak, considering his feats in the present. I also found it interesting how closely All Might in the past resembled Mirio Toogata...I would not bat an eyelash if the two are revealed to have some deeper connection in the story\'s future.As for the villain, I did not remember much about him or his motives, like many shonen movie antagonists he is one-note and forgettable. We are more concerned with the battles, and they are very good. Art, sound design, and the sheer energy are spectacular. The animation for Boku no Hero has always been great, but the fights in this movie really have a slick style to them that makes up for the rather thin plot. The side characters have things to do, with Bakugo and Todoroki getting some nice no-holds-barred fights to their names. The final confrontation is similarly a feast for the senses, with a heartwarming (if somewhat pandering) combination attack between All Might and Izuku. It is commendable that even in a self-contained movie the series never forgets the emotional core which is the bond these two characters have.Overall, I endorse this movie for fans of the series who can\'t get enough of the characters and the highly polished technical aspects of the anime. There are many cliche elements to the plot but they are executed as well as possible. Far from cashing in on the anime\'s popularity, this movie celebrates and accentuates that which has caused Boku no Hero to explode over the past few years. series is constrained somewhat by the constant tethering to the school setting.

Laughed way more than i expected. Really liked the Island itself, sounds like quite the haven. The movie original characters were alright. Melissa was a bubbly girl who was...ok, nothing really great or awful about her.

PLUS ULTRA!(i literally wanted to scream my lungs out watching this)MY HERO ACADEMIA - TWO HEROES*REVIEW* *POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEADI actually didn\'t expect much when i\'m about to watch this movie because i watched BONES\' Bungou Stray Dogs movie, Dead Apple. But boy am i glad that this movie really go beyond my expectation!The premise of the story fits in when UA students are having a school break and some of them got an invitation to a man-made island filled with scientist and hi-tech stuffs, I-Island which also having a pre-opening to the public (previously private). The island have top-tier security, and...always compared to Tartarus, the famous prison in MHA universe. But despite that, a group of villains manages to break in. Now it\'s the heroes\' job to fight the villains and save the day!*STORY*As the title suggests, this movie highlights its two stars, that is Toshinori and Midoriya. While the opening act features a powerful blow from young Toshinori when he studies in USA, some might think that probably nothing can tops this act for the rest of the movie, lemme tell you this, that is a gravely wrong assumption.That opening act also serves as Toshinori\'s and his best friend, Dave\'s, backstory. The overall story itself serves as Midoriya\'s growth as a character as there are people and conditions that made him guilt tripping at some points in the movie, and that made me want this story somehow canonized.While as we can see from the trailer, not all the students of class A are shown, that is to serve for better purpose and reasons behind it. They managed to highlights each of the students\' power and how they contribute to each other to help people, all within the timeframe of 95 minutes, even made fangirls in the cinema started squealing when they reveals Kirishima and Todoroki.The story directing from how, why, and who when the conflict started, delivered in a great way and with pretty good pacing, all the better when it\'s almost reaching the climax, with occasional comedy placement between Mineta and Kaminari, that\'s really not out of place nor character, it\'s really fresh.Though there\'s a bit (really bit) bitter aftertaste in my tongue regarding the conclusion, for its lacks of aftermath scene. Despite that, i still suggest you wait until credit scene with ""Long Hope Philia"" song ends.*CHARACTER*Dave and Melissa Shield is a great character for Toshinori\'s and Midoriya\'s character development. They are a very likeable character, and very supportive to the both teacher-student, with a good backstory behind them that made me really sorry for Midoriya. Alas, aside from that i can\'t disclose much more about them as it will become spoiler.As for the other characters, well if you watched this movie before watching the main series i suggest you watch them first, it\'ll be much clearer of why they are there, their backgrounds and their statuses in the universe.Maybe that\'s kind of a minus too, there aren\'t any explanation of what their quirk is like how the series usually shows. Also the villains whose only purpose is to highlights the two heroes.*VISUAL*As for the visual itself i can\'t say it\'s great, it\'s just normal like how the series usually is, the colour palette and backgrounds aren\'t especially striking, really just normal. BUT, THAT IS COVERED BY SUPERB ANIMATIONS!!! OH MY GOD!!! WHAT AN EYEGASM! IT MADE ME JUMPED OFF MY SEAT, LIKE YOOOOOOOOWWWW WTFFF!!!! THE PALETTE SUDDENLY CHANGES FITTING THE ANIMATION, THE ANIMATION OF QUIRKS, POWERS, DESTRUCTION IN THE BACKGROUND, EXPRESSION, MOVEMENT, ALL THAT MADE MY JAW DROPPED! As the story builds, the animation are so on point of which scenes they needed to emphasize, it\'s so awesome and fits really well with story, character and sound.*SOUND*Two thumbs up, the foley and OSTs really immersed me. This is what i actually afraid of, and made me lowers my expectation. Because in the movie BONES made previously (Dead Apple), all the songs are inserted here and there, and those are not instrumental, which kinda distracts the audience because there are dialogues when the songs inserted. But thankfully, here on Two Heroes they mainly using an instrumental musics fitting the situation and mood. WHICH MADE MY ADRENALINE PUMPING (or maybe the whole audience in the cinema).(+) The story is great, serves more development for Toshinori and Midoriya(+) Likeable new characters(+) Animation is superb(+) Fighting scene is really great and impactful(+) Foley and OSTs are awesome(+) Enough screentime to highlights the students involved(+) Made you think some things may cause a plothole in the main series, but it\'s actually not(-) Lackluster villain motivation(-) Some students aren\'t explained really well of how they get to the island(-) The graphic are standardSummary:It was a great experience watching this movie, they successfully delivers the story they wanted to show and character\'s mood visualization, especially Midoriya\'s, which is very crucial. Despite the lacking of good villain and aftermath, this movie is still very enjoyable and worth watching.I really hope Dave and Melissa get canonized tho UwU. always compared to Tartarus, the famous prison in MHA universe.

Despite that, i still suggest you wait until credit scene with ""Long Hope Philia"" song ends.*CHARACTER*Dave and Melissa Shield is a great character for Toshinori\'s and Midoriya\'s character development. They are a very likeable character, and very supportive to the both teacher-student, with a good backstory behind them that made me really sorry for Midoriya. Alas, aside from that i can\'t disclose much more about them as it will become spoiler.As for the other characters, well if you watched this movie before watching the main series i suggest you watch them first, it\'ll be much clearer of why they are there, their backgrounds and their statuses in the universe.Maybe that\'s kind of a minus too, there aren\'t any explanation of what their quirk is like how the series usually shows. Also the villains whose only purpose is to highlights the two heroes.*VISUAL*As for the visual itself i can\'t say it\'s great, it\'s just normal like how the series usually is, the colour palette and backgrounds aren\'t especially striking, really just normal. BUT, THAT IS COVERED BY SUPERB ANIMATIONS!!! OH MY GOD!!! WHAT AN EYEGASM! IT MADE ME JUMPED OFF MY SEAT, LIKE YOOOOOOOOWWWW WTFFF!!!! THE PALETTE SUDDENLY CHANGES FITTING THE ANIMATION, THE ANIMATION OF QUIRKS, POWERS, DESTRUCTION IN THE BACKGROUND, EXPRESSION, MOVEMENT, ALL THAT MADE MY JAW DROPPED! As the story builds, the animation are so on point of which scenes they needed to emphasize, it\'s so awesome and fits really well with story, character and sound.*SOUND*Two thumbs up, the foley and OSTs really immersed me. This is what i actually afraid of, and made me lowers my expectation. Because in the movie BONES made previously (Dead Apple), all the songs are inserted here and there, and those are not instrumental, which kinda distracts the audience because there are dialogues when the songs inserted. But thankfully, here on Two Heroes they mainly using an instrumental musics fitting the situation and mood. WHICH MADE MY ADRENALINE PUMPING (or maybe the whole audience in the cinema).(+) The story is great, serves more development for Toshinori and Midoriya(+) Likeable new characters(+) Animation is superb(+) Fighting scene is really great and impactful(+) Foley and OSTs are awesome(+) Enough screentime to highlights the students involved(+) Made you think some things may cause a plothole in the main series, but it\'s actually not(-) Lackluster villain motivation(-) Some students aren\'t explained really well of how they get to the island(-) The graphic are standardSummary:It was a great experience watching this movie, they successfully delivers the story they wanted to show and character\'s mood visualization, especially Midoriya\'s, which is very crucial. Despite the lacking of good villain and aftermath, this movie is still very enjoyable and worth watching.I really hope Dave and Melissa get canonized tho UwU.', 'Boku no Hero Academia the Movie: Futari no Hero is my first experience of watching an anime movie in a cinema, and I have to say it was pretty great! This review will contain some vague spoilers (such as mentioning new characters), so do not read if you have not seen the movie or care about these things.This is an original movie set (supposedly, it is actually somewhat confusing) in the time between the end of Season 2 and the start of Season 3, so before the Forest Training Camp Arc. It is a fast-paced, action-packed and well-animated side-story to the popular anime. In it,...Deku and All Might head to the ""I-Island"" to attend a world-famous ""I-Expo"" where some of the best scientists in the world research quirks. This, however, is really an excuse for All Might to visit his old friend, but as one can easily guess, things do not go smoothly and villains interrupt their plans.Story - 7:Honestly, a pretty basic ""villains VS. heroes"" set-up, with a classic BnHA scenario of adult heroes being incapacitated, requiring the young UA students to rise to the occasion and save the day. There are some fairly predictable ""plot-twists"", but overall the movie has a very simple story line. Nothing really phenomenal, but just like the main series, this movie manages to work well and is enjoyable to watch.Art - 9:Amazing as always, Studio Bones is again showing how good and reliable it is. Nothing much to say here, if you have seen the main series, it will be more of the same excellent animation throughout the whole movie. I have to commend them for making the fight scenes especially ""juicy"" and you get to see all your favorite characters fight it out against the villains in very high quality. If I had to name the strengths of this movie, art is definitely one of them.Sound - 9:As usual, a job well done, both by the VAs and the soundtrack team. Most OST is re-used from the main series, however I think there is one or two original tracks, which were all great. Miyake Kenta as All Might is as great as ever, and I really enjoyed Koyama Rikya (VA for Takamura from Hajime no Ippo) as the main villain.Character - 7:Fan-favorite All Might and the protagonist Deku play the leading roles in this movie, with the familiar Class 1-A students joining in the action as the supporting cast. There are also two new major characters (which were previously mentioned in episode 20 of Season 3), Melissa and her dad Dave, who is All Might\'s friend from his early days of being a hero.I really liked that the movie provided some backstory to All Might, and I enjoyed the new character Melissa; however, I feel like the movie could have explored some of the aspects of these characters (such as Melissa being quirkless, and thus sympathetic to Deku\'s early struggles, and vice versa), and the friendship dynamic of Dave and All Might in a richer manner. Because they did not, Melissa especially feels like wasted potential, and is presented as merely this one-dimensional all-round perfect daddy\'s girl - perhaps that\'s what they aimed for, but in my opinion her character could have been effectively used for Deku\'s development. The villains are entirely forgettable, and other than a great seiyuu of the main villain and a small reference/nod to All for one, they were as bland and dull as possible. I guess the main villain had a somewhat interesting quirk, but that is all.The rest of the Class 1-A are not really developed in any significant manner, and reflect their current characterization in the main series (the slight hint of some romantic development between Deku and Uraraka at the very start is unfortunately used only as comedic relief). Overall, decent but could have been a lot better in my opinion.Enjoyment - 10:The most important aspect of any anime is how enjoyable and fun it actually is, and I have to say that despite some of the problems that I have written about, this movie was a blast to watch. Great comedy (despite the overuse of Mineta, which the main series suffers from as well), amazing fights, emotional moments - this movie has it all. If you are a fan of BnHA, you will have tons of fun watching it, and that is what really matters.Overall - 8:Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, especially given my experience of watching it on a big screen in a cinema. The story and characters could be better, however the animation and fights make up for that. If you are a fan of Boku no Hero Academia and cannot get enough of it, then I am sure you will greatly enjoy this side-story movie. It did not blow my mind, but it was worth my time and money, 8/10.

Season 3 was not great, and I'm not sure how it's higher rated than the movie to be honest, action and excitement wise, the movie takes the cake.If you have watched all seasons of the show, it may leave you a little stumped as to when the movie actually takes place, I was trying to figure it out with my friends and from what I gathered it takes place after Season 2, and before Season...3.I found this 5x more interesting than anything that had happened in the second half of Season 3, so I was extremely happy and delighted. Overall, the movie covers a bit of All-Might's backstory and progresses the bond between the class of UA, even if it is just filler, I quite enjoyed it. 3.I found this 5x more interesting than anything that had happened in the second half of Season 3, so I was extremely happy and delighted.

When it comes to shows like this, I can't help but feel they are promotional cash grabs meant to sucker people in who already love the show. It just so happens that I am one of those suckers. The very moment this movie was announced I knew I had to watch it and decide for myself whether it was a hollow replica or something that can stand on its own merit.Story- 7This might as well have been called All Might the Movie because he is what drives this story's plot and...is very much the highlight of what is otherwise a by the book film. We get to explore All Might's early days which is a treat for anyone who loves our plus ultra of justice, and its a shame we did not get to see anymore of All Might in his prime. Past that we are introduced to our main plot consisting of heroes and villains and you probably know where this is going. The first twenty and the last twenty minutes are by far the most compelling reasons to watch while the rest feels like filler. Overall, the story is fine with the real standout plot point being All Might's origin which doesn't last as long as it should. I will give it praise though for actually having a connection to the main story line.Characters- 7It's pretty much the same cast we all know and love from the series, most of which do not serve a purpose nor do they experience much development. This is to be expected as the main character of this movie is our lord and savior All Might in all his youthful glory. Just getting to see All Might again with a smile on his face as he kicks some villain but laughing all the way is a sight to behold. We are also exposed to some unfamiliar faces created just for this movie. One of which, David Shield admittedly doesn't add much to All Might's character arc with the exception of their interaction in All Might's early days. In fact I found his daughter to be far more compelling and that's not just because Horikoshi is a wiz when it comes to designing female characters, as it was nice to see a quirkless character have some exposure in a quirk filled world. Oh yeah, there is also a villain because this is a superhero movie who isn't all that compelling and mainly serves as a punching bag for our main characters.Animation- 9By far and a way this movie's main selling point is its animation. Boku no Hero Academia is already known for having stellar animation, so when it was greenlit for a movie you know Studio Bones is going to dial it up to eleven. There are quite a few standout scenes in this movie that can easily go toe-to-toe with some of the most hype moments in the main series. Speaking of hype, in case I haven't mentioned All Might enough already, most of the key scenes involve our boy in crisp animation so good your eyes will be screaming plus ultra!Sound- 6I'll keep this part short as there isn't really much to say. Most of the music is reused and I couldn't hear much in the way of anything original which is disappointing. However the show music they do use is fine enough so it is what it is.Enjoyment- 8Overall, I got what I wanted out of this movie. It had the All Might origin that I so desperately craved and well animated fight scenes that put a smile on my face. The story is good enough for a standard length movie and the characters served their purpose. I wouldn't say its an integral part of the overall story, but damn did it feel good seeing All Might going all out one last time. is very much the highlight of what is otherwise a by the book film.

But for the most part, it\'s Midoriya fluffing around in I-Island seeing all the attractions while giving Melissa some screentime with Midoriya.It\'s the latter half where it turns into Die Hard where the students of Class 1A gets to show their worth as they climb the tower to get the security system back to normal, from the typical headliners like Todoroki, Iida and Bakugou to Ochako, Momo, Kaminari, Jirou, Kirishima and yes even the grape scum Mineta gets his limelight at one point of the movie. Our main antagonist Wolfram voiced by Rikiya Koyama is our Hans Gruber if the Die Hard analogue is anything to go by and he\'s your typical ""final boss"" of the movie but LA didn\'t expect him to have links with....""him"" giving us something at least that doesn\'t make this movie completely isolated from it\'s anime series and heck Dave Shields and the revelations towards the latter half with him, not only does he get major development but also shows him clinging to the past with All Might to be detrimental and to look beyond to the future *cough* Midoriya *cough*.Animation-wise, done once again by Studio bones, the animation overall is indeed having the exact same aesthetics as the anime series right down to the fights shown having blocky destructive background work that bones and Boku no Hero Academia is well known for. Character designs are striking as always and the background work is in great standards. It\'s Bones going to the big screen, so yeah it\'s expected that the best set pieces, the fights are fluidly and amazingly animated.Voice acting, well LA doesn\'t have much to say, the returning cast is back but with three new characters thus voice actors, those being Rikiya Koyama as Wolfram, Katsuhisa Namase as Dave Shields and Mirai Shida as Melissa. The new cast is great and mingle nicely with the rest of the cast with major props to Rikiya Koyama doing a marvelous main antagonist for this movie. As for the returning cast, LA HAS to give MVP once again to Kenta Miyake as All Might but also Daiki Yamashita as Midoriya.No movie is without flaws however, LA did find that the movie liked to flashback to the anime series and even to it\'s own previous scenes at times and to be honest, sure the anime series did it for clarity but even so, if your a fan of a particular anime series and a movie came out, we should have ALREADY known this, thankfully the flashbacks were rare to say the least so that it could give us new material. The other flaw would be that as much as Wolfram is the main antagonist of this movie and has ties to ""him"", he was an ""ok"" villain overall, it\'s just felt like his presences was only truly felt near the end of the movie and not encompassing the movie, as one he was behind the shadows early on and two, on the latter half, he let his lackeys do all the work, it\'s not until the finale he showed his true colors, LA just wanted more form him really. Really as much as LA has some flaws with this movie, the movie manages to defends it\'s flaws and making up for it one way or another.Melissa however was an interesting character in all honesty, a Quirkless person who wanted to be like a pro hero like Midoriya, but since she was Quirkless she went into support and loved making this for heroes like her father Dave did for All Might, a sorta of introspective look at what would of happened if Midoriya didn\'t get One for All, it\'s kinda too bad that we didn\'t go more in-depth with her in the movie as it would had been interesting but nonetheless what LA got was still fine.Boku no Hero Academia the Movie: Futari no Hero is an obvious must see for Boku no Hero fans and LA was worried this would do the anime movie syndrome of having it being a one-shot, isolated from the anime series movie filled with compilation scenes from the anime series, but Boku no Hero Academia the Movie: Futari no Hero did well to NOT do this but still implement in a ways that we\'re still getting new material, a new story out of it and it did just that.  Yes the movie has some flaws but still the movie holds up even with it. LA\'s experience with Boku no Hero Academia the Movie: Futari no Hero is pretty much a 95 minute long mini-arc of the anime series, just with the theatrics of being a blockbuster movie and man does it show.Boku no Hero Academia the Movie: Futari no Hero did go beyond PLUS ULTRA but expected from Boku no Hero Academia. for heroes and the like, Midoriya later meets his classmates of 1A one way or another before some villains hack into the security system holding the entire I-Island hostage, it up to All Might and some of Class 1A to stop them.So LA will say the first half of the movie is to get the audience acquintated with I-Island as well as giving us hints towards the latter half of the movie involving Dave. But for the most part, it\'s Midoriya fluffing around in I-Island seeing all the attractions while giving Melissa some screentime with Midoriya.It\'s the latter half where it turns into Die Hard where the students of Class 1A gets to show their worth as they climb the tower to get the security system back to normal, from the typical headliners like Todoroki, Iida and Bakugou to Ochako, Momo, Kaminari, Jirou, Kirishima and yes even the grape scum Mineta gets his limelight at one point of the movie. Our main antagonist Wolfram voiced by Rikiya Koyama is our Hans Gruber if the Die Hard analogue is anything to go by and he\'s your typical ""final boss"" of the movie but LA didn\'t expect him to have links with....""him"" giving us something at least that doesn\'t make this movie completely isolated from it\'s anime series and heck Dave Shields and the revelations towards the latter half with him, not only does he get major development but also shows him clinging to the past with All Might to be detrimental and to look beyond to the future *cough* Midoriya *cough*.Animation-wise, done once again by Studio bones, the animation overall is indeed having the exact same aesthetics as the anime series right down to the fights shown having blocky destructive background work that bones and Boku no Hero Academia is well known for. Character designs are striking as always and the background work is in great standards. It\'s Bones going to the big screen, so yeah it\'s expected that the best set pieces, the fights are fluidly and amazingly animated.Voice acting, well LA doesn\'t have much to say, the returning cast is back but with three new characters thus voice actors, those being Rikiya Koyama as Wolfram, Katsuhisa Namase as Dave Shields and Mirai Shida as Melissa. The new cast is great and mingle nicely with the rest of the cast with major props to Rikiya Koyama doing a marvelous main antagonist for this movie.

The last one was Perfect Blue, there was 8, and 5 of them was people I dragged along. This time, the theatre was filled, it’s almost as full as a first screening of a marvel superhero movie. I think it shook an emotion inside me to see things you like in real life, the anime community in the west isn’t small, but it’s always online and nothing ever comes...to the cinema. It’s so different to watch it on big screen, to laugh out loud with everyone when All Might says “shit” or every time Kacchan does his shouty Kacchan things, to feel hype and tense about the boss fight. Shonen series has this tendency to generate a little fire in you, times that by how many other people in the cinema at that time, it’s as powerful as a Detroit smash! Very enjoyable!! My experience of this film is obviously skewed compared to the guys who watched it alone at home with a smaller screen. Nevertheless, here’s a breakdown, no major spoliers.Characters:There is no character development for the supporting characters (I would argue very little development for our main boys too), the movie’s target audience is most likely people who have seen the TV series, it’s expecting the audience to know the back story and the quirks of each character. While I don’t think you need to watch the series to enjoy the film, I think it contributes to the enjoyment. Such as, when Kacchan says “Thank you” to Kirishima and everyone is suddenly crying at his character development – because he’s our jerk teenage son who is opening up and being nice finally. Or when Deku says “Thank you” to Todoroki when he uses his fire – because we know he’s reluctant to use his fire quirk due to his father. Or why everyone in the cinema collectively groan when Mineta appeared on screen (tbh I wanted Tsuyu to have more of a screen time, alas!).Plot:A stereotypical superhero movie storyline, superheroes fights the villains, superheroes saves the day. Now that doesn’t mean it’s bad because how have DC and Marvel been running for 7 decades, am I right? There is a small plot twist. It’s still an interesting film, although I would’ve liked to see more of the island and the features it supposedly have, that might be interesting, what I’m saying is, I need a Godzillo spinoff.Art and music:Pretty good, fluid animation, good use of music, nothing major to have a dig at or praise.Overall:It’s like another arc to the existing story, a fun watch.Melissa is also best girl you can’t change my mind. to the cinema.

It has the predictable anime superhero plot line with some minor twists that allow for a thorough enjoyment of the plot overall.A key thing I greatly enjoyed was the All Might short it started out with that kind of opened up the character of All Might to the viewers in a way we hadn\'t particularly seen. This then, obviously, fed later in to the movie when we got to meet other big All Might...fans that had actually known him in his other ages, contrasting to young Midoriya who just idolised him and his past, despite not really being there for it.The characters that were movie exclusive were also compelling ranging from the powered villian who basely sought out more power for his employer and himself to the young, powerless girl All Might had known since her younger days.These compelling characters combined with a signature MHA soundtrack allowed for a great overall experience that, like with most shonen, was cookie cutter yet used its IP to try and stand out as its own well-developed film. fans that had actually known him in his other ages, contrasting to young Midoriya who just idolised him and his past, despite not really being there for it.The characters that were movie exclusive were also compelling ranging from the powered villian who basely sought out more power for his employer and himself to the young, powerless girl All Might had known since her younger days.These compelling characters combined with a signature MHA soundtrack allowed for a great overall experience that, like with most shonen, was cookie cutter yet used its IP to try and stand out as its own well-developed film.', ""The movie wasn't bad, wasn't too great either in my opinion. I don't think it was necessary to make this movie. It was fine to watch, but it gave be filler vibes that I got from Bleach. All the character joining in seemed a little much and unnecessary, but there were some enjoyable scenes between them all. I give it a 7, I wouldn't necessarily watch it again soon though. The series I can watch over and over, but like I said, the movie wasn't really necessary.Story: 7. It was a predictable story line and how they brought in all of the characters was a...little lame, but there were moments that really made me smile and beam.

It was as if they wanted to put all the character in there that we all love, but it was forced and kind of just to have them there. It was kind of disappointing. They don't have a reason to be there. If it had been just All Might and Deku from UA, that would have been more than enough.Enjoyment: 7. Just because 6 is too low and 8 is too high.

Characters from the TV series were still very interesting and all played their parts really well. However, new characters such as David and Melissa were pretty bland in my opinion. Had real big expectations to Dave’s character but it turned out pretty mediocre. Melissa felt redundant as well though I do understand why a character like her’s would be beneficial to the movie. My main complaint would be the villain, he felt really boring without a real purpose in this film.Music and scores...were above average, nothing really outstanding.However, the animation really saved the movie. The final fight truly outstanding, as expected from My Hero Academia fights. The emotional feeling from seeing Midoriya and All Might working side by side, pupil and mentor, really made me feel a sense of pride. Similar to seeing Minato alongside Naruto in the ninja war arc. The fights was truly spectacular and like I said, this is the one redeeming point in the movie!Overall, the movie is still considered good in my opinion though some may find it boring and tasteless.

The animation is great as usual, and so is the sound, although at times it felt a hint recycled from the series itself.I absolutely loved the idea of Deku and All Might heading off to a sort of ""side story"" of their own, especially with All Might\'s past mixed in, but this is exactly why I felt that mixing in so much of the regular cast was a mistake. The new side characters felt new and interesting, while the regular ones were crammed in so bad that...they didn\'t come off as nearly as interesting or resourceful as in the series itself.In short, not a bad movie, but not a memorable one either. It tried to emulate the series in a film\'s form factor, which in my opinion wasted most of the film\'s potential and premise. they didn\'t come off as nearly as interesting or resourceful as in the series itself.In short, not a bad movie, but not a memorable one either.

Although some of those expectations were met, I was let down by a few points throughout the movie. The lower score mostly comes from the hurried ending and the character-building for the new characters.What makes Boku no Hero Academia so special is how it involves the entire class. Far too often in a school-themed anime, the show/movie only focuses on like 1 or 2 people. But BNHA utilizes all the characters in the school so they're not just background figures for Izuku and Bakugo. Although the movie only focuses on certain kids from...class 1-A, it was a relief that all the kids were featured at some point, even if only for a moment.That said BNHA introduces two new characters for the movie's plot. While good characters, I felt there could've been more time spent on character building. We all have seen class 1-A and know them well. I wish I could've felt the same connection towards the new characters brought into the movie.The last thing on my list is that the movie ended abruptly. I know abruptly is vague but I'm trying not to spoil anything. They definitely could've taken 15 minutes to have a cooldown. Once the movie ended. I felt like it just wasted my time because there were some questions I want to be answered. Who knows? They might answer them in movie 2.Overall, it was a bit rushed but still a good movie, and if you like BNHA definitely check it out. class 1-A, it was a relief that all the kids were featured at some point, even if only for a moment.That said BNHA introduces two new characters for the movie's plot.

Even today, it is part of one of the best mangas of recent years.

Now that it’s done and the second feature film of the licence is going to be screened, I thought it was the right...time to talk about this first film. Is this movie good?

Y\'know? And well... it was good. (lol)The movie is what you\'d expect really; a more-than-decent film with our beloved characters fighting against a giant threat a saving the day! Plot wise, it\'s nothing unexpected or special, although to be fair, that plot did surprise me hehe. But my friends said that they saw it coming, so maybe it\'s just me who\'s blind.The art of the movie is PHENOMENAL, as you\'d expect for the blockbuster film of one of the biggest animes right now; everything looked so crisp, hell! Even...the random eagle in the intro looked phenomenal! It was wayyy above average, really amazing and beautiful.Now the meaty part, the characters. As per usual, the character\'s are what tie the plot together. Every single character is as great as ever! They make the movie fun, and enjoyable and make the alright story into massive fun! Also the battles where amazing, really really dope! As per character development, I dunno what to say, because basically anything that happened in the movie never ever gets mentioned again in the show, lol. So it\'s kinda like it never happened really.Also can we talk about how great the guys looked in the outfits?! hehe.The worst thing about the movie is that it\'s a bit stale and non significant. It truly loses impact after you finish it. Reason\'s being that it\'s a bit predicable and it feels like nothing happened although it was technically a huge fight. And that final battle... that final battle was just bad. I feel like the villain got back up stronger after being beaten by Midoriya and All Might like 7 times. After the second time, it\'s already like ""just fuckin end it already!"" and thus the movie seems even more insignifcant if the most important moment feels lame.Regardless, I still quite enjoyed this movie, and while it prolly deserves a 7, I  liked a bit more than that, to be honest...

And even if I wasn\'t knowing too much about the story (only watched 3 episodes), I think it was an enjoyable experience. So many people said that the Boku No Hero\'s movie feels just like a cheap cash grab, but for me it was okay. Let me be clearer.....Story:The story is not something different. If you watched the actual Boku No Hero anime, then what are you waiting for? Just go and watch the movie. For me, it\'s not something that deeply impacted me. It feels like another generic shounen, except for the characters...and its themes as well. I don\'t know too much about the story, so I can\'t tell too much. I went to the movie theaters and watched, without knowing almost anything about the actual story. It basically starts, introducing the appearance of ""quirks"" (which are superpowers, that the 80% of the humanity have). With that, the majority of people possesses various abilities, since manipulation to shapeshift. However, our main character Izuku Midoriya bornt without those superpowers. Since he was a child, he has an ambition to become an superhero (making notes about each hero he find), but without his special abilities, your fate was being judged by 80% of people. But things can change sometimes: one day, he met the number 1 hero All Might: an personal idol. His quirk can be transferred to another peole, so All Might decided to take his power to Midoriya. After lots of months of hard training, Izuku got to enroll in UA, a prestigious highschool for superheroes in training. With a lot of talented classmates, and being threated by a villanous organization, Izuku, with the course of time, will learn: what means to be a hero.Not all the people have superpowers, but not all of them need to have them to save people. Sometimes, you can fight with the teachings that life gave to you, or with your mind. Powers, sometimes, can be at second place. And that\'s why we have the I-Island, and island for cientists that creates support items that assists the heroes, and dedicated to research Quirks and everything related to hero stuffs. The movie introduces two new characters: Dave (an old All Might\'s friend), and his daughter Melissa; two people that don\'t have superpowers (as Midoriya in the past), and cientists. The UA is taking an summer break on that island, but a mysterious squad infiltrated the I-Island, and it\'s up to Midoriya and his friends to confront them. So, keep on your head: the plot itself is not new. Almost everything is predictable, but it\'s still an anime hyped by everyone. I think if you watched the actual show, you probably gonna like the movie as well.Art:Kinda unispiring, studio Bones could make the art looks better. CGI isn\'t the best, and sometimes, I got confused with some scenes, being so much look like the Naruto x Pain fight scene... lmao. Bones is not the best in terms of art style, if we put Ufotable (for example) to the side. But, other than that, it\'s great, refreshing and average for an shounen anime. If you\'re praising for the art, then this movie couldn\'t be for you. Look for Fate or Shingeki no Kyojin, because they are eyes-blessing. On Boku No Hero\'s movie, the best scene is the final fight scene (CALIFORNIA SMAAAAAAAASH), which was well-animated, and a funny spectacle as well.Sound:Well, I felt Kimetsu No Yaiba\'s vibes with the soundtrack of the movie. Both of them are shounen, so you can expect the same from both (goosebumpy and emotional soundtracks). A great ending song, and probably one of my favorites.Characters:Usually shounen animes tend to be predictable, and for being great, it needs to have a lot of well-performed fight scenes, and charisma for the majority of characters. It wasn\'t something that I felt with that movie. I personally think that we can have a great relationship between Dave and All Might, but Melissa could be shown in a better way. Removing them, not all the 1-A were presented, and I think that was great. One major problem I\'m finding is the character development: we could have a wider narrative, and a stronger cast of characters, but sometimes, it fails to present an refreshing relationship with them. To be honest, it\'s not a huge problem. I kinda felt the same Kimetsu No Yaiba, but still, they\'re both great animes. Boku No Hero could be a more dynamical development, and younger All Might is one of the most exciting things on the movie lol. But it\'s still resonable for a shounen animes. Could have a better villain as well, and my favorite characters are Yaoyorozu and Todoroki (an couple btw).Enjoyment:Well, it was great. The ending is not best, too rushed, and sometimes the movie can be cringy. But I think it was a great experience. I watched at the movie theaters, and what can you expect: lots of fun with the characters; the OST as the strongest part, but an rushed ending and a predictable movie.If you are a big fan of the franchise, just go and watch. If you are like me (only watched the movie and skipped the anime), then you can\'t expect to be the big hit on the shounen world. Overall, it was good, and I actually need to continue to watch the Boku No Hero anime. If you\'re familiarized with the action genre, then you\'re gonna like it). That\'s it. and its themes as well. I don\'t know too much about the story, so I can\'t tell too much. I went to the movie theaters and watched, without knowing almost anything about the actual story. It basically starts, introducing the appearance of ""quirks"" (which are superpowers, that the 80% of the humanity have).

It's technically Die Hard with superheroes, and I wasn't very surprised when I found this overused action movie trope applying to My Hero Academia which has basically converted and adopted a lot of tropes from The West as its own. The plot is simple and you pretty much know how it will end, but the intense action and some good plot twists make this more than an enjoyable experience.The opening action sequence, for example, is breathlessly captivating and leaves you smiling. Then, as we return to our usual characters once again as...the plot unfolds, the proceedings heat up and in spite of the realization that we might actually be getting a very predictable plot for a movie like this, the excitement of wanting to see our beloved heroes fight and showcase their fantastic quirks makes up for most of it. The voice acting is as usual top notch, especially in the last fight where I literally felt excitement rising very high. Characters were dealt with pretty well, and the animation... of course, stunning!This is just a fun action movie to be enjoyed by the MHA fans who won't mind seeing something beyond the series. After all, this fun-filled blockbuster has mostly what the series has offered so far: great action, solid characters, captivating story and...

Just a movie to put that arc somewhere, I get it.Nothing special really, there are some anime movies continued from a series that I love, this was eh, okay.The girl that we get introduced to with the glasses though is very pretty, just felt like I had to add that in since this series is known for it's lovely ladies, although as we know it obnoxiously sexualizes them.Anyways okay movie, it's kinda just something to watch if you want to I guess.From my experience you can understand MHA just fine without watching this movie I believe.So yeah, it's just whatever. "", ""It was fun, I mean it wasn't spectacular? It was fun. Do you know what I mean? As stated before by others, it's incredibly predictable and unoriginal (that sounds so bad but come on, what did we really expect) but it's still a pretty good time. I would say it is not necessary to watch this movie to understand the series at all. It has some lore but I don't think will affect the main series in the slightest.Art style remains the same from the series, very high quality.The characters are as you would expect from the series: kind of generic, predictable (sorry but let's...be honest), but still fun (I don't know how else to describe this movie...).Again, it was fun, nothing amazing. be honest), but still fun (I don't know how else to describe this movie...).Again, it was fun, nothing amazing."", ""It gave me hope and power at the end of the movie.

That's how it affected me.I couldn't give a dang about how anyone says about the overall movie. This is a Shounen that captivated me to feel hope, even at the hardest times. I had fun with the characters and how they interacted. "", ""Imagine if this movie was the first thing about MHA you see (and you're not a shounen fan), would it appeal to you? Admittedly, I would have enjoyed this movie as an MHA first-timer and non-shounen fan. That's why the irony is that, as an avid MHA fan, this movie was a slap in the face. The production value was nice, but the effort to write a decent and well thought-out storyline was low-key. This movie clearly rode on the coattails of the series' success to be this mediocre and predictable, and possibly not up-to-date with what's actually happening in the show.Like most anime movies...based on a series, the setting is in an isolated movie-only situation. There are some new people who show up in the movie to be relevant (with a shoehorned backstory to justify that), there's villains to be worried about, and it's up to our heroes to save the day. This formula is followed by this movie to a T. To add insult to injury, only a certain and very small portion of the UA cast were selected to take center stage, while the rest were given 5 to 10 seconds of screentime before pushing them out of the picture once their existence in the movie was established.To say nothing of the MHA characters, some of them were turned into cliche stereotypes of themselves, while most of them barely did anything to make an impact throughout the movie. And again, this was because of the 95% being cut out of the plot.As for the movie-only characters, the Shields (which I daresay is a blatant Marvel reference), their part to play in All Might's making as the greatest hero of all time doesn't have the kind of impact the screenwriter must have been banking on. Nothing was at stake or gained with this family; whatever reasons they had for doing what they did or what they wanted to do, were half-hearted and barely believable to really make fans care about what they may achieve outside of the main story, let alone root for their success. The Shields went through the motions of being heartwarming and stirring up the conflict necessary to give them all an adversary to fight back, and they still pale in comparison to the accomplishments of Horikoshi's own characters, who were always a cut above the usual anime tropes.Nothing was gained or reaffirmed in this movie. It was pure filler from start to finish. On a more personal note, I'm still waiting for Bones (or preferably Horikoshi himself) to write up a movie storyline that plays out like a DC animated film instead of another anime cashgrab, really give me something to get hyped up about. based on a series, the setting is in an isolated movie-only situation.

People in the BNHA fanbase were excited for it, even I was into thinking it'll be great, but was unable to purchase the movie because of money issues. I just so happened to find a copy in the college library I work at and decided to check it out myself after waiting for so long to do so on a weekend night.And in a way, I was disappointed to some extent.What is my issue you might ask? Why am I, who consider myself a BNHA fan,...be annoyed with how this movie was played? Well, here's why...Warning: Spoilers---Story [5]: Okay, the story was a rough 5-6 score point for me. Yes, the story is not meant to be a solid canon to the BNHA main storyline, but at the same time, it's pretty forgettable. It doesn't have a storyline that hasn't been done before in other shounen stories. Defeat some big bad villain and win the day. The only reason that the main villain in the whole story is really there is because of the canon villain in the main storyline. The thing with the main storyline villains that we are introduced to have character development and backstories. That would be extremely difficult to accomplish in a movie timeframe, I agree. But our main villain in the movie is just cheesy. He doesn't really have a real goal besides snatching a person and an item before bolting off somewhere. The 'plot twists' in the movie are predictable, especially if you have watched other shounen movies or even just movies in general before.All the characters we know in the main storyline or are introduced to in the movie are just...there. They have no real purpose besides to set up the movie's storyline. They are there with the lamest of excuses. Only our main protagonist and his mentor appear to have a swell purpose in there throughout the movie. It's just a coincidence that they're all there. Instead of this, they should've just brought in all the classmates and say it was a school trip or something. But then they'd have to spend more of a budget for this movie with more voice actors coming in, character drawings, etc. You wanna know what pissed me off the most? When the characters are looking at each other, they for some reason have some sort of telepathic understanding of what the other wants from them. What??? It would be as pointless if there was nothing being said that whole time of just staring at each other! Was there something I miss in the main storyline that where the characters all learn this telepathic communication thing with just their eyes? Was there someone telepathic in the midst something letting them do that? I don't understand!But it would've been more worth the time to push this movie out, right? It's rather obvious the movie was created just for a cash grab with a plot this stiff;Sorry for the rant there, but here's the plot of it; main protag comes in with his mentor and coincidentally, meets some of his classmates there. They do some stuff together, happy happy, and then the big bad villain comes in to sh*t on their parade. Big bad villain takes down main protag's badass mentor with some other heroes and its up to the main protag to kick his ass with his classmates, get the girl (who won't matter after this movie), and get that happy, pointless ending.That's the plot. Mediocre is a real good title for the score point.Art [7]: The art's pretty alright. It holds up to it's main storyline's art. It holds true to the character designs. But I can notice even on my first movie watch that there are animation and drawing errors when characters do something such as running together. Other times, there's CGI... Yeah, that's a tough thing to work with on a 2D animation level. It's not the worst. But it's definitely not Ghost in the Shell levels. One of the obstacles that the characters have to face is so simple and bland-looking that I question why it was even CGI-made to begin with. Only part I thought was ideal to use CGI on was at the very end of the movie due to the complicated nature of what was going on.I think they could've worked more on the animation progress than what they did, but otherwise, it could've worked off as a typical BNHA episode's level of design, if they throw away the CGI junk.Sound [7]: BNHA's music is amazing. Always so inspiring to hear and almost never do I skip the opening or endings of each main storyline episode I watch with them. Hearing them again in this movie is none the worse. I expected to have new music though at least and not just revised orchestra themed versions, but hey, I already admitted to knowing this movie was just a cash grab. But otherwise, the music is okay when it is there. Otherwise, it's silent and feels somewhat empty whenever something is happening.Character [4]: HAHAHAHAHA- This is the fun part. The characters we're introduced to are downright cheap and lazy. As I said, it's hard to get a character developed in a matter of a movie's timeframe, but seriously, one of the new characters are absolutely not even important to have. They're there, because...they're there. They are an addition to some backpiece to the mentor's backstory, but otherwise, they could've been pressed off into some manga chapter or slowly formed in the main storyline over time, not in a movie. The unimportant character, named Melissa, has only one purpose in the whole storyline; to help the main protag get back control of the highjacked island that was taken by the big bad villain.She has no quirk, relating to Midoriya, our main protag. I can see why she was made; just as a romantic option for Midoriya to squeeze in on. They made it obvious that way when all the convenience female classmates that end up there express their jealousy in the beginning when Midoriya is hanging out with Melissa. Since when did they have hots for him besides Uraraka, our bubbly, gravity-free girl? What was the point? If you took Melissa out of the picture, I wouldn't even notice. We already have good based female characters who know what they're doing in a way of hero's work. Midoriya was willing to risk a life of a quirkless girl who was only there to shut down a system. How does she even know how the system works? Did her father make the system? Did she work with security before? That's like a random citizen of a country just knowing how to bypass their government's system. Really cheap. At least she made this boss invention for Midoriya to use to help him succeed, but surprise surprise, he breaks it and he never will use it again, unless somehow, some reason, she decides to remake it for him to use that won't break each time he uses it.As for her father who has the North American name Dave, because he is from the United States after all, is in relation to All Might, Midoriya's mentor's, backstory as the dude who just stuck around with him. He was saved by All Might, is quirkless like his daughter, and decided to go into the scientific field to invest his time with All Might as a way to thank him and save lives with him, even if indirect. Dave made this certain device for All Might   as to improve his heroism, only to have it taken away due to governmental issues with it. He has an assistant named Sam, who betrays him later in the movie, who holds no purpose EITHER besides just handing the device to the big bad villain. He just wanted money for the device even after working all these years with Dave. Talk about worthless loyalty being as worthless as the character.The big, bad villain I've been talking about? Don't even know his name. Maybe the movie said it somewhere. I don't know, but I certainly don't remember it. I recall the guy having scars all over his face, who had a hyped up reveal throughout the movie, but other than that, he was just another villain with a mask on who was a goon for an actually interesting main villain in the main storyline. Hilarious they only had the main villain's voice actor come in for like, one line only. So the main villain used the device against Midoriya and his friends, but with great spirit, saves the day with his mentor with his trademark b*tch punch power.The new characters were bland, while the old characters were stale. They were just there. That's the whole damn movie; the characters are there because they are.Enjoyment [6]: It was your typical shounen anime movie plotline. It's not bad, but it wasn't something that would make you remember the movie. You could've even not watch the movie at all and just stick with the main anime storyline (or manga's) and nothing would change. The movie really was a cash grab. It was a time mover if you have nothing better to do, but isn't something to spend a whole lot of money on unless you wish to complete your BNHA collection. At least you can brag to any friends willing to listen that you have the copy that you probably won't watch ever again.Overall [6]: I averaged it out to a 6. Like I said, the movie isn't BAD per say, but not a masterpiece you would want to watch over and over again. Hopefully the next movie they're spawning out at the time I've written this review fix the mistakes this movie made into making something far better than what was given. be annoyed with how this movie was played?

We already have good based female characters who know what they're doing in a way of hero's work. Midoriya was willing to risk a life of a quirkless girl who was only there to shut down a system. How does she even know how the system works? Did her father make the system? Did she work with security before? That's like a random citizen of a country just knowing how to bypass their government's system. Really cheap. At least she made this boss invention for Midoriya to use to help him succeed, but surprise surprise, he breaks it and he never will use it again, unless somehow, some reason, she decides to remake it for him to use that won't break each time he uses it.As for her father who has the North American name Dave, because he is from the United States after all, is in relation to All Might, Midoriya's mentor's, backstory as the dude who just stuck around with him. He was saved by All Might, is quirkless like his daughter, and decided to go into the scientific field to invest his time with All Might as a way to thank him and save lives with him, even if indirect. Dave made this certain device for All Might   as to improve his heroism, only to have it taken away due to governmental issues with it. He has an assistant named Sam, who betrays him later in the movie, who holds no purpose EITHER besides just handing the device to the big bad villain. He just wanted money for the device even after working all these years with Dave. Talk about worthless loyalty being as worthless as the character.The big, bad villain I've been talking about? Don't even know his name. Maybe the movie said it somewhere. I don't know, but I certainly don't remember it. I recall the guy having scars all over his face, who had a hyped up reveal throughout the movie, but other than that, he was just another villain with a mask on who was a goon for an actually interesting main villain in the main storyline. Hilarious they only had the main villain's voice actor come in for like, one line only. So the main villain used the device against Midoriya and his friends, but with great spirit, saves the day with his mentor with his trademark b*tch punch power.The new characters were bland, while the old characters were stale. They were just there. That's the whole damn movie; the characters are there because they are.Enjoyment [6]: It was your typical shounen anime movie plotline. It's not bad, but it wasn't something that would make you remember the movie. You could've even not watch the movie at all and just stick with the main anime storyline (or manga's) and nothing would change. The movie really was a cash grab. It was a time mover if you have nothing better to do, but isn't something to spend a whole lot of money on unless you wish to complete your BNHA collection. At least you can brag to any friends willing to listen that you have the copy that you probably won't watch ever again.Overall [6]: I averaged it out to a 6. Like I said, the movie isn't BAD per say, but not a masterpiece you would want to watch over and over again. Hopefully the next movie they're spawning out at the time I've written this review fix the mistakes this movie made into making something far better than what was given."", ""I have to say that while the movie was slowly building up to something potentially really good, around the 70% mark, when the villain motivations were revealed, it REALLY dropped the ball.  There were a lot of scientists who were doing some kind of good/gray area things with very dumb methods. On top of that most of the heroes powers are de-powered in very obvious ways. Most notably, Deku.All that said, all the of new characters were enjoyable and added some much needed lore to the series, like the crime rates in other countries and how All Might is seen outside of Japan. Also...it addressed that science is indeed not being left behind at all by all the quirk powered people. Yes, it was acknowledged in the series before, but not by adult scientists.Though not having any new heroes introduced in such a locations sounds very bizarre, it was probably for the best that they focused on partner fights with the UA students for the whole movie rather than introduce heroes we'd never see ever again.The setting however was heavily under-utilized. They barely talked about it, including what country owns it...Also apparently it is entirely policed by robots, which I don't think have ever been mentioned as existing in the series ever before.The music was reused from previous seasons so it didn't really stick out and the art was perhaps a bit weaker than the normal seasons as well.Also the bit where they showed All Might when he was young should've been more important, or better yet the whole plot of the movie.Overall, it had a lot of potential and had some really solid momentum for most of the movie, but a soon as villain motivations were mentioned the whole premise of the movie kind of stopped everything in its tracks. That's just my initial impression, after the movie ended I started finding a plot whole or two with the villains as well. They didn't need to be complex, which they weren't, but even with simple motivations and a mostly simple villainous plan, the movie still failed to keep the villains anywhere close to believable. it addressed that science is indeed not being left behind at all by all the quirk powered people.

It felt like this to me because the animation was pretty identical to the show, and they even had some call backs to earlier episodes and stuff. It doesn't really live in it's own bubble, and heavily relies on the audience coming in beforehand knowing the characters and stuff, which is odd, because of how many call backs there are to the show?Anyway, the plot is pretty weak, you can kind of just get the vibe of how things are going to turn...out within the first 15 minutes.

However, amidst the current landscape where superhero narratives are being deconstructed and substituted with tales merely featuring superheroes, rather than embodying the essence of heroism, this film manages to distinguish itself more than ever. Remarkably, it has aged better than the heavily politicized content churned out by both DC and Marvel.I would argue that what sets this film apart is its embrace of classic hero storytelling and its willingness to revel in the inherent absurdity of a world teeming with superpowered individuals and the societal shifts that accompany...such a reality.The narrative centers on Izuku Midoria, who is in the midst of his journey to become a hero through training and study. The story of this film unfolds against the backdrop of an Expo visit, which serves as a pivotal moment revealing All Might's backstory while also charting Izuku's future trajectory.In contrast to the current trends in Western superhero storytelling, this film feels like a breath of fresh air. Which is a wild thing to say but its the truth. Despite its humble origins, initially likened to a knock-off of X-Men, it now stands on its own merits.Ultimately, if you're a genuine fan of superhero tales, this film is likely to resonate with you.

This is established immediately after the opening fight scene which reminded me why I love this franchise, cause once that ends there’s a 30 minute exposition dump, explaining the basic premise of the show to any newcomer, what the deal is with all the new characters, what the deal is with this setting their all in, and, by far the most painful one to sit through, is why the film feels the need to explain why every character from the show is here.Instead of doing the normal thing one...would expect from a show in high school of having a school trip as an excuse to move the class to a new location, All might got invited to his super special awesome island and he was only able to take Midoriya and then once best girl is introduced, acting like a generic version of herself, we find out that the whole gang is here each with their own excuse…and nobody deciding to mention anything about it to anybody else…why?-Ahh.

It was a classic hero movie which isn't really a bad thing because it was overall well-paced (and we finally see I-Island). It has a few nice plot twists (some were predictable, some were not as much), but the movie does rely on plot conveniences (Like, what are the chances that so many students from class 1-A have a ticket to I-Island?!).ANIMATION [7/10]:I don't know why some reviews say that...the animation is bad because it really isn't that serious. I quite liked the art. Especially, the last fight was nicely done.SOUND [5/10]:Not memorable at all with a few old songs from the first two seasons. Nothing new and special, but definitely not bad.CHARACTER [4/10]:The movie brings back half of class 1-A and it was enjoyable to see them interact with each other, but it felt like they were only really there when their quirks were needed in fights.

Ginga Tetsudou 999 (Movie),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1301/Ginga_Tetsudou_999_Movie,"['This anime has a great story and awesome cast of characters. Outside the movies, I have little to no familiarity with the other mediums this story has been told. I heard the TV series was 113 episodes!! I don&rsquo;t get how you can make a story that big!! Plus, I heard the manga was also 20 volumes.Regardless of how much is compressed in this version, you still feel the maturity of Tetsuro and how strong the bond is between him and Matel. The bond they share is something comparable to what Naked Snake and the Boss have in Metal Gear Solid 3. It&rsquo;s beyond mother...and son, brother and sister and a romantic relationship between man and woman despite Matel&rsquo;s mysterious age and Tetsuro still not yet hitting puberty. There are some elements that are predictable and others that are not. Whether or not you anticipated something, you&rsquo;ll still be surprised regardless. I&rsquo;ll admit that every time I see this anime which is probably once every other month or so, I&rsquo;ll cry at the end. Because you really feel that bond between Matel and Tetsuro and the friends he made and those who died that made their impact and you really learn the meaning of life.Well, this anime despite being made in the late 1970s is still very acceptable by today&rsquo;s standards. Even Leiji Matsumoto himself cannot even evolve his style to modern day times. You might likely associate the character designs from Daft Punk&rsquo;s music video One More Time. That music video was made some number of years ago and it shows that Matsumoto stands by the way he draws. He&rsquo;s a lot like the creator of Saint Seiya, Kurumada Masami in that kind of way. His style can be corresponded to a certain era of anime, but as long as he is still working, he&rsquo;ll continue to do things the way he does it.I like to talk about the use of scenery and the interpretation of the future in this anime on earth. Despite being nearly 30 years old, the interpretation of the future isn&rsquo;t as retro ally exaggerated like the Jetsons or Lost in Space or the old school Star Trek series by using stupid designed robots or weird clothes. If this anime was made even today, the interpretation of the scenery of the future of the earth would probably still be the same. It has a dark look to it and you can comparably say the scenery of the city you see in the first act while still on earth is that to Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star. Still has tall buildings but they are not really too mechanical looking despite the lights. The clothing of the characters aren&rsquo;t really spandex jump suits or weird space suits. They use clothing close to modern day standards with the exemption of the pirate characters.Now time to talk about how the characters are designed. The male characters aren&rsquo;t really portrayed as being muscular. This is a common trait I&rsquo;ve seen in other 1970s anime such as Gundam, Maringer Z, and Lupin III. They got more of a skinny built but that quality is made up with quick, sharp, and clever movements if there is ever any action. Tetsuro as a kid has a huge head in his flash back scenes and there are other awkward design characters like Tochiro. Then there&rsquo;s also the female characters. They tend to resemble each other too much. Like Matel, Emeraldis, and the female character at the beginning of the movie all have the same stick figure built and face, but different hair colors and Emeraldas of course has a scar on her face. Is this suppose to be the Gundam SEED of the late 1970s where there is some limited diversity to the design? Granted Matsumoto has a distinctive art style and draws some good female characters, but he really needs to work a bit on the diversity field of main female characters.But the mecha people have great designs as well and are well distinctive which makes up for the bad quality I just mentioned. Like there are some mecha characters that still have some vague human form to them like in the bar scene. Some have 100% mech bodies like the main villain Count Mecha. And there are some that can have other material types of bodies like Claire who is made of crystal glass and can light herself. So the world of robotizing yourself in this anime gives you many choices of what you can do. And of course there is the awesome looking pirate space ships that have an intimidating look to them and the interesting design of the 999.Now time to talk about the voice acting in both the Japanese and English version. What&rsquo;s ironic is that Tetsuro happens to be played by actresses that have one trait in common. Both Masako Nozawa his Japanese voice actress and Saffron Henderson who plays him in the English version also happened to have played Goku in Dragon Ball. Well Henderson specifically played Goku in the first dub to Dragon Ball that was released in 1995, while Nozawa played Goku throughout the entire Dragon Ball saga. So I thought that was a real interesting twist. Both actresses portray the character very well. The screams really bring out the character in the Japanese version while the voice Saffron uses is well suited to his personality meaning he is a kid, but still quite mature and knows how to handle himself.Other well known Japanese voice actors is Banjo Ginga who has a brief role in Planet Andromeda. And from what I found, the original voice actors in the Japnese versions of Harlock and Emeraldis also reprise their roles.The English version as well as the sequel which I will also review at a later time were aired on the Sci-Fi era of Anime after Midnight. So I guarantee that you will love this anime despite the language because both offer their own great portrayals to the characters.As for the music, it has a lot of disco beat to it considering the time it was made. I happen to be a 1970s fan and I love the movie Saturday Night Fever so I dig the background music. Now time to talk about the lyrical music. Specifically the ending theme. It&rsquo;s a very iconic music. It&rsquo;s really folkish and it is a timeless classic in it&rsquo;s own right. So big in Japan that it was included in versions of Guitar Freaks and Drummania and is in Karaoke Revolution. It&rsquo;s really catchy and really sets the mood of the ending. The voice sounds really 70s but the way the music is played doesn&rsquo;t really have the disco beat but it has more of a 1960s rock to the presentation.Quite honestly, I have no idea how you can make a 113 episode TV series out of a story you can perfectly tell in this 2+ hour movie. You will feel the emotion of the characters and be captured by the story. The character design may not be for everyone but the action and the scenery is still up to the standards of modern day anime of the same genre. The music is incredible. The anime may be a possible interpretation of the future, but will always be a product of it&rsquo;s time. and son, brother and sister and a romantic relationship between man and woman despite Matel&rsquo;s mysterious age and Tetsuro still not yet hitting puberty. There are some elements that are predictable and others that are not. Whether or not you anticipated something, you&rsquo;ll still be surprised regardless.

Despite being nearly 30 years old, the interpretation of the future isn&rsquo;t as retro ally exaggerated like the Jetsons or Lost in Space or the old school Star Trek series by using stupid designed robots or weird clothes. If this anime was made even today, the interpretation of the scenery of the future of the earth would probably still be the same. It has a dark look to it and you can comparably say the scenery of the city you see in the first act while still on earth is that to Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star. Still has tall buildings but they are not really too mechanical looking despite the lights. The clothing of the characters aren&rsquo;t really spandex jump suits or weird space suits. They use clothing close to modern day standards with the exemption of the pirate characters.Now time to talk about how the characters are designed. The male characters aren&rsquo;t really portrayed as being muscular. This is a common trait I&rsquo;ve seen in other 1970s anime such as Gundam, Maringer Z, and Lupin III. They got more of a skinny built but that quality is made up with quick, sharp, and clever movements if there is ever any action. Tetsuro as a kid has a huge head in his flash back scenes and there are other awkward design characters like Tochiro. Then there&rsquo;s also the female characters. They tend to resemble each other too much. Like Matel, Emeraldis, and the female character at the beginning of the movie all have the same stick figure built and face, but different hair colors and Emeraldas of course has a scar on her face. Is this suppose to be the Gundam SEED of the late 1970s where there is some limited diversity to the design? Granted Matsumoto has a distinctive art style and draws some good female characters, but he really needs to work a bit on the diversity field of main female characters.But the mecha people have great designs as well and are well distinctive which makes up for the bad quality I just mentioned. Like there are some mecha characters that still have some vague human form to them like in the bar scene. Some have 100% mech bodies like the main villain Count Mecha. And there are some that can have other material types of bodies like Claire who is made of crystal glass and can light herself. So the world of robotizing yourself in this anime gives you many choices of what you can do. And of course there is the awesome looking pirate space ships that have an intimidating look to them and the interesting design of the 999.Now time to talk about the voice acting in both the Japanese and English version. What&rsquo;s ironic is that Tetsuro happens to be played by actresses that have one trait in common. Both Masako Nozawa his Japanese voice actress and Saffron Henderson who plays him in the English version also happened to have played Goku in Dragon Ball. Well Henderson specifically played Goku in the first dub to Dragon Ball that was released in 1995, while Nozawa played Goku throughout the entire Dragon Ball saga. So I thought that was a real interesting twist. Both actresses portray the character very well. The screams really bring out the character in the Japanese version while the voice Saffron uses is well suited to his personality meaning he is a kid, but still quite mature and knows how to handle himself.Other well known Japanese voice actors is Banjo Ginga who has a brief role in Planet Andromeda. And from what I found, the original voice actors in the Japnese versions of Harlock and Emeraldis also reprise their roles.The English version as well as the sequel which I will also review at a later time were aired on the Sci-Fi era of Anime after Midnight. So I guarantee that you will love this anime despite the language because both offer their own great portrayals to the characters.As for the music, it has a lot of disco beat to it considering the time it was made. I happen to be a 1970s fan and I love the movie Saturday Night Fever so I dig the background music. Now time to talk about the lyrical music. Specifically the ending theme. It&rsquo;s a very iconic music. It&rsquo;s really folkish and it is a timeless classic in it&rsquo;s own right. So big in Japan that it was included in versions of Guitar Freaks and Drummania and is in Karaoke Revolution. It&rsquo;s really catchy and really sets the mood of the ending. The voice sounds really 70s but the way the music is played doesn&rsquo;t really have the disco beat but it has more of a 1960s rock to the presentation.Quite honestly, I have no idea how you can make a 113 episode TV series out of a story you can perfectly tell in this 2+ hour movie. You will feel the emotion of the characters and be captured by the story. The character design may not be for everyone but the action and the scenery is still up to the standards of modern day anime of the same genre. The music is incredible. The anime may be a possible interpretation of the future, but will always be a product of it&rsquo;s time.', 'The movie, was directed by Rin Taro (Astro Boy, Captain Harlock), while the series was directed by Nobutaka Nishizawa (Slam Dunk, Zatch Bell); so it makes sense the movie was more action oriented than the series. Tetsuro gets an upgrade in his character design, which was a big boost, and the overall art gets an upgrade as well. There was even some music added that the original series really lacked, but hey, it was anime in the 70’s.So, how do you compress a 113 episode series into two hours? Basically, you take all of the important events, planets with the best lessons, the characters that...impacted Tetsuro the most, and take away all of the “filler” planets. Many questions are answered outright instead of wandering through space and slowly forgetting the original question, and there is even an overlap with Emeraldas and Captain Harlock that makes sense as opposed to the series. The only thing that is missing is the true mother to son sense between Tetsuro and Maetel that the original series developed.The movie is great, plain and simple. It really captures almost everything the series has and gives the viewer more in the sense of action. impacted Tetsuro the most, and take away all of the “filler” planets.

This is a retro golden oldie that condenses the main plot of the TV series (which was 113 episodes long) into an easy to digest feature film. It's one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by everyone regardless of age or sex. The dated visuals and music might put some off but I think it actually added to the retro charm and a low budget production...like this was never meant to be a feast for the senses anyway. A film like this hardly needs eye melting spectacle or to bombast you with incredible sound when it's filled with so much imagination and heart.It's no masterpiece but then it was never meant to be. What it is is a fun, engaging coming of age adventure in a sci-fi setting (though it's actually very light on any actual science in a Star Wars kinda sense) that will make you smile from start to finish and able to ignore any of its technical flaws, which again I think actually add to the charm and appeal most of the time anyway. In an age where most family entertainment is disposable, interchangeable, unoriginal, technically superb but ultimately boring it might sound cliche to say it but they really don't make family films quite like this anymore.As always it's better to watch with the original Japanese dialogue with subtitles. like this was never meant to be a feast for the senses anyway.

Yet it contains a lot of depth. But what's great is that all of it's deep philosophical ideas are explained in a very easy to understand way. It gets profound messages across without confusing the viewer. The story is about a young boy, determined to avenge his mother, who rides the Galaxy Express 999 on a pursuit to have a mechnical body and to kill the machine who took his mother. Without spoiling anything, he goes through a deep journey and discovers what it means to be human. He learns that the temporary nature in life makes...it valuable.Art 8/10The art style is pretty good. The animation is great for 1979, and the character designs are really awesome. For the most part, the main character's eyes looks weird at times, and some characters are a little exagerated. Most of the female characters and the robots have really great designs. I think Matael, Shadow, and the glass chick were some of my favorites. But the art really shines when it comes to the world around them and all the amazing designs in the background. Each planet they visit in unique and looks greatSound 8/10The sound is pretty good. The overall score is kinda typical, but still well done and works well in such an emotional anime.Characters 9/10The characters are really great. Tetsudou, our main hero, is determined to avenge his mother as well as other goals. You see him question himself and the world around him as his journey goes on. He's a very brave character, and definitely thinks he's too big for his britches. I've heard complaints he was too brave and not very emotional. I disagree. It seems like people want non-stop sobbing and lamenting to show the characters emotion. I feel that's equally unrealistic as making them super tough. I think the character shows plenty of emotion, but just not in loud bombastic ways.Matael on the other hand I can't talk to much about without spoiling anything. She's one of the best characters here. She has this warm motherly tone, and develops a sort of mother-son relationship with the main character. But there's also a quasi-romantic thing going on as well. Bottom line she's a very tortured and interesting character. You feel for her throughout the anime, but I can't explain why without spoiling stuff.As for everyone else, I think each of the minor characters have awesome, funny and memorable personalities.Enjoyment 9/10Much of the enjoyment you get is in the style. I can tell this anime came out around the same time as the movie Star Wars and it shows. The story doesn't rip off that movie, it just probably had some stylistic influence. The action is well done. It doesn't go on non-stop, which allows you to appreciate the atmosphere. There's a sense of adventure with the train stopping at all these different planets. It doesn't rush itself either, after the movie is over 2 hours. That's what's impressive about the pacing. It get's a lot done, but doesn't rush and doesn't linger on anything.The last thing I need to point out is that this is a very emotional anime. This works for the dark tone that it has, and provides some contrast with the action and adventure. Many people call this a tear jerker. With the story and characters, I'd say that it can be that way. After seeing Tesudou and Matael bonding you get strong feelings for these characters.Overall 9/10Overall this is easilly one of the best anime films I've seen.

In order to reach this goal, he wants to ride the Galaxy Express 999, an intergalactic locomotive. What may seem like a really simple and predictable concept at the beginning, develops into a way more intriguing and complex tale as the film goes on.At first, the story is about Tetsuro visiting several planets where he learns about various aspects of life, especially about the relationship between humans and machines. In a...certain way, it is similar to Kino no Tabi but unlike that anime, where the stories are not connected, Ginga Tetsudou 999 has an overarching plot and a goal the protagonist is moving towards. The experiences Tetsuro makes on the different planets greatly affect how he thinks about machines and moreover create a new path the plot then follows. While the story might be slightly predictable, this film is more about the characters' relationships with one another and their respective development, which, in turn, result in some interesting twists at the anime's end.Next to Tetsuro, there is Maetel, a mysterious woman who seems to be somehow connected to the young boy's past. While you watch the anime, you are constantly wondering about her, her motives and who she really is. At the same time, the viewer can see how her relationship to Tetsuro grows in a completely believable manner. Additionally, she does not only affect the main character's growth but also plays a central role in the anime's plot.The antagonist has no motive to be evil other than for his own amusement but in the context of the setting, there is nothing wrong with his behaviour. There are several supporting characters who also affect where the anime is going and who all have distinguishable personalities. Unfortunately, some of them suffer from unrealistic character development, which sometimes leads to incomprehensibly awkward scenes.Being a two-hour film rather than the 113 episodes TV anime it originally was, Ginga Tetsudou 999 has some severe pacing issues. The beginning as well as the ending are unjustifiably protracted and at the same time, there are some subplots that reach their conclusion disturbingly fast.The animations are fluid for the most part and at no point horrible. In fact, it is better than some of Toei Animation's modern work, such as Dragon Ball Super. Moreover, the backgrounds are well-detailed and create a distinct feeling for every planet Tetsuro visits during his journey. However, the character design is laughably bad. Not only are the characters indescribably disproportionated but they moreover look different from scene to scene. You accustom yourself to it as the film goes on but this does not change the fact that the creators could have done a much better job.The background music is not very memorable but there is also no huge issue with it. However, from time to time the music is too loud so that it is difficult to hear the characters' voices. The protagonist's voice actress is Nozawa Masako, who is famous for lending her voice to Dragon Ball's Goku as well as Digimon Tamers' Guilmon. While she does a splendid job, Maetel's voice actress, Ikeda Masako, unfortunately lacks in comparison. Her voice might be fitting but it sometimes sounds as though she would not make an effort.As a whole, Ginga Tetsudou 999 is an enjoyable film dealing with some very interesting topics, accompanied by a good and loveable cast.

Upon this re-watch, it felt a bit intimidating as soon as the first emotional part began with Tetsurou's flashback. What scares me about this anime is that it forces the viewers to confront and think about very emotional and unpleasant topics. Still, Galaxy Express 999 forces us to confront these emotionally painful lessons for the best of us. Due to the episodic nature of the 113 episode TV series, it was easy for the staff to summarize it all in a satisfying way in a 2 hour film.The topic of eternal life....Can living forever make you happy? Would it last forever? It's talked about as if it is the ideal existence, and yet no one has lived forever to tell us the results. Through Leiji Matsumoto's interpretation, eternal life can result in eternal suffering. One could lose themselves from all the modifications to their robot body. Your loved ones will all eventually die. Maybe life itself can vanish in the distant or not too distant future. And yet, you will still be there, alone forever.The topic of death stopping you from achieving your life passions. Life is short, and many times, people die with so many ambitions left behind. Even when dying of old age, if you really think about it, is still dying young. Living 80 or so years. There really is barely anything you can do considering the grand spectrum of time and the possibilities, is there? For many people, living 80 years just wasn't enough, it felt as if life was only just beginning. This realization that one's life is about to end without all of one's dreams explored frightens me. That is why a certain death was so painful to watch. There is a lot I want to do myself. Will I have the time to do it all and be satisfied in the end? Or will I die angry and frustrated that I never really felt like I was truly alive and explored all my dreams? There are those who cherish their collections. Have they ever thought about what will happen to their beloved collections after death? It feels better at times to just not think about these things. And yet, Galaxy Express 999 shakes us to see these realities for what they are, not what we want to see, and readies us with these life lessons in advance for when it's our time to need to use them.The topic of motherhood. Eventually, if it follows a natural path, a child or adult will have to confront the death of their mother. The person who raised you, sheltered you. That person who sacrificed so much in their life for you to be somebody. The person who did all they could to help you live a better life than they did. The person who gave you the push forward throughout all your life will one day inevitable be gone. Some may believe in a heaven or afterlife. What if it's not true? There are those who don't buy it and don't believe. Where will mother be after death? We really wouldn't know. Will that person still exist somewhere else? Their consciousness? Or has it all gone black and ceased to be? The movie tells the viewers to show their appreciation towards their mothers while they still can for all they did and continue to do for them.Maetel is a woman who lives a melancholy life. She has existed for who knows how many hundreds of years, and crossed paths with many people who meant something to her at some point. Due to her eternal life, she had to say goodbye so many times, and still continues to do so. In the beginning, she bears witness to Tetsurou's poor struggle in the dirty city life, and eventually comes to understand him, respect his bravery, and what he is trying to do. This leads to the two becoming friends and thus their journey on the Galaxy Express 999 into space travel begins. A mysterious woman, she wouldn't be around forever, as she swaps bodies to continue to live as well. She eventually wants to part ways with Tetsurou. Maybe she will be right next to him one day, but he won't notice as she would be in a different body. All she'll be to Tetsurou could be memories of his youth.Many of the characters introduced during the movie meet unfortunate ends or live under miserable circumstances. There is the question of Shadow. A woman that gave up her body to become an immortal robot. Despite this, she could never find an artificial body as beautiful as her natural one, and decided to have no face as a result. She lives on Pluto and watches over the bodies of the others who gave up their humanity for robots and were left frozen there. She often looks at her older body and marvels over the beauty she once had. Because she has lived there alone for so long, she becomes desperately clingy to Tetsurou when she meets him. Regardless, Maetel would split them and tell her that it was her choice to live forever and that she must deal with her loneliness on her own instead of trying to keep Tetsurou with her. Though she lives forever, she is dying of loneliness.One character who's story haunts me is the mother of Ooyama. Now at an old age, she lives by herself on a dangerous planet with no real laws in a house in the woods. She would find Tetsurou after he was attacked, and helped him by giving him shelter and food. Tetsurou learns that she carries the pain of having been left by her son. Still, she accepts the fact that part of being a mother is to be able to let go of your child when it comes time for them to leave. Regardless, she tells Tesurou that a child should at least come back once to see their parents while they are alive, showing that deep down she still misses her son. Will she most likely end up living her last days in that house alone? As she is a very loving and caring mother, it gave me an ugly feeling that this can be a possibility.The major realization that Tetsurou comes to is that death gives meaning to life. In the beginning he wanted to get an immortal robot body like his mother wanted him too. And yet, he sees throughout the film that many of these people are not happy. That it is a limited life that gives people the drive to live meaningfully. With only a short time to live, people are moved to give it meaning, whereas living forever made many people lazy and complacent. He feels that this limited life gives others the ability to feel for others and thus creates kindness. He tells Captain Harlock and Maetel that living forever isn't as great as it sounds as he wonders if it is really worth it.The high production of the film made it very beautiful. It's from 1979, and features Leiji Matsumoto's iconic woman designs. You could say many of them might look too much alike. Still, I can't deny that his designs are beautiful. I do appreciate that they improved Tetsurou's character design from the TV series.One of the best parts of this movie is the atmosphere and feeling it brings out of the viewers. One great example is the bar scene. It's a run down city, and Tetsurou walks in to a beautiful woman playing a melancholy song. Everyone around is drinking and looking down. He looks with fascination and asks the bartender why everyone is crying. The bartender says that the song reminds them of their youth, a time that's lost and that they will never get back. The song forces them to confront this reality. It's a great scene that captures that classic Galaxy Express 999 feeling. Among the highlights is also the beautiful soundtrack. It's consistently good throughout the film and greatly elevates the emotions the scenes try to show. My only real complaint is that Tetsuro, for being just a child, can achieve great things that don't seem realistic for him at all. At least they show him getting help along the way.Considering all this, Galaxy Express 999 is a gold nugget from that peculiar 70s and 80s era in anime. It's from a time where writers were more sincere and aware of the world and themselves. Can living forever make you happy? Would it last forever? It's talked about as if it is the ideal existence, and yet no one has lived forever to tell us the results. Through Leiji Matsumoto's interpretation, eternal life can result in eternal suffering. One could lose themselves from all the modifications to their robot body. Your loved ones will all eventually die. Maybe life itself can vanish in the distant or not too distant future.

Have they ever thought about what will happen to their beloved collections after death? It feels better at times to just not think about these things. And yet, Galaxy Express 999 shakes us to see these realities for what they are, not what we want to see, and readies us with these life lessons in advance for when it's our time to need to use them.The topic of motherhood. Eventually, if it follows a natural path, a child or adult will have to confront the death of their mother. The person who raised you, sheltered you. That person who sacrificed so much in their life for you to be somebody. The person who did all they could to help you live a better life than they did. The person who gave you the push forward throughout all your life will one day inevitable be gone. Some may believe in a heaven or afterlife. What if it's not true? There are those who don't buy it and don't believe. Where will mother be after death? We really wouldn't know. Will that person still exist somewhere else? Their consciousness? Or has it all gone black and ceased to be? The movie tells the viewers to show their appreciation towards their mothers while they still can for all they did and continue to do for them.Maetel is a woman who lives a melancholy life. She has existed for who knows how many hundreds of years, and crossed paths with many people who meant something to her at some point. Due to her eternal life, she had to say goodbye so many times, and still continues to do so. In the beginning, she bears witness to Tetsurou's poor struggle in the dirty city life, and eventually comes to understand him, respect his bravery, and what he is trying to do. This leads to the two becoming friends and thus their journey on the Galaxy Express 999 into space travel begins. A mysterious woman, she wouldn't be around forever, as she swaps bodies to continue to live as well. She eventually wants to part ways with Tetsurou. Maybe she will be right next to him one day, but he won't notice as she would be in a different body. All she'll be to Tetsurou could be memories of his youth.Many of the characters introduced during the movie meet unfortunate ends or live under miserable circumstances. There is the question of Shadow. A woman that gave up her body to become an immortal robot. Despite this, she could never find an artificial body as beautiful as her natural one, and decided to have no face as a result. She lives on Pluto and watches over the bodies of the others who gave up their humanity for robots and were left frozen there. She often looks at her older body and marvels over the beauty she once had. Because she has lived there alone for so long, she becomes desperately clingy to Tetsurou when she meets him. Regardless, Maetel would split them and tell her that it was her choice to live forever and that she must deal with her loneliness on her own instead of trying to keep Tetsurou with her. Though she lives forever, she is dying of loneliness.One character who's story haunts me is the mother of Ooyama. Now at an old age, she lives by herself on a dangerous planet with no real laws in a house in the woods. She would find Tetsurou after he was attacked, and helped him by giving him shelter and food. Tetsurou learns that she carries the pain of having been left by her son. Still, she accepts the fact that part of being a mother is to be able to let go of your child when it comes time for them to leave. Regardless, she tells Tesurou that a child should at least come back once to see their parents while they are alive, showing that deep down she still misses her son. Will she most likely end up living her last days in that house alone? As she is a very loving and caring mother, it gave me an ugly feeling that this can be a possibility.The major realization that Tetsurou comes to is that death gives meaning to life. In the beginning he wanted to get an immortal robot body like his mother wanted him too. And yet, he sees throughout the film that many of these people are not happy. That it is a limited life that gives people the drive to live meaningfully. With only a short time to live, people are moved to give it meaning, whereas living forever made many people lazy and complacent. He feels that this limited life gives others the ability to feel for others and thus creates kindness. He tells Captain Harlock and Maetel that living forever isn't as great as it sounds as he wonders if it is really worth it.The high production of the film made it very beautiful. It's from 1979, and features Leiji Matsumoto's iconic woman designs. You could say many of them might look too much alike. Still, I can't deny that his designs are beautiful. I do appreciate that they improved Tetsurou's character design from the TV series.One of the best parts of this movie is the atmosphere and feeling it brings out of the viewers. One great example is the bar scene. It's a run down city, and Tetsurou walks in to a beautiful woman playing a melancholy song. Everyone around is drinking and looking down. He looks with fascination and asks the bartender why everyone is crying. The bartender says that the song reminds them of their youth, a time that's lost and that they will never get back. The song forces them to confront this reality. It's a great scene that captures that classic Galaxy Express 999 feeling. Among the highlights is also the beautiful soundtrack. It's consistently good throughout the film and greatly elevates the emotions the scenes try to show. My only real complaint is that Tetsuro, for being just a child, can achieve great things that don't seem realistic for him at all. At least they show him getting help along the way.Considering all this, Galaxy Express 999 is a gold nugget from that peculiar 70s and 80s era in anime. It's from a time where writers were more sincere and aware of the world and themselves."", 'Regularly scheduled disclaimer: I don\'t believe in the MAL rating system, so ignore everything but the overall score if you actually want to know my opinion for some reason.Here\'s the short version: Ginga Tetsudou 999 is fun and gorgeous and absolutely worth watching.The most obvious appeal is the visuals: it\'s directed by Rintaro, and you can tell. Every single sequence in the movie is beautifully animated and expressive. The big action set pieces are just plain fun to watch if only to marvel at how great they all look. The opening scene is in particular a standout, especially because it (like the entire film) has...beautiful character animation that gives you an immediate sense of the personality and attitude of every key player. Tetsuro in particular is instantly likable, even before you learn anything about his backstory, purely because the animation makes watching him move and talk and make faces so enjoyable. Once the film gets going, Rintaro uses character animation judiciously to develop Tetsuro and Maetel\'s relationship, which is just charming and lovely to watch. The beautiful settings and environments, especiallyA contrast with the Ashita no Joe film is illustrative here: both are movie adaptations of very long classic 70s anime, with excellent (though very different) character designs by Sugino Akio (who also designed a number of other classic 70s shows and would go on to do work on Black Jack and, most famously, Legend of the Galactic Heroes.) 999 makes the smart decision to cut the majority of planets and leave behind the most powerful ones, and use character animation to fill in the gaps left behind in the key dynamic of the film. Ashita no Joe\'s character animation is great too, and the film similarly uses it to characterize its key players, but unlike 999 it doesn\'t rely on this animation to do the heavy lifting and instead adapts many of the key plot beats and details from the TV series. The resulting movie ends up feeling a bit plodding, which 999 largely avoids.That\'s not to say the film is devoid of flaws: you can definitely still feel at times the limitations of adaptation, and many side characters are introduced and developed but not really tied into the conclusion, and left feeling interesting but ultimately a tad superfluous. The movie attempts to graft the core plot of the show together with episodic adventures in a way that doesn\'t quite manage to feel seamless, and I\'d be lying if I said I was particularly interested in the core themes or came out of it feeling impacted in a way more substantial than ""That was fun!"" Still, fun isn\'t at all a bad thing to be, and Ginga Tetsudo 999 does it very well. beautiful character animation that gives you an immediate sense of the personality and attitude of every key player.

It's storyline is perfect for an anime iteration, but then again, any idea can become an anime. Well  what I'm getting at is that this is another...iteration based on that epic. And in my opinion, this is the best iteration of that tale that I have seen so far.It's not historically accurate at all. If anything, it follows the story extremely loosely. I mean the names are partially the same and their personalities match (i.e. monkey, priest, etc) but thats about it. Their opposition are literally monsters and their goal is to reach the west. They use guns and have a dragon that transforms into a jeep. So you can't take this seriously. But there is one thing that this show has and the other anime does not: attitude. The four travelers, Gojyo, Sanzo, Hakkai, and Goku, are all badass and their chemistry between each other are hilariously cool.Now I enjoyed the English dub of this show simply because the banter between the four was actually more believable in a realistic friendship sort of way. When they make fun of each other it sounds like something I would say to my friends. No matter how much they sound like they hate each other guts and despise each other but when it comes down to it, they will follow each other to the ends of the earth. That is something that is often attempted in anime but rarely executed very well.All the adventures they encounter are your typical random shonen encounters that they have to overcome. I would have cared less if their teamwork wasn't so awesome and macho even under stressful conditions. No matter what they faced, they still managed to accomplish it in a virile manner.Overall this show, like many others like it, can not be fully appreciated unless you're ready to accept the fact that its story is very very vague. Secondly, I highly recommend the English dub since they sound much more badass than the Japanese dub and really made this show from okay to pretty darn good. iteration based on that epic.

Most of the storylines only take 1 to 2 episodes to tell, as you follow these 4 travelers, sent by the gods, to prevent the reawakening of an old, extremely dangerous demon.My only complaint about this anime would be the animation.  There are a lot of ""still shots"" used during the battle scenes, but you can overlook that.  The animation is also not as clean as I would like to be, but I think, maybe,...it was intended that way, to go along with the story.The characters are PERFECT.  They don\'t get any better than this.  Sanzo, the \'renegade priest\' who swears, smokes, drinks, weilds a banishing gun, and has a tongue sharp as a razor.  Goku, the lovable little monkey king, who is always hungry, and whiny, but kicks butt during the battles.  Hakkai, the soft-spoken, sympathetic demon, with a heart of gold, and a tragic past.  Finally, my personal favorite, Gojyo, the drinking, gambling, swearing, skirt-chasing pervert of a water sprite, who just makes you laugh out loud almost everytime he opens his mouth.All of the characters have a tragic past (with Hakkai\'s probably being the worst), that is revisited from time to time to help you understand why they are the way the are.The music in this anime is great, especially the OP songs.  I would actually buy the OST if I could find it.Even though the goal of the entire series is to prevent the resurrection of the old demon, and the entire series works towards that goal, this is basically an episodic anime.  Enjoy!! ^_^ it was intended that way, to go along with the story.The characters are PERFECT.  They don\'t get any better than this.

Enjoy!! ^_^', ""What is there to say? For one, Saiyuki has quickly crawled to the very top of my &quot;favorite anime&quot; list, and I don't believe it will be leaving anytime soon.Story: Based on an old Chinese story, the story of Saiyuki is addicting and entertaining. The simple idea of four total opposites finding a way to travel together on a journey to &quot;save the world&quot; is kind of hilarious. Now, the story itself isn't quite as interesting as the comedy or the characters, but with an &quot;evil&quot; group trailing the Saiyuki boys, a few crazy demons here and there, and a huge secret from the past...on their backs, it does keep you interested to the very end.Art: The art style for Saiyuki is done in a way that it preserves the original manga style. While at times the drawings appear a little weird (and maybe disproportionate), the overall style is amazing. Each character design is different from the next. I like the art style. It's unique and in a way, beautiful.Sound: The music for Saiyuki is catchy. Each background song is nice and fits almost perfectly with the mood. The openings and closings are addicting to listen to. As for the voice acting, nothing better can compare (for both Japanese and English). The Japanese version is as good as any Japanese version made, with the talents of Souchirou Hoshi and Akira Ashida (along with many more). The English dub, however, goes almost above and beyond. With Greg Ayres as Son Goku (and in his first major role), Vic Mignogna as Kougaiji, and David Matranga as Genjo Sanzo, the dub itself rocks! Considering it was translated a few years back, the acting beats that of most of the newly translated dubs of the current years (such as Bleach, Death Note, etc.). To finish, the sound for the series is perfect.Character: The characters for Saiyuki are amazing. With Son Goku (the monkey king), a fiery boy with a knack for being loud and a love for meat buns. . . With Cho Hakkai, the calm and laid-back man with a tragic past. . . With Genjo Sanzo, a priest with no care for following the rules and a cigarette always in hand. . . With Sha Gojyo, a perverted half-demon with a love for smoking, drinking, and woman. Each of the four main characters are unique in their own way. Even the bad guys are interesting (with the Kougaiji group being just as cool as the Saiyuki boys)!!! All in all, the characters are definitely a part of what makes the series addicting.Enjoyment: Oh, where to start? From the action-packed adventure to the slap-stick comedy that continues throughout the entire series, the enjoyment is absolutely outstanding. The interactions between characters, the awesome voice talents, and the beautiful art style. . . All add up to a great watch that makes you want to finish all 50 episodes as soon as you can.Overall: The series is amazing, something to watch over and over without growing bored. I might be giving it a little too much credit, but then again, I personally think Saiyuki is one of the best. Hopefully others (such as those who might possibly read this review) will enjoy it as much as myself. on their backs, it does keep you interested to the very end.Art: The art style for Saiyuki is done in a way that it preserves the original manga style.

The character animation was fine but stills during fight scenes were terrible.  There was no character development and even though it has a long complex story they came across to me as stand alone.  Their attempts at humor just seemed lackluster and homosexual at best.  Wouldn't recommend this for anyone. 3 is probably a high rating for this and I'm ashamed to say that i spent $70.00 on this garbage.  To make it worse the place I bought it wouldn't let me trade it in......guess...they knew it was crap too!!! they knew it was crap too!!!"", 'Well, I have to say that this is one of my favorite shows even if it does have some flaws. We open with one of the most epic narrations by Sanzo and then get into the bad ass additude as he attacks Goku. The why the show introduces the characters is actually one of the reasons why I really like this show. We see each character in their ‘element’ so to speak and not all at once. It also doesn’t give us a whole lot of narration about these characters because they don’t really need it this early in the show. We get small tastes...of the personalities, then bring them all together. I do wish that they had a little more information on how the group did meet earlier in the series then they do though. The series seems to believe that we have all seen the manga and since I have not, it makes me feel a bit out of the loop. It is a double edged sword because for me, I want to know more but for others, it can throw them off.We see that Sanzo is not like many monks around the temple, but we never really see his past until later in the series though we do get a one second glimse of someone who died in front of him as a child. It seems that the only person he really listens to is the goddess but when he is hanging around the other characters, I can sort of understand.Goku is actually rather annoying in the first part, acting like a little child and yet the little things he does make him seem even more like a monkey then a little boy. He is rather innocent, and As the series goes on, he grows more and more. He is the only one that we get a little piece of the past right up front but they don’t explain much more then a 5 minute clip.Gojyo is pretty much a womanizer and gambler. He seems to always start fighting with Goku as though they are brothers and its fun to watch seeing as how I have a brother myself and we used to fight a lot. Although he is like that, he actually has a good heart he shows every once in a while. He doesn’t really show it to the others but there are some places where this good heart shows.Hakkai is rather sweet at least when it comes to children and always willing to help others even if they aren’t rather nice at first. He is more level headed then any of the other characters. Although he is level headed, he tends to get scary in certent situations. He shows a rather masicistic side in a way.The goddess is rather odd, sometimes sounding really wise and sometimes she sounds like she just wants to have a little fun with the characters. She actually really interestingI love the fact that this show not only makes us feel for the main characters, but for some of the enemies as well. Not all of them are bad for bad sake. Now sadly, I really wish they did have a bad ass girl in their group. Without the girl, the group makes me think of yoai like a lot of other people I know. There are a lot of interesting groupings that I like and I’m sorry I’m getting into my fan girl love again.Sadly, there is no ending to this really. It seems to go in arks like Pokemon or Inuyasha but doesn’t get to the ending of the story. There are times where is does become boring because they keep walking and riding with some of the same old jokes that they normally do where Goku fights with Gojyo and Sanzo threatens to kill them. Fighting scenes do get bad once in a while but yet are still interesting in some places.I really wonder some of the choices that they do for the artwork like the very first part when Sanzo is saying the only one he can trust is himself, why do they show him naked when he does this? Now, there are many times that the characters have long limbs or long necks and it changes once in a while but because of how the story is, I was able to over look it for the most part. The tiny waists though and sometimes broken eyes area bothers me a bit.The music is pretty bad ass. The first opening is highly addictive to listen to and actually fits the series rather good. I’m not so sure about the ending song though, it’s alright but not something I would listen over and over again. I skipped it most of the time. Sadly, some of the voices aren’t that great or the prononciations are bad but at least the main cast is pretty decent so I don’t have much problem with them.

I mean don’t get me wrong, I love lots of mangas of all genres and whatnot but Minekura’s story is definitely a one of a kind gem. The main cast of this series, the Sanzo Ikkou a.k.a the Sanzo Party are made up of four emotionally-charged personalities. Sanzo, the stubborn and quick-to-shoot Buddhist priest, Goku, the ravenous but extremely adorable Seiten Taisei, Gojyo, the flirt who walks and talks like a casanova but wonderfully clicks into a comedic duo with Goku and last but not least, Hakkai who is a sweet but simultaneously a scary man with patience...like no other. Spinning a story from the legendary classic tale of the Journey to the West, Minekura’s characters carry dark emotional baggage that she cleverly weaves into their comedic adventures. Now, this is mostly from the manga but in terms of the anime series, Saiyuki has one of the best original sound tracks. From openings to background music, Minekura’s world becomes even more depth-ridden and vast. The melancholic music which graces the background of the Ikkou’s tragic moments gives the anime an absolutely heart-wrenching undertone but also brings amazing authenticity to Minekura’s story. Even with all the ups and downs the anime has suffered and successfully plowed through, Saiyuki remains an absolute favorite of mine. If you haven’t heard of Minekura Kazuya or her manga, I would most definitely recommend it. like no other.

What I just said my seem like I'm making fun of the show...but I'm not, I'm quite serious. This series has a lot of it, but I'm not necessarily saying it's a bad thing. What I'm saying is that if you have issues with these traits in this or any type of program then Saiyuki is definitely NOT FOR YOU! Because all you're gonna...say is that the show is so “gay” and blah blah blah and not really appreciate it for anything else! Now, I on the other hand, LOVED IT! I wouldn't be the “Bishounen Hunter” if I didn't, hee-hee!~ArtReleased in Y2K [Year 2000, for those of you who might have been too young to remember the now funny year 2000 “Y2K” Panic], this anime is definitely showing it's age. Because even if it was released in 2000 it was created with 90's technology and style....and probably with a smaller 90's budget to boot. And it so very much shows! There are some rare moments when there is some smooth transitioning and CGI being used, but they're used very sparingly, like for the flashier boy-band looking opening credits [which was nice, but it was a waste of resources if they aren't going to apply that kind of “GLAM' throughout the series, right? Since this would most definitely be considered a fighting-series, it's a little disappointing to see these sub-par fight scenes, this show cuts a lot of corners for the fight scenes: reused/recycled scenes and poses, excessive still imagery with people frozen in one pose and a blurred background...or NO background just a monochrome color. It's all just very cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap on the fight scenes. The overall art style is very nice I do like the lines, shading and coloring but it's pretty obvious all the focus were on the characters.~SoundUm wow, what can I really say? I watched this show in English dub and it left me stunned! And there is no qualifier to the word “stunned” you could take that to mean in a good thing  or a bad thing.....I mean I was just fucking stunned!!! I mean was anyone else surprised by the frequency of the foul words pouring out of everyone's mouth? I mean, at one point people were calling each other “faggot” and such................like, REALLY??? Are we REALLY gonna go there? Like do we really have to throw words like that word around in order to reinforce the masculine image? And the sad part is I know fully well why they did it, it wasn't the creator's doing [that's for sure] and not the voice actors' fault either [they're just doing their job], no this is something that the American distributors felt they needed to do to “butch up” the male images so American male viewers wouldn't detect the underlying softness of the male characters [typical pre-Y2K mentality] and watch and enjoy the show [of course it didn't work, and many American males still thought the show was horrendously gay], But thanks to [post Y2K phenomenons like] the bishounen craze, the appearance of the metro-sexual, yaoi, shounen-ai and of course fan-girls, people are understanding it's OK to present other forms of masculinity in anime [and many other products] and they will STILL SELL!That being said, I'm still not so impressed by the English voice cast it's 50/50. Goku sounds like he's forever straining to take a dump and Goyjo sound A LOT like Butt-Head from Beavis and Butt-Head [and is it me, or does he really have a slight lisp?]. I like Sanzo's and Hakki's voices, though, those seem very fitting to me.The music I totally loved, they were very appropriate for a show like this.~StoryI'll be honest. the story is kind of lacking, and this is probably due to the fact that this anime is based from one of those infinitely running manga series, so the main plot doesn't really go anywhere. The [Homura] arc from the second season when more characters are introduced and the gods come to fight seems pretty interesting...but there's no real momentum to any of these stories till near the end, after watching 40+ episodes. The filler episodes are nice but of course doesn't really contribute to the overall story However my recommendation would probably be to watch this series with the idea that it's supposed to be episodic [it's not really supposed to be, but things move so slowly that you might as well consider it such] because the quality of the shorter stories are done pretty well and entertaining. What I perhaps especially like is that not all of the short stories [filler eps.] are senseless, comedic, happy-go-lucky stories where people are always getting rescued at the end of the episode. Some of them are quite dark and moody that deal with death and loss and other darker subject matter. And I appreciate stuff like that sometimes, because as much as I like comedy, when I choose alternate titles – with characters that look like these do – I want to see a much broader range of experiences and emotions.~CharactersThey are fricken gorgeous! I'm a big big big fan of the way they look! Of course me being a crazed bishounen freak this should go without saying. But actually this goes BEYOND my general bishounen appreciation, I truly love the design of the characters, it's very new and very unique. I have a few wall scrolls and posters just because I love the art, the large calendars are fricken GORGEOUS and totally worth the money, go out and buy them if you can! The art was so good that I had looked up the name of the artist “Kazuya Minekura” He does very beautiful work, and you can totally tell his style a mile away....the ONLY reason I haven't read the manga is because it's ongoing. I hate being dragged along and kept in suspense over things, but once it's done I'll start buying the volumes for my library. And I'm not saying just the guys are good looking, so are the females but at some angles, while the “duck-bill” lip thing seems OK on the guys....when the Merciful Goddess does it [it's not cute]...lol,no it isn't in the least!With bishounen anime, it's hard to have a favorite; Goku seems to be the anime fave but I like Sanzo's look and personality it seems to be the most consistent, Goyjo looks great with long hair but with short hair not so much and I'm not too crazy about the 90's style pointy eyelash-thing going on there....Hakki is cute and sweet but also on the blander side of things. Kougaji is probably my fave as far as visual presentation goes [I love dark-tanned anime characters generally].~VerdictOK so I don't know if Kazuya Minekura is gay or not [just based on the character designs – more than likely, he is] but if he is, then he's kinda like me with respect to presenting alternate views of masculinity. Because if the characters are NOT meant to be gay, they are A GREAT deal more sensitive/compassionate than the standard hetero-male represented in most anime shows.....but if they ARE gay [because there is that underlying gay subtext that everyone seems to be picking up on, lol], then at least they aren't “KIREPAPA” gay. Which is to say they aren't hyper, over-sexualized, slap-sticky, SUPER-fem [which is not a bad thing, per se, but the stereotyping is getting out of hand]. I came across this series because it does appear as a recommendation on quite a few yaoi/shounen-ai sites, that being said this is really only “regular” series with a lot of “slash” potential. say is that the show is so “gay” and blah blah blah and not really appreciate it for anything else!

Sure, the storyline is top notch in my opinion... but the TERRIBLE voice acting in BOTH English AND Japanese is just not worth the pain of watching it. If you would sit around and watch 50 episodes, then there is no reason why you can't go out and read 9 volumes. It would take you less time and you'd enjoy yourself more. This is not to say it's not an enjoyable anime. If you can get over the awful voices than it's still a pretty...fair anime. The animation is kind of half-assed though. In comparison to the beautiful manga art of Kazuya Minekura's, the anime just kind of rips the characters up and makes them incredibly shiny (shading wise) and rather strange in hairstyle. There are quite a few points where the four main characters just don't seem portrayed correctly AT ALL. Not to mention most of the youkai in quite a few of the episodes are just terrible stereotypical excuses for muscular human beings with large ears and funny colored skin. Oh and let's not forget the feral set of canines complete with each demon!If you must however feel connected to the Saiyuki anime in some way shape or form, I suggest a soundtrack or something. Then you can better use your time; instead of watching all 50 episodes, grab volumes 1-9, play a few of the anime theme songs, and enjoy.

The design is wonderful, but the animation is clunky.Ultimately, this show somehow became one of my favorites.The story is one of the most important parts of an anime, and to be honest, it's a bit lacking. Many individual episodes stand on their own, and sometimes it's hard to discern what is filler and what is driving the plot forward. The ending felt rushed. However, where it fails in tying together a plot, it succeeds in creating characters you want to root for, which is my second point....The characters are...very interesting puzzles. You think you have it figured out at the beginning - the angry one, the womanizer, the calm guy, and the childish guy. But there's more to it. You see why they are how they are and how their pasts haunt them. And they're likable, too. Of course, Sanzo would be a nightmare in real life, but from the distance of fiction, he's enjoyable to watch.Overall, it's enjoyable. There's some intangible aspect that brings one back to watch it every time. I can go on and on about the flaws, but when it does something right, it does it right.

For the most part, I think Saiyuki does not quite reach the heights of storytelling that series did, but it does distinguish itself in ways both good and bad.Firstly, the plot is mostly episodic in nature, with copious episodes that succeed at establishing characterization and worldbuilding, but otherwise do not move the plot significantly. It is filler, but pretty good filler in my opinion, since it really gets the viewer immersed in the world. This is an old-school...adventure story first and foremost, and the length of the journey is painted in the medium via this long-form storytelling. A certain patience is expected from the viewer as Hakkai's jeep slowly plugs along the desert roads. I think those who enjoy episodic series like Pokemon won't mind this at all, while those with no patience for filler will immediately drop the series, it is a defining factor.One thing I heartily congratulate this series for is the main characters. They are all very fleshed-out, rounded, and compelling in their own ways, almost archetypically so. You have the womanizing water sprite Sha Gojyo, hot-tempered and vain like any seducer. There's Cho Hakkai, who arguably has the most fucked-up backstory of the lot, but nowadays acts as the driver and mediator of the group. There's the spunky kid tagalong, Son Goku, who is entertainingly whiny and always hungry, but seems to be the best fighter of the group. He also has a limiter device on his forehead which holds back a psychotic dark side that can't distinguish friend from foe, like he's on some Kid Buu shit. Fun times! And then there's my personal favorite, and arguably the main character, Genjo Sanzo. I like both his japanese and english voices (David Matranga has always been cool in my book). Furthermore, he's a huge asshole who spouts off action movie one-liners before putting holes in demons with his revolver, he's simultaneously very cool and very lame. Gotta love it! In general, the character designs are quite good.The antagonists are hit and miss - the creepy doctor and whatever the name of the main female villain was, they were very one-note and forgettable. The Kougaiji group was alright, they were all rather sympathetic and fine enough characters. But the real badasses were the Prince of War and his two sidekicks, those guys were absolutely sick!Now, we arrive at the flaws, which are sadly rather striking. It is clear from the beginning that these guys are balling on a budget - the fights are mostly a series of still frames, recycled animation loops, and reaction shots. When demons are killed, they break apart as if they are made of glass. It rather reminded me of when monsters are destroyed in Yugioh. I like old school animation, but a lot of this was probably bad for its time, and it obviously doesn't age well. So if animation is a problem for you, turn back now!As far as the voice acting goes, I can only speak to the English dub. I thought the main characters were mostly fine, David Matranga as Sanzo and Vic Mignogna as Kougaiji in particular doing a good job. Gojyo's actor came across as wooden a lot, as did most of the one-episode-only villagers and short-lived demons. I will give credit to the scriptwriters for including some swearing, Gojyo even calls someone a bundle of sticks at one point. They certainly wouldn't have the balls to do that nowadays, though considering how effective outrage marketing obviously is, it's a tactic that might get dusted off again at some point. But generally, I would advise sticking to the sub. As a sidenote, I really liked the first opening song as well, it had a classic rock vibe that was very unique in my opinion.Overall, the show is fine. If nothing else, the main characters are strong, the worldbuilding is good, and there are aesthetically pleasing moments. I'm interested in seeing how the 2017 series fares in comparison to this - I hope that it fixes many of the issues while contributing to the strengths. As is, I wouldn't go into this expecting more than some easily digestible entertainment. adventure story first and foremost, and the length of the journey is painted in the medium via this long-form storytelling.

The characters are fantastic, the storyline is entertaining, and the filler episodes aren't nearly so painful as in most other anime.The art surely does Kazuya Minekura's original series justice. Although, the anime is old (anything older than 3 years is old by today's standards), so the action scenes are a bit less than interesting (yaaaaay for still shots!), but aside from that, the anime is very well-drawn.The characters are excellent, (and sexy), and it's hard not to fall in love with each and every one of them. (but Sanzo is the best,...in my not-so-humble opinion)Also, this anime is actually one that I WOULD recommend you watch with the English dub. The English voice actors are actually very good (with a few exceptions), ESPECIALLY Doctor Ni.Plus, the dialogue is actually very good, especially between the four main characters. The English dub adds something to the show for us native-speakers that you can't get from the direct Japanese to English subtitles.The only grievances I have with this anime are these three things:1. Some aspects of the characters background and stories have been deleted2. There isn't as much blood as in the manga. I mean, the demons just disintegrate into particles when they're killed, what's up with that?3.

I saw a couple episodes of Reload Blast and instantly fell in love with the characters. I was talking about it to a friend who is an intense fan of the original so I went back and started from the beginning, and I'm glad I did. I could have enjoyed Blast without having seen the others but I know now that I will enjoy it so much more having seen what comes before.Watching this twenty years later is pretty hard on the eyes. Animation has come a long way since then. If you can get...past the nostalgia of the turn of the millennium style, it's 100% worth the watch.What I loved about it:1. The characters. The main characters, both good guys and bad, completely make this anime.  Story, art, sound, ... none of it compares to these guys and how endearing they are. They're funny and sympathetic, complex and tragic, and so badass. There is nothing not to adore about them.2. The tragic backstories: everyone has one. But each one's somewhat unique and they play heavily into the main arc and many of the fights and singular episodes. It permeates everything are and that's how it should be. But they are also moving past them, not wallowing in them.3. I will freely admit I loved the male eye candy and there was a lot of it. It wasn't otome levels but so many of the characters are attractive and I love it. Don't judge. Guys like their anime girls in short skirts with big boobs. I like my pretty boys. It makes a great anime, awesome.What I didn't like about it:1. It got a little repetitive but only a little. Nothing terrible.2. Linlin. She's an annoying brat and I could have happily watched her die.3. There were a few pretty stupid episodes, mostly revolving around effing Linlin. Could have lived without those.Overall, I highly recommend watching this series if you plan to watch the rest, which I also recommend you do. :) past the nostalgia of the turn of the millennium style, it's 100% worth the watch.What I loved about it:1.

I am going to be truthful and not lie to you guys just because this is anime. Honestly, this was not the best anime I saw. In fact it's number 8 in my top 10 worst anime I ever watched.Story- Let's start with the story. You have four guys, a priest named Sanzo, and three demons Gojyo, Goku, and Hakkai wo are going to India to stop the resurrecting of Gyumao. I never watched Dragon Ball Z so I am not going to say this show copied the whole story. However it...did copied the traits of Goku in DBZ. I will explain that more in character.Back to the story. Their journey west is always interrupted by some demons or Gods trying to destroy them for a scroll Sanzo holds. You begin to feel tired of the journey and wonder will they ever make it west. The fact this is a episodic show is more stupid. Episodic shows never have a climax. They show stories in every episode or 2. This would work if the show was like Sponge bob where the goal was not obvious. This show's main goal, conflict if you will is obvious therefore defeats the purpose of being episodic.Luckliy, there are two more shows so the chance of their journey being finished is higher. I understand that this anime focus is the journey not the goal, but the characters haven't changed since the beginning making the idea fail.Art- The art is old looking and very PG. If you are looking for gory scenes go find a different anime because this one does not provide one. Even when they kill demons you see no blood. You only see the demons  disintegrate with a white background.Also to attract the male audience the women in this sow are degraded with big breasts.To attract the female audience the main characters do some questionable things with each other. In the opening themes there are times when the guys look like wuss instead of strong like their personalities.Lastly the backgrounds will be so plain like black and a character's face. I like seeing new things, but that fails. I guess they were trying to make the viewer use their brain to imagine where the characters were at times. Nice stragedy except most people who watch tv do so so they can use little to no imagination.Sound-The sound. The characters unnecessarily cussed all the time. It was annoying especially if it didn't fit the characters. The openings were fairly okay as for the endings idk because i never bothered to listen them. The ost in this anime were typical for this anime genres. However i found a good ost in this anime. It's called open up your mind. I'm listening to it as I write this review.Character- very typical. You had a womanizing, drinker/smoker(gojyo), pretending not to care character (sanzo), motherly like character (hakkai), and annoying, greedy character (goku). To address Goku in more depth I heard a rumor that he is a huge copy of DBZ Goku. People say Goku eats like the goku in dbz, fights like him, and is a monkey like him. I do not know if this rumor is true, but I hope it is not.The character's story were okay I guess. Goku was the most predictable. Hakkai was the most cliche one. Sanzo was the most normal one and Gojyo was the most unique.Enjoyment- I liked the anime, but not that much. If i really loved it like so many others I would have finished this in two days not approx. a week like i did. I procrastinated because it was bad and i knew nothing will change. There was something that got my off guard, but it was only once.Overall- I will be nice and give it a 6. Don't take my opinion. Check it out for yourself. did copied the traits of Goku in DBZ.

I couldn't get over the lack of action in the fights, things were very slow moving, and still shots of things here and there. Just not very exciting. If your looking for a good story its worth the watch, but if you like to have an exciting visual stimulation with your story I would pass. "", ""A badass, gun-toting priest (Sanzo) has to team up with two equally badass demons (Hakki and Gojyo) and a really freaking annoying monkey demon (Goku) to prevent the resurrection of a terrible super demon.Here's my breakdown of the characters: I'm in love with Hakki, I like Gojyo, I tolerate Sanzo, and I would strangle Goku if I could.Lots of violence on this boys-only road trip, everybody gets hurt, everybody kills somebody else. Character-building is something this series does really well, and it's much more interesting than the fights. "", 'I really enjoyed the Saiyuki manga. It used to be one of my favourites, before the position was usurped by the likes of Berserk. It was funny, the characters likeable, and on a whole an entertaining and enjoyable work.The anime on the other hand was not so enjoyable. Perhaps I am just picky about animation/art, but I was not a fan of the animation in the Saiyuki anime. I\'m not sure what the budget for it was like, but from the two episodes that I watched, the animation style seemed to adhere to a principle of ""as little as possible"". You know those crappy gifs...that have only part of the image animated? Yeah, that\'s what watching Saiyuki is like.The art excepting the animation is ok, with some really nice backgrounds in some scenes. However, that doesn\'t make up for the crap animation.As far as character design, the main characters are pretty bishie. Otherwise, not too special.But hey, if you can get over the animation, I\'d say to give it a watch. I\'m not entirely sure how closely it adheres to the manga, not having watched the entirety of the anime, but based on my experience with the manga, it should be decent, with plenty of hilarity thrown in.Where I\'m concerned I\'d rather just re-read the Saiyuki manga. Don\'t have to deal with crap animation, the characters are still bishie (if you like that), and you don\'t have to hear Goku\'s annoying voice. that have only part of the image animated?

Saiyuki grabbed you from the first episode and it dident let go throught the whole series (Plus OVA's) Saiyuki hit you right of the bat with comedy and alot of it every episode there were many amazing comedy scenes that made you run out of air because you were laughing so hard but not only did it have comedy it had amazing fighting scenes and outstanding characters that grew in their ability to know who they are and also grow in power and understanding of...the world. Saiyuki is at the top of my favorite anime and wont be leaving anytime soon.

So with his 3 friends, Cho Hakkai, Son Goku and Sha Gojyo, they head west and have many adventures along the way.My thoughts:I truly loved watching this anime. The animation is very good and there's just something about a gun-totin' monk that just gives a 'je ne sais quoi' to the story. Following Saiyuki is Saiyuki Requiem (the movie), Saiyuki Reload and then Saiyuki Reload: Gunlock. Although sometimes the characters don't seem to like each other, it's my opinion...that they in fact do care for each other like brothers. Their fights are more like siblings getting on each others nerves.The anime has most everything in it; action, romance in a way, comic relief provided mostly by Gojyo and Goku, as well as their intense moments when fighting. What I like most is that the four trust each other with their lives and are there for one another.The only thing I didn't like about this anime is that we don't see a true ending. All we see is they keep heading West, but they never reach their true destination. Hopefully sometime in the future they will come out with a 4th season and actually give us a true ending. This anime is one I recommend watching.This is a review I wrote in 2008, I'm currently looking for any other Saiyuki anime that have been done since. that they in fact do care for each other like brothers.

But Gensoumaden Saiyuki is the first anime where the animation is so lacking and rudimentary that I can\'t help but call it ""BAD"", because it is. Most visible in fighting scenes that look so poorly animated it\'s almost painful to look at.What I mean is there is barely any animation whatsoever. Just static images moving around the screen with some flashy background. One example is...when the characters were riding the truck and fell into a river. You would imagine this is depicted, but it\'s not - you see them driving towards the river bank and shouting, next thing you see is the sky and a splash animation coming from the bottom of the screen.Now imagine this is the level of animation for 50 episodes. How do I know it keeps going for 50 episodes when I dropped it on episodes 5? Well, I skimmed through the last 3 episodes and it\'s the same thing. When I began watching it, I was hoping the animation will get better later on, assuming the anime became more popular, but alas.The second problem is the story - overall it seems like an interesting plot, but each episode feels like an anthology and as if they aren\'t interconnected. The pacing is so slow and boring that for 5 episodes I could not get intrigued, I found myself pausing and doing other things all the time. I had to watch the episodes on x1.25 speed too. All signs of really a boring presentation.In comparison when I began watching things like One Piece, Naruto, Bleach or something else, they became interesting in the first 2-3 minutes of the first episode and after that I just couldn\'t stop watching them until I realized hours have passed.For me it just isn\'t worth it wasting time watching it. when the characters were riding the truck and fell into a river.

The series is really loose with faithfulness to Journey to the West with the four members of the Sanzo party having their vices to give into with the older members frequently smoking, gambling, womanizing or drinking and Son Goku depicted to almost always be hungry, no different from the character\'s depiction from Dragon Ball. Also several members...of the demon side assisting in Gyumao\'s resurrection are more like honorable villains as they don\'t often cause trouble for Sanzo\'s party and usually find themselves teaming up to take on a worst enemy threat. The first half mostly features the Sanzo group thwarting whatever ""demon of the day"" threat opposes them with some exploring tragic pasts that each of the group members have to bear. This half also tosses in some rather subpar attempts at humor compliments of the archetypal personalities of the Sanzo party members clashing with one another and having the occasional filler episode with some bizarre predicaments such as a group of scammers impersonating the members of Sanzo\'s party.The second half of the series delves into exploring what the world of heaven is like in Saiyuki when Sanzo\'s group come at odds with a trio of fallen gods having their own hidden plans with Son Goku\'s power and the scroll used by Sanzo. These episodes are slightly better as they do introduce the first genuinely serious threat that Sanzo\'s party has to confront and more light is shed on Son Goku\'s time while he was in heaven while dealing with prejudice from the other gods for his heretic status, befriending another heretic like himself in the form of Nataku and interacting with gods who are actually past incarnations of the older Sanzo party members. The episodes do have their shortcomings in that they don\'t explore the final moments of the four while they were still in heaven and that the show still resorts to occasionally slipping in either a ""demon of the day"" conflict or ""comical"" filler episode with Sanzo\'s group.The visuals to the series are rather lackluster. In spite of the attractive character designs shown with members of Sanzo\'s group, the Gyumao party and a number of the god characters, lining on character designs were on the rough side and animation was rather lacking at many points since Saiyuki made liberal use of animation shortcuts to limit onscreen movement, this being quite noticeable during action scenes when characters strike battle poses or simple movements in a lazy attempt to depict action. While having a much longer episode run than Saiyuki, Inuyasha was much better looking in the visual department in 2000 with clean details and better implementing its animation shortcuts to create convincingly engaging action scenes.Overall, I\'m mostly indifferent to Saiyuki since it tries being something that I am not too convinced it really is due to the characters and storytelling being mostly cliched in the series, even with the slightly more engaging second half with the trio of gods that Sanzo\'s party have to deal with. Would only recommend this if you\'re a diehard fan of shounen action titles. of the demon side assisting in Gyumao\'s resurrection are more like honorable villains as they don\'t often cause trouble for Sanzo\'s party and usually find themselves teaming up to take on a worst enemy threat.

Gokushufudou Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48707/Gokushufudou_Part_2,"['Yes, our favorite gangsta is back!Another season of Gokushufudou.And of course, doesn\'t change much from what we had before...First of all, one thing that remains and I absolutely love is that the jokes are still very good, every single one of them lands perfectly and makes me laugh hard.Those awkward situations where two characters come close to each other with angry faces ALWAYS gets me. It\'s amazing due to the context they are in.So, you are asking me right now:""Why don\'t you give a higher score for this anime?""Well...because there is a issue that is pretty relevant and if you haven\'t figured out:...The animation...or the lack of it.The way they did the adaptation of the Gokushufudou\'s manga is terrible.I can\'t emphasize enough how awful it is. Makes me sad and I mean it.It\'s like they took the manga and made it on movement. That\'s it.They couldn\'t think a better or more interesting way to adapt than just make those black and white pages get colored and with movement...lame as fuck.I don\'t know if they did that on purpose or because they had a really low-budget but this kind of adaptation COMPLETELY DESTROYS the immersion on some moments that were supposed to be funny. When I see them being static with 0 fluid scenes and they only moving their mouth while talking I can\'t think anything else other than:They could made one of the most successful comedy anime of all time.(a enormous waste of potential)Imagine if this anime had a animation\'a quality like Kaguya-sama or even Saiki-Kusuo (isn\'t that good but far better than this), would be crazy and way more enjoyable, hands down.And yes, animation\'s quality is a big deal when you talk about some specific anime (those of comedy) because they actually benefit from it when it\'s a well done job.But it is what it\'s. What we can do is pretend that is okay and accept it...Talking about other production parts of this piece of media, the sound area is easily tier GOD and I say that only because the VA\'s fits perfectly and the voice of the main character is LEGENDARY. It\'s almost like he was born to do this.(Tsuda, Kenjirou: I love your work with all my heart!!!)Also, the opening and ending are catchy and cool to listen to.Not a single complain about it. Sound 10/10.The characters, on the other hand, aren\'t anything special, but is not a problem since everyone of them makes me laugh and I think is great. They are believableThe protagonist is hilarious and anytime he is on focus is amazing. 7 out of 10.Well, I guess that is not much more I can say about this anime.At the end of the day, Gokushufudou is the reminder of how a great manga can be totally disgraced and disrespected with such a lazy effort adaptation.Gokushufudou deserved more, so much more than what it has received.It\'s okay and all, you can watch with no problem, but it\'s not special. Should be...This anime gets a 6 out of 10.Maybe one day they will adapt it better...let\'s hope for that.

We finally returned to Tatsu and his common life as a househusband. As usual, the wackiness and craziness of the town are apparent in the second part. It\'s almost as if it never left, though that\'s not much to say because it didn\'t feel like it left.Let\'s begin with the review.Story: 5.5/10Pretty mid, just the same as Part 1.

For those who didn't mind the animation and had fun, expect more of the same, and to those who were turned off by the animation, then sadly that's still the case for this season.Story-wise, it's still the good-old fun and hilarious slice-of-lice moments with Tatsu, Miku, Masa, and the others. It doesn't derive too much from what was shown in the first season, although I will say that I liked the development with Tatsu and Masa's friendship.Speaking of Tatsu and Masa, the characters are still...entertaining in Part 2. One thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, they once again get into wacky and hilarious situations. While Tatsu and Kenjiro Tsuda's performance is still amazing, for me, the glasses otaku guy stole the show whenever he's shown.Art-wise, yep, it's still the PowerPoint-esque animation that everyone saw in Part 1. and I'll say it again: if you didn't mind it, you don't have anything to worry about, and if you didn't like it, Part 2 doesn't really have anything going for it in order to convince you to continue watching. Personally, the animation grew on me. Sound-wise, also nothing special, although when the wacky situations starts to unfold, the addition of sound does help elevate the scene to make it even funnier.Overall, if Part 1 was fun for you and you weren't bothered with the animation, then check out the continuation. If that wasn't the case for you, then that's totally fine, as you aren't really missing out, except for what is possibly Kenjiro Tsuda's funniest voice acting performance in recent memory.(6.4/10) entertaining in Part 2.

The rest 90% is the chances of being a bombed adaptation where most of the animation quality is PowerPoint (a.k.a. slideshow) style or the scriptwriting is terrible or both.Gokushufudou's First Part was tolerable to watch and it's mainly thanks to The Kenjiro Tsuda voicing a yakuza-turned-househusband protagonist. For this Second Part, there's nothing much changed as the animation style is 100% PowerPoint and the sound quality of the voice acting is achieved...the same level as FP.

Didn\'t expect it to have another season, however it turns out to have a better humor overall, xD I mean I have a crappy humor but man those facial expression and voice actors just makes it 10x times funnier. Now let\'s get to rating itStory: 7The story was separated into different episode in per episode, and it was basically Tatsu daily life as a household husband where it was portrayed humorously since Tatsu was an ex-mafia member. Where it makes it funnier to how he turns out to be a household husband. In this second season I...must say I laughed too damn hard watching the second season as to how ridiculously funny it is. But really overall its story is just somewhat a slice of life of Tatsu\'s life that is portrayed humorously.Art: 5The art of this anime is somewhat inconsistent regardless even it has a unique animation as it is like a manga talking really with little to none movement. So it just sometimes annoys me to how some ""animation"" was somewhat out of balance when it has little to none movement you know. However, what I do like is their facial expression that are ridiculously humorous and also some of their characters design.Sound: 8The OP and ED of this anime is just damn straight mafia gangsta vibe. It fits really well with its theme of the anime. And damn like the seiyuus/voice actors portrayed the character so well and some lines was so ridiculously funny or perhaps like  some character voices were so funny to hear as it has a uniquely somewhat humorous voice.Character: 8Each new character or previous character that was in the anime was all too well funny in my opinion. I can\'t say much really regarding the character since I do love all the character quirks and all because it makes the as GOKUSHUFUDO. I mean without the characters it ain\'t GOKUSHUFUDO.Enjoyment: 9Man I laughed my ass off every episode and of course I enjoyed all and each episode. No regrets watching this animeTherefore, overall, this anime gets an 8 out of 10 from me. Looking forward to Tatsu and his friends in the next season, maybe.

Thanks for reading this review till the end :)', ""Gokushufudou is back with the second part, and this time around it was more funny than it's predecessor. The animation type remains the same wherein it feels watching something straight out of manga, but it didn't felt a hindrance whatsoever.Animated by J.C Staff, Gokushufudou is about a yakuza turned househusband and his daily life/chores. The animation felt a slightly better than the first season and voice acting by Kenji is amazing. It's very short with just 5 episodes but it was a decent one.A little improvement over it's predecessor, season 2 of Gokushufudou was more funny and humorous and it seems that it will get...better with more seasons to come, if they get announced (although the animation style would still remain the same with which I am not totally pleased).My Rating : 7/10 better with more seasons to come, if they get announced (although the animation style would still remain the same with which I am not totally pleased).My Rating : 7/10"", ""This is so funny, i love the Manga aswell.When the Third Part gets released you know im watching it immediately.Every character are used just when they are needed too, and they elevate the scenes so much. And i love the returning characters with gags, like Otaku always being in the areas and buying whatever things Tatsu want right before him. My favorites are of course the main 3. Tatsu, Miku and Masa. Tatsu and Masa's relationship reminds me of Walter and Jesse's from Breaking Bad.The animation isnt very fluid and they instead went for something that looks like the manga with just a...bit more movement, it elevates some jokes, but overall it could have been better.people reacting to Tatsu and remembering him as the Immortal Dragon reminds me of early One Piece when people were scared of Zoro.The ending slaps. bit more movement, it elevates some jokes, but overall it could have been better.people reacting to Tatsu and remembering him as the Immortal Dragon reminds me of early One Piece when people were scared of Zoro.The ending slaps."", ""Here is my review of this anime in 2023!Story (9)The story is about retired Yakuza that become a household father where He's taking care of all his needs for a living.

Not a bad thing but also not a good thing either.Animation is basically where it coloured the manga panels and animated some mouth and hand movements. I don't mind it being panel to panel animation but it feels like the colouring got a bit sloppier.  Love the voice acting and story. If the animation was better then I would rate it an 8/10. Really wished Netflix would do more episodes instead of just a measly 5 "", 'This isn\'t your typical run-of-the-mill slice-of-life anime. A neat summary of how great of a pick-me-up this series is.I first caught wind of Gokushufudou from an OPED about what were the author\'s favourite\'s/disappointments of 2021 anime. I noticed this one as a runner-up contender for best of late 2021 and I popped it on to my \'Watch later\'.After wrapping up Demon Lord is Reborn into Typical Nobody (sigh...), I began sitting through Gokushufudou.I did have slight concerns about what other viewers mentioned about this series, particularly its animation, despite claims of having a phenomenal setting and cast. That didn\'t put me off at all,...it only made me curious and over the next 2 evenings, I busted out all the episodes and now it\'s time for a review (first one by the way).First of all, I would like to say that the production and cast teams for putting on an incredible display of performances, visuals and narratives deserves standing ovation, at the bare minimum.As I gathered from the synopsis, it\'s not seinen, which atypical setting that the slice-of-life generally consists of. So, a good change of pace and setting.That\'s what I would say if it wasn\'t for the myriad of content in this series to be completely refreshing and jam-packed with comedy, suspense and relatability.Story: 9/10Each episode contained microcosms of episodes, in skit fashion.It didn\'t take more than the first minute to understand who Tatsu/Tacchan was and his personality. It wastes no time moving through the narrative to include every detail imaginable; too many pilot episodes are far too padded in their fickle attempt to world-build and introduce characters to the audience. That\'s why this first episode hit me and caught my attention. First impressions are important!The bento scene is still very fresh in my mind at the time of writing; I watched the live action version as well! With each skit, they tend to stick to its true-and-tried format of a 3-act-play, with each act as being some sort of gag and a punchline; a notion of golden comedy is flipping something up over and seeing if it sticks to the mind of the viewer; Gokushufudou is largely successful in this manner. Pseudo-examples, dialogue of Tatsu and Masa involve ""getting the white powder"" (cocaine/heroine, usually) turns into buying flour in the next frame. Tatsu holding up a knife, musing to himself ""this is it, I\'ve got you now"" transforms into slicing cuts of pork, all the while dressed for the occasion.It\'s this concept of \'Haha tricked you. Baited!\' that really carried me through each skit, each episode. I\'m easily pleased.I won\'t lie, I dipped a point off because I found the skits of Gin the cat to be just little skippable extras, and I don\'t like cats to be honest.Art: 10/10Picture a meadow with a shallow hill, let\'s put a tree on top and the glare of the sun behind. Sounds beautiful right? Okay, now some flowers grow around the tree, next you have a loving couple set up a picnic below the bough of the tree. Here comes a family with their hyper pet pooch, then a cyclist, they nearly crash into the dog. A wild squirrel appears and grabs an item of food and scurries back up the tree.You now have a scene of chaos and a lack of clear focus, amidst the original beauty of it all. Anime as of late tries to lend itself towards intricate detail and filling in any proverbial white space. This is where Gokushufudou differs, massively.""As long as you don\'t mind the stillness of the anime, it\'s a good watch."" The stillness of the anime is its high selling point! Every moment, I can focus on the focus. It doesn\'t require too much of me to stay engaged with each passing frame. Maybe it\'s a boomer mentality but I feel all the necessary action is captured, the emotions are conveyed visually and all the chaff is non-existent. I won\'t refute that people\'s claims of it being a slideshow of the manga, it can definitely come across that way. However, in this day and age, this form of art is honestly rare and it was a joy to see something \'antique\' in a way.Character: 10/10The viewer comes to see self-proclaimed \'househusband\' Tatsu as a caring individual for his wife Miku, a complete juxtaposition to his old lifestyle as one of the most dangerous yakuza. He cannot shrug off his ruffian vocabulary or his naturally imposing demeanour, that being a core of his personality, yet despite being intimidating and misconceived as a threatening person to some, to others he has built good neighbourhood rapport and acquired the skills to survive the \'every day\' life in his own style for his family. Miku\'s character is instantly relatable and likeable. She is the breadwinner for the household so she\'s very occupied with her job. She\'s not a central character (and doesn\'t need to be) yet she stands out with her strong willpower, impulsive love for Policure and reciprocal care for Tatsu. I find Masa to be a younger \'rookie\' version of Tatsu, household skills notwithstanding however. He is memorable as much as his several appearances throughout the show. Other characters within Tatsu\'s circle I have not invested enough interest to care about them but the neighbourhood mothers and the active gang members is akin to a Venn diagram with Tatsu in its intersection. 2 complete separate communities converge because of one man, I find that to be impressive. Especially with the volleyball!Sound: 9/10Masterfully voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda, Tatsu is every bit of cool and commanding. There\'s no other VA I know that can pull off with at least equal or greater measure.A surprising star-studded cast can be found here too. Shizuka Itou voicing Rindou Kobayashi in Food Wars was a voice I was enthralled by when I first heard her so I\'m glad she was Miku\'s. Tomokazu Sugita (my all-time favourite) as Bob. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as a cat that Gin encounters. Show Hayami => Bartender-san. Yoshimasa Hosoya will always be Reiner to me but here he is Torajiro. This list could go on but I\'ll stop my tangent there.So despite this, the reason why I am dipping 1 point off from the score is purely on the basis of being a slice-of-life, I do not notice nor register any background noise or music. The only music I listen for and like is the OP. Other than that, I\'m listening to the dialogue and exchanges and it\'s great.Enjoyment: 10/10This is where I conclude things here to say that I have not felt my time watching wasted on some menial build up, be teased with a climax and be let down by the denouement. Each frame has been carefully crafted with precision and focus. Comedy is subjective, as you might expect, yet with Gokushufudou, it was objectively organic. The 3-act-play skit format may force the tempo but the narrative was truly well-written that its delivery hit the mark, every time.Ultimately, Gokushufudou cuts through stereotypical slice-of-life tropes as much as Tatsu cuts pork and veggies for Miku\'s lunch.Despite knocking off 2 points, for a total of 48/50, I give it a passing grade of 10/10 overall. If you have a few hours of the day with nothing to do, you\'re all out of current airing anime to watch and your list is looking empty, I wholly recommend this not-so-run-of-the-mill series!Thanks for reading. it only made me curious and over the next 2 evenings, I busted out all the episodes and now it\'s time for a review (first one by the way).First of all, I would like to say that the production and cast teams for putting on an incredible display of performances, visuals and narratives deserves standing ovation, at the bare minimum.As I gathered from the synopsis, it\'s not seinen, which atypical setting that the slice-of-life generally consists of.

Shizuka Itou voicing Rindou Kobayashi in Food Wars was a voice I was enthralled by when I first heard her so I\'m glad she was Miku\'s. Tomokazu Sugita (my all-time favourite) as Bob. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as a cat that Gin encounters. Show Hayami => Bartender-san. Yoshimasa Hosoya will always be Reiner to me but here he is Torajiro. This list could go on but I\'ll stop my tangent there.So despite this, the reason why I am dipping 1 point off from the score is purely on the basis of being a slice-of-life, I do not notice nor register any background noise or music. The only music I listen for and like is the OP. Other than that, I\'m listening to the dialogue and exchanges and it\'s great.Enjoyment: 10/10This is where I conclude things here to say that I have not felt my time watching wasted on some menial build up, be teased with a climax and be let down by the denouement. Each frame has been carefully crafted with precision and focus. Comedy is subjective, as you might expect, yet with Gokushufudou, it was objectively organic. The 3-act-play skit format may force the tempo but the narrative was truly well-written that its delivery hit the mark, every time.Ultimately, Gokushufudou cuts through stereotypical slice-of-life tropes as much as Tatsu cuts pork and veggies for Miku\'s lunch.Despite knocking off 2 points, for a total of 48/50, I give it a passing grade of 10/10 overall. If you have a few hours of the day with nothing to do, you\'re all out of current airing anime to watch and your list is looking empty, I wholly recommend this not-so-run-of-the-mill series!Thanks for reading.']"
Hungry Heart: Wild Striker,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17/Hungry_Heart__Wild_Striker,"[""When I first started watching this anime, I really didn't expect anything special.  I was simply looking for a sports anime that I could watch in my free time and also was relatively long (52 episodes) that hopefully enjoyable.  Hungry Heart Wild Striker brings nothing new to the table.  It's not a revolutionary anime by any means, and its relatively unknown compared to some of the other mainstream sports anime like Prince of Tennis, Eyeshield 21 Major, Shoot!, etc.  However, after watching this anime, you cannot help but feel a special bond to it after following the journey and life's ups...and downs of Kanou Kyosuke.  Oh, by the way, this is a soccer (football) anime, for your information.When I say that Wild Striker doesn't bring anything new, the one exemption from that can be with the story.  Although you still have your typical sports anime story with following a protagonist (Kyosuke, in this case) and his will to win the national championship.  The catch here is that his brother, Kanou Seisuke, is already a superstar that plays for AC Milan, and both of them are polar opposites in every way, shape and form.  So Kyosuke is always being compared to his older brother and is expected to follow in his footsteps (well, sort of anyway).  That's the overall main theme that the anime always goes back too.  However, let me say that there is a lot of plot twists that Wild Striker brings in that really catches you off-guard.  It keeps you on your toes and keeps the story very interesting.  The matches are also very unpredictable, as Kyosuke's teams suffers plenty of losses throughout the show.  There's a bit of romance in here as well, which is actually very interesting to watch.The animation and art is really brings this anime down a notch.  Everyone knows that sports anime has a ton of repeated frames, but Wild Striker really pushes that to the limit as each match, it feels like you're watching the same exact match from an earlier episode, just with a different opponent.  A very focal point of sports anime is how the animation during matches is done and because of the poor quality in Wild Striker, sometimes its not that fun to watch.  The same thing can be said of the character design.  Seriously.  It makes me wonder what the budget was for this anime.  A bunch of the characters, if you look closely, have the same exactly facial structure, but simply different color eyes and a different hair style.  Swap hairs and you'll swap the character.  But Wild Striker does provide enough different character designs to keep it interesting.Before I get too deep into my sound explanation, let me just start off by saying the the first season OP was the best piece of music in the entire anime.  It's really  nice piece of music that fits in perfectly with the anime and very uplifting as well.  The rest of the music ranges from so-so to not all that great.  The voice actors bring a lot of emotion into the characters they act for, which really brings a lot of the matches to life.The characters themselves, I was very conflicted on.  At first, I was going to write how they were pretty much unoriginal, but when I sat and thought about it for a few minutes, the characters are actually pretty decent.  The anime brings just enough different types of characters to compliment the main protagonists in the show, but as I mentioned earlier, save for a few, they all look relatively the same.  My biggest qualm about the characters is that there aren't many opponents that the show heavily concentrates on.  Sure, there are teams, but not single opponents.  In other words, they'll introduce a rival, concentrate on him for about 4-5 episodes tops, and then after the teams play their match, moves on forward.  But I guess that's also a good thing, in order to bring in new people into the show.Even with all of the negative aspects I mentioned about this show, you simply cannot help but to watch episode after episode because the story is pretty unpredictable.  When you think a team is going to win, they end up losing.  When you think they're going to lose, they end up winning.  Even the storyline itself has a few nice plot twists that you won't see coming.  Though the matches do tend to repeat themselves with the animation, they still have some mystifying quality that makes you watch in anticipation.  Bottom line, Wild Striker is enjoyable to the max.When I rank sports anime, I typically think of placing them in one of three tier groups: top tier, middle tier and bottom tier.  I would place Wild Striker in the middle tier.  It's definitely not the worst thing about there, as its very entertaining to watch.  However, the ending may leave you with an unsatisfied taste in your mouth and wanting more.  In addition, the lack of detail in character design and variability in animation prevent it from the top tier of sports anime.  Nevertheless, its something that's worth your time to check out for yourself. and downs of Kanou Kyosuke.

Scroll down…[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]Although there are not a lot of good sports anime out there, Hungry Heart Wild Striker is definitely a great sports anime and is definitely undervalued and underappreciated. Although it does contain some stereotypical shonen elements and characters, the anime is actually much deeper than it appears on the surface. It deals with some real issues that soccer players face such as injuries, uncooperative teammates, going pro and many more. Also, this anime’s story line is really strong and keeps you going through all the episodes. The...hero, Kanou Kyosuke, is an extremely likable character and adds to the show’s strong story line and slapstick humor. However, the animation and music really suck.  If you love soccer, then you should definitely check this anime out. If you’re not, you can still watch this anime to kill time. Either way, check it out.[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]Hungry Heart has one of the best stories possible for a soccer anime. Our hero, Kanou Kyosuke, is a great striker but is too rough for the soccer field. Also, his brother is Japan’s top soccer superstar and plays for the Italian club, AC Milan. Tired of living in his brother’s shadow and being compared to him all the time, Kanou quits soccer for good. But one day, Miki, his classmate, blackmails him into coaching the girls soccer club for a week. As he coaches the girls, Kanou realizes he doesn’t need to give up soccer and joins the high school soccer team, hoping to play alongside his brother in the World Cup one day. And thus, begins Kanou’s journey.The story really is amazing as it is truly inspirational. Kanou, a punk, tries to become Japan’s top striker. You might be thinking “Oh, it’s an anime… Of course he’s going to win all the matches at the last minute and fulfill his dream. This is too predictable…” Well that’s where you, and most people, go wrong with this anime. The plot has several twists and keeps you engaged through all 52 episodes. And unlike Captain Tsubasa, Kanou’s team does not win every match. In fact, they lose quite a lot. The story also brings in a bit of realism, by showing us how difficult it really is to pursue a career in soccer. . Also, you realize how a player’s personal life affects his performance on the field. The importance of team work is also emphasized on constantly. As I said before, the inner meaning of the anime has more than meets the eye.The characters in the anime are what make the anime enjoyable. Although they superficially appear to be your typical shonen anime side characters, they are not. In the first quarter of the anime, all the characters except Kanou fail to hold your attention for long. However, as the story progresses, you begin to see the complexity in their personalities. The usual side-kicks turn into main characters and their transformation is felt greatly, especially in the cases of Rodrigo, Sakai, Esaka and Kamata. The characters are just so well portrayed that, when they win, you feel like cheering with them and when they lose, you get frustrated. You can feel what is at stake during the big matches. Kanou’s character shows great depth and his character develops through every episode, which is very entertaining and inspiring, to watch. You watch him transform from a street punk to a mature soccer player.The animation in this anime is well, terrible. Although it wasn’t a very high budget anime or very new, it was still sad to see an insane amount of frame recycling. For example, the 5 second animation of Kanou taking a shot or Rodrigo passing the ball is used in almost every 5th episode. I’m not kidding. In fact, you even see the same animation clip repeated FOUR times in a single episode. It is a very annoying feeling to see the same player play the same pass to the same person over and over again. The character design is another disaster. Almost every midfielder in the anime looks the same. Just change his hair color and his jersey color and there you go – a new midfielder. Seriously, they don’t even change the poor fellows’ hairstyles. Thankfully, the story and the characters themselves are strong enough to keep you motivated to watch the rest of the series.The music was the second and final problem I had with this anime. The 1st opening theme was pretty good and suited the mood. Sadly, that was the one noteworthy track. The others are just out of place. For example, they play some sort of carnival music during an intense second half. It really feels out of place. Speaking of songs and their placing, the song placing in this anime was absolutely stupid. Whenever you hear inspirational music play, you know that Kanou’s team is going to score in 2 minutes and whenever you hear a daunting drum beat track, you know the opponents are going to score. It really gives the suspense away. They should’ve really put some more thought into that. Howver, it isn’t intolerable.The ending is great and provides just about enough room for fan fiction. As far as the voice over goes, it is done really well and you can see that the voice actors really enjoyed what they were doing, especially Miki’s and Esaka’s. The subbing by Saizuken could’ve been a bit better though.The-Bottomline:Overall, Hungry Heart Wild Striker is a superb anime with a strong story and interesting characters. The animation quality and the soundtrack are disappointing, but are not all that frustrating. If you love soccer, shonen with a dash of Slice of Life or both, then you definitely can’t go wrong with this anime. It’s just one of those anime which has that “it” factor.( P.S- The way soccer is pronounced as “sucker” can be annoying, but it sort of grows on you :D) hero, Kanou Kyosuke, is an extremely likable character and adds to the show’s strong story line and slapstick humor.

Soon he starts kicking his own game with his new teammates to play in the same professional team as his brother one day. That's about how it starts out and throughout the plot it expresses it.Art: The artwork won't be counted as too bad for a pretty old anime in my eyes. It's not like all the new ones with action and very thing in high quality but is VERY worth watching still.Sound: The sounds are pretty good with their...characters. Since this anime was dubbed in cantonese and japanese it's hard to say. Though if you speak cantonese WATCH the cantonese one cause it's super funny. Didn't really ever try the japanese one but I doubt it can be that bad.Character: This is one part of the anime that is my favorite part. Most characters have their own road to soccer stardom but they each have diffiiculties and their own power. Most shocking things happen with the main characters Kyosuke. Though the one known as his girlfriend (as a joke) Miki is not expressed very good with personal life though she's a supporter for Kyosuke.Enjoyment: As one of the first animes I watched it's definitely NOT a shabby anime. There are NO ecchi in this anime whatsoever and one of the funniest one you will find around on this time of day and year.Throughout the plot the main character Kyosuke goes around making trouble and trying to score. No matter what ways he makes this anime worth watching.Overall: Since I absolutely LOVE this anime. 10 is one of the worse scores I can give it actually.

The MC is constantly compared to his successful brother, which causes a lot of friction in MC\'s life.The story line is one of the strong points of this anime.  The story is inspirational and uplifting. What makes this anime standout from rest of the sports anime is its slice of life approach in telling the story. Also unlike other shounenish sports anime, where story is driven by the MC, this anime provides ample amount...of space for supporting characters.There are lot of obstacles that the MC and his team face on and of the field  which engages the audience on emotional level and the victories are so much more memorable.Art 6Art is the weakest aspect of this anime. Sometimes art can be used to enhance story line and a lot things can be communicated to the audience without saying it. This anime does not rely on art to enhance the story line. Even though this anime is about football, art could have been used to improve the viewing experience. Many a times the anime relied on same scenes to show the passing and dribbling of the football over and over again. Considering the anime is made in 2000\'s I expected artwork to be much better.Sound 7I liked the background music that is used in this anime. Whenever the background music starts playing it was able to change the vibe that the anime gave. There have been times when the background music starts playing, my heartbeat would go up and body temperature rose just from the anticipation of what was going to happen in the next few scenes. I also liked the OP#1 ""2nd Stage"" by Kids Alive, i do listen to it from time to time just like the story it is pretty uplifting.Character 8The anime has done pretty good job of fleshing out the MC and how he evolves over time. Even the supporting character got ample screen time and even they evolved as the anime went on. One gripe i had with this anime was unlike the MC and his team the antagonist didn\'t get  much character development. If the  antagonist  were given some character development the victories that MC and his team achieved would have been much more meaning full.Enjoyment 9The enjoyment that I derived was from the goals that the MC\' team scored and ultimately from winning the matches. The matches between the teams were well done. The MC\'s team faced opposition teams that were evenly matched or teams who had good players who could win the matches or teams who were much better than MC\'s team. The goals that were scored or attempted were pretty enjoyable to watch. Some of the goals were scored from an awkward position or when the MC\'s team was in dire straits this also added to the enjoyment factor.Overall 9There are many things or combination of thing that can make a anime great. What makes HHWS great is its ability to use slice of life approach to tell a sports story and they are wildly successful in it. The story line is inspirational, memorable and highly re-watchable. I have already watched this anime 2 times and i am confident that i will be watching it again and again in the coming years.I would recommend this everybody but especially to people who  are facing personal or professional difficulty this anime will be a much needed respite and you will watch it again and again from time to time. of space for supporting characters.There are lot of obstacles that the MC and his team face on and of the field  which engages the audience on emotional level and the victories are so much more memorable.Art 6Art is the weakest aspect of this anime.

Certifying ""Hungry Heart: Wild Striker"" to be the best sports anime that I have ever seen might not amount to much, since it is arguably the only sports anime that I have seen till date.This incident occurred during the era when I had not yet watched an anime. One fine day, I came across my friend sitting in front of his laptop watching a ""Japanese cartoon"" in which characters with large eyes and pointed noses wearing orange were playing soccer with other characters with...large eyes and pointed noses wearing blue. After watching over my friend\'s shoulder for about a couple of minutes, I thought I had got the general idea of the show. With what I assumed to be a wise wag of the head, I told him my impression - a soccer based show where the team you support face overwhelming odds, but they always manage to win.I was totally wrong.My friend assured me on the above point, and convinced me to give it a shot. Thus, I began watching ""Hungry Heart: Wild Striker"". And I am glad I did.The main focus is on the soccer team of Jyoyo Akanegaoka High School. The soccer matches are a treat. True that some of the players seem to be adept at defying the laws of gravity and the limits of the human body. Often the ball is kicked or headed from an altitude of several times the goal-post. At some points, an attempt to tackle the ball from an opponent is not so much skill display on terra firma as a battle of wills in mid air. Also, some of the frames are used repeatedly.But in spite of all this, I thoroughly enjoyed the soccer matches.What mainly got to me was the spirit of the players, their approach to the game. The I-refuse-to-give-up attitude is only to be expected, but I liked it nevertheless. Then there is the way in which rivalry between teams and players are depicted. In the matches towards the end of a soccer season, where the opponents are formidable and Jyoyo\'s dreams of holding aloft the cup are seriously threatened, sparks fly. But at the end of the match, after the whistle has blown and the dust has settled, the gestures of the characters reveal the mutual respect beneath all the rivalry.There is also the element of unpredictability. Because of this, an overflow of adrenaline is almost inevitable. This is not the usual show where the side you support magically discover hitherto unknown skills with the ball and score away. If the figures on the score-board are not in favour of Jyoyo, and the referee is eying the clock and putting the whistle to his mouth, it is reason enough for fans of Jyoyo to panic. And even though this was just an anime featuring - not even professional soccer, but just - high school soccer, I found myself heartily supporting Jyoyo.It was not just the soccer matches that had me hooked. A lot happens off the field as well. It becomes clear that before joining the Jyoyo team, Kyosuke had once quit soccer because he becomes fed up of being compared with his illustrious elder brother, whose skills are at such a level that it is he who makes Japan a force to be reckoned with in the world of football. And yet, it was with his brother that Kyosuke nurtured his own skills at soccer, and developed a passion for the game. Bit by bit, the relation between Kyosuke and his brother is revealed. The encounters between Kyosuke and Tsujiwaki Miki - captain of the girls soccer team - are hilarious, and much more.Then there are the relations between the players. This is seen both on the field and off it, during serious matches and during practice matches.As the series progresses, we see the characters change. Perhaps this is one of the most charming aspects of any show. For most of the characters, I don\'t think I could use the same adjective to describe them the way they are at the beginning and at the end.The background score is excellent, especially during the matches. It is totally in sync with and reflective of the situation of Jyoyo. But then, I usually learn to appreciate the music after I have appreciated the anime. As for the animation, I am not complaining. The voice of the characters is excellent.Overall rating: 8Bottomline: A rather under-appreciated anime. But excellent as it is, a fair warning for followers of soccer played in the real world - you might not like it. This last paragraph has been added as an afterthought after remembering what happened after I recommended Hungry Heart to an EPL fanatic. I think he got as far as the tenth or eleventh episode before he dropped it in disgust. And for months after that, he never lost an opportunity to give me a tongue-lashing for convincing him to see such an anime. large eyes and pointed noses wearing blue. After watching over my friend\'s shoulder for about a couple of minutes, I thought I had got the general idea of the show. With what I assumed to be a wise wag of the head, I told him my impression - a soccer based show where the team you support face overwhelming odds, but they always manage to win.I was totally wrong.My friend assured me on the above point, and convinced me to give it a shot. Thus, I began watching ""Hungry Heart: Wild Striker"". And I am glad I did.The main focus is on the soccer team of Jyoyo Akanegaoka High School. The soccer matches are a treat. True that some of the players seem to be adept at defying the laws of gravity and the limits of the human body. Often the ball is kicked or headed from an altitude of several times the goal-post. At some points, an attempt to tackle the ball from an opponent is not so much skill display on terra firma as a battle of wills in mid air. Also, some of the frames are used repeatedly.But in spite of all this, I thoroughly enjoyed the soccer matches.What mainly got to me was the spirit of the players, their approach to the game. The I-refuse-to-give-up attitude is only to be expected, but I liked it nevertheless. Then there is the way in which rivalry between teams and players are depicted. In the matches towards the end of a soccer season, where the opponents are formidable and Jyoyo\'s dreams of holding aloft the cup are seriously threatened, sparks fly. But at the end of the match, after the whistle has blown and the dust has settled, the gestures of the characters reveal the mutual respect beneath all the rivalry.There is also the element of unpredictability. Because of this, an overflow of adrenaline is almost inevitable. This is not the usual show where the side you support magically discover hitherto unknown skills with the ball and score away. If the figures on the score-board are not in favour of Jyoyo, and the referee is eying the clock and putting the whistle to his mouth, it is reason enough for fans of Jyoyo to panic. And even though this was just an anime featuring - not even professional soccer, but just - high school soccer, I found myself heartily supporting Jyoyo.It was not just the soccer matches that had me hooked. A lot happens off the field as well. It becomes clear that before joining the Jyoyo team, Kyosuke had once quit soccer because he becomes fed up of being compared with his illustrious elder brother, whose skills are at such a level that it is he who makes Japan a force to be reckoned with in the world of football. And yet, it was with his brother that Kyosuke nurtured his own skills at soccer, and developed a passion for the game. Bit by bit, the relation between Kyosuke and his brother is revealed. The encounters between Kyosuke and Tsujiwaki Miki - captain of the girls soccer team - are hilarious, and much more.Then there are the relations between the players. This is seen both on the field and off it, during serious matches and during practice matches.As the series progresses, we see the characters change. Perhaps this is one of the most charming aspects of any show. For most of the characters, I don\'t think I could use the same adjective to describe them the way they are at the beginning and at the end.The background score is excellent, especially during the matches. It is totally in sync with and reflective of the situation of Jyoyo. But then, I usually learn to appreciate the music after I have appreciated the anime. As for the animation, I am not complaining. The voice of the characters is excellent.Overall rating: 8Bottomline: A rather under-appreciated anime.

Together with his brother when they're still a kid,he often plays and train their skill in soccer in order to aim their dream to become a great soccer player at the future.When I decided to write a review for this anime,I'm hesitate.I mean,what's the point of reviewing an anime that already aired almost 9 years ago and already outdated?But then I realize that I want to review this one in order to make Hungry Heart popular once again and make people who read this review to watch this one (I hope),because it's such a shame to let this one unwatched by many people.So,I bravely make myself write this review eventhough I know thatI'm not that skillful at English.So I'm sorry if you read some part of my review and there's a mistake in it.But I'll put my best on it,I promise you.Sport anime is always identic with an enormous amount of episode,lot of field action and a 'matrix' situation when the character is doing a spectacular move (you know,it's suddenly can be a slow motion in the middle of the game and paused for a long time).But Hungry Heart isn't like that. Compared to other sport anime,I personally think that the story isn't too long and complex (in my ownopinion).The plot is simple and maybe,for all of you who's been already watch a lot of sport anime, is easy to guess.But that doesn't mean that the story itself is boring and plain.It's somehow bring a spirit and excitement for the audience,especially if you love soccer.I'm personally love this anime because I love soccer a lot and the feeling of the story flow inside me.I feel very surprised when I know that this story is created by Takahashi Yoichi,the original creator of the famous 'Captain Tsubasa'.Yeah,it's a very different one from Tsubasa.The only similarities is in the eye 'part' of the main character.I realize that it's pretty much alike with Tsubasa's.You will never find a never ending succes like in Tsubasa's soccer journey in Hungry Heart.Instead of a plain and childish story like Tsubasa,Hungry Heart serve you a brand new and refreshing plot.The story setting is in the High School.There's a lot meaningful point of friendship,hardwork,and a little romance in Hungry Heart.It's about a teenage who live in a dorm with his soccer team mate here.The impressive part of Hungry Heart is that this story can make such a simple and easygoing plot like dorm live and soccer become more attractive and funny.Another positive point for this show is the character in this story.It's different with another sport anime which usually self centered and only make the main character is the only interesting character in the story. In Hungry Heart,all of the character built up the story.Every each of the player in the team involved in the story and they character are all well described.Okay,now I will talk about the lack of this story.It's lack of L.O.V.E.Well,I'm a 16 years old brat now,and I'm in my puberty now,and when I rewatch this anime I realize that this anime lack of romance.I demand more of it,but this anime only give a little of it between Kyousuke and Miki. And yeah,actually demand more episode too (I guess 52 episode wasn't enough for me).The other plus point for this anime is the music.The opening (2nd Stage) is very nice and suitable for a this anime.The ending (Utaibito Hane) is soooo damn gooooddddd and I never bored to listen to it even after many years after this anime ended.Well,over all....This anime is very worth for you to watch and I recommend it highly for you,but whether you like it or not it's up to you.All of people have a different taste,so I don't mind it. japanese soccer player and he's playing for the AC Milan as a midfieldstriker and in his top performance and glory at the moment.He's also considered as one of the best player in the world.Meanwhile,his little brother Kanou Kyousuke is a delinquent in AkanegaokaHigh School and feared by many people because he's powerful in street fighting.He has a very eccentric orange colored hair appearances which is make him look even more like a delinquent.

You might have the same scenario with Kyosuke.An Orange Highschool, orange haired main protagonist and orange uniform, you’ll all get it in Wild Striker. The Hanamichi Sakuragi of Soccer? That would be Kyosuke Kano. This anime series focuses to the main protagonist, Kyosuke Kano, a teenage highschool student who at the beginning of the series, has just transferred into Jyoyo Orange High School. He is the younger brother of Seisuke, a...famous A.C Milan soccer player who first taught him how to play and love the game soccer and whom he admired since childhood. But after Seisuke left Japan to sign with Italian powerhouse A.C Milan, people started comparing Kyosoke to his brother. They criticize his different playing style, saying that it’s too rough and unpolished. Living with his brother shadow, he’s love for the game slowly started to diminish and eventually lost most of it if not for two schoolmate who saw and was amaze of his wonderful strike.You’ll learn how cooperation, loyalty and comradeship influence one’s decision. The choice between loyalty and ambition which was tested in several episodes can be seen.The main characters evolve from being an individualist to a true sportsman. The story is a continuing strives to win. The motto “try and try until you succeed” and “don’t lose hope” is noticeable. It’s more of individual growth than of the team where they belong.The story seems to have a lot of cuts. It looks like something is missing but you cannot point it out. It also seems to be fast-forward. It was unfit for only 52 episodes.This is one of sports type anime that you wish there is a miracle win that will happen in difficult times. I don’t know if it’s being realistic or the writer just love tragedies. It’s quite disappointing! The writer is being hard to himself. What’s with winning at least once on their strongest rival? They are the protagonist team right?7   AnimationThe Wild Striker can happen in anyone’s school. The setting is typical and ordinary. One downfall of the show is the poor animation. If you don’t like old animes, it might not be to your likings. Except from the main characters Kyosuke, with distinct orange hair, Rodrigo with Brazilian features and Sakai with distinct European features all other characters are blurred in comparison. This other character can be interchange by a non frequent viewer of the show. The drawing is kind of suck. The coloring is not that good. The graphics are not that refined.Don’t look at the characters and you’ll get excite. They use awesome effects especially in “losing parts”. The raining parts are epic. You’ll be carried away much more if you hear the background music. Losing seems to be one of the best parts if you’ll think about it.10   SoundI’ll give two thumbs up when it comes to sound. This is one of those anime that gives me a last song syndrome after watching it. Especially the first opening song ""2nd Stage"" by Kids Alive. They also have the right effects for the different moods that revolve around the story. Since it’s a sports type anime, the effects add to the adrenaline rush of viewers watching it. On the field sounds and player dialogues are good and do make tense moments even more exciting.7   CharactersThe story focuses more on individual characters than the team itself. It shows how a character might be anyone. They seem to be picking up from reality.You’ll see how the main characters Kyosuke, from being a delinquent and devil may care attitude to a potential leader and responsible player. How Sakai from being “Mr. Popular and show off to become a dedicated and loyal friend although their still a hint of his being a lover boy. Rodrigo’s being an individualist to become a mid fielder who connect the team and use his brilliance not for his own benefit but of the team. It also shows that some people are born with talent and some don’t. It has the proper portrayal of characters according to their skills. The noticeable details about some traditions and behaviors of foreign players are also observed.7.5   OverallNot being into sports didn’t hinder me to like the show. It got a good humor that lightens the tension and its share of drama which usually involve career break decisions.There might be drawbacks like the drawings are not that awesome and the story kind of suck in between but its still okay. It does have the certain “K” that makes me addicted. The losses that they encounter had been artfully done. It was actually one of the best parts of the show.Don’t expect a good ending for the team. It’s more of individual growth. This is a story of friendship, comradeship, sportsmanship and loyalty. It shows the strong bond that form in the team.

Higashi no Eden Movie I: The King of Eden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6372/Higashi_no_Eden_Movie_I__The_King_of_Eden,"['I know I gave the movie low mark, but please read the review instead of immediately voting down with fanboy rage. I am writing the review for people who haven\'t seen the King of Eden yet, but who\'ve watched Eden of the East/I begin by stating I loved the original Eden of the East. The story was fresh and the main characters were loveable. The art style was modern and realistic and the show didn\'t take itself too seriously, even with a political plot.This isn\'t always the case with the movie.---Story---   score: 5As always with a movie, time is a limit, a story...can\'t always be carved out with the depth afforded by a season. The King of Eden is a direct continuation of the original Eden of the East. That means it doesn\'t try to stand alone as a movie. It requires a lot of prior knowledge - if you haven\'t watched Eden of the East, stop reading now!This need for prior knowledge is the first problem: with such a diverse cast from the first season, the movie tries to give everyone some screen time for the sake of it. Characters flit in and out for no apparent reason, all the time detracting from the dynamic between the central couple. In this respect there is very little development, if fact, I would argue that the entire movie is a zero sum game, as Takizawa has lost his memory and most rebuild a relationship again - in preparation for the movie\'s sequel.The second problem is that the story feels stretched. The plot, the bits which have any meaning to the story, is quite simple, and it feels like it was one episode  fleshed out in order to make money as a feature film. The movie has moments of long stills and pauses after speech. Long monologues are what\'s to be expected here. Don\'t make excuses for the movie as other reviewers did by saying things like ""it\'s not afraid to be slow in order to develop the characters"". It is clearly being slow for the sake of stretching this meandering conclusion over 3 hours.The characters are forced to give long monologues as exposition to the plot. One particular discussion of the inheritance tax system really destroys any pacing or credibility that the film has as a non-money grabbing venture.The third problem is partly covered above. There are unnecessary plot points popping up for no reason, much of which goes unresolved, such as a random object wielded at a playground. In addition, the story  introduce another Seleção that apparently provides comic relief, but fails. The person also doesn\'t add any value to the plot. After watching the movie I feel empty inside as nothing of importance actually happens.--Art--  score: 8Not much to mention here. It is still the high standard set by the television show, with the addition of more obvious cgi that looks out of place. You can decide for yourself whether it\'s a sticking point that it hasn\'t changed from the TV series, but this is a movie base on a TV show, I liked it then and I like it now.--Sound--  score: 5The movie has an OP just like a regular episode, but the new opening lacks the same impact and catchiness as Oasis\' Falling Down.ED was standard.I really enjoyed some of the background music, but why a 5? Well, the sound is great, when it\'s there. The music was totally and notably absent for much of the first hour of the running time. No music that would make those long awkward pauses, unnecessary cutscenes and wrist-slittingly long monologues more bearable. When it is there, for the climax, the suspenseful music is so dominating it was like watching Wagner. Bombastic music coupled with the poor dialogue about nothing in particular made certain scenes more unintentionally hilarious than gripping.--Character--   score: 7The cast is the same as the one we all got to know and apprecaite in the prequel. However, while it takes on the guise of an extended episode, The King of Eden is still a movie. A movie that falls into the classic trap, where other characters are paper cutouts apart from the leads. Having scenes of other characters ""interacting"" by talking at each other or repeating behaviour traits from the first season in a vain bid at humour does not constitute character development. What makes up for are the main characters, while there is also very little development, Takazawa and Saki are both loveable and believable, and their (re-)budding relationship is the only redeeming feature of the movie. However, their screen time is encroached on by pointless dialogue from other characters. If you were to watch this for the characters you will not be disappointed by inconsistency but rather the shallowness.-- Enjoyment -- score:5I\'ve watched this twice, once by myself and again with my friends. I can tell you my friends laughed 3 times in this film. The biggest laugh came from the unintentional Engrish. It\'s not a bad film, it\'s just that after you finished you wished that you had spent your time better.--Conclusion--As a fan of Eden of the East, the King of Eden is a requirement for concluding the story, however, it\'s not necessarily enjoyable. Nonetheless, just because the movie isn\'t great, you should not treat watching it as a chore. The artwork is intricate and incredibly realised, and some backgrounds are worth seeing. Unfortunately, the other parts are very bad and really bring down what could have been a shorter, tighter and more focussed sequel.I\'m just starting to write reviews so any feedback would be kindly appreciated! =D, agree of disagree, just write me a comment and I\'ll be happy to discuss it (or any series I watched) with you. can\'t always be carved out with the depth afforded by a season.

In this respect there is very little development, if fact, I would argue that the entire movie is a zero sum game, as Takizawa has lost his memory and most rebuild a relationship again - in preparation for the movie\'s sequel.The second problem is that the story feels stretched. The plot, the bits which have any meaning to the story, is quite simple, and it feels like it was one episode  fleshed out in order to make money as a feature film. The movie has moments of long stills and pauses after speech. Long monologues are what\'s to be expected here. Don\'t make excuses for the movie as other reviewers did by saying things like ""it\'s not afraid to be slow in order to develop the characters"". It is clearly being slow for the sake of stretching this meandering conclusion over 3 hours.The characters are forced to give long monologues as exposition to the plot. One particular discussion of the inheritance tax system really destroys any pacing or credibility that the film has as a non-money grabbing venture.The third problem is partly covered above. There are unnecessary plot points popping up for no reason, much of which goes unresolved, such as a random object wielded at a playground. In addition, the story  introduce another Seleção that apparently provides comic relief, but fails. The person also doesn\'t add any value to the plot. After watching the movie I feel empty inside as nothing of importance actually happens.--Art--  score: 8Not much to mention here. It is still the high standard set by the television show, with the addition of more obvious cgi that looks out of place. You can decide for yourself whether it\'s a sticking point that it hasn\'t changed from the TV series, but this is a movie base on a TV show, I liked it then and I like it now.--Sound--  score: 5The movie has an OP just like a regular episode, but the new opening lacks the same impact and catchiness as Oasis\' Falling Down.ED was standard.I really enjoyed some of the background music, but why a 5? Well, the sound is great, when it\'s there. The music was totally and notably absent for much of the first hour of the running time. No music that would make those long awkward pauses, unnecessary cutscenes and wrist-slittingly long monologues more bearable. When it is there, for the climax, the suspenseful music is so dominating it was like watching Wagner. Bombastic music coupled with the poor dialogue about nothing in particular made certain scenes more unintentionally hilarious than gripping.--Character--   score: 7The cast is the same as the one we all got to know and apprecaite in the prequel. However, while it takes on the guise of an extended episode, The King of Eden is still a movie. A movie that falls into the classic trap, where other characters are paper cutouts apart from the leads. Having scenes of other characters ""interacting"" by talking at each other or repeating behaviour traits from the first season in a vain bid at humour does not constitute character development. What makes up for are the main characters, while there is also very little development, Takazawa and Saki are both loveable and believable, and their (re-)budding relationship is the only redeeming feature of the movie. However, their screen time is encroached on by pointless dialogue from other characters. If you were to watch this for the characters you will not be disappointed by inconsistency but rather the shallowness.-- Enjoyment -- score:5I\'ve watched this twice, once by myself and again with my friends. I can tell you my friends laughed 3 times in this film. The biggest laugh came from the unintentional Engrish. It\'s not a bad film, it\'s just that after you finished you wished that you had spent your time better.--Conclusion--As a fan of Eden of the East, the King of Eden is a requirement for concluding the story, however, it\'s not necessarily enjoyable. Nonetheless, just because the movie isn\'t great, you should not treat watching it as a chore. The artwork is intricate and incredibly realised, and some backgrounds are worth seeing. Unfortunately, the other parts are very bad and really bring down what could have been a shorter, tighter and more focussed sequel.I\'m just starting to write reviews so any feedback would be kindly appreciated! =D, agree of disagree, just write me a comment and I\'ll be happy to discuss it (or any series I watched) with you.', 'Unique and likable characters, a plot that utilizes its relative sluggishness well, suspense, and excellent animation made Eden of the East a very enjoyable series, but unfortunately was let down by the fact that it only had 11 episodes, which combined with a slow plot meant that the ending was incomplete.  However, the slow plot didn’t feel pondering nor did it incite in me a desire to have it move faster, since the advancement of the story and development of the plot and characters was utilized to the fullest extent.  Things were revealed slowly but the story kept moving forward- not a moment...was wasted, making it disappointing that more episodes weren’t earmarked.Now, the logical thing to do for the movies in this case would be to pick up where the series left off and then continue on from there, since with only 82 minutes to utilize, time is of the essence.  Sadly, however, the producers decide to stall the plot’s movement with a seemingly unnecessary use of amnesia and a splitting of the main characters.  There is also a time skip used in this case, which while short, is more than enough to waste valuable time in explaining what occurred in the few months between the series and the movie and also to get the main characters back together again.  The intertwining of plotlines of several minor characters plus two main plotlines in separate locations was successfully utilized in the series, and is utilized well here as well.  However, getting the 2 main plotlines to converge in the series and then splitting it again before the movie is extremely unnecessary since it hinders progress of the story.  As a result, by the end of the movie, the two separate plotlines are still in the process of reconverging.The characters’ personalities and chemistry was a high point in the series, but unfortunately was tapered and diluted here due to the split plotlines, amnesia, and time skip.  That’s not to say they’re terrible, but the quality and impact that they had in the series is much less noticeable here in the movie.  This is not as bad for the secondary characters, however, since they maintain more of their distinctiveness and helps soften the disappointment.  The lack of time also doesn’t do much to introduce new characters, and as a result, there are several Selecao whose identities are still unknown and others who have died with only a hint of an explanation.As a result, despite containing art that’s as good as the series, the first Eden of the East movie as a whole falls short of my expectations.  The high standards of character chemistry and suspense that were set in the series weren’t met in the movie, and the utilization of time in combination with the slow plot led to constant longings for the story to progress faster and either build up to a climax, expand on its depth, or start on its conclusion.  It does move forward and doesn’t come across as horrid, but there was so much more that could have been done in those 82 minutes, the equivalent of nearly 4 episodes of a series.  The movie, at most, accomplished the plot development of at most 2 episodes.  Here’s hoping that the second movie will be able to bring the series to a close. was wasted, making it disappointing that more episodes weren’t earmarked.Now, the logical thing to do for the movies in this case would be to pick up where the series left off and then continue on from there, since with only 82 minutes to utilize, time is of the essence.

I'm a huge fan of the first season and was really eager to see the continuation of the storyline.StoryThe story essentially picks up from where the first season left off.  Takizawa has gone missing and the Eden members are trying to locate him.There are a few storylines intertwined as well as new Selecao revealed and old favourites returning.  I found it was steadily paced, developing the characters further and setting up what I would expect to be an action packed finale.One of the...storylines involving a new selecao felt a little out of place, offering comic relief at times when the movie had been trying to build suspense and intrigue.Other people have criticised the lack of action in the King of Eden.  I don't really have any problems with it though.  The first season had action packed episodes as well as slower plot building episodes.  The movie is perhaps more of the latter, however I'm eagerly looking forward to Paradise Lost!ArtThe art is great.  It's crisp, vibrant and very detailed.  Exactly what you'd expect from Production IG.  Theres alot of cool details and found myself pausing from time to time to read the selecao cell phone logs and take in a lot of the subtle details (cult movie posters etc).SoundOnce again the sound it great,  the voice work is top notch and the soundtrack complements the story without being too overpowering.  I still find it amusing when an American character speaks English and Japanese character responds in Japanese, yet the seem to understand each other perfectly.As far as the opening and ending goes, the new LEAH opening is enjoyable enough but didnt have the same kind of resonance that Falling Down had.  I was glad to see School Food Punishment performing the ending theme once again though.OverallAn enjoyable expansion to the Eden of the East universe.  It feels as though the movie is more of a setup for the third movie, lacking a little in action but a must watch for Eden of the East fans.8/10 storylines involving a new selecao felt a little out of place, offering comic relief at times when the movie had been trying to build suspense and intrigue.Other people have criticised the lack of action in the King of Eden.

King of Eden is such a disappointment. Since the prequel ended with a big cliffhanger, I felt the need to watch this movie.“What’s going on?” That question popped up periodically throughout the entire movie. There is no logical explanation for the prequel’s ending or the new plot. Before the majority of the questions are analyzed, there are even more questions thrown out near the end of this movie. Since there is only one more movie left for the series, it’s impossible not...to think how everything will be interpreted in less than 1.5 hours.Apparently, Takizawa now holds the role of the successor to the King of Japan, and everyone knows about his right to the throne but him. The entire story about Takizawa’s life as a Seleção has to be repeated, since he erased his memory and created a new alias again for some unknown reason. It is bad enough that no one can easily predict the reasons behind Takizawa’s actions, but it’s even worse when he can’t even answer for himself.The primary objective of the series is misled. The whole game with the Seleção is ruined, and it gave me no hope for a good ending. The game has rules that brings excitement to the entire series, and it makes you anxious to discover how a winner will be determined. There is no thrill to the game anymore, since some of the rules are disregarded. It literally takes the fun out of the whole anime.There are signs of love and compassion like in the prequel, but there is not a passionate love story that most people would expect. Nothing sucks more than when the person you love doesn’t remember who you are. Poor Saki. However, Takizawa does consider her feelings prior to erasing his memory by leaving her a message that only they can understand. Saki goes against all odds to find Takizawa and help him regain his memory once again. Despite the fact that Takizawa has no memory of her, he shows her compassion. However, it is the same kind of compassion that you would show any kind or beautiful stranger. Based upon Takizawa’s considerate personality, Saki is not a special case. He’d do the same for any girl.There are the same naïve portions of the story. As in the Higashi no Eden series, the setting takes place post-9/11 and guns are brought into the U.S. as if people just magically go past airport security. There is no law enforcement present, and the American characters didn’t show enough fear or concern at the sight of the firearms.Thanks to Eden of the East’s miraculous technology, some things were clarified about the status of Seleção and the game in general. By receiving updates from the Seleçãos’ activity logs, they were able to predict their next moves and the level of danger from their intentions. The Eden team, especially Panties, made this anime a little easier. Admittedly, they didn’t understand much about the logic behind Takizawa’s present position either.Overall, I was highly disappointed and really confused. There was little to no romance.

The series really started to gain momentum as time passed on, and by the end I was very interested in what would happen next. Sadly, this movie was a let down.The original series definitely had some issues -- poorly done CGI effects, awful English (and I\'m not even talking about the dub), and strange art decisions (Saki\'s eyes, for instance). All those things remain, but now they have taken away what made the original good. Higashi no Eden redeemed itself in it\'s interesting characterization and a plot that was pretty captivating, when it was...comprehensible.The movie drops all of that. Instead it focuses on the Eden of the East employees watching Saki run around trying to deal with memory-erased Takizawa all over again. As if we didn\'t have enough of that. Most of Takizawa\'s charm is lost when he loses his memory and he just doesn\'t act quite the same anymore. Plus, the nagging fact that he doesn\'t even remember anything that went on during the series (from the selecao plot to Saki to, well, anything) makes the whole thing feel like you\'re playing catch up. And that leads to the next point.The plot. It\'s quite bad. Which is impressive because it\'s almost nonexistent. For some reason the writers thought it would be a good idea to introduce a time skip since the series ended, but then go ahead and do flashbacks/summary of what went on in those 6 months. So... what was the point of doing a time skip at all? Finally, once you get past all the re-cap stuff, the plot basically amounts to Takizawa remembering a little bit of his life, going on a wild goose chase, and then realizing the dire situation they are in. Then the movie ends. Yep, they finally set up the plot to move forward and then the movie ends. Oh dear, oh wow. I have to click the little rating buttons above to score ""plot"", and the score of ""2"" is ""dreadful."" I\'d have to say that\'s pretty accurate.Overall, this movie was not enjoyable. The series definitely had some interesting aspects, but the movie did not capture any of them. Standing alone it may be the most pointless thing in the Higashi no Eden universe that ever happened. 90% of it could have not been shown, and we wouldn\'t have missed much. The other 10% was just setup for the next movie which is pretty ridiculous.I can only hope the next movie is better. comprehensible.The movie drops all of that.

Although there were a lot of praises being thrown around, there was quite an outrage from many, including hardcore Eden fans. And I can’t take any one side here, as I agree with both of them. While this movie does make some striking mistakes, it also has a lot going for it.The story picks up six months after Akira stopped the...missile bombing. He becomes an idol, after the NEETs posted the photos of his heroics online. And while Japan is in turmoil thanks to the bizarre missile strikes, Akira manages to vanish into thin air, leaving his Selecao mobile with Saki. And so, Saki begins to search for him. Meanwhile, the other Selecaos finally seem to be taking the game seriously.The first half of the movie is all about how Saki searches for Akira and tries to reunite with him using the Selecao phone as the only clue. *cough ~ Serendipity ~ cough*. For the first 45 minutes or so, the film lazes around with this premise and you see some sort of Slice of Life elements surrounding the anime. Here again, the series makes the same mistakes that it made with the first season – trying to be more than it can be by struggling to squeeze other genres in. After an extraordinarily slow paced first half, you finally get to see some good stuff as the other players of the game get to work. As things slowly speed up, it slows down again rather abruptly. Once again, irregular pacing plays spoilsport.The artwork is as sharp as ever and the usage of CGI appealed to me. Looks like Saki has dropped a few pounds and lost most of her chubbiness. However, she still wears the same my-puppy-died expression throughout the movie, regardless of the situation.The soundtrack is just right, but I do miss the Oasis OP, Falling. The background score fits the bill.Characters are same as ever. The one person, who has (surprisingly) developed the most is … Juiz ! Yes, the “woman” now shows emotions and speaks out her mind. There is one new character, who fails to make an impact. All the other characters are pretty much the same as ever and the side characters continue to be as uninteresting as ever.You finally get to see the other Selecaos taking the game a bit more seriously and realizing the magnitude of their situation. And just when things get interesting, the movie ends. When the credits rolled, I was like “Uhh…why are the credits rolling? Shouldn’t there be an ‘INTERMISSION’ sign on the board?”Now, coming to the actual plot, well, the entire movie feels like the first half of a big film. It’s just a bloated up build up to the second movie. It has a cliffhanger ending and this movie fails to answer any question that the series left unanswered. Typical setup for the sequel. But, when it’s all said and done, I did find this movie entertaining. It goes without saying that this is a must for fans of the original series.The Bottom-line:Eden of the East : The King of Eden is just a huge build up to the second movie that raises, but doesn’t answer, a lot of questions. Don’t go in with expectations of watching a movie, because you will be disappointed. Just imagine the movie as the next few episodes of the first season and you might just enjoy it a bit more.Masterpiece? Hell, no! A good movie? Maybe. Entertaining? Definitely. missile bombing.

Definitely.', 'This is the first movie that follows the 11 episode series. This is a sequel that runs about the length of 3 episodes. Being a continuation of an already amazing story it is easy to see why fans underrate it. I say underrate because it doesn\'t hold the same overall caliber that the 11 episode series did. For that reason fans tend to give it an extremely low score. This wasn\'t bad unless you compare it to the first part of the story. That being said, it is still good, and it is still worth watching.The story shifts gears for this movie. The series focused...on the mystery of the game the main character was caught in. It was clever and very well told. It had plenty of twists and great character development. In this part of the story they have delivered it much more straight forward. It focuses a little more on the main character himself, and it pushes the game into the background. It doesn\'t have the same charm that the series did, and the characters are not developed any further. It ends with a cliffhanger in preparation for the second movie that is supposed to wrap everything up. Essentially it is lacking and incomplete.Even though it fell short, I like to think of it as a long episode instead of a movie. If you think of this as another episode it simply becomes a least favorite. It had it\'s high points, and it raised a few questions. Those questions should be answered in the next movie, but at this point it\'s simply a ""good"" movie.

It was clever and very well told. It had plenty of twists and great character development. In this part of the story they have delivered it much more straight forward. It focuses a little more on the main character himself, and it pushes the game into the background. It doesn\'t have the same charm that the series did, and the characters are not developed any further. It ends with a cliffhanger in preparation for the second movie that is supposed to wrap everything up. Essentially it is lacking and incomplete.Even though it fell short, I like to think of it as a long episode instead of a movie.

But its the 'greater' crowd out there that is beginning to enter the story.I do not want to give away anything.  But you realize it resumes a bit of time after the first series, but you are not cheated as that gets revealed in its own time what happened and why......part of the fun. part of the fun."", ""Eden of the East was one of the better anime programs in recent years and it is probably reasonable enough to argue that the amount of good quality animes have decreased consistently since the mid-naughties. The King of Eden does suggest that the audience should have prior knowledge of the show either as a display of the writer and director's confidence or as a suggestion of its popularity in Japan.It is difficult to grasp that the film begins six months after the show's climax in the program as the characters hardly discuss the events that have passed. The fantastic character of Takisawa appears fairly late...in the film which wasn't hoped for as the other lead character, Saki Maromi, is a dull and one-dimensional character who is far to obedient towards Takisawa's erratic requests; Even the film poster displayed on the left-hand side looks as though Moromi is just being dragged around Times Square against her free will.All of the other recurring minor characters were lumped together in one room and the scenes that contained them were particularly dull and the problem they suffer at the end of the film was too laid out as the solution to the problem was referenced earlier in the film (regarding the phone). The new characters that were introduced did not seem to have much personality and it added to the sense that little time or effort had gone into the script-writing. The character named Number Eleven, for example, refers to herself as being a guardian angel - therefore the way her scarf blew in two directions (to metaphor angel wings) seemed slightly obvious and incomprehensible if stood near a plane engine.The story itself was never particularly engaging, at least not to the levels of its previous program and very few locations seem to be explored, despite the backdrop of New York City. The animation was beautiful and the music was also gratifying, though the theme-song was again, a step down from the program.Overall, it is a disappointment that does little to add to the franchise that lacks the pace and mystery of its ancestor. It is a perfectly acceptable watch in which the sheer beauty of its animation alone could be worth watching - but it seemed fairly unnecessary and lacking in conviction. in the film which wasn't hoped for as the other lead character, Saki Maromi, is a dull and one-dimensional character who is far to obedient towards Takisawa's erratic requests; Even the film poster displayed on the left-hand side looks as though Moromi is just being dragged around Times Square against her free will.All of the other recurring minor characters were lumped together in one room and the scenes that contained them were particularly dull and the problem they suffer at the end of the film was too laid out as the solution to the problem was referenced earlier in the film (regarding the phone).

While a lot of the series went nowhere and seemed to stand in one spot with nothing happening, The King of Eden takes that formula and ramps it up two-fold.The series ended with a bang and then cut off. So, I figured the film would pick up where the series left off, but instead it picks up six months later and introduces an idea totally new to the series, Takizawa is an amnesiac. Wow, so because the series kind of wrapped up with Takizawa...learning everything about his past, I guess we need to start fresh again? And it’s just as compelling as it sounds. The movie follows Saki as she tries to find Taki, and Taki doesn’t know Saki, and they run away from police, and there’s some missiles…And that’s it. In eighty minutes, exactly jack-shit happens. We’re introduced to one new character, a villain who is not a villain, more like a stalker with villainous intent. He’s taken down so easily it almost feels like a joke.And that’s about all I can say about the film since there is nothing to it. It bridges the gap between the series and the second movie but doesn’t come into a life of its own. It doesn’t even seem to need to be existing. There’s so much that could happen that doesn’t. The first hour and eight minutes or so are just pointless and seem to be bringing the series back to the beginning rather than moving it forward. The last few minutes are good, but then, as with the series, the movie cuts off and that’s that. After absolutely nothing has happened, the movie ends when things start to happen. It’s kind of annoying. And the problem is that the things that are happening don’t really make much sense. Why is everyone transporting missiles with their number atop it? What are these character’s intentions and what are their plans going to actually accomplish? Because the series never gets in the heads of the bad guys and tells us in-depth what their plans are, we are just made to assume that they are doing something bad. There are a few explanations, but nothing is really, really fleshed out. While everyone was sitting around doing nothing, maybe the bad guys could have been focused on.And that’s the problem with the series as a whole. A cool premise that is rotted by the terrible pacing and terrible focus on things that don’t really matter all that much. It’s kind of boring really. The characters of the series aren’t all that exciting, so you don’t stick around for them. The plot is plain boring, but maybe you stick around in the vague hope something will happen? Sure the animation is good and the sound is good, but that doesn’t keep you watching.King of Eden is nothing. It’s just there. There’s no real reason it exists but to cash in on the Eden of the East franchise. It progresses the plot a tiny bit, but otherwise remains stagnant and the few new things and new developments feel trite.I can only hope that Paradise Lost will be a good ending to the series and make up for this failure of a movie. learning everything about his past, I guess we need to start fresh again?

Some spoilers from the previous episodes but none for the films.The initial 11 episodes of Higashi no Eden were quickly in the higher ranks of the my beloved anime list, simultaneously feeding my need for absurd science fiction survival and a goofy, sentimental romance. The artwork is gorgeous and endearing while still allowing for a sense of urgency and disarray. The narrative presents a very ethically blurry set of decisions for the protagonists that don\'t rely on excessive violence or needless character...death to underline this. All the characters feel very precious.This continued right into the movies, which takes place 6 months after the last episode, and - despite what I am about to say - are worth watching if for nothing else than that.That said, the movies ultimately felt like stretched episodes in their pacing. I was expecting the narrative to go off the rails (in a good way) considering the series started off with a naked protagonist waving a gun in front of the White House and the sheer grandiose and conflicting  machinations of several of the Selecoa. Characters like Shiratori, who made an elaborate display of busting out of a hotel window on exaggerated black wings in an ambiguously symbolic gesture, or Yuuki, whose multiple missile attacks were thwarted by Takizawa, make lackluster appearances considering the aptitude for violence and destruction they both previously demonstrated. Much of the edge and mystique of the other Selecoa is muted. Though the ""gang""  of East of Eden all are developed nicely, each having a moment to evolve and grow by making hard and/or brave decisions.The plot ends up getting snagged on small details that end of getting dragged out and don\'t result in anything fruitful.  One snag in particular focuses on one detail of Takizawa\'s past - revealed by Juiz while attempting to make him ""king""- that ends of up being inconsequential to both the mystery behind the Selecoa, his confrontation  with Mononobe, and romance with Morimi all of which ends in a rather abrupt and unsatisfying way. There did not feel like there was any consequence for a supposedly high stakes game which really dulled on an otherwise amazing series. death to underline this.

The beginning made me feel a bit lost as to what happened in between Higashi no Eden and the King of Eden - which was supposed to happen. But this lack of cohesiveness disappointed me in the form that it couldn\'t ""build"" up as much as it ""should"".Overall, I enjoyed the rebuilding from ""ground zero"" and the quick pick up of pace that is selecao game. This middle piece lives little room for disappointment. ', 'Okay, why did this get a movie? I mean, I know the T.V. series ended badly and I probably wouldn\'t mind a little bit more or even a better ending to get a better conclusion, but was this really necessary? I don\'t think a way to conclude a series is by making a movie out of it when movies require conflict and this is exactly what this movie had. It was a sucky way to conclude a good-but-not-great series.So, the movie starts off with Saki, in a taxi in New York. But that dang rude Taxi man goes off on her for some reason, drops...her off somewhere suddenly, and leaves her there, leaving her phone and passport in the car. Then, everyone starts staring at her and humiliates her. When she finds her family and friends, she starts hugging one of them and crying. Wow that took a little bit of time to get to a conflict of this movie already, huh?! 😲Here are my problems with this movie, the characters. This movie focuses more on Saki when I thought the main protagonist of the series was Akira. I know Saki was one of the protagonists, but she wasn\'t quote as much in the series as Akira was unquote. But I don\'t like how this movie focused on Saki more when Saki isn\'t even that great of a character in the first place.Of all the characters they had to choose, they chose Saki. First of all, she likes to whine and mope about things; second of all, she can get a bit mean on occasion. I didn\'t think making her the main protagonist would be a good idea. I liked her better as being just a love interest for Akira. Akira used to have a story just for him in the series, but now he\'s become Saki\'s sidekick, which makes Saki the second main protagonist.As for Akira... why did he erase his memories? Why did Juiz change his name to linuma? why and how did he disappear? Is it just because he went off to New York on purpose? Did this movie answer all these questions?The characters are inconsistent to the ones in the series in terms of what role they play and their personalities and are now shadows of their former selves. I noticed that the few producers who did the T.V. series have not done this movie, and it probably would\'ve been better if they came back to do this film. Even the voice actors sounded like they were struggling to make their voices fit their now inconsistent characters.Next is the story, the movie does not have much of a plot; the only plot it has is Saki trying to find Akira, which lasts all of like 20 minutes. The dialogue is clichéd and there\'s no point to this movie other than it\'s about Saki trying to find Akira and get her passport and phone back. The movie starts putting me to sleep with its uninteresting story and focusing on the painfully annoying Saki instead of Akira, who was supposed to be the main protagonist in the first place, and since he disappeared, the movie had to ignore him for a long while.It was a struggle to watch this dull film. It was too slow, the pacing was kind of all over the place, and there is not enough action in it and what I mean by that is that the way the movie is that the structure in this movie is missing some of the important ingredients every movie/TV show needs just to be some kind of silly slice-of-life drama and it would\'ve been better off as a manga, as long as it doesn\'t mess up on the things this movie has messed up on. I also hate slice-of- life because most of them don\'t structure the ingredients every movie/TV show needs. They can be slow and just would rather focus on the drama and the characters and not bothering to put any important elements in them.And no, don\'t give me that excuse of ""It\'s a slice-of-life, you\'re not supposed to worry about plot, and it\'s supposed to be relaxing, happy and carefree."" No. You can make a good slice-of-life while making it flow well.So, let\'s get to the good points to this movie. There are several funny scenes in it, I liked the merry-go-round part and music, it was nice to see Akira and Saki happy and calm and talking about catching a gold ring on a merry-go-round, I empathized with them there. But that\'s about it. The characters\' personalities as a whole were not funny and neither was the conflict in this movie or whatever things they probably played for comedy.This is the kind of film that is forgettable and I would probably pretend it\'s never happened. Though, I would like to try and grab a gold ring while on a merry-go-round. her off somewhere suddenly, and leaves her there, leaving her phone and passport in the car.

But that\'s about it. The characters\' personalities as a whole were not funny and neither was the conflict in this movie or whatever things they probably played for comedy.This is the kind of film that is forgettable and I would probably pretend it\'s never happened. Though, I would like to try and grab a gold ring while on a merry-go-round.', 'This review will be a summation of the anime series and the two sequel movies.(~21 Episodes in length)[General]The anime sets this series up promising... with a very interesting concept to go about the plot along with likeable characters.  However,  the series quickly falls off and by the end of the second movie,  leaves it\'s watchers with an unsatisfactory ending.[Nitpicks]I feel the response to a threat in Japan is very unrealistic and takes away from the immersion this series tries to envelope it\'s audience in a game of thought. Additionally, many side characters and characters of interest felt lackluster,  and...there never really is a good villain or rivalry in the path of our character.  Entirety of the anime plot can somewhat be summed up in one phrase. ""Ok boomer.""  Still leaves it\'s audience unfulfilled.[Overall]There is still some good to be had in watching this series in it\'s entirety, but I can\'t help but feel there was so much potential here that was clearly wasted and a lot of plot decisions here that did not follow through completely and are merely just forgotten about. there never really is a good villain or rivalry in the path of our character.

I\'m getting the idea of it now that I\'ve made it to the movie, but overall, I wish there\'d been more backstory presented for the Saviors as an organization because it feels like something\'s missing. You have this load of tension between the...Saviors because of what they\'ve been tasked to do, but you don\'t really feel like it\'s all that intense because you have no context for it. I don\'t know if that makes sense, but it does kind of suck that the story isn\'t all that fleshed out.Again, the characters aren\'t all that fleshed out either. However, I will say that I don\'t think this story necessarily needs characters with rich backstories. My main issue with the characters-- namely, the main character-- is that I can\'t really tell where their motivations lie. Especially given the state that the main character was in at the end of the anime, it didn\'t really make much sense for him to be the exact same in this movie as he was at the beginning of the anime.

The series has mystery surrounding how everything works and the discovering the system and secrets of the Selecao operation was pretty interesting. The movie has no such interest factor. Yes, Takizawa loses his memory again, but I feel like I'm rewatching the first part of the series again seeing him puzzled and Saki slowly helping him remember who he is. Basically, the movie just has a lot less going on.The worst part of the movie is the collection of characters. The Eden of the East crew feel like they are just there. They're at the head...of the company but they don't do anything. And how did they get so many workers in the first place and work the operation smoothly when most of them have the social IQ of a neet, which is what they were. It's just grating how a crew that contains an absolutely useless Oosugi is perfectly leading a company. Like how did they get there?The guy with glasses and black hair has too short a temper. Saki just listens to the black haired glasses guy scream at him over the phone ordering what to do. Like wtf basic respect with your friends you're not even capable of that? Pants guy just came along the group and acted like the token fat smart guy of the group that tries to act cool but fails. (Steins Gate?) I guess the worst part about the characters is that they were just there, and not doing anything. Saki didn't mature at all. In the series it felt like she was trying to become a little more independent. In the movie that progress is stunted: he completely relies on Takizawa. She also does the emotional character speech that's completely illogical but I'll do something because my feelings are too strong. (this happens when she tells black haired glasses guy he would save Takizawa by acting rashly because she feels bad for him, which only endangers her and thus the whole ass operation of saving Takizawa in the first place) Finally, seeing Takizawa having amnesia again gave be déjà vu boredom.Basically my gripe with the movie is that nothing happened and that the characters were uninspiring.Tl;dr Worst than the series in every aspect except visually of the company but they don't do anything.

It still tilts a little to the light-hearted side in the situations that ask for a more suspenseful and dramatic mood.

During his role as a teacher, he develops a great relationship with his students vowing to always protect them from danger. This is constantly proven when his precious students are attacked by ghosts, yokai, & other supernatural demons.

It should also be noted that the main character can vary every episode as some are focused on Nube while others are based on his students.One of the highlights of this series is Nube himself as he a shonen hero in every respect and is a well written character who shifts from a wise mentor to a comedic love crazed buffoon. I should mention that a love triangle forms in the anime which intentionally was done for laughs but towards the end of the series becomes a very serious subject.Overall, Hell Teacher Nube delivers in entertainment at times being a much darker version of Goosebumps. It may have a monster of the week formula but it's not a battle series & provides much more content as a whole.

Then let me talk you about Hell Teacher Nube.Hell Teacher Nube is a supernatural/yokai episodic “monster of the week” show from the mid-90s that is flying under the radar of most anime fans nowadays since it was never really a hit in the first place back then, and as most of the titles that fail to generate a solid initial impact, it couldn’t avoid the fate of being forgotten in time. Debuting in the same year Neon Genesis Evangelion sent bittersweet shockwaves with its controversial last 2 episodes, Rurouni Kenshin...became the new fighting shounen attraction after Dragon Ball was quickly running out of steam with Dragon Ball GT, Detective Conan started building its empire drawing the attention of the ones interested in mysteries, the Slayers franchise was getting stronger in the fantasy genre with its second installment (Next), and Sailor Moon, the most iconic and popular magical girl show from the 90s, was saying goodbye with its final season (Stars), among other competent shows that made their debuts in 1996, there was hardly any room left for a fully episodic and simple show like this (which also had to face direct competition in the supernatural genre with the more well-known and established GeGeGe no Kitarou (1996) household series) to make itself a relevant name both in Japan and the West.I first knew about this show back in 2007, when a local anime specialized TV station started airing it after midnight and I used some of its episodes as background television while I was finishing some of my homework and was preparing myself to sleep, never really paying much attention to it and consequently remembering virtually nothing besides the visuals, character designs and the catchy J-rock opening theme. But there was something about its captivating, youthfully-sinister atmosphere that after all these years did manage to stuck in my mind that encouraged me to revisit it now, 11 years later, with complete dedication. And I have to say that -despite its simplicity- it has been quite a pleasant surprise, and that it’s truly worth the try for those who have no troubles watching old shows with dim colors, simple characters and an episodic monster-of-the-week structure. Watching it has been such a delightful experience, that I just can’t help to try to increase its low awareness levels.The argument: it follows the paranormal adventures of Meisuke “Nube” Nueno, a kind, funny, lovable and young teacher at Domori elementary school who since birth had an abnormal sensibility to perceive evil ghosts and demons from the spiritual “yokai” world (a faculty that made him an easy target to them and allowed him to evetually become a demon connoisseur and a demon slayer) and the 5th grade naughty students he has in charge, with whom he develops a very close, warm and trustworthy relationship, to the point that he even gets permanently and tenderly bullied by them. Due to a tragic incident (which is told with details in one of the later episodes) before becoming a teacher in that school, he managed to seal a powerful demon in his left hand, which turned it into a monstrous-looking one and which he has to cover with a black glove in order to not reveal his true nature and frighten the people around him. This sealing granted him the ability to fight other demons with said hand, since the power of that demon is at his disposal there.I have to say that the “horror” tag this show has is kind of misleading. Though it’s about ghosts and demons attacks, it is really not scary or uneasy to watch at all. You don’t watch this to feel frightened, to feel that suspense that true horror works stimulate. No episode will really have you on the edge of your seat nor covering your eyes from shock. It is after all very kid-friendly, there’s no gore, no raw scenes and no body parts flying through the air. There is blood, but nothing that terrible or excessive, and virtually the whole time from the teacher’s part, never from the kids, who are only threatened by the supernatural entities and never physically hurt, so no edgy and cheap child torture here. The tone is really very light, innocent and with lots of goofy comedy the whole time, though it occasionally gets more serious.As an episodic, “monster of the week” show, most episodes are pretty formulaic with an autoconclusive story; one or some of the students of the class will face –in a certain context- the threat of a yokai world entity (ghost, demon, monster, etc.) that will take advantage of a particular weakness, insecurity, moral fault or dark inner sentiment those children have in order to scare them. When the entity is about to make his act, Nube appears, confronts it and ends up slaying it with the power of the demon he has in his left hand, saving his students in the process, something he is happy to do since he believes it is his mission in this world to protect them from their attacks. Everyone celebrate at the end and the kids learn from the mistakes that allowed the creatures to attack them in the first place.Despite being formulaic, the episodes still show variety in focus, relevance and tone. Some are very light, while some others are more intense and/or heavy. Some are more relevant than the rest, in the sense that they tackle the backstory and some mild character progression of the characters. Some are just to have simple fun, others to leave substantial moral messages. Some are more disturbing or creepy than the others, or even thought-provoking, like one which involves an artificial biology-class mannequin that started to develop a soul inside and started considering himself as a real normal human being with genuine feelings, a situation that made the class feel uneasy and that led them to face a moral dilemma and to take questionable decisions. And while teacher Nube is the main character and the ones who saves the day, not all the attention is put into him; the show does a good job in giving every character of the class a fair share of focus in terms of number of episodes centered around them (including Nube himself).Speaking about the characters, they are not realistic and most of them are stereotypical. Nube himself represents a virtuous and beloved shounen hero that will protect the ones he loves no matter the costs. Hiroshi, the main character from the children, is a naughty, hyperactive but kindhearted and brave boy, who likes playing football and has lots of friends. Kyoko is an insecure, neurotic but grounded girl everyone likes to bully (I’d say she’s the most interesting among the children because she is the most mature and can see and analyze the situations they face with an adult perspective). There’s also a malicious girl who likes to gossip and brag of her early developed breasts, an innocent, righteous boy, a spoiled rich kid and a delinquent, among others. But being an unambitious formulaic show, I don’t see any trouble in this. You never come to this type of shows expecting realism and lots of character development and stuff. However, this doesn’t mean they are totally static throughout all of the show’s run. As said before, some of the terrifying incidents with the ghosts make the kids learn important life lessons and grow up as human beings, which is effective.Anyway, watching all these characters interact, having fun with their teacher and living all those thrilling and mysterious ghost adventures in their own school and surroundings is truly the main appeal of the show and precisely why you come for it, because in all honesty, who wouldn’t have liked to live all this during their elementary school days? Scary and everything, supernatural and paranormal activity has always been a subject that has awakened the interest of people trapped in a boring, mundane daily life, even more in kids discovering the world they live in. And this show really delivers in dragging you to those times when you were a kid fascinated with ghost stories. It appeals to that child wish most of us had of living fun and adventurous supernatural experiences along with our friends and classmates. It does an excellent job in making you wish you would have lived all that to make your school life way more entertaining and memorable, in company of an unorthodox, funny, young and close teacher everyone loves that wasn’t just that typical distant person you treat with a lot of respect and fear looking from below.The art irradiates a particular charm hard to describe that makes this so addictive and the atmosphere so obscurely lovely. The color palette is colorful enough to not give this image of something that is trying to sell itself as very dark and serious but rather kid-friendly and at the same time dull enough to print in the viewer this absorbing feeling of people being menaced by creatures sneaking from the shadows, especially when action takes place at nights. It perfectly suits the overall tone and direction of the show. Anyway, you just have to see it to understand, it’s kind of hard to do so with cold words. All I’m going to add here is that this youthfully sinister and haunting feel is something that you just dont see very often in modern anime with digital coloring and shading techniques and that cel-animation had an advantage when it comes to this matter.To conclude, Hell Teacher Nube is a show that, while nothing special in regards of being an episodic show which follows a monster of the week formula, it’s still a show with a fascinating, obscure-but-innocent charm, able to delight and entertain almost effortlessly given it’s likable cast, easy-to-watch condition and absorbing atmosphere. Besides, it is also educative, you can use it to learn a lot from Japanese folklore. And while it obviously won’t work for people who have a hard time getting into monster-of-the-week shows, I believe that those who don’t have troubles with them will find this show to be an overall gratifying experience that is worth the try. 7/10.Some additional tips/comments:Being episodic, you don’t really “have to” watch every single of its 48 episodes to understand it and you can skip some of them. However, episodes 20 and 34 are essential, since they tackle the past of the main character and explain more who he is and why he feels he has the mission to protect kids from the attack of ghosts. And if you really want to feel the whole emotional impact the heartbreaking last 2 episodes provide, I’d say it is indeed necessary to have watched the whole show so said impact can in fact, materialize in you.As a show dealing with ghosts with a gloomy, somber (but still innocent) feel, it is highly recommendable to watch it at nights, and ideally inside your bed. That way you will be able to get more immersed in its exquisit and haunting atmosphere, which is precisely the idea when watching a show like this! The same way you enjoyed more scary shows like “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” or “Tales from the Crypt” when you watched them surrounded by the mysterious and menacing feel of the night rather than by the clarity-safety feel of daylight. The feel of this show is such that it just doesn’t work much if watched during the day.The show gets a little pervy sometimes. You will see some boys conveniently falling into women breasts, some nosebleeds, the teacher fantasizing with naked women, and what may be probably the most annoying issue, an 11 year old girl bragging about her early developed boobs. There’s also an episode where a teenage girl literally suffers from spontaneous body incinerations that burn her clothes leaving her totally naked in front of everyone. But as most of the 80s/90s shows with raunchy stuff, all this is used for more comical rather than erotic purposes, so it’s really nothing that annoying. But if you categorically can't stand the inclusion of this type of moments in shows involving kids, then it would be better to not try this show. became the new fighting shounen attraction after Dragon Ball was quickly running out of steam with Dragon Ball GT, Detective Conan started building its empire drawing the attention of the ones interested in mysteries, the Slayers franchise was getting stronger in the fantasy genre with its second installment (Next), and Sailor Moon, the most iconic and popular magical girl show from the 90s, was saying goodbye with its final season (Stars), among other competent shows that made their debuts in 1996, there was hardly any room left for a fully episodic and simple show like this (which also had to face direct competition in the supernatural genre with the more well-known and established GeGeGe no Kitarou (1996) household series) to make itself a relevant name both in Japan and the West.I first knew about this show back in 2007, when a local anime specialized TV station started airing it after midnight and I used some of its episodes as background television while I was finishing some of my homework and was preparing myself to sleep, never really paying much attention to it and consequently remembering virtually nothing besides the visuals, character designs and the catchy J-rock opening theme. But there was something about its captivating, youthfully-sinister atmosphere that after all these years did manage to stuck in my mind that encouraged me to revisit it now, 11 years later, with complete dedication. And I have to say that -despite its simplicity- it has been quite a pleasant surprise, and that it’s truly worth the try for those who have no troubles watching old shows with dim colors, simple characters and an episodic monster-of-the-week structure. Watching it has been such a delightful experience, that I just can’t help to try to increase its low awareness levels.The argument: it follows the paranormal adventures of Meisuke “Nube” Nueno, a kind, funny, lovable and young teacher at Domori elementary school who since birth had an abnormal sensibility to perceive evil ghosts and demons from the spiritual “yokai” world (a faculty that made him an easy target to them and allowed him to evetually become a demon connoisseur and a demon slayer) and the 5th grade naughty students he has in charge, with whom he develops a very close, warm and trustworthy relationship, to the point that he even gets permanently and tenderly bullied by them. Due to a tragic incident (which is told with details in one of the later episodes) before becoming a teacher in that school, he managed to seal a powerful demon in his left hand, which turned it into a monstrous-looking one and which he has to cover with a black glove in order to not reveal his true nature and frighten the people around him. This sealing granted him the ability to fight other demons with said hand, since the power of that demon is at his disposal there.I have to say that the “horror” tag this show has is kind of misleading. Though it’s about ghosts and demons attacks, it is really not scary or uneasy to watch at all. You don’t watch this to feel frightened, to feel that suspense that true horror works stimulate. No episode will really have you on the edge of your seat nor covering your eyes from shock. It is after all very kid-friendly, there’s no gore, no raw scenes and no body parts flying through the air. There is blood, but nothing that terrible or excessive, and virtually the whole time from the teacher’s part, never from the kids, who are only threatened by the supernatural entities and never physically hurt, so no edgy and cheap child torture here. The tone is really very light, innocent and with lots of goofy comedy the whole time, though it occasionally gets more serious.As an episodic, “monster of the week” show, most episodes are pretty formulaic with an autoconclusive story; one or some of the students of the class will face –in a certain context- the threat of a yokai world entity (ghost, demon, monster, etc.) that will take advantage of a particular weakness, insecurity, moral fault or dark inner sentiment those children have in order to scare them. When the entity is about to make his act, Nube appears, confronts it and ends up slaying it with the power of the demon he has in his left hand, saving his students in the process, something he is happy to do since he believes it is his mission in this world to protect them from their attacks. Everyone celebrate at the end and the kids learn from the mistakes that allowed the creatures to attack them in the first place.Despite being formulaic, the episodes still show variety in focus, relevance and tone. Some are very light, while some others are more intense and/or heavy. Some are more relevant than the rest, in the sense that they tackle the backstory and some mild character progression of the characters. Some are just to have simple fun, others to leave substantial moral messages. Some are more disturbing or creepy than the others, or even thought-provoking, like one which involves an artificial biology-class mannequin that started to develop a soul inside and started considering himself as a real normal human being with genuine feelings, a situation that made the class feel uneasy and that led them to face a moral dilemma and to take questionable decisions. And while teacher Nube is the main character and the ones who saves the day, not all the attention is put into him; the show does a good job in giving every character of the class a fair share of focus in terms of number of episodes centered around them (including Nube himself).Speaking about the characters, they are not realistic and most of them are stereotypical. Nube himself represents a virtuous and beloved shounen hero that will protect the ones he loves no matter the costs. Hiroshi, the main character from the children, is a naughty, hyperactive but kindhearted and brave boy, who likes playing football and has lots of friends. Kyoko is an insecure, neurotic but grounded girl everyone likes to bully (I’d say she’s the most interesting among the children because she is the most mature and can see and analyze the situations they face with an adult perspective). There’s also a malicious girl who likes to gossip and brag of her early developed breasts, an innocent, righteous boy, a spoiled rich kid and a delinquent, among others. But being an unambitious formulaic show, I don’t see any trouble in this. You never come to this type of shows expecting realism and lots of character development and stuff. However, this doesn’t mean they are totally static throughout all of the show’s run. As said before, some of the terrifying incidents with the ghosts make the kids learn important life lessons and grow up as human beings, which is effective.Anyway, watching all these characters interact, having fun with their teacher and living all those thrilling and mysterious ghost adventures in their own school and surroundings is truly the main appeal of the show and precisely why you come for it, because in all honesty, who wouldn’t have liked to live all this during their elementary school days? Scary and everything, supernatural and paranormal activity has always been a subject that has awakened the interest of people trapped in a boring, mundane daily life, even more in kids discovering the world they live in. And this show really delivers in dragging you to those times when you were a kid fascinated with ghost stories.

I mean Nube.This is a fairly faithful adaptation of manga, which, unfortunately, skips several manga chapters, and tones down material quite a lot (I suppose to make it suitable for TV). Due to doning down of material it is also weaker than manga counterpart.It is a very solid/quality show, which is, unfortunately not outstanding. It has couple of amazing episodes, and few great moments, but number of those is fairly small. Out of 49 episodes  maybe 5 were truly memorable. The rest is just alright.Differences compared to manga: some of the brutal/gory moments from manga are toned down, changed...or removed. Several deaths do not occur in anime, and gory horror moments are heavily toned down when possible. For example, instead of open wounds on sliced monsters we see silhouettes, some people don't die horribly in this adaptation, and so on. Also... compared to manga, story feels less dynamic.Due to (slightly) toned down story you'd think this almost qualifies for kid's show... but on occasion it throws body horror and very tense moments. Which doesn't happen often. Still, it definitely feels like an attempt to make the story more child-friendly.Anyway.Here's detailed breakdown:Story: 6/10The story mostly follows episodic monster of the week structure, occasionally some events happen across multiple episodes. Meaning that even though though episodes are mostly unrelated to each other, few events happen in order. The reason why the story is 6/10 and not 5/10 because of few episodes I liked where the anime managed to shine (by being darker or more interesting). At core material is pretty much close to some sort of campfire stories and describes supernatural occurrences that are inexplicably centered around the same school.Art: 5/10:It is a tv show from 1990s. It wasn't done on shoestring budget, and doesn't look terrible (for example, it looked much better than Narutaru), but it could've been better. Animes of comparable quality would be.... hmm.... perhaps, slayers tv series, or ranma. Meaning fairly well detailed, but not outstanding.Sound: 5/10:Opening starts almost as a death metal composition, but quickly devolves into a sillier tune. There was a small number of interesting motives in background music, but overall  music doesn't stand out and is forgettable.Characters: 4/10:Characters are not very well portrayed. They aren't stereotypical or bad, but they're not very believable. Due to amount of supernatural stuff that occurs in the school in question it is hard to believe when Nube dismisses someone's concern, or when people act in reckless fashion regarding possible yokai. Nube as a character is quite annoying, I also strongly disliked Ritsuko sensei. The problem with Nube is that he is portrayed as a completely incompetent idiot when it comes to women (or anything that is not yokai), and in some scenes I was feeling sorry for his objects of romantic interest. Ritsuko-sensei are completely one-dimensional and barely displays any character, ever, her primary job is getting angry at Nube. Quite a lot of characters are close to being one-dimensional, meaning they do what plot tells them, most of the time. The most interesting characters from the whole cast were Miki, Kyoko and to some extent Hiroshi. Yukime was also somewhat interesting, but Ritsuko sensei, and Nube's antics pretty much impacts show negatively.Still, some of the side characters were interesting and amusing, which included some of the youkai.Enjoyment: 5/10.IT was alright, but that's about it. I'm not sure why I watched it, but I didn't hate it. I did enjoy few rare episodes that were of higher quality.Overall: 5/10.It is a decent show, but not a masterpiece.I think checking out the manga instead of anime might be a good idea with this one. Overall the anime gives impression of being aimed at either children or young kids, if not for the occasional instances of body horror. Art style isn't bad, and some of the characters are cute. So... may be worth picking up for retro visuals or to kill some time. or removed. Several deaths do not occur in anime, and gory horror moments are heavily toned down when possible.

Hinomaruzumou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37007/Hinomaruzumou,"[""You don't find a lot of anime that you can really say tick all of the boxes to being the perfect experience, however Hinomaruzumou undoubtedly comes close. It evokes powerful emotions every episode and had me on the edge of my seat for the outcomes of each sumo bout, which were never predictable and always had an enrapturing dramatic flare. The soundtrack, while not particularly striking among some of the greater soundtracks we have seen in anime, is very fitting and sets the mood brilliantly at every turn. Heavily recommend this series to anyone who enjoys suspenseful action-based anime, martial art-based anime or sport-based anime. "", 'Fat guys wearing diapers and sweating like pigs. Over weighted = over powered. Who cares if you can\'t bend to tie your own shoe lases when can just walks thru walls anyway. Let the slimiest man win!I never quite understood why sumo was called a sports instead of the male version of plus sized beauty modelling, but Hinomawhatever helped me to open my eyes to the beauty of this art. Partly because it quite closely follows the normal, formulaic pattern commonly seen in sports anime and partly because of its manly and bro cast. I never quite respected sumo nor thought much about it,...but now I kinda do.The setup for our story will seem rather familiar to anyone who has seen classic sports series. Main bro is a prodigy with the heart, but he can\'t be the unbeatable sumo Jesus just yet for there are several things in the way. He himself is a manlet, practically new unit between meter and decimeter -tier midget who is too short to officially be able to become a sumo pro. He also can\'t join the school with the best sumo club in Japan because he is terrible at reading maps, so instead he ends up in a school which sumo club is practically dead and the whole fight sports scene in the school ruled by thugs, delinquents and cool badasses. The nearly-a-Jesus type of character with these hardships/obstacles is used to create some rather interesting mixed martial arts battles very early on and also to introduce bunch of characters who get to discover the beauty of sumo sports in the same manner as the viewers who are new to sumo do when watching the series.  Development and awe-inspiring coolness exists for a while, offering a strong start for the series. This commonly slows down the pace later on and requires some back stories, build-up and character depth. And this is more or less like the route that was now chosen, but the route itself is ever so entertaining to follow.The events are rather simple since Hinomary is a simple series that doesn\'t try to really be anything more. Our cast contains a wide variety of characters from people who are totally ignorant to sumo to pros whose entire life centers around it. This brings quite a few different perspectives in to the mix and shows many sides of the sports itself. The series can be rather educational from this part and thanks to the colorful cast, the way Hinomary is dealing with the basics of sumo feel very natural and smooth. The author is clearly knowledgeable about other sports series as well as the sports in question and that at least carried all the way thru this season, which main focus outside showing what sumo is and who our main characters are, is a simple interschool sumo tournament where different sumo clubs from different schools face each others.The strongest sides with the series lie within the awe moments, fights, GAR-like atmosphere and Hinomaru\'s (sumo Jesus\'s) personality. The weakest parts are the believability of other club\'s members success and the lack of a proper training arc + the pacing which can be -- at time -- jumpy and seem like new episodes start off from episodic settings rather than continuing from anywhere that was shown in former episode.Outside Hinomaru, the most interesting (and relatively bro) main character is Chihiro Kunisaki, who is a talented wrestler that now joined Hinomaru\'s sumo team. The remaining 4 club members from ""our side"" can occasionally feel bit filler-ish and much less interesting. We have super shy and skinny dude who looks incredibly unfit to physically even participate in the sports. Fat dude who is practically the exact same as the thin dude (personality-wise) except has always loved sumo and is somewhat good at it. There is also another Jesus in the series named trainer-Jesus person and he is more or less like anyone else in the series except supposedly holds lots of sumo-wisdom and wear glasses and is training our main cast.. kind of. The last club member is a delinquent thug person who was portrayed to be incredibly cool and badass in the beginning of the series, but then his personality was put on a leash pretty much and now he is just another person doing sumo without many visible&interesting personality traits, but even he gets thru some development later on and his personality change gets explained rather well eventually. There is also one more  ""main""character in the series because all sports series need a mascot girl. Student council president who is the thug dudes sister and has a brother complex over him. The good part is that the opponents of our sumo Jesus themselves are way more interesting and cool than the main cast which is more so portrayed to be ""real people"" than completely badass sumo pros. Other basic sports elements exist also, such as tragic past story for main bro\'s mother and a love interest subplot. The series has many things to offer due to these simple elements, but it should be noted that these things didn\'t really go anywhere during the first season.In terms of production, Gonzo is underrated as ever. The first ED is beast as hell. Side character bros look awesome. Like really advanced awesome. Some sumo wrestlers still are just big and otherwise they do not stand out, but others have highly unique and manly character design which is also memorable. The music is fitting and those sounds when men fall on the tatami exactly as loud as they should be, meaning hella. The animation is especially fitting for a series of this sort and art design along the color choices do their work splendidly. It\'s subdued and simplistic and I see no reason to complain about it, much rather praise this simplicity for how efficient it is. Some weird errs still exist, such as sumo Jesus really looking like 1 feet tall compared to the bigger and fatter sumo dudes who are like 8 feet compared to him during certain shots. This may seem ridiculous/annoy some viewers. It stands out, but personally I didn\'t find it annoying.I highly enjoyed this series because I am a huge fan of sports series and Hinomaru didn\'t especially do anything that was there to ruin the experience for me. The story board is somewhat lacking and clearly unoriginal + the other main characters are not as amazing as the real mains and their opponents, but the generic sports pattern itself is being dealt with in respectable manner and Hinomaru\'s way to deal with its characters and execute the common tropes are pleasure to watch even when the series lacks some depth.ps, there is a a slice of life oriented sketch at the end of each episode that starts after the ED, highly recommend watching those but now I kinda do.The setup for our story will seem rather familiar to anyone who has seen classic sports series.

The story board is somewhat lacking and clearly unoriginal + the other main characters are not as amazing as the real mains and their opponents, but the generic sports pattern itself is being dealt with in respectable manner and Hinomaru\'s way to deal with its characters and execute the common tropes are pleasure to watch even when the series lacks some depth.ps, there is a a slice of life oriented sketch at the end of each episode that starts after the ED, highly recommend watching those', ""Hinomaruzumou is one of the most criminally slept on anime in recent memory. The 24 episodes it has run is not nearly enough to satisfy my desire to observe Hinomaru's sumo.Fall 2018 saw a rebirth of sports anime. The trio of Run with the wind (Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru), Tsurune, and Hinomaruzumou have collectively transformed the genre. These non traditional sports made room for more character growth and development than I've ever witnessed in sports anime, and I truly hope that Tsurune and Hinomaruzumou each receive second seasons some day. These three anime show us that sport anime have the potential to be less about...the sport involved, and more about human growth, relationships, spirit and passion. If I were to define any of these three anime as being about sumo, cross country, or Kyudo, my definition would be severely lacking. These three masterpieces have ushered in a new era for the sports genre, and I am very interested to see how the industry and the community will react.Before this anime I knew nothing about sumo, and I feel as though I knew even less about spirit. Sumo is a spiritual engagement, and Hinomaru & co. show us an overwhelming amount of spirit, too much to fit inside any one physical body.The animation is the only weak point of this series, as I imagine studio Gonzo didn't have much of a budget to put up. This however, did not take away from the intensity and raw emotion of each and every bout.If your a fan of sports anime or any sort of naturalism, I highly recommend this series. I was constantly reminded of Jack London's White Fang and the Call of the Wild. The kill or be killed mentality, the animalistic instinct and strength put into every move, the willpower to never back down and give your body for the sake of Sumo, all make this title a fantastic addition to the naturalist genre. On top of that the thrill of the mortal combat, watching these characters (and voice actors) give every ounce of spirit, not in the name of victory, but in the name of the Sumo gods, and their teammates. The voice acting was incredible thought the series, and the awesome action scenes were well balanced by a great variety of hilarious comedic scenes. Just watch OP2 of the series for an example of how intense and exhilarating the sumo can be.I appreciate the reflection of how sumo is viewed in contemporary Japanese high schools, as the country becomes more westernized. I believe this westernization may result in a loss of the spirit that defines much of Japanese culture. But seeing these characters change their mind about sumo, and come to deeply respect the sport as an art accurately depicts my own journey that this series has taken me on. I now respect and am inspired more by those that participate in sumo than in any other sport.Seeing Ushio and his team put 110% into every slap and throw for the sake of others has made me miss the joy of team sport, and the catharsis which can result from them. These characters continually put it all on the line and the final bout of destiny will have to go down as one of my all time favorite anime battles.If you've ever enjoyed a sports anime before, I recommend this series that has so sadly flown under the radar, and has received none of the credit which it deserves.So many elements came together to make this a great anime, and if I ever become a multi millionaire, I'm getting Gonzo to make another damn season!! the sport involved, and more about human growth, relationships, spirit and passion.

An anime about magic? Done. An anime about ghosts? There\'s one. An anime about turning war weapons into cute and beautiful girls? Look no further. And finally, an anime about soda cans also being feminized? Yes, it exists.And now a shounen anime about sumo.I can now finally add another entry on my ""Japan\'s Greatest Ideas"" list and not on the ""Japan\'s Weirdest Ideas"".Hinomaruzumou or Hinomaru Sumo is about Ushio Hinomaru, a new student who enrolled at Oodachi High School and joined...their very small sumo club with the intention of being a Yokozuna (the highest rank on professional Sumo). But it appears fate isn\'t very kind to him because he\'s too ""small"" for the sport.Despite his disadvantage, Hinomaru makes up for it with training and strong spirit. And he\'s going to prove to everyone that you can still be a Yokozuna even if you\'re not big enough!I know, I know. It has that clichéd sports anime feel of wanting to be at the top of the summit despite the main hero\'s glaring flaw(s). But don\'t let it deter you from watching this anime! It was brilliantly done and in just a few minutes, you can\'t help but be immediately get used to their world.This is, after all, another retelling of that classic shounen and sports anime feel while giving it a breath of fresh air. It\'s advantage is the fact that it features a sport that (let\'s be honest) not everyone will immediately be interested in. They\'re taking a risk with this one and I\'m all in!I literally went in with little to none knowledge on sumo and so far, this is becoming educational for me. I never thought that I\'d actually would like to learn more about sumo and find this, in general, something fascinating. I mean, it\'s just about two ""fat"" guys hugging each other, right? Wrong. I was so wrong. It was more than that and I admit, Hinomaru was able to influence me for I saw how passionate he was and I couldn\'t help but be interested as well.The opening was wonderful and gives insights on future characters/rivals/events; and at the same time, makes it obvious that this IS shounen and you\'re in for a wonderful ride. The ending is very manly as well. The ""ooh hah"" parts really get my blood pumping!The characters are so lovable. The main character can really inspire you and even though he\'s the good ol\' shounen hero, I didn\'t mind at all. In fact, that made me love him even more. The supporting cast are amazing as well. I love their individual quirks and how they all blend so well together. This is truly an ensemble to watch out for!The art style, at first, didn\'t truly catch my attention. It\'s not bad but it\'s not that great either. However, when the sumo matches are shown; wow, I was blown away. I love the way they used heavy and darker lines and palette during intense scenes and lighter ones during comedic scenes. As someone who read the manga, I\'m glad they\'re staying faithful to the original art.Another thing I\'d like to point out on the art style is that I hardly saw any still shots which is a really good news. I tried pausing at random times to see if I\'ll see any goofy drawings but haven\'t seen one. A lot of anime nowadays resort to those aforementioned goofy shots because they either want to save money or speed up the animation process.Overall, Hinomaru Sumo is a really great anime. Since it\'s about a sport I\'m not very familiar with, it immediately piqued my interest and I\'m so glad I tried it out. The opening and ending songs give me the classic shounen feel, and the characters, especially Hinomaru, are lovable; and I can\'t wait to get to know them better. The art is the typical one you usually see on anime nowadays but when it\'s sumo time, wow, it really brings a lot to the table!I\'m very excited for the next episodes and continue this wonderful journey!P.S.: There are anime released before about sumo but none of them caught my attention like this one did.P.P.S.: If you\'re thinking of reading the manga, I suggest you start from chapter 1. The anime skipped a lot of chapters after all. It\'s like the anime has its own storytelling of the same characters and universe while the manga has its own different style as well. Both are enjoyable and will make you appreciate Hinomaru Sumo even more. :)Story: 10/10Art: 10/10Sound: 10/10Character: 10/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 10/10 their very small sumo club with the intention of being a Yokozuna (the highest rank on professional Sumo).

Animation is very still typically but I can\'t deny that it becomes good and borderline great in action sequences! Sound wise, the OP, ED and OST...are top notch, some of the best this season and probably this year! Voice acting is solid but doesn\'t stand out in any way to be honest.Character=8/Story=7:Although the characters are stereotyped heavily, I can\'t deny that I do love them and especially their chemistry and interactions as they all seem linked by the sport of sumo which can be seen as following a lot of shounen tropes but honestly it doesn\'t seem forced; also as a small guy, the MC makes me hype! The story is the typical, ""I wanna be the best at something but I have a certain drawback so I\'m gonna recruit some buddies and go on a journey until I learn to be the best I can be.""

It feels as if this anime needs a little more attention so I decided to write this review.As a fan of sports and shounen anime I think that Hinomaruzumou is actually quite original. There are all these anime that have already been done such as volleyball, tennis, boxing, baseball, etc. But never in my life I thought there would be one about sumo. Every single time I watch an anime that is about a certain sport, I think its great that these anime\'s teach you about how the sports work as...well. Now learning about sumo was probably the best experience out of all the sports anime that I have watched. Since the first episode, this anime was screaming ""HYPE"" right from the get go. I think that learning about different sumo techniques such as slapping or grabbing the belt are very interesting and that is what makes sumo so unique. This also makes it like Hajime no Ippo just toned down a little bit.The story and art are not totally perfect by any means. Of course there are things that I want to have improved such as like have more background information about the main character Hinomaru. Why does he look that way? These questions got in the way sometimes but overall didn\'t distract from the main story. The art is quite normal but that doesn\'t get in the way at all. Most of the time, I don\'t even notice it. The characters in this show are very likable and the introduction of each them are very smooth.Overall, I think that this is one of the hidden gems of the season. Like I said before, I am a very big fan of sports and shounen animes so you can take this review with a grain of salt but I am loving this anime. The opening is very cool as well and I can\'t wait for what is going to come. Not only do I recommend this show to sports anime fans, but for everyone, as I think that it is a great watch this season.(P.S These are my initial impressions. I am going to be writing a review at the final episode) well. Now learning about sumo was probably the best experience out of all the sports anime that I have watched.

Honestly, I never liked the sport in real and whenever sumo came to my mind I would think a bunch of sweaty overweight dudes slamming their chubbiness against each other. But boy o boy! This anime maintains the respect of the sport and shows it from the perspective of...Ushio, who is only 152cm but his desire to win, passion for the sport and support of his teammates makes him achieve the impossible.x-----------------Spoilers---------------x- Story: Great story overall. There is a lot of background story telling also which in my opinion is done very well. I would encourage anime producers to please always rethink before splashing forward a 12 episode season. Since in my personal experience it never lets me synch or helps me in understanding all the characters. The moment i saw 24 episodes I was sure the story will have to be great and to my surprise it exceeded my expectations. The best part was that even though obviously the story has to revolve around the protagonist, the story telling of all the other characters has been done phenomenally.-Characterization: Perhaps the most important part of the anime are the characters.  The Daichi Sumo club and its members have been well characterized each having a strong background story which strengthened their individual character building throughout the plot. How Yuma who when sees the light to redemption seeks his path of making up to Ozeki and the sumo club for the lost years.  Kirihito with his knack for analyzing his opponents and despite having a physical limitation, the way he overcomes it in the last few episode in order to compete in the final and wins it so convincingly is amazing. How, Chihiro the all out genius makes his way through fame and finally competes against his brother in the finals. How Ozeki and his love for the sport makes him realize his goal. How Kei evolves from being a weak individual to someone with a strong will and spirit. Last but not the least Ushio! His characterization is everything I love to see in a protagonist. Strong, fierce, passionate and compassionate makes the perfect recipe for the ultimate protagonist who despite being short in the end beats the Kuze the son of a Yokozuna and makes it to becoming pro. The bond between all these characters and the support characters in terms of their managers and rival teammates makes this anime a seriously hidden gem in the realm of animes.

This is one such anime which takes you a sport which is practiced professionally only in Japan and is full of ancient traditions.The artwork is nice and more than anything, it gets you craving for more. The protagonist (Ushio) is the normal guy with a -never-give-up- attitude and a never ending love for the sport. In the anime, He sparks interest in everyone who is spectating and much like the anime, He will quickly get you interested in Sumo as well. I started reading up on...it non-stop.Even though the anime does not explain each and every details about Sumo (cant blame them, traditions in Sumo is too vast to be explained over a couple of shows), I can guarantee one thing... If you are like me who is fascinated by Japanese culture.. this anime will open new doors for you.The opening and closing soundtrack is just awesome..

Alot of sports anime tend to focus only or mainly on the MC but in this show they give everyone a bit of the spotlight. Sumo isnt something im interested in usually, but this anime is great. The way the story is told is beautiful, the pacing is good and the bouts are great.Overall this anime ticks all the boxes for me ; it looks decent, the battles/bouts are emotional and explain techniques well enough to understand how it all works.Something felt missing though, im not sure what exactly it is but something didnt quite sit right at times.Still,...definitely a solid anime and would recommend definitely a solid anime and would recommend', ""There's few things I love more in storytelling than an underdog story. This was that through and through. This journey we went on with Ushio has it all. Highs and lows and everything in between. Going along this path with him trying to become a yokozuna was an absolute delight. Being a small guy myself it was a natural fit for me love and cheer for him. Ushio himself was such a good character. Typical shonen lead perhaps but the way the story used him and explored more about him was done so well. How his love for sumo drew more people to the sport.Myself...being kind of like that too. didn't really know too much about sumo beforehand and while the show didn't make me an expert or anything it did open my eyes to how thrilling it can be. Going along with Odachi on all their bouts was incredibly thrilling. The whole team and managers and their whole support network were awesome. All congregating for their love of sumo or just support of Ushio which turned police into love of sumo. Reina's words at the end summed it up. This is love. Love for Ushio's sumo. A spirit that can make you even see the best in yourself somehow. Truly a beautiful message.Small negatives I have are again it feels kinda tropey at the beginning and the animation looks really bad in a fair amount of spots. But overall it wasn't horrible and the bouts themselves you can tell they poured it on. Cause every single sumo match looked amped up. But the way the show too builds upon those early moments is really well done. Bringing it all back through Yuma and Ozeki and Ushio and how they've changed since then and built that sumo club to the best in Japan.Loved following this show for these past month's and while I know a second season isn't gonna happen I greatly enjoyed my time with Ushio and everyone at Odachi.8/10. being kind of like that too. didn't really know too much about sumo beforehand and while the show didn't make me an expert or anything it did open my eyes to how thrilling it can be.

I\'m not sure how popular the sport is in Japan, but at least in the West it\'s not so popular.

He ends up entering a school where sumo is not something of great relevance (what a surprise), he gets the gym to train after beating the boss of the delinquents who sees the juice as a way to start over (what a surprise). Speaking objectively, the anime is not bad, but...unfortunately it had much more potential, the struggles that were most exciting were the protagonist, and their companions were static scenes that sometimes tried to apply some emotion.

I’m honestly surprised at how little attention it’s gotten because I think it’s a glossed over treasure.It feels like a breath of fresh air as it actually added some new things, sure there are some the troupes you can’t escape but the unique touches are enough to set it apart! I’m a HUGE shounen anime fan so for me it already had a lot that I...liked. I just randomly checked it out on a whim and found myself hooked 10 minutes in! And why? Cause of the main character, Ushio. Even his first few lines drew me in! He definitely has the similar shounen troupe of a huge aspiration to achieve but he’s actually really likable I find. His insane determination and a surprisingly charismatic side make him an MC I actually care about and I wanna see what he does next. Like I really wanna see if this short dude can become a Yokozuna!The side characters are great too, all the different types of fighters and personalities add the usual fun roster of friends. They aren’t as strong and distinct as Ushio but they’re a nice compliment. They give the right amount of backstory to keep you interested, while it’s nothing out of the normal troupes, it’s still portrayed well so you aren’t bored.The plot is pretty straight forward and doesn’t do much that’s different but the characters pull enough weight that you don’t you even notice. You just wanna see what’s gonna happen next! The biggest thrill is watching these characters fight!!! The way the fight scenes are animated kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. Another thing that's enjoyable is how informative it is about sumo wrestling! I never would have had the slightest interest in it before but I found myself looking up things about it out of curiosity.The sound is amazinggggggg. The opening and ending songs are just to die for! I love when the music is top notch and distinct it’s usually a good sign the anime is going in a good direction, in my opinion. But both songs get watched in their entirety. Every. Time.The English dub is pretty good, better than the Japanese even! It’s the typically good Funimation voice work but, as it seems I just can’t get enough of Ushio, I really like the person they chose (Ricco Fajardo) for him, it’s a real good fit.So this lil gem is a good one in my book! I think everyone should give it a shot.

Most sports anime will have a common theme so they tend to be redundant but Hinomaruzumou is the first anime (that I know of) dealing with sumo as the theme.I guess you could say the only thing Hinomaruzumou has in common with other sports anime is that the main lead, Hinomaru, wants to be the best and is aiming for the top.The art might not be super attractive to some but...don't let that fool you from the actual plot. I wasn't expecting much when I started watching it, because honestly, I thought it was going to be boring because it was about sumo, but I was sucked in immediately after only a few minutes.The character designs aren't flawless but they are likable. I like the easy camaraderie they all have with each other.To anyone who is on the fence about watching Hinomaruzumou, I'd say it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. don't let that fool you from the actual plot.

This show is phenomenal at getting you hyped up.The first opening is intense, in visuals, and especially with the song.

I must assume that it's because its an anime about Sumo, and not a more popular sport like Baseball or Basketball, that this anime has been pushed to the background, but it is absolutely fantastic and a must watch for fans of sports animes.The premise is familiar to anyone who likes underdog sport stories.  An undersized, underdog wills his way through overwhelming challenges as he strives to gain strength and become the best.  In this regard, Hinomaruzumou doesn't do anything different.  It's the same story as Kuroko's Basketball or Hajime No Ippo.  And...while the animation quality lags behind those two, it's just as good as they are.  In fact, Hinomaruzumou has pretty much the same intensity as Hajime No Ippo does.  The fights are very intense and dramatic.The characters are great as well.  My personal favorite character wasn't even Ushio, the MC, it was Chihiro.  But, there were a number of good characters in the anime, and with the exception of Chihiro, all of them were underdogs trying to overcome the odds.  It really made you get behind the entire team.There wasn't really much fault to find in this anime, other than the subpar animation style.  It wasn't terrible, but you could tell this was a lower budget animation.  In spite of that, the action was well done, and the twists and turns in each match made them all fun to watch.  The chemistry between the cast was great, and surprisingly, the anime even managed to get me a little misty eyed at times.  Good drama, good comedy, good action.I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who loves sports tournament type animes.

It\'s based off of a Kawada manga and the anime was handled by Gonzo. Gonzo has worked on some spectacular anime like Chrno Crusade and Bakuretsu Tenshi. They\'ve also done really mediocre stuff like Strike Witches & Trinity Blood and some absolute rubbish like Sunabouzu. So, predicting their quality isn\'t exactly plausible. Let\'s just dive in and see how they did with this one.Story:We open with our protagonist, Little Mac, going to scout a school with a strong sumo team. He accidentally takes a wrong turn and ends up at a school where the Sumo...club is made up of one, dedicated guy. Naturally, he ends up going to this school with an under dog team. As he\'s very short, his one hope of entering professional sumo is to do well enough in High School Sumo to be able to bypass the physical exam. Don\'t ask me if that\'s an actual thing in Sumo wrestling as I don\'t know.The biggest issue with this series is that it follows every trite, over-used Sports media cliché. If you\'ve seen literally any other work about an underdog sports team, you can easily predict the arc the story\'s going to follow and, in at least 90% of cases, predict who\'s going to win each bout. No twists, turns or originality.The writer is also a bit weird about the way he talks up sports. He clearly has a thing for Sumo wrestling, but even when it comes to the characters who used to be Judo and Wrestling champions, he spends a bunch of time hammering in the idea that their performance in Sumo is not reflective of whether wrestling or judo is a stronger discipline. Like he\'s deathly afraid that his audience will think they know his position from how the characters do in a sumo match. I mean, obviously Judo is stronger. Even ignoring the fake wrestling with the personas, Olympic wrestling is basically just muscular guys having foreplay. Which shouldn\'t be a surprise, since it comes from ancient Greece.Honestly, the best part of the series are the thirty second, comedic bits you get at the end of the episodes, after the ending theme tune.Characters:Having compelling, complex characters could make up for\xa0 predictable, generic plot. Unfortunately, this series doesn\'t have those either. The characters are really bland. You have the highly driven, and skilled one who drives the team forward. The one with a lot of potential and passion but a huge losing streak. The former delinquent turning their life around. The athletic one who\'s new to the particular sport. The one who\'s in over his head but doing his best. And we can\'t forget the one who loves the game, but shouldn\'t play it for physical reasons but irresponsibly does it any way.Art:The artwork looks fine. The details are pretty well done. The characters have decent designs. The bouts are a bit mixed. A lot of the ""special moves"" are pretty boring. The character will shout out that they\'re doing a hundred demon take down, or something and you\'ll get a still image of the character doing it or you\'ll see the other character counter the move by firmly planting their feet. You\'d think a series that\'s a love letter to sumo could make sumo look more interesting.Sound:The actors do well enough. I can\'t really fault Abe Atsushi. Kumagai Kentarou, Satou Takuya or any of the other actors on their performances. However, you can\'t really call it great acting to be able to portray characters this generic competently. I actually really like the Fire Ground theme tune, but the rest of the music is just kind of... meh.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any, really. Maybe if the characters had developed relationships, it would be different. But they don\'t.Areas of Improvement:The element of surprise is your friend. Just have some moments where you defy expectations. They make things more interesting than if you can predict everything that\'s going to happen really early on.Develop the characters. Having generic characters that develop into something distinct and more complex is fine. Having generic characters that follow completely typical arcs is just boring.Take yourself less seriously. The best parts of this anime are the short, comedic scenes after the ending theme tunes. And a big part of that just comes down to the comedy being less bland than the typical story and characters.

Now i watch sumo full time!The show takes a group of strangers and transforms them into a sumo team to be rivaled. The show depicts a healthy amount of hard work, technic breakdown, and...also failure. These three aspects for me really make a great anime sports show great, you are not just watching a OP character take on everyone but actually show you what a leader looks like, what the techniques are in the sumo world, and how to work as a team to achieve greatness in any field, and most importantly how to deal with failure.I am very happy to have watched this show because it did introduce me in to IRL world of sumo, and because i was able to take away some important lessons I learned in the show.Great show and will be watching again for sure! also failure.

Black Jack 21,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2214/Black_Jack_21,"[""The sequel of Black Jack series, the story focuses mainly on Black Jack's real identity &amp; happenings beyond his mother's death. I really love the series because..... Well, just watch it! The story is superb! "", ""I guess my professional bias shows when the medical aspect of the show that bothers me most is the fact that researchers kept seeing viruses under a light microscope, and that these viruses were the same size as--or larger than--red blood cells. Maybe the term that was translated as &quot;virus&quot; can be used for multiple micro-organisms, because the B.O.P. looks more like an ameoboid or other eukaryotic organism, but that is neither here nor there. It's Black Jack, for fuck's sake; while it is more accurate than most medical dramas out there, it's still anime.Nit-picking aside, I'm a sucker for medical dramas, and I have...this long-standing affair with Dr. Black Jack. I was afraid post-Tezuka's death the franchise would start to suck, but this show proved that BJ has not lost his edge, no pun intended. Though I can't help giggling every time somebody calls him &quot;B.J.&quot; with a thick Japanese accent. You keep using that word; I do not think it means what you think it means. But I digress.This is one hell of a fun show. The pacing is tight, the action is good, and the characters are clear without being overbearing. There are equal parts action and science and character development. It is nice to see Black Jack's past further clarified, though I have to wonder what Tezuka would have thought of the way the writers dealt with his accident and his childhood. I, for one, enjoyed it, but I am not the original creator. The storyline is more linear and integrated than the original manga, but the overall effect is not in the least jarring. One could view it as a very long movie or story within Black Jack's saga.

I was afraid post-Tezuka's death the franchise would start to suck, but this show proved that BJ has not lost his edge, no pun intended. Though I can't help giggling every time somebody calls him &quot;B.J.&quot; with a thick Japanese accent. You keep using that word; I do not think it means what you think it means. But I digress.This is one hell of a fun show. The pacing is tight, the action is good, and the characters are clear without being overbearing. There are equal parts action and science and character development. It is nice to see Black Jack's past further clarified, though I have to wonder what Tezuka would have thought of the way the writers dealt with his accident and his childhood. I, for one, enjoyed it, but I am not the original creator. The storyline is more linear and integrated than the original manga, but the overall effect is not in the least jarring. One could view it as a very long movie or story within Black Jack's saga.

So Black Jack-21 is a delightful sequel to the serious medical drama that I adored so much. For older viewers like me, as a personal perference;Black Jack TV series kinda makes too 'lightly' and rather than focusing on the fragile but painstaking surgeries, they were focused more on character back stories. Since it wasn't written by Tezuka, I assume this was just the writer's interpretation. Not that it's a bad spin-off, but to my relief; Black Jack 21 returned with a deeper emphasis on the wise and misunderstood...doctor with a stronger 'action-paced' and smooth well-made animation as expected. doctor with a stronger 'action-paced' and smooth well-made animation as expected."", 'Story 7/10The story follows Black Jack and his fellow assistant Pinoco trying to uncover what the Noir project is and why he was caught in a bomb accident that killed his mother.Art 9/10Same art style from the first Black Jack TV show. Nothing much to say here, except pretty much the same opinion. The art style is great, just to me, I felt like the noses were weirdly drawn and that the background didn\'t really match some of the frames/drawings.Sound 10/10Black Jack 21 has one opening and two endings: Destiny -Taiyou no Hana- by Hitomi Shimatani (opening); careless breath by EXILE, Silence whispers by TRF....The opening and endings match perfectly the tone of the whole series. Don\'t have much to say here.Character 8/10So, they still don\'t focus much on the patients, but they focused on other doctors that Black Jack has encountered in the past (like ""Black Queen""). They improved a bit their character development but the series still focuses on Black Jack. I wished they focused on the patients, but that didn\'t really improve here.Enjoyment 7/10Black Jack 21 is a good watch, but I really prefer the previous TV show.

Anyhow, I\'ll keep this short.So instead of having episodic enjoyment, this time around we have a 1 very long ""side-story"". In another words one sub-plot that runs the whole series, whilst as well of course Black Jack cures people. But I found the sub-blot / focus quite boring. Wasn\'t as enjoyable as the episodic galore the 2004 series had.✦Art&SoundSame as series, not much to comment. Good but nothing special or bad. Only complaint I would have, kid...smiles became oddly creepy.OST&Music was for most part quite okay/good. Did although absolutely love the opening song.✦Enjoyment&OverallFor most part I enjoyed it as 2004 series, but this prolonged  sub-story this season had, was a quite factor to makes this series enjoy less. Plus that story wasn\'t anything special nor that enjoyable, basically boring type of conspiracy with an adventure of Black Jacks past/family. smiles became oddly creepy.OST&Music was for most part quite okay/good.

It was a really bittersweet end to the Dragon Ball Z Kai series and wrapped it up nicely making way for the Final Chapters :D definitely a must-watch for those who want to bring clarification for what happens when Future Trunks goes back to his timeline..but *spoiler alert for the episode*it goes exactly the way you think it went xD...I scored this a 9 simply because I wasn't expecting the series to give us a whole episode dedicated to Future Trunks saving his world in his time and I'm really glad we got to see the series wrap up so nicely! Not going to lie it made my kokoro race to see Future Trunks finally bring an end to the Androids and all the pain and suffering he, Bulma and the people of Earth went through. Of course it's still so saddening to think that he really has lost everyone and there's no one left for him but his mom, but as the main theme for this episode is to highlight the way everyone rebuilds themselves and their lives after all the destruction, both in Future Trunks timeline and in our main timeline, it gives hope for the future and at the very least now we know that all of our heroes are truly happy I scored this a 9 simply because I wasn't expecting the series to give us a whole episode dedicated to Future Trunks saving his world in his time and I'm really glad we got to see the series wrap up so nicely!

There is overall not much to say on that I really enjoyed this and the fact that they included the Other World Tournament arc while creating confusion on what is considered ""canon"" in Dragon Ball was a nice piece of fan service...since that arc was one of DBZ\'s more memorable filler arcs would\'ve been nice if they showed Frieza, Cell and the gang getting beat up since it did a good job at selling Pikkon as a memorable character but the fact they did this at all was cool enough on it\'s own.Not much to say that it was a solid ending just wish it actually was the ending. since that arc was one of DBZ\'s more memorable filler arcs would\'ve been nice if they showed Frieza, Cell and the gang getting beat up since it did a good job at selling Pikkon as a memorable character but the fact they did this at all was cool enough on it\'s own.Not much to say that it was a solid ending just wish it actually was the ending.']"

When the topic has come to this? I am talking about what Abe no Seimei said to the Black King. There was no need for such a speech. I was watching this series as a seinen but a shounen-like scene appeared out of nowhere.

The most captivating part the show was Tsumugi. Her adorableness pretty much drove the show, but it could only drive it so far. For me it was two episodes. By episode 3 she lost her flair and by episode 4, the show started to get boring. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy shows with cutesy appeal but for a cutesy show to be good, it needs...to be coupled with something else like a good story or comedy. The story is quite repetitive and eventually gets boring. Every episode, the characters decide to cook something, then they cook it. The End. As for comedy, their is nothing in this show that made me laugh.So, should you watch Sweetness and Lightning? Well, I think you should try it. People obviously like it. I don't know if the high rating are just the initial hype or if there is something about this show that I'm not seeing. If it is the latter, then I don't want to take the enjoyment away from you, but know that there is a chance you will not like this show, like me. to be coupled with something else like a good story or comedy.

We gouge down, smacking our lips, lapping up the remaining sticky stains that pepper our face, slurping the sweet syrup that coats our fingertips, savoring every last drop like sweet-tooth bandits. But after a while, that sugary delight leads to an unwelcome stomach ache, where we\'re left bloated and forced to endure the rightfully earned scorn of our parents:""I told you not to eat all those sweets at once!""Their words a guilty sentence we don\'t even bother fighting against, as they march us off to the restroom to...brush away the very thought of potential cavities taking refuge between the crevices of our underdeveloped molars. It\'s the right of passage for us kids, for us mischievous sweet-tooth bandits. And if not for the proper guidance by our parents to keep us in line, we\'d more than likely be sporting a smile with teeth weathered by decay.Sweets are good, but overindulging in them tend to lead to this inevitable end result. And as you\'ve undoubtedly figured out what\'s being alluded to by now, Sweetness and Lightning suffers a similar fate. A show that barrages you with all the cuteness that the namesake would imply—and on that end, it certainly delivers—but doesn\'t offer enough levity to let any of it settle in. It\'s all dessert without dinner, every child\'s wildest dream in theory, but in practice, a very tiresome endeavor that turns sweet-tooths rotten and palates too soaked to ask for more. Sweetness and Lightning shares in our delight for all things sugar-laced, but unlike the reprimanding we received as kids growing up, when this show overindulges, there aren\'t any parents around to scold it. And for an anime that centers around parenting, this becomes an issue that even the smile of a bubbly little girl couldn\'t dissuade you from taking notice of.There really isn\'t much here to talk about, despite what the premise would have you believe: a man left to cope with the pain of losing a loved one while also raising a daughter, taking on all the motherly duties that he had once taken for granted. And during this adjustment period of serving both parental roles in his daughter\'s life, Sweetness used food as a catalyst to catalog his parental growth, as well as a common means for the father and daughter to become closer. With a premise that could serve multifaceted purposes—parental bonding and culinary infotainment—Sweetness and Lightning was practically gift wrapped for the creators. It wouldn\'t have had to do much in order to foster a lighthearted show with sobering life lessons sprinkled throughout it. Just simply display the culinary aspect as a vehicle to showcase the parental bonding; it\'s almost foolproof. And yet, even with this hand-delivered premise placed right in their laps, very little of it went beyond the occasional reminder of a motherless household and dishes reminiscent of a happier time in the father and daughter\'s life. Parenting was placed on the back-burner for food montages, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing if that\'s all you came looking for, but when you take into consideration what ingredients the anime had at its disposal, the decision to divert from that path felt like an act of complacency than any intentional artistic statement.But there\'s also something else that the show\'s setup alluded to. Something that isn\'t as important as the themes it skipped over but still a desirable promise nonetheless. And that promise was a cute mascot. And boy, did this anime ever deliver! Tsumugi is, with little dispute, one of the most adorable kid characters to have been conceived in the 2010s since the likes of Naru from Barakamon. She\'s cuteness that transcends regulatory standards. Cuteness that bursts past the stratosphere. Cuteness that almost hurts. Tsumugi is cuteness incarnate. And dear I say it, the sole reason for this show\'s existence. Without Tsumugi, there wouldn\'t be a Sweetness and Lightning worth discussing. Which, quite frankly, became a double-edged sword if you were watching the show for any other reason beyond its flagship character. Because when it comes to everything else that this anime attempted to offer, the act of slouching in disinterest became far too common of a practice.As far as the rest of the cast goes, there\'s really no other character worth mentioning beside Tsumugi. Everyone else was simply introduced to feed off her energy. To say she\'s the star attraction would be an understatement. The very foundation of this show\'s existences is made impossible without her inclusion. She\'s the poster-child of Sweetness and Lightning. The very thing people will remember the show for long after they forget the events of the show itself. It\'s the kind of character whose reputation would outlast the source material it\'s attached to. She\'s the Yuno Gasai, the Haruhi Suzumiya, the Holo, the Major Kusanagi; the very legacy that the source material will leave behind.This isn\'t to say that the cooked meals and other characters introduced weren\'t interesting, just that in the backdrop of a show that\'s taking things slow and steady, all its efforts are lost in translation to the little girl twerking on the floor, practicing her cooking dance charms to make the food delicious. And when you pair that eccentric personality with that of an unkempt, mild-mannered man who\'s constantly lost behind the bushy top hairdo and frame of his glasses, whose only defining trait is being soft-spoken... well, what you ended up getting was a recipe for amnesia-inducing content.If I was placed on the spot to recall the events of any given episode, the best I could come up with would be: ""They cooked food, Tsumugi was being cute, they ate, and went back home.""

In the absence of World Masterpiece Theater\'s praiseworthy depiction of children, the ""moe"" boom of the early 2000s had created a paradigm shift that brought with it this current dilemma.

Sometimes I don't want to watch the fate of the world be decided by three gigantic robots in an hour-long mega battle to the death, or see a bunch of high-school age kids beating the (physical or mental) shit out of each other in some competition to stay in their uber-competitive school....(That being said, if you're looking for action, you're in the wrong place. Sorry.) Sometimes I want to watch a (cute) single dad despair over how to get his (cute) daughter to eat green peppers.Story: 10/10Definitely one of the elements I love most about this anime. In my opinion, it's emotionally engaging, though a little slow at times- but in my opinion, that pace adds to its charm.  It's basically what it says in the description, so I won't draw it out for you- one thing I will say is that when I started watching, I was worried it was gonna turn into a teacher/student romantic relationship, but that's not the case at all. (Actually, the dad deals with the whole 'contact w a female student in his personal time outside of school' thing very appropriately.) (Conversely, if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, you're probably out of luck.)Art: 9/10Definitely no complaints. Art is beautiful, realistic, and fits the tone of the story- plus, all the characters are cute.Sound: 9/10Same as the art- fits the overall tone of the anime, well-selected.Characters: 10/10Probably the biggest strength of the anime, imo. The characters and their relationships and motivations are- wait for it- believable and easy to care about. I know. Crazy, huh.Plus, there aren't too many side characters introduced- i think the cast is mostly three mains and a handful of sides, which makes it easy to follow and focuses enough on the mains to really flesh out their characters. None of that 'well, these ten are the mcs, and these thirty are the side characters, and those other twenty pop up sometimes just for fun and to confuse the shit out of you.'Overall: 9.5-10/10I think the only thing holding me back from giving Amaama To Inazuma a full 10/10 rating is that the pacing can be a little slow sometimes- as of now, it's been four episodes, and one of the (i assume) mcs shown in the opening hasn't been introduced yet- but I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something sweet, low-conflict, and heartwarming.

Well, Amaama comes with a lot of heart, with a concept that’s not only realistic but also relatable perhaps, as it’s about a dad struggling to care for his daughter after the mother passed away because reasons. The dad does his best, but his job makes him busy all the time, and the daughter is just a sweet little girl who does sweet little girl things like watch dumb magical girl shows, say weird things that make no sense, and hate eating vegetables. The dad, Kouhei, is a good and caring parent for the most part, but has one severe flaw, which is being unable to cook, so this show is about fixing that. But Amaama also has an optimistic view on this scenario, as Tsumugi, the daughter, will be sick of eating something and not finish a meal, but still play it off as being full because she understands that she doesn’t have any other options.This is not a fierce melodrama. After watching the first episode, I had to consider that the show could’ve become intensely emotional very easy, but it also looked like it was just gonna be a happy little slice-of-life cooking anime with a parenting theme behind it, with only small amounts of drama sprinkled throughout. It’s the latter… and I’m okay with that, because the basics of the show are shown so beautifully in the first episode, which was what I believe to be the best pilot episode of the season. The small details in the personalities of Kouhei, Tsumugi, and Kotori, the things that are shown instead of told (such as the leftover meal thing I mentioned), all with a very charming presentation by TMS Entertainment.The show does get pretty repetitive, I’ll give it that. The show does get pretty repetitive, I’ll give it that. I’ll give it that. And I do kinda wish there was a little more drama between Kouhei and Tsumugi to compensate for that, but personally I didn’t mind the repetition because I watched it weekly on Crunchyroll™, your #1 source for anime and drama, now teaming up with Funimation™ to bring you more than ever!! So, having just a small dose of this heavy cuteness each week made it very tame for me. It never got old, and I looked forward to it each new week, though when the episode ended I didn’t feel the insane need for the next episode. Even now that it’s over… eh. I’m alright with that. If they make another season, that’s cool. If they don’t, it was fun.But back to repetitiveness as an issue. It is still an issue, a little bit, and I still think that more of the character drama would be nice, because that’s probably what I liked most out of the show. Episode 7 was particularly outstanding because it had a big conflict, with the cooking aspect of the show not having much of a prevalence as it usually does. But usually, the episode will have something going on with Tsumugi, whether it’s an event at school or she just generally wants something, and the rest of the episode will be about making a meal out of whatever can tie into that. Since it’s a slice of life, there’s no story progression to be had, so it’s something that needs good characters in order to keep me coming back....and it totally does. I think everyone would love to have a daughter like Tsumugi; even me, the 20-year-old deadbeat who wants to drop kick every child that runs around his workplace. I work at 2AM, WHERE DO THEY KEEP COMING FROM?! PUT YOUR FUCKING KIDS TO SLEEP!! FOREVER!!!!!!*ahem*That said, Tsumugi is very idealized because this show needs to be pleasant to watch. While she’s adorable and playful and excitable and kind (OR I GUESS YOU COULD SAY… SWEET!!! AHHAAHAHAHAHA), her only flaws are generally the same flaws a normal little kid would have. She get mad and cries over really petty things, like someone making the retarded assumption that she stole someone’s Play-Doh. That kid was an asshole. Fuck that kid. No pedo tho. She doesn’t like eating vegetables, and sometimes she’ll get inappropriately mad in public. I guess I don’t need to mention that she’s five years old, or somewhere around that age. Still, for the sake of fun, I don’t mind that she’s not entirely realistic.Kouhei, on the other hand, is much more realistic, being a dad who struggles a bit to care for his daughter without his wife. Watching him try really hard and act optimistically was really endearing to watch, and the basics of his character make him easy to root for. Each episode has a good payoff when he finishes cooking and the characters eat and react to it positively. And Kouhei stays humble, he’s not an over-the-top character who bursts with excitement whenever something good happens. It’s just a normal, but very genuine happiness. Tsumugi’s the one who should be exaggerated.Kotori is more of a third wheel in terms of development, as her role is to basically support Kouhei and Tsumugi with their cooking, and just generally be the best waifu of the season. (If any of you fucking say Rem I will shove your fucking head into a trash compactor where your shit waifus belong.) It’s still great to watch her, ‘cuz she’s like an emotional weirdo who really really really wants dat sensei D or something, and so she gets worked up over whatever dilemma either Kouhei or Tsumugi have. She’s basically a replacement mother here.I also wanna bring up Yagi, even though he’s a very minor character who only shows up in about half the episodes. But it was always great to see him because he’s more mature and very deadpan. Since Amaama just oozes with love and peppiness and excitement, it’s nice to have a character that kinda balances everything out without taking away from the mood. He’s still a nice guy and goes along with whatever’s happening around him, he just presents a much more different mood. He’s also followed around by Shinobu for some reason, making them fun to watch as some weird couple.With all of the light-heartedness of Amaama to Inazuma, TMS Entertainment compliments it with a softer color palette and consistently good animation; at no point did I think it was particularly outstanding, but it still features some well-timed sakuga with some character reactions and cooking. The overall design of the backgrounds and characters are about average, but also as good as you could want them to be. However, Tsumugi in particular has the best hair of 2016. There’s no contest to this, and if there is, you can shut it down right now because everyone has been absolutely blown the fuck out. I highly respect anyone with curly hair, especially if that hair is basically the size of their entire body. She’ll put that hair into twin-tails a lot of the time, which is especially cute, moe, kawaii, and other synonyms. Tsumugi’s entire design, especially with her childish expressions, just scream moe for the entire world to hear.The sound is equally exceptional, being very soft and gentle with few instruments being used, and it’s implemented quite well. For instance, in the first episode, Kouhei and Tsumugi run through an alley, and it’s a rather intense scene for this show, but only an acoustic guitar is playing, and it sets the rather sad mood perfectly. The OP, honestly, isn’t my kind of thing to listen to, though I didn’t skip it much. It’s just another peppy, happy song that anyone could expect to hear in a sweet slice-of-life such as this. I like the ED, though, it sounds touching, hopeful, and slightly emotional, and the stylish illustrations to visualize it made for a beautiful cap on every episode.The voice acting is pretty solid as well, with great performances all-around in the main cast. Tsumugi is especially great because she was actually voiced by a child, something that isn’t done enough. Granted, Rina Endou is a few years older, but she still sounded completely real. Tsumugi actually sounds like a goddamn child, and that’s fantastic.Overall, I really loved Sweetness and Lightning and didn’t mind its few flaws. At its worst, it was a repetitive moe slice-of-life Shokugeki no Soma that was still fun in its own right, and at its best it was a phenomenal character story with some moments so sweet that you could rot out all of Willy Wonka’s teeth. ...oh wait, Gene Wilder died. Shit.I most certainly would recommend this to anyone in the mood for a slice-of-life that they would only watch in small doses instead of binging in one day, and anyone who wants an anime with a parenting theme. Though I also wouldn’t recommend it if you’re looking for drama, because this doesn’t exactly have enough of it, even if it is good.But I can’t end this review without leaving a very important message…………… Watch out for sharks!!Story - 8Art - 8Sound - 8Character - 9Enjoyment - 9Sweetness - PROTECT TSUMUGIOverall - 8.25/10 (Range: 6-8.5)Favorite episodes - 1, 7, 12Favorite character - KotoriRecommendation level - High so incredibly sweet!” Yeah, that’s fucking great, but why?

Amaama no Inazuma (Sweetness and Lightning) is your answer. Taking the sweetness of slice of life and mix it with cooking accessories is just the tip of the iceberg. Believe me, this is a show that’s more than about food. It packs a satisfying and emotional ride that’s just too sweet to pass up.Adapted from the manga of the same name, the series is essentially a slice of life story of daily adventures. I should mention though, the story is pretty...simple and straightforward. We got three main characters. There’s Inuzuka Kouhei, a widowed math teacher who is struggling to support his daughter and home. There’s Tsugumi, the overly charming kid with a picky taste at times. And finally, we got Iida Katori, a shy and lonely girl with a big appetite but bad cooking skills. So by formulaic standards, you might anticipate the food in the series to look atrocious. However, the show takes these characters and puts them into everyday life situations that brings the best out them. (and the food of course!)It doesn’t really take long to get settled with the show. The first few episodes easily showcases the pattern of the story. Every episode in some way or form depicts the main characters cooking something delicious. However, there are also other segments that connects the characters’ daily issues. For instance, Katori is lonely and often feels like she doesn’t belong with others. However, her connection with Kouhei and Tsugumi brings out a more cheerful side of her. Meanwhile, Kouhei is also able to support Tsugumi better when the three of them work on making delicious food together. Tsugumi is also one of the most interesting characters. Being a kid, she lacks common sense at times like kids do. However, she also brings other characters together with her charming personality. From home to school, there’s something that’s hard to ignore about her. Whether it’s her adorable smile, curiosity, or innocence, Tsugumi is someone that you can’t help but want to make friends with. Her relationship with Kouhei is also very realistic with a strong daughter/father connection. Furthermore, Katori acts as a big sister to her. In one particular episode, she shows a very protective side after certain misunderstandings.Despite the main cast getting most of the screen time, side characters such as Kouhei’s friend Yagi and Katori’s classmate Shinobu also occasionally joins in to spice up the story. Characterization is a strong emphasis and this show never falls short from that. The downside is that some of these side characters will be overshadowed by the main cast. However, this isn’t really a big issue as they still bring in the fun to the show especially when it comes to cooking.So yes, after reading up to this point, you may be wondering if the show is worth the investment. After all, watching almost the same thing happen every episode may get repetitive. However, I can assure that not every episode follows a generic cooking session. Even in a small world that the how takes place in, there’s plenty to explore when it comes to the story. Tsugumi’s school life, Kouhei’s daily challenges, and character relationships are just a few to name. Furthermore, the comedy of the show is genuinely refreshing. And while the series lacks extravagant food styles like Shokugeki no Souma or Toriko, it makes it up for its strong realism. The author’s attempts at constructing the story by mixing in realistic drama, food gags, and character relationships really brings out the best of the series. As a manga reader, I am also satisfied with the adaptation despite some trending and rearrangement of the chapters.TMS Entertainment may not be a powerhouse studio. However, they definitely got the understanding to make this series look great. The visual quality is colorful and character designs are realistic to portray characters of all ages. Tsugumi is especially noticeable for her innocence and childish features. Even her clothes symbolizes youth and appeals to younger audience. I also have to give praise for the food creativity in the show. From gyoza, seafood, donuts, etc, there’s all sorts of food you’ll witness. Plus, the way they make the food is in great detail every episode to leave nothing out.You may not realize it too much but the soundtrack and music has a strong appeal in the show too. The OP and ED theme songs are charmingly decorative with a catchy tone. The atmospheric OST brings out a good degree of realism ranging from cooking sessions to simple conversations. However, what I really praise is the character voice mannerism in particular Tsugumi. Believe it or not, she is actually voice by a child as well. The talent Rina Endou brings into her character really stands out as she steps into the shoes of Tsugumi.Amaama to Inzauma is a charming SOL family adventure that’s simply memorable. Every episode brings something new to the table that goes far beyond just food. Character relationships is something that I think most will find realistic between a child and their parent. Rather than relying on flashy food shenanigans, the show brings the story to life with its credible realism. I can’t say this enough but the show itself will almost always leave you hungry. In fact, the series experiments with more than just making the food. It shows how characters get together to build strong friendship and unity to accomplish a goal.

In the grieving wake of the unexpected you cling to whatever is comforting, dreading beginning the next day without them. I have a friend who lost her fiancé to a car accident a few years back, and although I couldn\'t empathize appropriately, I provided the support that I could for the disaster that rocked her world. She was left to take care of her then three year daughter and pick up the pieces along the way. In light of the...initial struggle, life stumbles on and we learn that we can be happy again, even after something as devastating as this. When I heard about Amaama to Inazuma\'s story, I instantly felt a sinking in my stomach. It reminded me so much of her situation and I knew i had to watch it.I want to take a minute to reset the somber tone I probably just created. While Amaama to Inazuma has its share of sad moments, this is a very endearing anime. The writers do a decent job of attaching us to the character\'s internal struggles through the medium of cooking. An added bonus is how much I personally enjoy the art of food... something I feel gets less serious attention in anime than it deserves. The average person will spend over four entire years of their lives cooking and eating, so it\'s only natural that it can be used to convey and heal our many issues in life. The relatively small cast bonds quite well over the course of the show and creates an enjoyable, episodic approach to everyday problems like socializing, raising children and managing loss.The plot of Amaama is simple. A widower (Kouhei) taking care of his daughter is motivated to start cooking better when she questions why she never has a home cooked meal. This motivation, coupled with the use of one of his student\'s family restaurants helps Kouhei grow in both his cooking skills and relationship with his own daughter. That\'s pretty much it. This is not an anime you go into expecting a riveting or revolutionary story, or even a super engaging episode structure. It\'s best described as ""charming"", and you stay for the lighthearted atmosphere and Tsumugi\'s cute and cheeky personality. It\'s nothing to write home about, but its positivity and focus on food is what kept it afloat for me.I was delighted by Tsumugi\'s adorable demeanor in the first few episodes. She reminded me a lot of Naru from Barakamon or Rin from Usagi Drop, and embodied the actions of a six year old girl perfectly. She isn\'t written to be more mature than her age, and responds appropriately to the various situations she\'s placed in throughout the series. This is something I\'ve noticed anime directors having problems with in the past. She\'s naturally innocent, and even throws tantrums from time to time... something I would truly expect from a six year old. Turns out she also doesn\'t care for green peppers. Yep, sounds like a typical six year old.However, as Tsumugi\'s charm began to fade (around episode 5 or so), the series began to trip over itself and become boring. The episodes began to become soothing and I actually found myself dozing off in the expanded cooking segments. Don\'t get me wrong, I love food and these segments were quite technically accurate, but it just didn\'t translate well into entertainment value. I actually thought I had watched the same episode a few times in a row due to their repetitive nature. I eventually found I enjoyed the non-cooking snippets more as the series went on, because they allowed the writers to focus on the relationship between Kouhei and Tsumugi more. It was for this reason I realized why shows like Usagi Drop are superior to Amaama to Inazuma. It\'s all about focus. While relationships were the focal point of the former, the cooking centered approach from the latter just didn\'t satisfy as much.Aside from a few internal monologues and flashbacks, Kouhei is a rather bland protagonist. I guess it\'s only fitting, as Kotori\'s friend Shinobu pointed him out as ""plain"" near the beginning of the series. I feel Tsumugi\'s importance completely overshadowed him, and it would\'ve been nice to get some development here as well. His relationship with Kotori was just as strange. I might be wrong in this assumption, but is it normal for a single, male teacher to be texting one of his high school students every day? There were even subtle instances of Kotori appearing to have feelings for him (which apparently are furthered in the manga). Subtle, but still there.  A rather unnecessary addition to the show, and one I\'m still confused about. Maybe I\'m just overthinking it, since Amaama is otherwise as innocent a show as you\'ll ever watch. Zero fan service, and zero cursing. A nice change of pace for sure.I didn\'t care for the rest of the cast in Amaama either. Kotori had a constant blush emblazoned on her cheeks, a testament to her nervous demeanor. She just didn\'t work as a character for me, but her strife was understood in regards to her parent\'s divorce and social anxiety. It\'s honestly more of a preference issue than actual character development. I\'d actually argue that she receives the most out of any character in the show. Yagi and Shinobu are both rather one-dimensional characters that exist to propel the series forward. Both add slight comedic value, but ultimately aren\'t that important.As I mentioned previously, the characters look to correct both their internal struggles and awful cooking skills by focusing on food. The writers absolutely nailed this aspect of the show. I only learned to properly cook a few years ago, and every bad tendency I had when I initially started was explored here. Overcooking meals, screwing up recipes and the like were handled well, and the actual dish preparations were quite accurate. It really made me hungry at times. The scene with Kouhei filleting the fresh caught fish was a great example of Japanese culture, since they basically devoured the fish raw O_o  At any rate, I wish the same amount of effort would\'ve been spent on other aspects of the series as well.Since it is 2016, I would hesitate to call the art in Amaama ""good"". It\'s relatively below average compared to most of the shows being released today. Even though the scenes are mostly still and not animation heavy, there were still instances of lazily drawn character models from time to time. I did appreciate the amount of life drawn into Tsumugi\'s character, and the artists did a great job adapting from the manga. The OP was a real toe-tapper, with an upbeat, cute melody that welcomed you to the show. The ED also fit nicely with the tone of the series, with the rest of the background music emphasizing the current scene appropriately. Nothing flashy or over composed here. Tsumugi\'s VA (Rina Endou) ironically voiced the overly shy Hina from Barakamon and excelled in Amaama as well. I like to see younger characters actually voiced by kids.If you love food as much as I do, then Amaama to Izuma is an anime you cannot miss based on premise alone. Throw in an endearing girl rivaling only Naru from Barakamon in terms of cuteness and you\'ve got a casual, feel-good show that engages your heart more and your mind less. It\'s definitely got its share of issues, but it makes for a great time passer, an anime best enjoyed occasionally. I\'d recommend it to fans of Usagi Drop and Barakamon, or someone looking for something lighthearted to cheer them up. I did enjoy Amaama to Inazuma, but it isn\'t my favorite of the season.

When I heard about Amaama to Inazuma\'s story, I instantly felt a sinking in my stomach. It reminded me so much of her situation and I knew i had to watch it.I want to take a minute to reset the somber tone I probably just created. While Amaama to Inazuma has its share of sad moments, this is a very endearing anime. The writers do a decent job of attaching us to the character\'s internal struggles through the medium of cooking.

There is a health risk if you attempt to watch this show. You may end up being diagnosed as diabetic because the anime is an overabundance of sweetness, cuteness and anything else imaginable. I never knew child-raising could be this fascinating.This is a slice of life show that revolves around single parent Inuzuka Kouhei trying to provide better cooked meals for his pre-school daughter Tsumugi, who is bristling with energy. The doting parent is capable of cooking basic meals for her but his day job of being a high school teacher prevents him from making actual progression on his culinary skills. In an act...of last resort, he stumbles across a restaurant that is owned by the family of Iida Kotori who luckily attends the same school where he works at.As an act of consideration, she agrees to offering her knowledge to the inexperience Kouhei, allowing him to make meals with her guidance. There is a major catch though, funnily enough she can’t handle sharp knives which limits her involvement in the preparation process. Despite this handicap she is still very resourceful mainly due to the fact that her mother is a cooking celebrity.The concept of just making delicious meals may sound boring initially but after going from cooking plain white rice to exotic meals that require expert precision, it has left a very good impression on me. This gives me encouragement to be a better cook myself as it’s fairly common not knowing how to cook, when we have instant takeaways and such to contribute to our overall laziness. The enjoyment that Kouhei and Kotori gets being able to feed his daughter with nourishing meals fills him with delight and gives him a sense of pride. The whole premise is based on the fact that Kouhei’s wife who was well-equipped a cook, sadly passes away for some unexplained reason.The tragic loss of his wife who meant everything to him has made him realise the importance of having a family to care for. He acknowledges that Tsumugi would be orphaned if he were to meet the same fate as his spouse. This has affected his mental state to the point that he is a former shell of himself where he was brimming with passion in the household. The same can be said for his daughter, who is constantly reminded of her mother through the cooking made by the duo which reflects the sort of meals she once previously had. I cannot begin to imagine the torment she has to endure after he mother’s death, as one so young can’t fully understand the complex process until they’ve matured to a certain point in their life.The characters are the best part of the show as they are all relatable in some way or another. The single father is the one we can empathise with as death being a natural process is inevitable. The fact that he has to put up a front towards his daughter suggests that he really hasn’t gotten over it and is hurting deep down. Tsumugi as the innocent kid is the one where I can project my past self into, partly due to being in similar situations that she has encountered. She doesn’t have the privilege of two parents but that isn’t stopping her from enjoying her everyday life.Kotori is a strange one for me personally, the fact she developed some weird phobia of not using knives is bizarre. I don’t care if she got a horrific cut on her hand, she needs to bite the bullet and move on. Apart from that, I have no problems with her as she is a gentle and affable individual. Yagi Yuusuke who is a close friend of Kouhei, make several appearances where he is primarily known to be taking care of Tsumugi in his stead due to work commitments. The man comes off as being devoid of personality but is actually known to be very fond for Tsumugi which sees him being affectionate the majority of time. Kojika Shinobu is the best friend of Kotori and for me is just your ordinary and regular girl who isn’t outstanding in any way and also seems to enjoy being in the presence of the cute Tsumugi.The art in this show is not the best out there but the designs for each character are solid to say the least, giving an emphasis to the simplicity which is the most important factor. The design for Tsumugi might be a little over exaggerated but to be fair she is the focal point of the show, no need to make her look like the other generic kids in the pre-school. The show does not need excessive pretty visuals but effectively uses what is has to convey its message. The animation is nothing extraordinary with is being passable, I certainly wouldn’t be too concerned about this aspect if I were you.The sound is far better than what the art had to offer. The voice actors in this show have some real pedigree except for Tsumugi who is actually voiced by a kid! The shark song was something I played endlessly as it was done perfectly. That would be too strange for an adult portraying as a kid, so good move there by the production committee. The soundtrack is composed by Toda Nobuko who has only worked for another show called One Week friends. The tracks can change from a pleasant to a somewhat melancholy mood immediately. The one track played during the actual cooking always gets to me with its upbeat atmosphere.This show is well worth watching for as a basic SOL with its good characters that are very much relatable. The interactions between them is well handled with nothing being too forced or unnecessary. The comedy is great but can be easily forgotten once the depressing stuff comes along which is very impactful. You really won’t be disappointed with this as long as your expectations aren’t astronomical.

Okay, bad jokes over with, now on to the review.Amaama to Inazuma, or Sweetness and Lightning (hence the bad joke prior), is a fairly relaxed slice of life that found itself debuting in a season where many other shows stole the limelight. Premiering alongside extremely popular shows like Re:Zero and Food wars, this cute show didn't get that attention it truly deserved. However this did not stop the show from shining in the eyes of many of it's viewers. I for one, absolutely...loved this show, but more on that in the Enjoyment sectionStory.As it goes for most slices of life anime, story isn't a huge part of the show, so I will do my best to review the setting and progression in general. The story itself isn't anything spectacular; A Father loses his wife to illness(?) and finds himself having a hard time taking care of both his work and his daughter at the same time. One day, the father Inuzuka Kouhei and his daughter Tsumugi find another person struggling to find connection with others, Iida Kotori. Kouhei discovers that a fun way he can relate to Tsumugi is through the creation and eating of cooking, something his late wife was in charge of instead. The show itself covers the little adventures and happenings of the groups lives, and the different meals they create, as well as the happy times they experience together.Overall, each episode is fairly standalone, but the way the stories each week are presented feels very realistic. Many of the things that happen seem like things that would actually be happening in a young childs life, such as Tsumugi's constant range of emotions, even to her interactions with her classmates and family/friends. Amaama's portrayal of life for a young child feels very real, and this is something that anime as a medium of art, oftentimes runs into trouble approaching.One more thing worth touching on is the lack of real conclusion of the show. The final episode really just feels like every other episode, and lacks any real finality to it. Personally I find this to be a perfectly fine approach to a more relaxed slice of life show, as it leaves the ending very open, with the possibility of more seasons, as this show could definitely go for longer (provided the budget, ofcourse).Art.In terms of Art, the show wasn't anything spectacular, but still was very clean. In terms of cooking anime, such as the ever famous Food Wars, it's animation is not nearly as flashy, but instead reflects the much more mellow mood of the show. The art is by no means poor. In fact, I thought it was one of the better looking shows of the season (that I watched of course).In terms of character design, and setting, the characters aren't extravagant, and the settings aren't diverse and interesting, but they instead reflect the feel of normality and realism that the show conveys. Apart from Tsumugi and her voluptuous hair, the show itself displays itself very plainly, but still is rather pretty in it's own light.Sound.Sound tends to be a strange topic to approach as it encompasses a lot of pieces. I will break it down into two major chunks, those being Voice Actingand Music.For voice acting, I was very impressed. Amaama is one of the first shows I've seen cast an actual child (Rina Endou who is 10 as I'm typing this) to play the main role, and she did brilliantly. Tsumugi's voice was absolutely adorable, and displayed a wide range of emotions, which would prove very difficult for a young voice actress, so I do commend Rina Endou for her great work in this show. Other voice actors performed competently as well. Nakamura Yuuichi did a splendid job as Inuzuka Kouhei, and really felt at home in the role of a worried father. One of the most impactful scenes of the show, when Inuzuka sensei is looking for Tsumugi after she had left the house while he was sick, involved Nakamura shouting in a voice that conveyed true dispair and worry, and left many audience members impressed.As for music, the music was fairly consistent. The opening song is quite good and cute, and all of Tsumugi's self composed songs were extremely entertaining (my favorite being the no Clump song and dance).Character.In terms of characters, I found the show fairly strong. Many slice of life shows don't put a lot of focus on character development, but I felt that Amaama did a good job at it. Tsumugi's character was immensely enjoyable and fun to watch, whether it be her silly normal self, or how she dealt with complicated emotions for a child, she remained extremely fun and enjoyable to watch throughout the whole show. Inuzuka Kouhei wasn't a terribly unique character, but he and Tsumugi both developed strongly throughout the show as their bond grew stronger and stronger. Inuzuka sensei's fairly relaxed and worrying nature reflected that of a father who truly was doing his best to give Tsumugi everything he could, despite being a widower, and allowed for his character to be very relatable and understandable.Kotori was developed fairly well over the series as well, as she is a character who is struggling with loneliness due to her Mother's constant absence due to work. However, as she begins to interact with the Inuzuka family as well as the other minor characters, she begins to gain a better understanding of how to interact with people, and how her mother feels. Throughout the series she had a hard time dealing with her Mother's absence, but by the final episode, she has realized that her mother is doing her best, and finally gets to experience a meal with her and the new friends she's found.As for the other characters, which are Yagi and Shinobu, they weren't developed very much but still had defined characters which led to interesting interactions with the other characters.Enjoyment.I enjoyed this show immensely. As an anime viewer, I tend to be more serious and critical, which is reflected in my average rating statistics, but I found myself with a constant smile watching this. By no means am I a smiley person, but the sheer cuteness this show had astounded me. Tsumugi is one of the funniest and cutest characters I've seen in an anime, and I enjoyed her wacky adventures through life and food. The loving interactions of a father and his daughter are portrayed well and are extremely heartwarming to watch.Overall.Overall, a very fun and enjoyable anime to watch. Of course it has it's issues as every show does, but it is simply one of the most enjoyable slice of life shows I've watched. If you haven't watched it, try the first episode, because you'll fall for the show faster than you'd think.If you'd like to further discuss anything, or have any questions, you are always free to add or message me.

Throughout the series she had a hard time dealing with her Mother's absence, but by the final episode, she has realized that her mother is doing her best, and finally gets to experience a meal with her and the new friends she's found.As for the other characters, which are Yagi and Shinobu, they weren't developed very much but still had defined characters which led to interesting interactions with the other characters.Enjoyment.I enjoyed this show immensely. As an anime viewer, I tend to be more serious and critical, which is reflected in my average rating statistics, but I found myself with a constant smile watching this. By no means am I a smiley person, but the sheer cuteness this show had astounded me. Tsumugi is one of the funniest and cutest characters I've seen in an anime, and I enjoyed her wacky adventures through life and food. The loving interactions of a father and his daughter are portrayed well and are extremely heartwarming to watch.Overall.Overall, a very fun and enjoyable anime to watch. Of course it has it's issues as every show does, but it is simply one of the most enjoyable slice of life shows I've watched. If you haven't watched it, try the first episode, because you'll fall for the show faster than you'd think.If you'd like to further discuss anything, or have any questions, you are always free to add or message me. Thanks for reading the review guys and gals."", ""The bliss of cooking and eating good food. The highs and lows of assuming both parental positions when raising a child. The anxiety of finding yourself alone and lost. Just to name a few things that this show brings to the viewer, it’s been evident that Amaama to Inazuma is Summer 2016’s slice-of-life darling thanks to its heartwarming premise.The story focuses on Inuzuka Kouhei and his daughter Tsumugi who have been living quite the unhealthy convenience store-based lifestyle. He has no prior experience to cooking because it’s his wife who recently passed away that usually cooks the meals. Here comes Kotori, who they found while...walking in the park and is coincidentally a student in Kouhei’s class. Usually reserved yet enthusiastic, she is always alone at home due to the fact that her parents are divorced and her mom is always busy with work which means she always eats by herself. Her sudden appearance revitalizes the joy of cooking in the Inuzuka household by dedicating each episode of the series into a cooking show format that still gives the essence of a slice-of-life story about family.I’ll be honest to say that the first two or so episodes never failed to leave me teary-eyed. The show just does a great job on being down-to-earth. It gives out daily situations and how they fit into the life of the father-daughter duo with a sense of melancholy to it. Let’s not forgot about Kotori either, the same applies with her and how she shares a common point with them produces quite the interesting synergy. I like the fact that Kouhei acts like a convincing father who can get angry when necessary, can get stressed with the overwhelming workload, and yet shows a very sincere concern and dedication to everything he does. Tsumugi upholds all the characteristics a typical young girl would have. Energetic, easily upset, adventurous, she is at the center of what makes this show exude with energy that just melts the heart. Other characters that add a bit of spice into the mix include the serious yet responsible Yagi who is Kouhei's high school friend, and also the cheerful and friendly Shinobu who is Kotori’s close friend. With more people on the table, the atmosphere ever grows vibrant and welcoming to the viewer.I have a soft spot for child-raising stories and also have interest in plots that revolve around food. However, the main weakness the show has is trying to find a balance between the two. Sure, they are both what makes the show appealing but focusing on one aspect for too long gives less room for the other. For example, there are episodes that have some good potential story progression regarding how each of the characters cope up with internal struggles but the growing tension gets diminished by shifting the mood to a lighthearted cooking activity. While I do see that cooking is sort of a coping mechanism for the cast, I feel like they could have cut back on the minutes dedicated to it. There are a lot of procedures in each meal they create that could have been excluded with only the highlights of the recipe shown. Also, not every problem can be simply solved through cooking which make the problems that could provide better character development look superficial. There is also the issue of the absence of mother figures in both the life of Kotori (although not literal) and the Inuzukas. The subject is often touched occasionally but never really got to be explored further which is a shame because I think it is a good thing plot-wise. The issue of divorce and how it affects Kotori’s mindset towards the idea of family could have been a nice issue to be tackled with. It is implied that the Inuzukas are already past the stage of grieving but it’d be nice if the show did something like coming up with the terms of loss, healing oneself through finding joy in moments shared with friends around you.In the long run, Amaama to Inazuma is still a nice slice-of-life show recommended to anyone who wants something heartwarming and cute with the twist of going through gastronomic adventures by the episode. Story-wise it’s not the most fulfilling one out there due to half of its content dedicated to cooking but it definitely rewards the viewer with visually appealing food, the chemistry of the cast, and its humble approach towards family. walking in the park and is coincidentally a student in Kouhei’s class.

And of course, it had to leave out a fair bit to make it even that far.The art work and the voice acting make this a very special anime. The art in the manga was great, but after watching the anime, I feel like the manga was a bit minimalist. The extra detail, and of course the color, make the anime a really special experience. And the voice actors were incredible. Every single VA was perfect. It was as if I had known the characters and...their voices for years. Every actor recreated their character perfectly, and never have I heard such believable child characters.However, I strongly recommend reading the manga first. The original story includes some flashbacks, some travel episodes, and several epilogues or postscripts to wrap up important subplots. The story is obviously very incomplete at the end of the anime. It might be possible to make it all the way through the next 12 years of the story if it gets another season. But the only way to get the whole story is going to be reading the manga.

The series mixes around some light humor and drama with exploring the everyday challenges that Kohei has with raising his daughter as a widowed father and establishing their current relationship with Kotori for the three to get together to learn to prepare meals.What makes the premise for this series work is that it strikes a balance of both being relateable to audiences thanks to Kohei and Tsumugi's domestic...situation, and the cooking component making for an immersive component thanks to the work and satisfaction that goes into cooking and eating them. With the mundane feel of the series, Sweetness and Lightning has Tsumugi believably behave for a child her age (and voiced by a child seiyuu as well) and undergo many of the typical quirks someone of her age would have such as amazement of experiencing new things. hating to eat certain vegetables, and raising tantrums if something doesn't go her way. It also believably explores the joys and challenges that Kohei can have with raising her on his own where he can lose his composure if Tsumugi misbehaves or does anything to concern him, and both of them also show signs of coping from the loss of Kohei's wife through enjoying the meals that they prepare with Kotori.The cooking component of the series makes for the very heart of the series. While the premise would seem like a dull one due to the slice-of-life genre it is part of, the series offers enough focus on the developments of our trio of characters in cooking meals throughout the span of the series. Compare Kohei's skills with food preparation at the start of the series as a complete novice to how well he can manage by the end of it with the subtle improvements he has made in learning to cook.

By episode 12, it had stolen my heart completely.Sweetness and Lightning features a single dad, Inuzaka Kouhei, trying very much to provide for his young daughter, Tsumugi, who doesn\'t completely understand that mama is gone but tries every day to live without her. Does that grab your heart? Good. That\'s exactly what it should do, because that\'s human. Inuzaka-san tries to provide for his daughter, but his meals are frozen and reheated, and don\'t meet the Japanese standard of handmade bento - he barely knows how to handle a microwave, let alone a...stove and a kitchen knife. Tsumugi doesn\'t *mind*, but her father longs to do better for her. Now, in the United States, and across Japan, that\'s just life. Single parents try really hard, and don\'t always succeed.But we get the wonderful Iida Kotori, who offers up her family\'s restaurant as a wholesome place to try all sorts of recipes. Kotori is afraid of knives - she has a bandage on one of her fingers for the entire series - but she consults her famous mother for recipes that will make Tsumugi happy. Kotori is more afraid of knives than Inuzaka-san, by a lot, but together they build a partnership to provide Tsumugi with handmade, wholesome meals in a safe, gentle, empowering environment.The show becomes, primarily, about how Tsumugi bonds with her father in the wake of her mother\'s death with the help of Kotori. Kotori\'s best friend Shinobu, and Inuzaka-san\'s chef best friend Yagi, become important characters, but they very deliberately withdraw so the father-high school girl-daughter groupings can slice, dice, and cook together. At one point, Shinobu points out Tsumugi, Inuzaka-san, and Kotori and says, roughly, ""This is a treasure we need to protect,"" and they do for the rest of the series, very deliberately giving tasks to them and taking care of the grunt work when the father-daughter pair need a break. Even Yagi, who is rough around the edges but is extremely skilled in the kitchen, backs off so Tsumugi can explore the wonders of food.Tsumugi is written and delivered as a little girl who loves food, loves her daddy, loves shoujo anime, and misses her mommy so much that it hurts. Her voice actor, Endou Rina, at only 11-12 years of age channeled the wonder, imagination, fears, love, and *tantrums* of a young child. Yes, she has adorably cute moments - the sharky-sharky-shark song is part of anime lore. But she wasn\'t always cute - some commentators hate this - Tsumugi flies off the handle sometimes for what seems like the stupidest thing.That\'s actually one of the strengths of the series and of Endou Rina as Tsumugi. Tsumugi is an irrational little girl. A boy keeps teasing Tsumugi, and the anime makes clear that it\'s not okay and that he is punished for it by his attentive mother, but it also shows that they get along - sometimes. Her best friend hurts her feelings really badly. She cries about things that adults can handle and that adults are really confused about until they think about what she\'s feeling, at her age level. Her daddy speaks sharply to her (in a Japanese context; the subtitles don\'t really convey it all the time), and they both regret it. She breaks out into tears because of something that doesn\'t make sense to her, her dad, or anyone until they have a chance to talk about it. That\'s exactly how life was for me with my little sister after my mom died. My dad and I helped raise my little sister, with very much the same challenges - I saw those first difficult years replicated again and again in this series, including the eventual healing and the creation of new family and love structures in the wake of loss. The authenticity of Amaama to Inazuma won me over pretty early - broken families look for a place to center themselves and find a new equilibrium, and that\'s exactly what they did in this series.If you\'re looking for a 1/1 adaptation from the manga, note that the romance subplot is completely excised - and I agree with it in the context of this 12-episode series. Kotori is completely focused on helping to strengthen the relationship between Inuzaka-sensei and Tsumugi in this series, and if you want to ship people you\'ll have to look to the manga. Sweetness and Lightning is entirely about a family attracting a community that defends the bonding of father, daughter, and high school culinary expert against all odds, and it\'s beautiful.

The premise at best are following the trend of food anime but with the unique slice of life moe twist to it and even though LA didn\'t have any intentions of watching this anime, LA\'s friend got interested so LA did to..............also because...of Saori Hayami. What?.....In terms of characters we actually have a rather unique set of characters, the widow father Kouhei Inuzuka voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura and his daughter Tsumugi who acts like what an actual kids sounds and acts like as well as Kotori Iida voiced by Saori Hayami the main crux of this anime trying to teach Kouhei how to cook food for Tsumugi and really even though Tsumugi is the more real-like kid, LA just couldn\'t get enough of Kotori in the series and probably the main reason why LA liked this anime soo much, it was most probably due to Saori Hayami\'s vocals...""probably""...There are other things from Amaama to Inazuma other than the cooking however such as typical messages of family but some more daring ones later on such as Tsumugi going off in her own to help his dad that later gets more complicated to hell, in cooking terms...an adult\'s taste isn\'t obvious the same as a little kids. Amaama to Inazuma is still subtle it how it approaches it and still tries to focus more on the food than the more serious and ""unneeded drama"" it pulls. It\'s a slice of life cooking show with all the moe to go around...what do you expect when seeing a character like Tsumugi in an anime like this?. Amaama to Inazuma\'s themes is giving off the obvious eating food with your family or just people you know makes the food taste better, it later focuses more on family themes.There was however one worry LA always had when watching this anime and no it wasn\'t the serious drama or it being ""too moe"", LA was more or less worried that Kotori would somewhat ""replace"" Kouhei\'s wife (a sorta of mother surrogate) due to the nature of what this anime does and that will lead it as a far too controversial topic (teacher x student issue), thankfully, LA\'s worry was dispelled by the end of the anime and it NEVER went there...touched upon but more on the loss of the mother than trying to replace her.In terms of animation by TMS Entertainment, the character designs are pretty decent for the most part and although the backgrounding work is the mostly the same houses of Tsumugi\'s kindergarten to Kouhei\'s house  to Kotori\'s most of the time, the backgrounding like the character designs are decent, now the food animation instead the same quality as say Shokugeki no Souma\'s as it\'s more of homemade food than the gourmet side that Shokugeki no Souma gives us, but nonetheless the food animation is also pretty decent and like Shokugeki no Souma, the ""technical feature"" of making the food is pretty excellent in that regard.In terms of voice acting, well it was solid throughout and even though LA\'s reasoning as to why LA watched the anime was for Saori Hayami (and she is LA\'s favourite seiyuu in this anime), props too easily goes to Rina Endou who voiced Tsumugi for this, Kouhei\'s voice actor Yuuichi Nakamura at best was good but better during the more rare dramatic moments but he was great in voicing a dad character. The rest of the minor voice actors are decent at best with some highlights with Shinbou Kojika voiced by Haruka Tomatsu as well as Kotori\'s mother Megumi Iida voiced by the ever eccentric Satomi Arai.The ending if anything brings in the same format of most of the episodes given with Kouhei and Tsumugi having a squabble of some sorts, they go to Kotori\'s house to cook food that Tsumugi wanted (be it one they found in a restaurant or Tsumugi\'s kindergarten and wants to make one done by Kotori and Kouhei) and they resolve their problem with some parental guidance. It\'s the same typical fair and that isn\'t a bad thing as it is what Amaama to Inazuma does. LA was satisfied by the ending no less.Amaama to Inazuma has a nice concept with some homemade food and some adorable characters to add into the mix and people might find Amaama to Inazuma a bit repetitive and ""moe"" with food in the mix, heck Koufuku Graffiti even fits into this bill, but Amaama to Inazuma still has that appeal from it\'s characters to the whole point of the anime is for a parent who couldn\'t cook, learn how to cook for his daughter and Amaama to Inazuma deals with the problem of parental problems every parent deals with which helps solidifies this anime as a pretty good sit. of Saori Hayami.

The rest of the minor voice actors are decent at best with some highlights with Shinbou Kojika voiced by Haruka Tomatsu as well as Kotori\'s mother Megumi Iida voiced by the ever eccentric Satomi Arai.The ending if anything brings in the same format of most of the episodes given with Kouhei and Tsumugi having a squabble of some sorts, they go to Kotori\'s house to cook food that Tsumugi wanted (be it one they found in a restaurant or Tsumugi\'s kindergarten and wants to make one done by Kotori and Kouhei) and they resolve their problem with some parental guidance. It\'s the same typical fair and that isn\'t a bad thing as it is what Amaama to Inazuma does. LA was satisfied by the ending no less.Amaama to Inazuma has a nice concept with some homemade food and some adorable characters to add into the mix and people might find Amaama to Inazuma a bit repetitive and ""moe"" with food in the mix, heck Koufuku Graffiti even fits into this bill, but Amaama to Inazuma still has that appeal from it\'s characters to the whole point of the anime is for a parent who couldn\'t cook, learn how to cook for his daughter and Amaama to Inazuma deals with the problem of parental problems every parent deals with which helps solidifies this anime as a pretty good sit.', ""Every episode of Amaama to Inazuma is atomically engineered to melt your heart. Two of the three main characters, obviously the father and daughter, really got me whenever they interacted with each other.The world revolves around Tsumugi because she is everything good in the world and needs to be cherished and protected at all costs. However overwhelmingly adorable, Tsumugi's character was flawless because of her flaws. Not to be written off as a perfect child, Tsumugi can also be a brat at times, allowing the viewer to relate and develop a stronger connection with her.Kohei is seemingly the perfect dad for almost the...same reason. At every opportunity, he pours his heart into caring for Tsumugi in the most perfect ways possible. His daughter is his first, second, and third priority in life and that in itself fills my mouth with cavities by how sweet it is. Of course, when Tsumugi is acting like a daughter, Kohei has to act as the father. Admitting that his delivery at times can be wrong, it's visible to the viewer that his struggle of finding the balance between scolding and spoiling to be entirely real.Of course, Iida is a great character in her own right, but even as I consider her a main character, she still takes a seat in the sidecar as Tsumugi and Kohei steal the show with their father-daughter relationship.Although, overall and objectively I give the anime a 9/10, I have to personally add a +1 modifier for how much I had to physically react while watching this. It was extremely heartwarming and cute. I absolutely adore the opening. The supporting characters were great as well. The art was very standard, but what made it good was the very real expressions with the bouncy animations. And who can stand by and not make a remark on how good food looks in anime? same reason.

And who can stand by and not make a remark on how good food looks in anime?"", ""Ammaama to InazumaStory:We start off with my biggest critique point of the show, which is the story. It begins with Kouhei Inuzuka. He is a teacher and lost a couple of months before the story started his wife, with which he had a pre-school daughter Tsumugi. Since his wife took care of most of Tsumugi's needs Kouhei is rather lost and doesn't know how to take care of a child. This starts at rather basic things like cooking. So one day Inuzuka takes Tsumugi out to the park where they met Kotori Iida one of Kouheis students. After a few events Kotori gives the two...of them Kotori invites the two of them to come to her mothers restaurant. However when they arrive there Kotori is the only one there since her mom is quite the busy person. Since her mother isn't their Kotori wants to cook, but isn't as good as her mother. Still Sensei and Tsumugi are satisfied and Kouhei asks Kotori, if he could learn how t cook from her. She agrees and with being said, we have the setup for the plot.After this point the story goes on in an episodic fashion. Something with Tsumugi happens at the start of the of the episode. Some episodes couple this with a bit of drama and then they cook afterwards.While I don't mind episodic shows in general, the repetitiveness of the show really started to bore me at some point. They never changed the formula at the start and a huge part of the show was focused around the cooking.This is in my eyes a double-edged sword. On one hand the food making process was definitely nice to see and also the realism they brought to it was nice. Another positive aspect of this was that they steadily increased the complexity of the dishes, which made it feel like there was a certain amount of growth in Kouhei's abilities. On the other hand the part where they cooked took always around half the episode which did not allow for more complex settings.What I also missed was a clear red line in terms of development besides the cooking. Most of the development was done in early episodes and so the characters became a bit stale later on in theshow. Especially Kouhei could have had a lot more emotional development over the course of the show.Characters:This is one of the stronger points of the show. They did an excellent job at the start to make most of the characters relatable. They also had a lot of nice development in the first 3-4 Episodes to make the viewer grow attached to them. Also a strong point of the show is that they did not expand the cast to ridiculous numbers, but kept it to the minimum of the 3 main characters and 2 reappearing characters which were the best friends of Kotori and Kouhei.With the 3 main characters we first of have Tsumugi which serves as the cute doll character. Believe  me when I say she fits this role perfectly. At some points she is on a diabetes Type-II level of cute which is really good. Besides that, most of the episodes revolve around her and the things that she does or likes, for example stuff that happens at pre-school or vegetables she does not like. Overall Tsumugi is the main driving force of this show and Kouhei and Kotori play around her for the most part. Besides her cuteness she has the basic childish traits, but also has quite the dominant personality for a child. She is also outgoing and tries to help with the cooking and other things as best as she can. What I also wanted to mention is that her seiyuu did a good job in voicing her for a 11 year old.Kouhei, her father, is a more timid person in comparison. The loss of his wife really did affect him quite hard. So even after some time has passed, he still thinks a lot about her and what she would do in certain situations. His timid personality gives also the impression that he never wants to burden anyone. The biggest part that the death of his wife affect for him was however that he now needs to take care of Tsumugi and manage his job as a teacher at the same time. That is the reason why he is at first overwhelmed by the tasks at hand. However since he really cares a lot about the well being of Tsumugi he tries his hardest to manage everything and fill in the spot of his wife.Kotori is one of Kouheis students at school and her mom has a small restaurant, but due to her mother being famous she rarly is in the restaurant and more on her TV show. That is the reason why Kotori is most of the time alone at home or in the restaurant and there are no customers. When she meets the Inuzukas for the first time she is really happy, because of their company and gladly accepts Kouheis question of learning to cook from her. This is because of the two she does not need to stay alone anymore when her mom is gone. From all the characters I liked her the most in the show, because of her kind and caring nature, besides that she was also quite funny. That includes her beeing scared of knives to the point of not even touching them.Sound/Art/Animation:The visuals are mediocre at best, there were some inconsistencies here and there. Also the locations was most of the time the restaurant so you had no impressive places to see and no stellar artwork. The character models were also generic. Compared to the visuals the Soundtrack was much better. Most of the OST was fitting and improved the scenes it was used in. If we look at the Opening and Ending I have to admit I liked the Ending more than the Opening. Sure the Opening was upbeat, catchy and colorful however, for me personally I liked the calmer approach of the Ending a lot more.Overall Enjoyment/Conclusion:With everything said now I did enjoy this show for most parts. The cooking parts looked realistic and the characters were likeable so it wasn't bad. However since this show is not the first of its kind I need to compare it to others. The first two shows that come to mind are obviously Usagi Drop and Barakamon. Compared to those two Amaama to Inazuma has a lot of issues, especially with the pacing. It becomes very repetitive after around the 5th Episode and every following episode seems interchangeable. So for me its like that. If you want to see an entertaining show you watch Barakamon, if you want a show with more character growth you watch Usagi Drop and if you have seen those two already you can watch this show. So Amaama to Inazuma is in the end not a waste of time, but also nothing special. of them Kotori invites the two of them to come to her mothers restaurant.

My review will be based on the fact that this is meant for older men and not for teenagers who are wanting action, fan service, or romance. Once you get through the fact that none of these will be present during the show, you might understand why I am so confused to the comparison of the two shows.TLDR : This isn't Food Wars. Stop comparing the two.STORY : 8I cannot say that the story is the best, but...however, it is realistic in the sense that people do take some time to move on from major events and not everyone can easily let go of memories of others. This story is very heartwarming as it shows the slow progress of going through grief and dealing with the fact that an important role in the family is now permanently gone and shows the better side of being a single parent. The story is very realistic and is actually similar to something I am currently dealing with now, so this has struck home to me.ART : 8Same thing with the story, it's not the best, but it certainly catches my attention and sometimes boggles my mind. You just have to appreciate that the father never got his daughter a haircut.... >_>Sound : 7I am not a avid listener, but it is somewhat appealing to hear some music and the sounds of cooking, even when it's a slow simmer. Nothing too special here.Characters : 9These characters have their own personality and each seem like a realistic character pulled from someone's memory. Each one has their own goals and their own burden. I am not too sure how to explain each character, since I am at a loss of words, but each one is lovable in their own way. Romance isn't shown between the characters since there is a huge age difference and things would cause problems at school. This I feel is extremely realistic sinceI deal with this at schools myself.Enjoyment : 10Need I to explain how realistic the kids are? The students too. I wish my classrooms were a bit like these students, but I can't have it all.... can I?Overall : 8This anime is worth watching for the fun of seeing a special bond being made and having great memories being made from simple everyday actions that we do. We seriously do take the simplest things for granted. It makes you think about what things you have everyday, and what if that just disappeared. Making memories using cooking is probably the best way to show a family bond, in my opinion, and it was done extremely well. This wouldn't win a award, but it certainly will always be in my memories. however, it is realistic in the sense that people do take some time to move on from major events and not everyone can easily let go of memories of others.

Watch it if you\'re getting tired of the serious and gritty (or... the waifu wars, the moe-moe-kyun~ stuff, anything really) anim00.Story, it\'s sweet just like everyone said. But, if you look closely it\'s pretty engaging. If you see ONLY ""Tsumugi"" (the little kid), it\'ll be just like reading ""Yotsubato!"": cute, funny, and light-hearted. If you see the whole big picture, it\'s basically about a dad trying to make the kid happy after some accident that leads to the mom\'s dead and...at the same time a high school girl trying to cook. It\'s fun tho, it\'s hella fun.Art, nothing to appraise, it\'s pretty chill, generic (duh), but it gets the jobs done. Really nice with the mood of the whole anime.Sound, nothing special.

Eating with family while sharing stories over home cooked meals and cooking together are among some of the memories that can be made over the simple idea of food.  So, what happens when you take the fiery passion of cooking and the sweet gentleness of cooking at home with family?  Well, you get Amaama to Inazuma, or Sweetness and Lightning, a simple show about the recipe of family.Story: Inuzuka Kousei is a single dad with a 5 year old daughter named Tsumugi.  Due...to health complications, Kousei is left to raise his daughter on his own after the death of his wife.  Being unable to cook, Kousei is forced to give Tsumugi frozen and already prepared meals in order to feed her.  After going to a cherry blossom viewing, the father and daughter duo meet a girl consuming an entire 3 layer bento by herself underneath a sakura tress (And yes, that is a lot of food) named Iida Kotori.  She gives them a business card saying that her family owns a restaurant, and after a set of events, sparking a healthy friendship between the two families over food.Sweetness and Lightning follows a very simple recipe for every episode.  It first starts with a setup that sets up the day for our characters before going into a cooking segment with our three main characters before they all enjoy the meal together, sometimes with friends.  While formulaic and simple, each passing episode is a lesson involving parenthood, bonds, and the joy of being with kids, friends, and other loved ones.There really isn't much to say for the story of Amaama to Inazuma.  The story is so simplistic that only two paragraphs can really sum it up.  The only downside I can even see for this series is the fact that the show is so formulaic that if you're going into this expecting something different episode to episode aside from maybe a different recipe, than you're looking in the wrong place.Overview:+ Nice simple story with a good messageCharacters: The characters in any slice of life series are what generally make or break a series.  No matter how lackluster the story may be, without good characters, the show will inevitably fall flat on its face.First, we have the main draw of the show, Inuzuka Tsumugi.  The 5 year old is the kind of character you would expect of a little kid of that age.  She's an excitable, imaginative little girl who can turn from really adorable with her antics to downright annoying with her tantrums and fussiness.  (Yep, just like a real child.)  The majority of the series is devoted to Tsumugi and her constant wonder into the world of food.  The joy on her face is what drives the show to delve deeper and deeper into the family moral that's so ingrained in this series that it makes you forget that she's like any other small child who fusses when things don't go her way.Then there's her father, Inuzuka Kousei.  As the sole remaining parent of Tsumugi, Kousei's intentions and growth in the series comes with his devotion and love for his daughter.  Like any other caring parent, Kousei's motivation in the series is to better his relationship with his daughter and provide her with all of the love and care that she needs, especially now that it's only him and he needs to act both as the mother and father.  Over the course of the series, Kousei grows along with his daughter and ends up creating this really nice father/daughter dynamic that only deepens with every passing episode.Finally, we have the last of our trio of main characters, Iida Kotori.  Now, first off, Kotori LOVES food.  Like...really loves food.  An enthusiastic foodie, Kotori also suffers from mild depression since her mom is always out doing her work, leaving her to eat by herself on most days at home.  When our titular father/daughter duo comes in, Kotori comes into the picture and gradually grows alongside the other cast members and becoming in a sense, a member of the family.  She like many characters bond with Tsumugi in a way that can only bring a smile to one's face.Side characters are minimal in number and serve as other members around the dinner table in the second half of the series.  Aside from that, they don't really add much to the series, but they do add that friendly air that is certainly enjoyable to watch, even if they have little characteristics to make them more unique.Overview:+ Enjoyable and heartwarming cast-  Cast members aren't really that deep or too heavily characterizedArt: Produced by TMS entertainment, Amaama to Inazuma has...a pretty average animation style.  Admittedly, there's nothing particularly interesting about this animation style aside from the generally consistency of it.  Though, the food reveal in particular should receive special mention because those scenes specifically seem to have significantly better animation than the rest of the show.Sound:  Similarly, the sound for the series isn't really anything too special.  The OP is addicting and the ED is relaxing, but nothing about them stands out as extremely memorable or notable.Personal Enjoyment: Amaama to Inazuma is a show that I looked forward to every week.  As a fan of slice of life, I couldn't help but smile at the happy moments that these characters were enjoying.  The pleasure of food made my heart melt when watching this series and it was definitely an adorable watch that should get more recognition.Did I enjoy this series?Yes.  Amaama to Inazuma is one of my favorite series from the Summer 2016 season and definitely had me gripped in these touching family affairs that the characters had.  They seemed to genuinely have fun cooking, and while it wasn't any Shokugeki with the kinds of foods that they were presenting, nothing beats a nice home-cooked meal.What didn't I like about this series?Tsumugi's tantrums.  Admittedly, no one likes a child acting up, and there's no escaping the sad fact that adorable children have a dark side to them, so it's not really a flaw on the series at all.Would I recommend this show?If you want a show that's sweet with a bit of a melancholy bitter flavor, than Amaama to Inazuma is the show for you.  The show is formulaic, so expect to be basically seeing the same kind of thing over and over again on an episode to episode basis, but if you can get past that, you're in for a really nice and flavorful ride. to health complications, Kousei is left to raise his daughter on his own after the death of his wife.

An enthusiastic foodie, Kotori also suffers from mild depression since her mom is always out doing her work, leaving her to eat by herself on most days at home.  When our titular father/daughter duo comes in, Kotori comes into the picture and gradually grows alongside the other cast members and becoming in a sense, a member of the family.  She like many characters bond with Tsumugi in a way that can only bring a smile to one's face.Side characters are minimal in number and serve as other members around the dinner table in the second half of the series.  Aside from that, they don't really add much to the series, but they do add that friendly air that is certainly enjoyable to watch, even if they have little characteristics to make them more unique.Overview:+ Enjoyable and heartwarming cast-  Cast members aren't really that deep or too heavily characterizedArt: Produced by TMS entertainment, Amaama to Inazuma has...a pretty average animation style.  Admittedly, there's nothing particularly interesting about this animation style aside from the generally consistency of it.  Though, the food reveal in particular should receive special mention because those scenes specifically seem to have significantly better animation than the rest of the show.Sound:  Similarly, the sound for the series isn't really anything too special.  The OP is addicting and the ED is relaxing, but nothing about them stands out as extremely memorable or notable.Personal Enjoyment: Amaama to Inazuma is a show that I looked forward to every week.  As a fan of slice of life, I couldn't help but smile at the happy moments that these characters were enjoying.  The pleasure of food made my heart melt when watching this series and it was definitely an adorable watch that should get more recognition.Did I enjoy this series?Yes.  Amaama to Inazuma is one of my favorite series from the Summer 2016 season and definitely had me gripped in these touching family affairs that the characters had.  They seemed to genuinely have fun cooking, and while it wasn't any Shokugeki with the kinds of foods that they were presenting, nothing beats a nice home-cooked meal.What didn't I like about this series?Tsumugi's tantrums.  Admittedly, no one likes a child acting up, and there's no escaping the sad fact that adorable children have a dark side to them, so it's not really a flaw on the series at all.Would I recommend this show?If you want a show that's sweet with a bit of a melancholy bitter flavor, than Amaama to Inazuma is the show for you.  The show is formulaic, so expect to be basically seeing the same kind of thing over and over again on an episode to episode basis, but if you can get past that, you're in for a really nice and flavorful ride."", ""Amaama to Inazuma is a basic slice of life, it's cute and fluffy with a few slightly serious tones.The focus on cooking and it's ties to the mother is nice, and it's got a very relaxing feel to it. I also enjoyed learning about different Japanese dishes. It's a very soft-spoken story, nothing flashy happens and there's little progression in terms of plot after the first couple episodes. That said it still manages to be interesting thanks to the characters and the food.There's a discreet evolution in the main characters, Tsumugi is growing up and shows unrealistic but endearing maturity whilst her equally endearing father...slowly adapts to life as a single dad. They're everyday people getting to grips with their situation as their father-daughter relationship blossoms. The supporting roles are good, they're all varied and individual but all kind and likeable.The art doesn't stand out, it's a bit too uninteresting and plain. But the way the cooking is animated it quite well done.Overall I enjoyed it, the ending was good enough but not very pronounced, it didn't feel any different to the middle episode s but that's the way with many slice of life.I would recommend watching it if you're looking for something sweet and relaxing. slowly adapts to life as a single dad.

While most reviews keep mentioning the lack of actual story (and they are right), something about Amaama to Inazuma really hit home.Story;Kouhei, whose wife passed away less than a year ago, is the father to the seriously cute, and shining Tsumugi. Being a teacher and working to provide for himself and his daughter, Kouhei is used to buying pre-made food in order to feed his daughter, having no time or experience in cooking. When he and his daughter come across a small restaurant that happens to belong to the...mother of one of his students, Kotori, he finds out that the place is barely any open as it used to be. Intending to leave, Kotori eventually asks her teacher to stay and help her try to cook. From there on, each episode deals with their amazing adventures of cooking delicious meals.As stated before, each episode is very repetitive with no actual plot to derive the characters. You would normally see the relationship between Kouhei and his daughter at certain situations, but that is all. This could easily get boring, if not for the theme, which I personally connect to.Art;It started out great. Artstyle is casual like most slice-of-life anime. Tsumugi is adorable with a unique design, the teacher is pretty cute, and Kotori looks like the casual school girl. As the anime progresses, the art gets slightly choppy and quite unpleasant to see.Sound;I think it was okay. I didn't really pay much attention to the music in the background, but it was cute and fitting for the moment. Ending song is so pretty, honestly.Character;Character progression and development is easy to happen on the anime and it's done well. Kouhei eventually learns how to cook better for his daughter and himself, Kotori gets over her fear of screwing up good dishes, etc. There isn't much development or personality to expect from this kind of anime. Tsumugi is the heart of the cast and is adorable, anyone is easy to fall in love. Other side-characters appear on 2-3 episodes, and don't contribute much.Enjoyment;I liked this a lot due to personal preference and relating to the subject, but otherwise, it would be very difficult for anyone else to sit through this anime. It can get easily boring, repetitive and nothing special is happening whatsoever. No actual plot, just heartwarming moments -- and that might not be enough for all.Overall;Giving this a 7. I personally really liked Tsumugi and her father, as well as Kotori and her friend. What really captured me was how the majority of their doings, and the reason they would normally gather to cook, was centered around Tsumugi's happiness. Being the small, cheerful girl without a mother that gets excited over delicious food and spending time with her father, it's easy to feel great affection towards her and the other characters, too. Otherwise, this anime is preferred to be watched when you're laying on the sofa and having nothing else to see on TV. mother of one of his students, Kotori, he finds out that the place is barely any open as it used to be.

Now that's not a bad thing, considering this is a teach-you-to-cook show, but at times you want a bit more out of a certain character, and you will be a bit frustrated.The storyline is predictable and formulated. Something happened to Tsumugi, the father decides to cheer her up, they cook, they resolve the plot-of-the-week, they eat,...the end. Very simple formula, but it works, that's what I think important.The spotlight is always on the main characters, namely the cute loli Tsumugi, the father and the girl who may or may not have a crush on her teacher and also the girl who provides the father and daughter a place to cook. The side characters exist, but you don't see them most of the time. By the end of this series, nothing really happened to these characters, aside from the father getting better at cooking (SPOILERS), which is expected. I would even say that aside from the occasional mention of event of this season that you can probably jump to the second season and have no problem watching that (At the time of this writing season 2 hasn't been announced, but you know).Now the art is nowhere impressive, but it's coloured very lightly, and very charmingly, so it's not out of the place, but you might think this could have gotten a better artwork (That's what I think at least).Despite all the negative points, this show is fairly enjoyable. Because of the limited cast numbers, you put a lot of attention on the main characters, and you feel a lot more on them. Especially Tsumugi, since she is what driven the plot and what resolves a plot, basically. Also, watching this in the middle of the night is not a good idea, unless you need to cry.So all in all, I hope you would try out this show, to see if you like it. I know it is lackluster in certain parts, but it is a good show nevertheless. Hopefully you find it interesting enough. the end.

That\'s about it, to be honest.The ""dad raising a cute child"" setting is one that tends to really stick with me. But unfortunately, Amaama to Inazuma couldn\'t deliver a solid experience. Its biggest problem is that it\'s boring. As the series starts, Tsumugi\'s overall cuteness and her personality are good enough that I\'m kept interested for a few episodes. Endou Rina, as young as she is (10 years old!) did a fantastic job at voicing her, and watching her interact with her dad and meeting new characters with the viewer makes for interesting exposition, but apart from a few select extra-cute...scenes, the novelty of it all quickly wears off after the first few episodes.The characters show next to no growth by the time the series ends. Inazuka-sensei showing some improvement at chopping food is the only thing that comes to mind. It\'s mostly episodic, so I don\'t expect specific plot threads or much of an overarching plot, but if the one thing that\'s shared between ever episode (the characters) is next to stagnant, there has to be something else in each episode to keep me watching.That something would most likely be the food. One of the series\' major focuses is cooking. Learning a bit about the recipes is interesting, but every episode\'s cooking segment follows pretty much the same pattern, so they also quickly get quite tiring.

Similar to Usagi drop, this series revolves around a child and a parent living independently. However, it had so much to offer than just familial bonds.What makes this series stand out is its detail to its characters. They're not so special, but that's what makes them so detailed. In a slice-of-life series, it's always important to make the characters as realistic as possible, and this series did just that. An example of this is Tsumugi, who represented what an actual toddler would act like. The animation label did all that they can to make her...seem very much like a 6 year-old. They had a child voice actor, replicated the movements and habits of kids, even the expressions made were very childish. In short, they made the most realistic character without forgetting that it's just an anime.Tsumugi also represented the show itself. As it is called Sweetness and Lightning, we see an adorable side to her and also an energetic and irritating side to balance it out.The title pretty much sums up the whole show, in more ways than one.

Most people have their own general opinion on whether they're good or bad, annoying or cute, and worth the trouble or not. One of the things I like about Amaama to Inazuma is that it showcases both sides of children, and overall just comes of as really realistic. It feels like your witnessing the growth of a life. Or it would, if Tsumugi actually learned from her mistakes.________________________________________STORY: 5/10Originally, Amaama to Inazuma started out extremely entertaining. Comedy, drama, cooking, adorableness, the whole package was there. But then... it happened again. And again....And AGAIN. Essentially, the show literally repeats the same formula for nearly every episode. By about the halfway point, it was boring.Tsumugi constantly having spats with her bratty friends, which in turn transforms her into a brat. They make food to cheer her up, she apologizes to her friends, all is well until next week. New characters are introduced along the way, but the core elements of the plot never change._______________________________________ART: 4/10The art and animation are just below average. Nothing worse you can say about it, it's not repulsive or anything. But it's definitely NOT good. The movement looks weird at points, and the art style is too fluffy and childish. It might have been the intention but it doesn't change the fact that it looks bad.______________________________________SOUND: 7/10The OP and ED are pathetic. They set the tone for the series well, sure, but they aren't pleasant to listen to AT ALL. Both aren't something you listen to more than once, if you even give it the courtesy. The OST is the same case, but it's completely different in context because it only plays in the background. It carries the mood instead of solely trying to set it. The sound effects are barely there and don't contribute much. Still though, that would have given sound an average score. So why the seven? Well, the reason I started the series in the first place is because two of my favorite voice actors voice the main characters. Needless to say, they did a fantastic job as usual. Tsumugi, as well, sounded REALLY good. It's stupefying that the staff went out of their way to get a child voice actor on board with the project. The supporting cast isn't as good or memorable, but the main characters have a fine footing all by themselves.______________________________________CHARACTER: 7/10Just having a good voice doesn't make a character good though. First off, I'll start by saying the character design isn't the standout part of this group. But that doesn't matter that much, honestly. Neither do most of the characters. They all exist to popularize Tsumugi and that's it. Unfortunately, the chance you'll get annoyed with Tsumugi is high, but that's exactly why the other characters exist. For every character that fails, they have a backup plan, and I appreciate that.______________________________________TL;DR: 6/10+Unique, very unique story. Not a concept you've seen more than once, if ever+Decent OST+Great voice acting+Overall Good balance of characters-Story is repetitive-Looks bad-OP and ED are badAmaama to Inazuma is certainly an experience. It's definitely not a must watch all around but it certainly is for fans of slice of life. It does so many things right and yet so many wrong.

Sweetness and Lightning is about the single father Kouhei who struggels to care for his daughter Tsumugi after his wife passed away. He really tries his best, but especially fails at cooking, so he has to buy premade meals, which Tsumugi tolerates but she misses the great cooking of her mother.The story is told in two parts every episode. The first part is about the father and his daughter dealing with some problem, and in the second part they cook something, often something the mother used to make. So the...character development is limited to half of the runtime, but Kouhei, at the beginning struggeling with managing his family, becomes a man who has everything under control. Too often, the story follows a blueprint: Tsumugi is sad or mad at her father, they start cooking and she is happy again.The characters are the shows biggest strength: Kouhei is a loving father to Tsumugi, he really cares for her and tries his best. He sometimes screams at his daughter, but he always apologizes and explains that he was just worried about her. In his conversations with the student they cook with you learn that he hardly thinks about something besides Tsumugi.Tsumugi is the best representation of a little girl I have seen in a while, she is obsessed with a magical girl anime, sings random songs and wants to do everything her father does. What makes her so lovable is the assistance she is to Kouhei, she helps in the household and wants everyone she knows to be happy. She can be annoying at times, but so are real little girls. Her shark song great.The last member of the main cast is a student of Kouhei, Kotori. Her mother isn't home much because of her work, so the family restaurant has to stay closed, Kotori can't cook because she is really afraid of knifes. Together with Kouhei and Tsumugi, she tries her best to learn cooking through recipes her mother writes down. There isn't much more to her character, but she likes Tsumugi and always helps to solve the conflicts between Tsumugi and her father.The show is not trying to be much, but is doing a really good job of telling the story of Kouhei and Tsumugi bonding over the food they cook and eat together. It never fails to bring a smile to your face with Tsumugi being adorable or Kouhei being a good dad to his daughter. If you are searching for something light to brighten up your day, I strongly encourage you to give this show a try, while it isn't the most complex or visually stunning show, it certainly is something I really enjoyed watching. character development is limited to half of the runtime, but Kouhei, at the beginning struggeling with managing his family, becomes a man who has everything under control.

There would be specific kinds of food that I really loved and I hated. Since I am from a Greek family, the one thing I hated when I was young was liver. Whenever I heard the word liver, my face would change into that of disgust. As a kid, I sometimes also said mean things that I did not actually understand that they affect the others around me. We all had moments as children when we were naughty and we did something so terrible that we got scolded by our parents. Let\'s be honest nobody...likes to be scolded or even punished. Now that I have grown up, I understand that everything they do is for none else but us and they love us so much that they want to help us become good people in the future and that is why they can be very strict in order to make us understand where there is a limit.Amaama to Inazuma reminded me a lot about my childhood memories and Tsumugi is for most of the time an example of how some of us were as kids. I love the fact that the show is not story-driven but character-driven since I have more time to grow with the characters and understand their thoughts. Although the show is fairly short (only 12 episodes), I really felt connected with the show and it managed to touch my heart. The story that Amaama to Inazuma wants to convey to the audience is not anything grandiose or pseudo-intellectual as many shows. But, it is fairly simple and direct. It is about a family of a widowed man and his daughter who cook together with one of his students and their daily lives. Cooking becomes actually a fundamental component of the series since most resolutions of any difficulties or problems in the show are found while cooking. The parenting aspect is there but also not there at the same time. It was not given as much focus as the cooking, but with 12 episodes it is to be expected. One particular scene that struck me was when Tsumugi wanted to play the role of Mr. Galigali and her friend was weirded out by her behaviour. It is such a common phenomenon today for kids to be excluded because they have different opinions or likings than most of the other kids. Our societal norms affect immediately kids more than anyone else. This kind of exclusion is becoming more common in early grades since kids are taught to think in one way and anything that goes against it they either find it weird or ignore it. As a kid I was different and that had also been a case of causing some kids to bully me or laugh at me. As a kid, I was very chubby and shorter than other kids and I was getting teased for being fat. Looking at that scene, it showed me that kids usually do that not clearly understanding that the things they do or say may hurt the others around them.I could speak about this topic for ages but since I want not to tire anyone who reads this review I will move along. The characters in the show are all likable but the one that you could have guessed that he/she stood out was Tsumugi. She is a little kid that brings joy to everyone that watches her cute mannerisms. I felt like I was tasting white chocolate when I was watching Tsumugi. She is too sugary and sweet, but you cannot help but like her. At some point you may feel that the cuteness is wrapping completely your body but thankfully this has not happened to me. Unfortunately, there are not many things I can say about the other characters, except Tsumugi\'s dad. He reminds me of my father from his caring and loving nature, but also from his strictness. However, Tsumugi\'s dad\'s wife has died before the show started and he has to deal with all the parenting by himself. I supported him when he scolded Tsumugi for her behavior and I felt happy for him when everything went well and smoothly between him and Tsumugi. He shows what kind of parent I would want to be in the future and how I would grow up my kids. I would show them my love in any way I could, but when they act wrong, I will scold them and show them that their behavior is not appropriate.As for the art and animation, it is good. It fits the show and makes food look delicious in a heartwarming way, in comparison to the over-the-top orgasmic look in Shokugeki no Souma, another cooking anime. It reminded me of having a family dinner with my own family.The soundtrack overall was decent but unmemorable. It did not act against the show but it did not enhance the experience either. However, the ED song ""Maybe"" was the only track that stood out to me. It was warm and fuzzy just like the whole vibe of this show.Overall, this show is very meditating and relaxing. It is exactly what I need after a hard day and it warms my heart in many ways and brings the feeling of nostalgia. I am very pleased that I finally watched this show to its end. I had it on-hold from last summer and I feel so happy and sad that it ended. If you want a show that is relaxing and touching, this is the show for you.Overall Score: 7.12/10Alternative Recommendations:-Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari for the heartwarming feeling although not to the extent of Amaama to Inazuma.-Blind Recommendation: Usagi Drop likes to be scolded or even punished.

It's the quintessential feel-good show, especially for folks who sometimes feel overwhelmed by all the bad things in the real world. Sometimes, it's necessary to just sit back and take in the beautiful things, which Sweetness and Lightning offers.

The plot is stale, but everything else is worth your time."", 'Amaama to Inazuma (Sweetness and Lightning)Art/Characters: The art style in this show can really only be described in one word: Cute. There is just something about this show’s style that makes it blur the line between cute and serious. There are a few things that I am not a fan of in principle, such as the exaggerated hair on Tsumugi, but those things are pretty minuscule when it comes to the overall art of the show. One of the things that are really well done would be the way that the food is portrayed. Because this is a show about food it just goes to...say that the food should look good enough to eat, and that is exactly what happened throughout this show, every episode ended with me hungry. As for the characters themselves, I felt that they had a healthy depth to them that made them easy to watch. There are a few things that don’t really makes sense, like how a grown man has trouble with a knife and what exactly is the backstory, but more on that later. Tsumugi is a cute and fun protagonist that showcases what it really means to discover and experience things for the first time. Her father, Kouhei, is a perfect portrayal of the loving father who just wants the best for his daughter. Kotori, the high school student of Kouhei’s, really is something out of left field for me. But her love of food is something that I can easily relate to.Sound/Music: SO CATCHY. I love listening to these tracks time and time again because of how much fun I have just grooving to them. A good show knows when to be bubbly and happy, and in a show like this one, things can often get a little to over-bubbly and there is a loss of meaning in that joy. But not here, the sound director knew exactly what they were doing, and were able to create an atmosphere of joy, and importance in my heart. The music played in the background was even interesting and fun. The use of wind instruments along with a piano is a small change that gives a huge reaction. The sounds of the food as well! When there is meat going on the stove, we HEAR the sizzle. It looks great and it sounds great. And I am sure if I made it myself, it would be just as amazing. I was really brought into the restaurant as a welcomed guest with these sounds.Story: Kouhei Inuzuka is in a pretty rough patch of his life. With his wife recently passing away and his young daughter, Tsumugi, is solely his responsibility. The main struggle so far has been food. He isn’t much of a cook and makes mostly TV dinners for Tsumugi. She eats them every night and doesn’t complain, but he can see it on her face that she wants something more. On the whim of a coworker, he takes Tsumugi to a restaurant that is a little off of the beaten path that is run by one of his student’s mother. Unfortunately the mother isn’t there, but Kotori does her best to feed them what they would like. Kouhei learns that Kotori’s mother isn’t there often and because of this she often eats alone. After some quick thinking, Kouhei and Kotori begin to learn to cook fun and delicious food for all three of them. As the show progresses the food gets more and more interesting and friends of both Kotori and Kouhei join the cooking party!Personal Reflection: Call me crazy, but I am a sucker for stories about Dad’s beating the odds for their kids. That is the kind of dad that I want to be whenever I have kids. The Story of a father doing his absolute best that he knows how to make his daughter happy, and then choosing to cook with one of his students because he knows that it will make her happy just warms my heart. They cook a variety of meals that all look and sound delicious. I often want to make the meals that they make in the show, but often the recipes are missing something and I can’t. The characters are cute and fun to watch and it’s fun to experience things with them. There is an episode where Tsumugi runs into some trouble with her friend, but her dad is right there ready to help in any way possible, and the solution that he comes up with is just priceless. All that being said; there was a lack of true story. While episode by episode had a common theme, there was nothing overarching the entirety of the show to pull it all together. There was a main problem, food, and they solved it in each episode. While I love shows that are able to have this kind of “you-can-miss-an-episode” type of vibe, I really think they could have developed it better. If the source material provides it, I would love to see a second season. Maybe it is just me wanting to be a dad and seeing someone succeed so well makes me so happy, but the show left me wanting to watch these characters grow more. Amaama to Inazuma is a fun, lighthearted show about a dad just wanting his daughter to be happy.Overall Rating: 8.5/10 say that the food should look good enough to eat, and that is exactly what happened throughout this show, every episode ended with me hungry. As for the characters themselves, I felt that they had a healthy depth to them that made them easy to watch. There are a few things that don’t really makes sense, like how a grown man has trouble with a knife and what exactly is the backstory, but more on that later. Tsumugi is a cute and fun protagonist that showcases what it really means to discover and experience things for the first time. Her father, Kouhei, is a perfect portrayal of the loving father who just wants the best for his daughter. Kotori, the high school student of Kouhei’s, really is something out of left field for me. But her love of food is something that I can easily relate to.Sound/Music: SO CATCHY. I love listening to these tracks time and time again because of how much fun I have just grooving to them. A good show knows when to be bubbly and happy, and in a show like this one, things can often get a little to over-bubbly and there is a loss of meaning in that joy. But not here, the sound director knew exactly what they were doing, and were able to create an atmosphere of joy, and importance in my heart. The music played in the background was even interesting and fun. The use of wind instruments along with a piano is a small change that gives a huge reaction. The sounds of the food as well! When there is meat going on the stove, we HEAR the sizzle. It looks great and it sounds great. And I am sure if I made it myself, it would be just as amazing. I was really brought into the restaurant as a welcomed guest with these sounds.Story: Kouhei Inuzuka is in a pretty rough patch of his life. With his wife recently passing away and his young daughter, Tsumugi, is solely his responsibility. The main struggle so far has been food. He isn’t much of a cook and makes mostly TV dinners for Tsumugi. She eats them every night and doesn’t complain, but he can see it on her face that she wants something more. On the whim of a coworker, he takes Tsumugi to a restaurant that is a little off of the beaten path that is run by one of his student’s mother. Unfortunately the mother isn’t there, but Kotori does her best to feed them what they would like. Kouhei learns that Kotori’s mother isn’t there often and because of this she often eats alone. After some quick thinking, Kouhei and Kotori begin to learn to cook fun and delicious food for all three of them. As the show progresses the food gets more and more interesting and friends of both Kotori and Kouhei join the cooking party!Personal Reflection: Call me crazy, but I am a sucker for stories about Dad’s beating the odds for their kids. That is the kind of dad that I want to be whenever I have kids. The Story of a father doing his absolute best that he knows how to make his daughter happy, and then choosing to cook with one of his students because he knows that it will make her happy just warms my heart. They cook a variety of meals that all look and sound delicious. I often want to make the meals that they make in the show, but often the recipes are missing something and I can’t. The characters are cute and fun to watch and it’s fun to experience things with them. There is an episode where Tsumugi runs into some trouble with her friend, but her dad is right there ready to help in any way possible, and the solution that he comes up with is just priceless. All that being said; there was a lack of true story. While episode by episode had a common theme, there was nothing overarching the entirety of the show to pull it all together. There was a main problem, food, and they solved it in each episode. While I love shows that are able to have this kind of “you-can-miss-an-episode” type of vibe, I really think they could have developed it better. If the source material provides it, I would love to see a second season. Maybe it is just me wanting to be a dad and seeing someone succeed so well makes me so happy, but the show left me wanting to watch these characters grow more. Amaama to Inazuma is a fun, lighthearted show about a dad just wanting his daughter to be happy.Overall Rating: 8.5/10', 'Sweetness & Lightning is an example of a very well made story about the difficulties, struggles, and even happiness through learning experiences in a single parent household. The relationship between a single father and his young daughter brought many emotions, albeit for good reasons.Story 9/10: Firstly I would like to state that this anime can seem very episodic. There isn\'t a vast amount of detail invested into a big plot or anything of the sort. Even though this may seem like a negative aspect, Sweetness & Lightning\'s story had me intrigued. The father, Kouhei Inuzuka, is a high school teacher and single father to his...daughter, Tsumugi. Together they find an interest in cooking different foods, some of which Tsumugi\'s mother had made before she passed away. An important part to my rating for the story is due to the age Tsumugi is, which is 5 or 6 years old. Around that age is very important in life due to new experiences such as school, beginning the process of growing up, and learning many new things. This anime showed what I would consider a very realistic depiction of how a 5 or 6 year old would act given the circumstances.Art 8/10: I\'m not a huge critic on art unless I\'m being promised a phenomenal amount of detail and crazy effects, so my rating will be a standard 8 here. I would like to point out that although the art style is standard for todays production quality, specific detail was put into some of the foods created.Sound 7/10: This is a very laid-back and relaxing anime, so there wasn\'t an immense amount of effort put into the soundtrack. The opening and ending songs were pretty good, and fit the emotion of the story for the most part. Pretty much your standard OP/ED. Background music was also pretty standard.Character 9/10: I found the connection and relationship between Kouhei and Tsumugi very strong and particularly unique. Their bonding through cooking food seems mundane at first but both have fitting personalities for each other, and it was surprising to see the development between the two. Side characters all had their influences to the story overall and didn\'t feel like unnecessary ""extras"", except for two. Their brief involvement was forgettable up until this moment so I consider them irrelevant.Enjoyment 9/10: Laid-back yet still entertaining? Check. Characters with good personal qualities and behaviors? Check. Honestly in a broader sense, there isn\'t anything spectacular about this anime, it\'s a pretty basic show. If that\'s something you\'re looking for, then consider my points above, and maybe you will find it enjoyable as well!Overall 9/10: I feel like this show really only appeals to a niché of a niché, those who want a laid-back anime that requires almost no attention. But if you do pay attention, you\'ll find a truly appealing anime inside a seemingly mundane plotline. daughter, Tsumugi.

They are always learning new things (especially when it comes to cooking).  Also explores some parts of Tsumugi's past during the time of her mother prior to her death.CHARACTERSKohei: High school teacher. He's not very good at cooking. He is a bit of a pushover but is always happy. Plus, as you can see... he is a widow.Tsumugi: Preschool/Kindergarden who is full of life and cuteness.Kotori: High school student. She is shy, novice in cooking and has bad knife skills.OVERALL:It's one of my favourite...animes during the summer. There is a lot of smiles and heartbreak. I get to learn new recipes every week. Seeing Tsumugi growing up is just remarkable -- I feel connected to the character. animes during the summer. There is a lot of smiles and heartbreak. I get to learn new recipes every week.

Hold on to your butts boys and girls this roller coaster is about to get emotional.I think I'm more biased to liking this anime as I'm at that point in my life that I'm getting married and expecting my first child, so I'm more drawn towards Inuzuka, Kouhei (the father) as I understand his worries and fears about raising his child alone. Wanting to give her the discipline shes requires without driving her away and trying to find time to make her a proper meal. Then there is Inuzuka, Tsumugi (the daughter) who is always trying to have a...happy face but is hurting inside a lot if she remembers not having her mother.

The series is quite different from traditional anime. It's about a girl, her teacher and the teacher's daughter who through coincidences come together and start cooking things.Although you don't see much of a character development in this anime but it is quite cheerful looking at the three working hard to cook good food and enjoy eating the same.

This show wants to have its cake and eat it too; it dabbles in scarce poignant moments, but never incorporates them into the narrative directly, just as triggers for empathy (we don\'t see anyone dealing with the issues at hand, we simply see them...in the background, as if to make the life of our characters noble).The comedy is non-existent, literally, no jokes or gags other than over-the-top hacky cutesy behavior.And last but not least, I don\'t see this being grounded in the reality it pretends to belong to, namely, non of the characters being anything more than one dimensional stock characters living in a world where nothing bad ever happens, never mind how many mistakes you make. It doesn\'t matter that you neglect your child\'s nutrition and non-school social life, she will be a happy-go-lucky soul; never mind that the situations you put yourself in is vastly open for cynical misinterpretation, such things don\'t happen.I cannot shake off the suspicion that this show is being mendacious.It seems to me that the director is perfectly aware of the blatantly shallow nature of the entire story, so resorting to gimmicks was all.I don\'t think there\'s anything missing in your life if you haven\'t watched this.Some people definitely enjoy it, but for the "" upbeat cute kid"" element, there\'s Naru from ""Barakamon"" and for the ""single father"" element, there\'s the great ""Usagi Drop"". in the background, as if to make the life of our characters noble).The comedy is non-existent, literally, no jokes or gags other than over-the-top hacky cutesy behavior.And last but not least, I don\'t see this being grounded in the reality it pretends to belong to, namely, non of the characters being anything more than one dimensional stock characters living in a world where nothing bad ever happens, never mind how many mistakes you make.

The scene I remember the most and that I watched a couple times outside of the anime was about the little girl Tsumugi walking down the streets while avoiding imaginary sharks on an imaginary ocean in her mind, that particular scene had great special effects, but during the rest of the series there were pretty standard, and as the vast majority of slice of life shows, the character designs are simple, generic and forgettable, besides that the visuals are still a very solid department as a whole.As for the sound department, the sound effects were good and both the music and the voices did their job accordingly but nothing to write too much about besides Tsumugi, a five years old girl voiced by an, at the time, eleven years old girl, who despite being so young did a wonderful job. I have already talked about this on my Aishiteruze Baby review where Yuzuyu, also a five years old girl, was voiced by a little girl but with a much much worse performance, that is not the case here.Tsumugi herself is adorable, as most protagonists in this type of shows are, and unlike Rin Kaga, for example, she’s not so mature for her age, in fact she is not mature in the least. She’s loud, energetic, innocent, and makes a big deal out of everything, in either a comedic or dramatic way. If you’re like me, it will get tiresome a bit to see and hear a character cry for unimportant stuff, but it’s easy to give that a pass when the character is so young, and when is all around very well characterized.Sweetness and Lightning belongs in the iyashikei, or feel good, type of slice of life show, and as far as that goes, it manages to have a proper relaxing atmosphere, as long as you don’t get overwhelmed by how hiperactive Tsumugi can be at times.But that’s as far as positives of this show go for me. One complain I have about Tsumugi is that she barely has any conflict with no having a mother, if at all. Yuzuyu from Aishiteruze Baby was a way better character in that regard. I mean I guess you could say that’s the reason why Tsumugi gets so close to Kotori so easily, but that’s it. Speaking of Kotori, her introduction in the show was very weak, crying because she was alone and couldn’t eat with her mom? You’re not a little girl anymore. Then there is the father and he…I don’t have anything to say about him, really. There are more side characters but they don’t offer anything, they are just comic reliefs and what they do is not funny, to me at least.But what’s the real flaw of the show in my eyes is how it wastes its interesting premise of a widowed man taking care of his child all alone by basically having no plot nor theme exploration, and that’s precisely because it is a feel good type of show. With this premise you would expect drama, but there isn’t, or there is but it has to do with irrelevant stuff unrelated to the premise, which in turn is presented in an overblown way. Most of the series is just Tsumugi feeling hungry and the three main characters cooking and eating together. Slice of life shows are usually plotless and relaxing, but it is a problem here because the whole premise goes to waste. It also reduces parenting, something which I asume everyone would agree can be quite complex, to just feeding a kid, that’s as far as the show goes with it, like, come on. Again, Aishiteruze Baby features multiple characters dealing with parenting in their own ways, here is reduced to just that, so I say go watch that show instead, if you can deal with the bad visuals and weak sound.And the nail in the coffin is how by the very end they hint that Kotori developed feelings for the father (her sensei), if that wasn’t the sole reason why she got closer to him in the first place, which not only means that later in the manga there’s probably some romance vibes between a teenage girl and a grown adult, it also would mean that her relationship with Tsumugi was a lie the whole show, at least to some point.Needless to say, I don’t have a positive opinion of this show and I can’t recommend it, it’s as plotless and lighthearted with simple and forgettable characters as many slice of life series, but this one also wastes a very good premise and theme. Even its best points are done better somewhere else.For something similar, the Usagi Drop anime and as I already said Aishiteruze Baby, both of which I already covered, give you whatever you could want from this show and are way better. If you don’t want to go that back to watch a good childcare show, for some reason, there’s also Koutarou wa Hitogurashi which aired this year and is also good, albeit more sad than the rest. a series with no major quality drops, well made backgrounds, vivid, expressive and fluid motions and facial expressions for its type of show, and with cooking anime levels of detailed and very well drawn food.

A arte do anime também está bem bonita,então acredito que a maioria irá gostar.No Entretenimento o anime também se sai bem,seja nos episódios mais divertidos ou mais dramáticos,a obra tende a manter você interessado nela...Isso claro,se é esse o tipo de anime que você está procurando.Nota Pessoal: 8/10Veredito: Amaama to Inazuma foi um anime que eu tive muito prazer em assistir,devido a sua leveza e sua simplicidade,muita das vezes eu me peguei assistindo o anime até em momentos que eu estava muito estressado ou frustado quando as coisas não saíam como você gostaria e logo depois eu já me sentia bem novamente haha.E Amaama to Inazuma é isso,um slice of life muito bem feito e que consegue transmitir sentimentos positivos para quem o assiste.Enfim,se você gosta de obras do gênero ou animes semelhantes a Barakamon e Usagi Drop,pode assistir esse anime tranquilamente porque é bem provável que você tenha uma ótima experiência com o mesmo,assim como foi o meu caso. the place is all for Kotori.And that\'s when she decides to ask her teacher to always come with Tsumugi to eat in her restaurant, since that way she could practice a little more cooking, besides having a company and at the same time that Kouhei would be learning how to cook better and making ""tasty food"" for her precious daughter.Highlights/Singularities:1°) The interaction of a father and his daughter -> Probably the best thing about anime is that you see the relationship between Kouhei and his daughter.Whether it\'s when he manages to smile at her after making delicious food for Tsumugi, a gesture of affection from his daughter with him, moments that he ends up fighting with her and then come a very exciting reconciliation.Anyway, the show of affection between the two is something very beautiful to see in the anime and certainly would be a great reason to give a chance to Amaama to Inazuma.2°) Charismatic Characters -> Another factor very present in the anime, are his great characters.Tsumugi is too cute,Kotori is fun,Kouhei is a nice guy and you are touched by his concern to always make your daughter happy ...Anyway, it\'s a beautiful cast certainly and one of the highlights of the anime.Animation/Entertainment: The animation of Amaama to Inazuma is very well done, although for animals of the genre, it is not so necessary to have a superb animation ...

Also they represented what being  a kid was like very well.Cons: Unsatisfying ending♥Have you ever wanted to be a kid again? Or have you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be an adult? Well this anime goes through both of those.The anime shows the struggles of being a single father...doing his best to make his kid happy.Through the first episodes it made me smile ear to ear remembering how I was like when I was a kid. Tsumugi's  was really well written out and it gave me a new age for a character. Tsumugi's character almost seemed like a father or a kid wrote this while adding details on what their kid would do or what they would do. Literally, this is the most purest character I've ever witnessed. When being a kid you can go through emotions faster than shuffling through a deck of cards and some pepole got annoyed on how bratty she seemed like. She is a kid and I'm sure every kid was somehow bratty.Inuzuka's character was really interesting to watch and since I'm an empathetic person I would randomly break down only thinking about what he's going through. He is being a strong father for his daughter. 6 months ago he lost his beloved wife and he decided he would be #BestDad for his daughter. He started connecting to his daughter through one things she loves, Food.Passing that, I loved seen the characters bond over something we all like (I think? I mean if you don't like it.. er.. sorry?) Food. Watching Inuzuka as a father and watching him improve to make his daughter happy is so fricking pure to my dark soul.

Despite the simplicity of it's plot and animation, it remains an experience that I would easily recommend to anyone - especially those who enjoy slice of life series. It is an interesting take on the genre as a whole and remains very grounded to reality; as a result, the atmosphere of the series is very close to the real world. It truly encapsulates the essence of familial interactions wonderfully.The story revolves around a father and his daughter (aged anywhere from 3 to 6 years old - it is never directly specified), named Kohei (who...happens to be a high school teacher) and Tsumugi respectively. Kohei is burdened with raising the child by himself as his wife's death had occurred 6 months chronologically before the beginning of the series - the foundation for the series is laid when he stumbles upon a student of his; this student's mother is incidentally a semi-acclaimed chef who owns her own restaurant. After this is all explained, the remaining episodes follow a basic core plot - Tsumugi wants to eat something after a certain event has occurred that makes her want to do so (i.e, a fishing trip leads to her wanting to eat fish), and then the main cast prepares this certain food. It is very basic in it's premise, but never does it feel repetitive.The art in the series is riddled with mediocrity in many instances, but is generally consistent in quality that manages to stay up to par with other modern anime series. The series suffers from a bad case of static backgrounds with some motion in the foreground, so often times, when characters are drawn in the background, it often feels less lively as they tend to remain static most of the time. Regardless, it always manages to look nice, despite the simplicity of the character designs.The soundtrack is not memorable - it's very simple and quite common relative to other slice of life shows. The openings and endings are distinct and don't suffer from the generic openings that clout the genre. That being said - there is not much else to say on the topic. The soundtrack is consistently bland, and it doesn't add nor does it take away to the show.The characters, though few in numbers, are very memorable and distinctive in their own right - they are all enjoyable and work to benefit the series as a whole, as they are the main draw to it.

There are few changes beyond occasionally combining two storylines into one. A good job was done in picking a fitting last episode for this show so it still feels like there is a climax and wrap-up, even with the episodic story structure.ANIMATION & SOUNDThere may not have been any significant slip-ups, but this animation looks very basic for a 2016 show. Backgrounds look minimum standard at times,...and while it's nice to see the characters from the manga move around, I think a bit of detail was lost. Sound is fine with solid voice acting.

How have I come to that, do you ask?Kouhei-san, 6-month widowed (at the beginning of the series), lived with Tsumugi, his only daughter of about 5. Having previously split the household roles with his wife who used to do most the household chores, Kouhei struggled to do the chores all by himself, especially cooking. Consequently, both he and his daughter spent most of their meals off of a convenient-store-bought packaged-meals, or ate out at a restaurant. Tsumugi, already gotten used to her mom\'s cooking, complained once in a while about the quality and variety...(or lackthereof) of their daily meals. Trying to satiate his daughter\'s appetite of a homemade meal, Kouhei tried to put up a dish, albeit to no avail.On one fateful day, Kouhei met a girl named Kotori (whom he would later find out was one of his students), whose mother owns a small restaurant, and was invited to eat out at there. Later, Kouhei and Tsumugi came to the restaurant only to find out that Kotori\'s mother, the cook, was out for the night, leaving the unexperienced Kotori flustered and panicked. Not wanting to disappoint her guests and having them leave with a pout, she cooked them the only dish she knew how to make, a bowl of rice, which was weirdly enough to delight the guests.Before the guests left, Kotori fervently requested that Kouhei and Tsumugi eat and make dinner together again at a later time at her restaurant. What? Is this a vague allusion to a romantic interest? All in all, Kouhei humbly nodded to the request, which was the starting point of their culinary journey together. Kouhei, a man who is more senior, put his and pride aside to learn to cook together with a young girl who is his student, with feeling of mutual respect and of no shame. Tell me that is not gentlemanly.Aside from that, there were many heartfelt interaction between Kouhei and Tsumugi that embodied a healthy relationship between parents and children. As a kindergarten-aged child, of course there were occassions where Tsumugi threw a tantrum, to which Kouhei responded with reprimands and publicly scolding Tsumugi. Later on, Kouhei would apologize and try to understand to Tsumugi, while also trying to make Tsumugi understand why her behavior was not appropriate. Being able to listen, understand, and show that you actually have emotion, now toxic masculinity really just left the building.-----StoryThe story focuses more on home culinary experience, which seems to be an appropriate choice for an anime intended for family audience. The characters are cooking a certain dish in each episode, and other half of the episode would be the events that leads to the creation of the dish (mostly to Tsumugi\'s request). Interspersed between them are the main character\'s daily life like kindergarten situations, school events, and the struggle of dealing with bereavement, which I would say weren\'t much.While it is refreshing seeing how the characters interacts, their heartfelt conversations, and homemade simple dish, the show gets boring with the same formula in each episode. Furthermore, it has no central conflict/plot that would take a few episode/one season to resolve. If the show\'s plot were a graph, it would be a straight line with no inclination whatsoever, up until the last episode. The last episode especially wasn\'t even satisfactory. There was no sens of resolution, nothing that hinted a second season, or any form of climax. It was just the same as the other episodes, and left me with ""Oh..."" at the end of the season.The story focuses mostly on Tsumugi, which leaves the other MCs\' life unexplored. It\'s almost as if the other characters\' existence are only to cater to Tsumugi\'s needs. There was a slight romantic tension between Kouhei and Kotori (what with Kotori\'s facial expression drawn with blushing that never seemed to go away), but there were no action taken, no proposal nor rejection which would spice up the story more (as a sucker for romance I was quite disappointed, LOL)-----ArtI do think that the art is overall decent. On the other hand, I was quite disappointed that, with culinary taking more than half portion of the whole series, they weren\'t putting enough effort to create mouth-watering visualization in both the finished dish, and the animation of the process of cooking. There was no romantization of oil sizzling, ingredients cutting, sauce pouring, enhanced with appropriate sound to stimulate your appetite.-----CharactersI can\'t get enough of Tsumugi\'s cuteness! Her cheerfulness, her little dance and singing! Sometimes she sulks and get angry over little things but that makes it quite adorable, with a pint of annoying.The other MCs being Kouhei and Kotori were both mild-mannered, giving even more spot light to Tsumugi. As I explained before, though, I love how they give Kouhei a very fatherly characteristic who just loves his daughter unconditionally.I can\'t say much about Kotori except that she is decent and agreeable, and portrayed as more of a big sister to Kotori, or a mom? I don\'t know. (or lackthereof) of their daily meals. Trying to satiate his daughter\'s appetite of a homemade meal, Kouhei tried to put up a dish, albeit to no avail.On one fateful day, Kouhei met a girl named Kotori (whom he would later find out was one of his students), whose mother owns a small restaurant, and was invited to eat out at there. Later, Kouhei and Tsumugi came to the restaurant only to find out that Kotori\'s mother, the cook, was out for the night, leaving the unexperienced Kotori flustered and panicked. Not wanting to disappoint her guests and having them leave with a pout, she cooked them the only dish she knew how to make, a bowl of rice, which was weirdly enough to delight the guests.Before the guests left, Kotori fervently requested that Kouhei and Tsumugi eat and make dinner together again at a later time at her restaurant. What? Is this a vague allusion to a romantic interest? All in all, Kouhei humbly nodded to the request, which was the starting point of their culinary journey together. Kouhei, a man who is more senior, put his and pride aside to learn to cook together with a young girl who is his student, with feeling of mutual respect and of no shame. Tell me that is not gentlemanly.Aside from that, there were many heartfelt interaction between Kouhei and Tsumugi that embodied a healthy relationship between parents and children. As a kindergarten-aged child, of course there were occassions where Tsumugi threw a tantrum, to which Kouhei responded with reprimands and publicly scolding Tsumugi. Later on, Kouhei would apologize and try to understand to Tsumugi, while also trying to make Tsumugi understand why her behavior was not appropriate. Being able to listen, understand, and show that you actually have emotion, now toxic masculinity really just left the building.-----StoryThe story focuses more on home culinary experience, which seems to be an appropriate choice for an anime intended for family audience. The characters are cooking a certain dish in each episode, and other half of the episode would be the events that leads to the creation of the dish (mostly to Tsumugi\'s request). Interspersed between them are the main character\'s daily life like kindergarten situations, school events, and the struggle of dealing with bereavement, which I would say weren\'t much.While it is refreshing seeing how the characters interacts, their heartfelt conversations, and homemade simple dish, the show gets boring with the same formula in each episode. Furthermore, it has no central conflict/plot that would take a few episode/one season to resolve. If the show\'s plot were a graph, it would be a straight line with no inclination whatsoever, up until the last episode. The last episode especially wasn\'t even satisfactory. There was no sens of resolution, nothing that hinted a second season, or any form of climax. It was just the same as the other episodes, and left me with ""Oh..."" at the end of the season.The story focuses mostly on Tsumugi, which leaves the other MCs\' life unexplored. It\'s almost as if the other characters\' existence are only to cater to Tsumugi\'s needs. There was a slight romantic tension between Kouhei and Kotori (what with Kotori\'s facial expression drawn with blushing that never seemed to go away), but there were no action taken, no proposal nor rejection which would spice up the story more (as a sucker for romance I was quite disappointed, LOL)-----ArtI do think that the art is overall decent. On the other hand, I was quite disappointed that, with culinary taking more than half portion of the whole series, they weren\'t putting enough effort to create mouth-watering visualization in both the finished dish, and the animation of the process of cooking. There was no romantization of oil sizzling, ingredients cutting, sauce pouring, enhanced with appropriate sound to stimulate your appetite.-----CharactersI can\'t get enough of Tsumugi\'s cuteness! Her cheerfulness, her little dance and singing! Sometimes she sulks and get angry over little things but that makes it quite adorable, with a pint of annoying.The other MCs being Kouhei and Kotori were both mild-mannered, giving even more spot light to Tsumugi.

I don\'t know.', 'Wholesome show about family& food. I think that says it all but let’s elaborate.First, two things that threw me off:- Tsumugi’s voice. Not bad& very fitting to her character, but it struck me as out of place, especially at first.- The ""cooking is starting"" song. Also, pretty good but the first seconds are basically an alarm clock so I had a fight or flight response every time it played. I rarely notice music in anime & when I do its either too good, too bad or out of place. I\'ll add alarm clock to that list.With that out of the way, the characters are...very cute and pleasant, so you end up caring about their little adventures and victories. Also, huge points to Kouhei for being an amazing father who wants the best for his daughter, listens and apologizes when he does a mistake. It was refreshing to see. Tsumugi is cute and very well portrayed as a child, especially in some scenes that we get to see the world through her eyes. The way the grief and loss of the mom is portrayed is very interesting, as it gives some depth to the characters in a positive way as they try to move on for the best of the other person but still embracing the good memories of her they have left. Its sweet, but with a sad underline.Kotori is also very lovable and pure herself, finding happiness doing simple things like cooking with a family that she is missing so much.The food (as always in anime) looks very tasty and they really go in detail with each recipe making it more fun. Each episode is named around the food, but it almost looks like as if the food and the time they spend together making it is the solution to the ""problem"" of each episode which is pretty cute too.Overall, if you\'d like anime with food and also a relaxing/ wholesome show that will put a smile on your face and giggle a bit, give it a go! It goes past ""just good"" given the way the characters are portrayed, so I\'d recommend giving it a watch. very cute and pleasant, so you end up caring about their little adventures and victories.

The thing this does really well is that it recognises social barriers that would make things difficult in its scenario.Firstly, the teacher Inuzuka-sensei has barely at most of it lost his wife at one point only a few months then a year. It is great the romance didn't go too far with that in mind.Secondly, although love can transcend barriers it would have been difficult to have a teacher-student relationship go forward. This especially with Tsumugi being so young and that the fact it is so nicely thought about wanting her happiness first...regardless.The romance does exist for the main pair and it does also more so for the secondary pair in the anime. The fact the show retrains itself and also focuses more on Tsumugi is just the perfect side of the show. The show has barriers that stay in place to slowly erode as opposed to many shows that just say screw society.Also, the episode with the shark song is beyond cute.The art is a great standard throughout. It does drop off at times a bit which is fine since it is a slice of life as opposed to action where every scene matters.The sound comes with an amazing OP that is so memorable. The ED is equally very good throughout the show. The shark song is also amazing.Characters firstly containing Tsumugi's friends since they matter a great deal as do affect the story a fair bit. You see some conflict that has to be resolved on an adult and child level.In regards to the teacher and student situation, it does develop just very subtly. It is done very well making no clear moves but enough to know it may exist on the day.The teacher's friend and the student's friend also have something going on it seems. It is very nicely done again to be subtle.The main thing in development here is that it is about reading between the lines which not everyone can or will.In the end, the show is a cute girl does cute things show.

Watching these two gradually bond over the series over the making of homemade meals is a joy to behold.Kohei...is one of the main characters of the show and is Tsumugi's father. He tries his best to raise her while balancing work. As can be expected this is challenging and Kohei despite being a good father is not actually a good cook. However his attempts to provide meals for his daughter despite this is heartwarming.After encountering Kotori though and seeing how much his daughter loves homemade meals Kohei's character and  personality changes. Now he is willing to learn how to cook despite his inexperience. This change i welcome as homemade meals are always better than what you would find on the street. Kohei's transformation from a normal person that doesn't know how to cook to a somewhat able cook was a joy to see.Tsumugi is Kohei's daughter and is a excitable, positive and somewhat ecstatic person.  Like all kids she can be excitable and can often get into arguments with kids of similar age at the kindergarten where she attends. However at her core Tsumugi has a nice personality and has infinite curiosity with everything including food.Tusmugi's relationship with her Father Kohei is one of the centerpoints in the anime and i think it was shown and done pretty well as you can see just how much she loves him. Tsumugi's character was really adorable and this is no small part due to her seiyuu.Kotori serves as the third main character of the series and is actually one of Kohei's students. Kotori actually serves as the second heroine of the series. Her family owns a restaurant in the nearby town. However her relationship with her mother while close is offset by the fact that her mother is always away on work and as such she is a bit of a loner. One aspect of her character that i like is that she doesn't hide the fact that she is honest about food. Her relationship with Kohei and how they all met though is quite funny.As the daughter of a chef and a celebrity chef as well you would probably expect  her to be an impressive cook but due to trauma from her childhood this is not so. However by following her mothers recipes and with a little teamwork she is able to create many new, varied and no doubt tasty meals that she will also get the chance to enjoy.Kotori's relationship with Kohei and Tsumugi though is interesting though as i think she sees them more as a family than she has been lacking and missing all these years.The overall art and animation that was used in the anime was pretty well done.  And the character designs were also pretty good.Overall music was good and the opening and ending themes were really cuteand appropriate for the series. Scene music was also apt for the scene in question.Overall i actually liked this series because it was relaxing and a nice change of pace for other animes that were out at the time. The relationship between Tsumugi and Kohei was cute and seeing the bond develop between them was nice. Saori Hayami who portrays Kotori did a great job as always as did the support cast.Of the support cast the character of Shinobu who was played by veteran seiyuu Haruka Tomatsu was also one of my favorites due to her interactions with Yagi. is one of the main characters of the show and is Tsumugi's father.

My biggest complaint would be that what was supposed to be the strongest point of this anime, ended up being almost the weakest - it's the characters. All of them, even the main characters, can be described in less than 5 words and they don't get any development. The father? Kind, loves his daughter. Kotori-chan? Constantly flustered and loves food. Tsumugi? Super cute. At least I'm glad they didn't make Tsumugi into a completely perfect adorable child - she was bratty on several instances, and I appreciate that.The story? What story? The episodes followed...the same formula every time and there was no overarching plot - which I guess is understandable, considering it's a slice of life anime. But it still felt stagnant. The cooking parts of the show were always so detailed and long, I caught myself often wondering, whether I'm supposed to write down the recipes - I don't know, maybe that was one of the main things for the viewer to take out of this anime.Overall, despite my complaints, I found myself thoroughly enjoying this show. I admit, I got kinda attached to Tsumugi, but I wish I knew more about the father and Kotori-chan, about them as people and their backstories, more than just a few second glimpses to their past. This anime is a light snack if you like watching families cook together and small adorable children. the same formula every time and there was no overarching plot - which I guess is understandable, considering it's a slice of life anime.

I don't hate cooking anime but I rarely watch them. Because of Tsumugi, I watched it. At first, I just watch it because it's new anime and I'm impressed by Tsumugi. I think story, sound or art are not special. But character is good (only Tsumugi). I like her cuteness. That's not like I'm a lolicon, I love kids very much. Every her emotion, every her action, I love it. Because the reason is short, so I think I will write some bulshit things to lengthen it. I love Tsumugi,  I love...Tsumugi,  I love Tsumugi,  I love Tsumugi, , I love Tsumugi,  I love Tsumugi. Tsumugi,  I love Tsumugi,  I love Tsumugi, , I love Tsumugi,  I love Tsumugi."", 'tl;dr: A show with simple but relatable cooking and an adorable father daughter relationship that get’s somewhat repetitive towards the end.This anime is at it’s core about a single dad, Kouhei, learning how to cook with his five year old daughter, Tsumugi, and one of the students he teaches as a high school teacher, Kotori, who’s mother owns a restaurant. Each episode generally has two focuses that are connected to varying degrees, the cooking itself and the main character’s personal lives and relationships.The cooking I found interesting in that it was low level. There are many cooking shows and anime about great chefs creating amazing...works of culinary art or chefs who cook in extremely tense and high paced environments. But as someone that is a terrible cook those are completely unrelatable. They’re cool to watch as fantasy pretty much, but it’s completely impossible to realistically see myself doing anything resembling what occurs in them. In this show the cooking is done by people that largely don’t know how to cook and thus take things very slowly and follow the recipe’s very closely. I wasn’t really going in with the mentality of actually cooking any of the food that they made in the show, and if I ever do decide to I don’t think that memories from the show will be all that helpful compared to just following a recipe properly. But the detailed way they present the cooking done makes just normal cooking seem pretty awesome. They’re very hesitant and take things slow. They have trouble constantly but figure things out. They make small mistakes but work through them. Even though it’s just normal cooking, it feels like they put in effort. And in the end when they eat what they’re made after that effort, it feels like the effort put in was rewarded, and thus the act of cooking itself was rewarding. This more so than any other cooking anime or manga got me actually interesting in cooking more and becoming a better cook. Thus the portrayal of cooking is really simple, grounded, and arguably even somewhat boring in and of itself, but I really liked it.Beyond the cooking, it also focuses on relationships of the main characters. Kouhei’s wife dies not long before the ending of this anime, so when the anime starts Kouhei is still adjusting to how to be a single parent and properly take care of his five year old daughter while also working full time as a teacher. Most of the other anime centered around a man taking care of a child don’t involve the child actually being theirs and show the introduction and development of the relationship of the man and child in the show itself. This is pretty different in that Tsumugi is biologically Kouhei’s daughter, and thus they already have a relationship. This relationship is somewhat changing as Kouhei becomes better accustomed to his role as a single parent and Tsumugi continues growing, but it still ultimately has a very different feel compared to anime that show the start of completely new bond. The memories brought up of Kouhei’s wife and past events involving her before the anime are especially good at hitting emotional notes really quickly.Kouhei himself is a very earnest guy, and though he’s not a perfect father, he’s clearly trying his best and since this is a light hearted anime manages to correct his mistakes very quickly and learn from them to continue growing as a father. Tsumugi is absolutely adorable. The show manages to capture in her everything great about children. She’s energetic and curious about everything. She’s has strong reactions to lots of random things, both in terms of happy and sad, and very bluntly shows her emotions. She very much does her best to be a good kid though because she is still a kid she can’t always pull it off. Her just being herself is also hilarious and heartwarming. The few parts from her perspective especially. She has so many cute songs. She’s just a blast to watch and you can’t help but like her. And because Kouhei’s love for her comes through so clearly, he’s really likable as well.The last main character is Kotori. She’s a high school student that’s pretty shy it seems as she has trouble making friends in her class. Her parents also divorced and she lives with her mom so she’s incredibly close to her, but is somewhat lonely due to her mom being really busy recently. That’s probably what got her interested in Kouhei and Tsumugi, which seems to be what prompted her to initiate the cooking sessions with them. She also seems to be pretty earnest and doing his best to be supportive of Kouhei and Tsumugi, so she ends up really likable too. She also often has reactions just as adorable as Tsumugi, though far less of them. There’s also various side characters, mainly a friend of Kouhei’s and a friend of Kotori’s that join them in the cooking sessions sometimes and change things up due to them both being very skilled unlike the main characters, as well as various others minor characters such as Kouhei’s coworkers, Kotori’s peers, or Tsumugi’s peers and their parents that help in adding variety to the main character’s stories.With that said, the biggest issue I would say in the anime is that it doesn’t really feel like there’s much progress. Kouhei becomes a somewhat better cook, but not by much, and really him becoming a much better cook would ruin some of the charm of the anime so it’s probably for the best it doesn’t go in that direction. Kouhei and Tsumugi deal with various issues and come to have a better relationship, but it’s very incremental small changes. It’s nice enough to watch as short stories, but it doesn’t feel like anything is happening long term. Kotori manages to establish a good chemistry with Kouhei and Tsumugi pretty early on, but after that it doesn’t really feel like things change at all, even there are some hints that Kotori may be interested in getting closer to them. This combined with the cooking not really changing much over the show either results in the anime overall starting to feel kind of repetitive in it’s last third or so. There’s also not really much of an ending to the anime. There’s a bit of an attempt at visually trying to make things seem like a finale, but story wise it’s basically just another episode like the other episodes. Thus it does kind of feel like it just fizzles out in the end.The art and animation are decent enough I suppose. Not particularly great, but decent enough to convey what it need to convey both in terms of characters and cooking properly without things ever being bad enough to be distracting. The OP I found really nice both visually and in terms of the song. The ED was decent in both aspects. The soundtrack was mostly not memorable, but there’s a certain track used during cooking scenes that I don’t know why but I really liked. works of culinary art or chefs who cook in extremely tense and high paced environments.

Spoilers ahead!)Like Tsumugi of Amaama to Inazuma, I used to never eat one specific vegetable: onions.I still don’t eat them as is, but I do love to get them as fried onion rings. Whenever my family and I go out to eat, we always order the tall stack of them with an extra side of dipping sauce. The brown, flaky casing, the slimy onion innards, and the cool, sweet sauce that I lather this dichotomy with make it one of my favorite foods to consume.Amaama to Inazuma doesn’t taste as gross as regular onions, but it...doesn’t taste as wonderful as the fried version. Instead, it roughly ends up somewhere in-between.STORYAmaama to Inazuma centers on the kind Kouhei Inuzuka and his darling daughter Tsumugi. The death of Kouhei’s wife has left Tsumugi without a mother, and, when he realizes that Tsumugi no longer likes the boring food he has been giving her, he takes it upon himself to learn how to cook and provide her with meals that will make her happy. Together with Kotori, one of his students, the three have fun and food galore.Unfortunately for this anime, it ends up in a category that no story wants to find itself in: wasted potential. For Amaama to Inazuma has all the makings of a strong show – thoughtful premise, fun characters, interesting ideas – but ultimately goes nowhere with them.Take its premise. Kouhei lost his wife; Tsumugi lost her mother. Despite having these elements in place, the anime does not go anywhere that deep. Tsumugi lacking a female guide. Kouhei dating other women. What their relationship looks like from an outsider’s perspective.Most striking is how the anime approaches the death of Kouhei’s late wife. That is to say, they barely touch on it at all. The few occasions when they do, it’s either a quick flashback without much weight behind it or the anime does not go as far as it can.This last point is especially true in the final episode. Kouhei and Tsumugi are clearly dressed (and saddened) as they leave to see Tsumugi’s mother’s grave, but the anime stops there. It does not give Kouhei’s thoughts or show what Tsumugi did when she visited. Instead, the opening track plays, and the episode resumes, carrying on per usual.Although, this mindset may be unfair since Amaama to Inazuma aims to be lighthearted over serious. Tsumugi’s cute antics and Kouhei’s doting actions do not leave room for these deeper topics. However, this decision to adhere to more shallow content leads into the anime’s biggest problem and largest reason for wasted potential: repetition.The anime refuses to deviate from its own recipe. The first half of an episode presents some conflict or slice-of-life happening involving Tsumugi, and the second half shows the group making food, resolving the previous issue simultaneously. These ingredients are purchased from the beginning and are never replaced with anything else throughout the entire season.It’s not as if the anime is a comedy that relies on the same brand of humor. Simply put, the content in this show almost never tries to spice anything up. Kouhei reacts in a worried manner when Tsumugi does or says something peculiar, which touches the heart, but he almost always does so in the same way. Tsumugi dances or sings to “help” with the cooking, which is no doubt cute, but she almost always performs her “magic” in a similar fashion.Even the choice of venue is problematic; they always go to Kotori’s kitchen. Kouhei’s apartment, visiting Yagi’s place, or even just an outside barbeque area are places never considered. Combined with the repetitive structure and events, the anime has no chance of escaping its own restrictive direction.The food itself can also get repetitive, but at least here they change what gets made each time. Yet it’s not the repetition that that makes the food a problem but rather how it practically gets in the way.While it’s nice that the show wants to show the audience a lot about food, very few people are watching this anime for the food. Food is arguably not even the point of the anime. Indeed, it’s (supposed to be) about Kouhei, Tsumugi, and the relationship between them. So, while the explanation behind proper vegetable cutting or flour sifting is appreciated, it ultimately feels like the story wastes time on something much less important.However, to be as fair as possible, the food does serve a higher purpose. If it weren’t for the soup or gyoza that they make, Kouhei and Tsumugi would not be able to connect as readily as they do. He learns to listen to her more carefully, and she comes to understand that he always has her and her best interests in mind, even when he’s scolding her. In other words, food is the mediator that brings them closer together.Most importantly, food has an underlying parallel. A homecooked meal takes time, preparation, and a whole lot of thought to get right. It’s the same way with relationships. They don’t just miraculously form but rather require these same qualities. Tsumugi and Kouhei have a head start because they are already father and daughter. But, through her positive outlook and his nurturing hand, the two make meals that reflect the very relationship they share: warm, filling, and full of love.Again, though, not delving deeper into its obvious topics, the nauseating format, and the misplaced focus make this parallel and the anime’s other meaningful ideas – like the need for healthy relationships and what Tsumugi learns applies just as much to Kouhei (and the audience) – wasted potential that does not go realized.ANIMATIONAmaama to Inazuma’s art is an unseasoned dish: digestible but not flavorful.The lack of seasoning comes from its inherent inability to branch out. Kouhei’s apartment, the school, and Kotori’s kitchen are the most prominent places visited, but they lack any interesting details to speak of. Admittedly, Tsumugi’s nursery school does a better job of capturing that environment with pictures on the walls, the outside play area, and the little cubbies that hold the kids’ materials.Instead, the anime focuses most of its attention on the food itself. At the minimum, the anime passes in this regard. While the food almost never jumps out at the audience as delectable, the steamed rice, the filleted fish, and the hamburg-steak are dishes that have care put into them.The anime can have some small hiccups, like when a shot of Kotori from a medium distance looks weirdly wonky or some of the animation is slightly choppier than desired. However, animation usually keeps up when they are in the kitchen separating squid or mixing curry.What little flavor the show does contain comes solely from the designs of the characters. Especially Tsumugi. Her long, frazzled hair highlights her energetic personality. Wide eyes and a host of different outfits gives her the cute-kid look with ease. And her ginormous smile is infectious to the core.Kouhei and Kotori have their appeal, too. Kouhei’s polos, plain face, and square glasses scream fatherhood, and Kotori’s constant blushing and purple hair pinned up in a ponytail when cooking (to keep it out of the way) give her a welcoming aura. The Band-Aid on her finger is a nice touch and immediate reference to her knife-centric conflict.CHARACTERSThe cast of Amaama to Inazuma are more appetizing than its story and its art. Thanks mostly to a certain character (which anybody could guess on the first try): Tsumugi.In general, anime has a difficult time crafting kid characters. Usually, they just lean on the easy-out, making them too darn cute and overly nice. As though an angel descended from heaven in child form.Most people know that kids are not saints. Yes, they can be endearing and kind like any normal person, but they lack a very important trait: maturity. Toddlers, kids, and teenagers simply don’t have the life experience to socialize and approach everyday situations in a respectful, mature manner.Looking at Tsumugi, she is totally cute when she smiles her beaming smile after eating some good-tasting food, and she is more than nice when she cheers on her dad. But, best of all, she acts like a kid. She pouts uncontrollably when she gets into a fight with one of the boys at nursery school. She has a public temper tantrum after getting heavily scolded by Kouhei. She gets too rowdy one time, nearly ruining some of the food they were working on. She gets upset when she realizes that the okonomiyaki restaurant did not cook it in the style she thought they would.Tsumugi’s lack of maturity is not her only kid-defining trait; she has other characteristics that make her a believable child character. She loves Mr. GaliGali, a fluffy, pink animal from her favorite cartoon. She cannot stand vegetables, especially green peppers. She makes plans to invite everyone she knows to Kotori’s house for the “party” they will be having before receiving permission from Kotori and her mother. She has a tough time comprehending doughnuts because they are simultaneously a snack and a meal. She can only cut with a knife at most three times before getting exhausted.Amaama to Inazuma’s efforts to make Tsumugi into a realistic kid clearly show. She crafts personable scenes through her understandable actions and range of emotions. She is a top-tier example of what a child character can (and should) be, and, as such, she is arguably the best part of the entire show.Keeping an eye on her as much as he can, Kouhei, Tsumugi’s daddy, has his own direction. He’s an everyday guy, working as a teacher and caring for his daughter by himself. Just as Tsumugi lost a mother, he lost his dearly beloved wife. He grasps the gravity of this situation more than Tsumugi, but, as the parent, it’s his job to be there for her.And, as each episode depicts, he does just that. Nothing else enters his mind besides Tsumugi. What they do, where they go, and how they live always goes back to her, indicating his own strength as a parent. Because, for parents, their children are their everything, so it makes sense that he keeps her in mind with whatever dish they create next.Granted, he may be a bit too much on the soft side since he is quick to apologize to her when something unsavory goes down. However, he also has more sides to him than simply a passive father. He yells at Tsumugi when she went out by her lonesome. He teaches her how to get through to her friends. He cries tears of joy when he sees her finally enjoying food for the first time in a long time.He’s not as definitive of a father character as Tsumugi is a child character, but, like Tsumugi, his actions and emotions ground the anime in believability and therefore improve Amaama to Inazuma’s overall execution.Best of all is the relationship that Tsumugi and Kouhei share. Some of the strongest moments in the entire season form from their interactions. Whether it’s Tsumugi jumping onto her daddy’s back to console him or him sitting down and speaking with his daughter in earnest, their relationship likewise stands as a testament to the show’s believable direction.For that’s the whole point of the anime. It’s not at all the food, no matter how much it may seem that way. Rather, it’s their connection. A father and a daughter. The love they share, and the way in which they influence each other. In other words, they live lives filled with sweetness and as electrified as lightning because of the bond between them.That leaves Kotori who has been purposefully left out of the discussion up to this point. And for fair reason because she is easily the worst of the three.Her aichmophobia (or a fear of sharp things) pushes her to let Kouhei and Tsumugi use her family’s kitchen because she needed someone to handle the cutting and general knife-wielding. Kouhei obviously needed a more suitable cooking environment than his cramped apartment, so he had no qualms with her initial deception.Kotori has a mother whose television exploits embarrass her, and she has a deep affection for food, savoring it as much as possible whenever she sits down for a meal. She’s a kind person, aiding Kouhei in his quest to connect more with Tsumugi through the food they create.Unfortunately for her, she receives very little attention throughout the season. In essence, she becomes nothing more than a third wheel, her presence neither adding to nor subtracting from Amaama to Inazuma’s content.She does have a small moment when her friend Shinobu appears and she gets jealous that this special hobby may no longer involve just the three of them. But, when she does not have any interesting moments with Kouhei or Tsumugi, and other parts of her character besides her love of food go unexplored, she fails to have an impact on the anime.Worst of all, though, is how her fear of knives does not get resolved. She gets an extremely minor flashback, lasting not even three seconds, that depicted how her fear set in as a child. And Tsumugi’s own courage in using knives is noticed and addressed by Kotori. But the anime never has her face her fear, ultimately making her a third wheel that doesn’t even turn.SOUNDTo up Tsumugi’s believability even more, Amaama to Inazuma enlists Rina Endou, a child voice actress, to take on the role, and she does well. While her crying segments were slightly underwhelming, she nailed Tsumugi’s cute laugh, her happy comments, her pouting attitude, and her childlike wonder at the food before her.The original soundtrack also does well. The tracks are often very light, using xylophones, chimes, flutes, piano, and shakers to create small, catchy pieces that softly guide the different scenes along. Their friendly tone and how they do not overtake the scenes also add to their appeal. And the semi-grandiose track that plays whenever the meal is officially ready to eat may not be the best of the bunch, but it certainly highlights the show’s sense of fun.The opening track is rather recognizable with its back-and-forth, rising, and catchy lyrical play that makes up the beginning of the song and most of the second half, adding more of that lightheartedness and that fun the anime strives for. The background bells, the younger-sounding vocalist, and simplicity of the beat get at these qualities even more. It ends on a pretty abrupt note, but it’s overall a nice piece.The ending track goes nowhere near as energetic as the OP. Instead, it opts for a more reserved piece that highlights the contented side of life and the happiness that Kouhei, Tsumugi, and the others all share. The prominent guitar adds a feeling of nostalgia, and the vocal work brings the right amount of passion into the project. Like the OP, it sounds as though it ends before it wants to, but, once again like the OP, the ED is still a nice piece to listen to.ENJOYMENTThere’s not a ton of anime that focus on a father and his relationship with his child. But, each time I watch one, they only continue to instill in me my passion to have that connection myself someday.I think I’d be a good dad. Playing games of peek-a-boo or tag. Teaching him or her right from wrong. Being there for their biggest moments. I’d simply have to emulate my own father and the meticulous care he put into my own upbringing, and I’m sure I would be more than ready for whatever such a step in my life would bring.That’s not to say things would be easy. The tantrums, the difficulty of getting through to one’s child, and the worry of whether one is currently taking the correct action are all examples that I’m aware of. Examples that Tsumugi and Kouhei demonstrate through their own relationship.But the fun times would be there, too. Occasions like Kouhei excited over seeing Tsumugi in her first play or even simply her happiness and that toothy smile bringing him the utmost elation are ones that I myself hope to experience in due time.Moving from the personal to the material, I like the show a lot. Again, that’s very much thanks to Tsumugi. Her silly lines and reactions and her general positivity are heartwarming. Peering around the corner when peppers come into play and a mischievous expression that crosses her face when near Yagi’s house make her a fun, cute character. And, repetition aside, her dances and singing got me smiling and laughing with ease.Kouhei could be fun, too. While I would have liked to have seen him have more of a personality than just regular guy, he had his moments. He got super happy when Tsumugi, with tongue out and a “Nwope!”, turned down Mikio’s “marriage proposal.” And his concern for her picking up teenage jargon highlights his dad mentality to the core.Once again, the oddball out is Kotori. I don’t mind her because she’s nice and helpful. But she just exists without contributing much (if anything) to the dynamic that Tsumugi and Kouhei share. The same can be said for Shinobu and Yagi but to a much larger extent; they just weren’t around enough or did enough to warrant any significant feelings from me towards them.One final note that most likely needs addressing. I do not view Kotori’s relationship with Kouhei as romance-driven whatsoever. It never comes off that way from either of them. To me, she seems more like an older sister to Tsumugi and a teenage daughter to Kouhei.Which gets at my speculation that the anime will go that route with Kotori’s mother.The anime constantly alludes to this woman through Kotori. Plus, she is the one giving them the recipes to work with. She shows her face only once near the beginning and finally making an official appearance in the last episode (speaking the words about Kouhei’s love for Tsumugi that everyone else was too shy to say).Given that Kotori’s father is never mentioned (as far as I’m aware), the mother herself is a chef, and, again, how Kotori fits between Tsumugi and Kouhei, them all becoming a family makes both logical and narrative sense.All speculation and source-reading confirmation, of course. But it’s still fun to think about. Until I get a final answer (since the source for this anime is still ongoing), I’ll be going with these thoughts as my head canon.Amaama to Inazuma wastes a lot of its potential in its story when it cannot approach its content differently. However, the show contains many worthwhile characteristics. The relationship Tsumugi and Kouhei share, some strong musical and voice-acting performances, and enough cute moments to fill a buffet. The art and the animation leave one wanting, but this anime is a fried onion ring worth taking a bite out of.SUMMARYStory: Bad, a refusal to explore the more obvious topics on its plate and to deviate from its formulaic structure incite nausea, while the food motif both hinders and parallelsAnimation: Fine, Tsumugi’s design rocks, and the food doesn’t look gross, but not much else comes off as visually appetizingCharacters: Good, Tsumugi is one of the better kid characters in the medium due to her realistic portrayal, Kouhei emerges as a respectable father, and the connection they share matters most, but Kotori succumbs heavily to third-wheel syndromeSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, good OST, and good VA performancesEnjoyment: Great, being a father seems way too awesome to pass upFinal Score: 6/10 doesn’t taste as wonderful as the fried version. Instead, it roughly ends up somewhere in-between.STORYAmaama to Inazuma centers on the kind Kouhei Inuzuka and his darling daughter Tsumugi. The death of Kouhei’s wife has left Tsumugi without a mother, and, when he realizes that Tsumugi no longer likes the boring food he has been giving her, he takes it upon himself to learn how to cook and provide her with meals that will make her happy.

She shows her face only once near the beginning and finally making an official appearance in the last episode (speaking the words about Kouhei’s love for Tsumugi that everyone else was too shy to say).Given that Kotori’s father is never mentioned (as far as I’m aware), the mother herself is a chef, and, again, how Kotori fits between Tsumugi and Kouhei, them all becoming a family makes both logical and narrative sense.All speculation and source-reading confirmation, of course. But it’s still fun to think about. Until I get a final answer (since the source for this anime is still ongoing), I’ll be going with these thoughts as my head canon.Amaama to Inazuma wastes a lot of its potential in its story when it cannot approach its content differently. However, the show contains many worthwhile characteristics. The relationship Tsumugi and Kouhei share, some strong musical and voice-acting performances, and enough cute moments to fill a buffet. The art and the animation leave one wanting, but this anime is a fried onion ring worth taking a bite out of.SUMMARYStory: Bad, a refusal to explore the more obvious topics on its plate and to deviate from its formulaic structure incite nausea, while the food motif both hinders and parallelsAnimation: Fine, Tsumugi’s design rocks, and the food doesn’t look gross, but not much else comes off as visually appetizingCharacters: Good, Tsumugi is one of the better kid characters in the medium due to her realistic portrayal, Kouhei emerges as a respectable father, and the connection they share matters most, but Kotori succumbs heavily to third-wheel syndromeSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, good OST, and good VA performancesEnjoyment: Great, being a father seems way too awesome to pass upFinal Score: 6/10', 'My quest to find the perfect ""foodie"" anime continues with this.Story 8/10The struggling single father tries to connect with his young daughter through learning how to cook, he receives an offer from a lonely student with a workaholic mother who has a restaurant (now closed) due to her TV work. They decide to cook, and eat together. This is a slice of life with a different recipe and life lessons each episode. The kid having meltdowns and drama at day care, that was so real, every parent has experienced something like this. Great story.Art 5/10This should have been much, much better with better animation.

Now , you have a dad who was seemly not looking for another love interest after his wife died were it could be filled up by  Kotori Iida, his student. Now going back to the dad,  Kōhei Inuzuka, he strikes me as a wimpy type who somehow spoils his daughter Tsumugi whereby he can seem to give her some spanking when she's in a tantrum, also even in the manga he has to play this typical guy character who is the quintessential oblivious to the girl's feelings towards him.... I guess blame it on writers, Gido Amagakure  and Mitsutaka Hirota not making such arc possible , since Tsumugi seem  get along with Kotori Iida. As for Kotori Iida, I kinda like that she has the potential to be a good step mom to Tsumugi, but alas his anime ended without such arc occurring, btw I kinda hate it that this anime ended where she's still afraid of using knives, you one episode would have made such impact if there is a situation where she struggle to overcome her fear of knives with help of her sensei and then succeeds, but no this anime was just to focus on food and not making any development. Tsumugi Inuzuka maybe a cute and smart kid at one point you might wanna adore her, but on the other hand there are situations that you just wanna give her some spanking cu'z of her tantrums, so one more reason for the low score, cu'z I kinda feel like going there and give her some spanking. Also as for Shinobu Kojika and  Yūsuke Yagi, it was too bad that studio TMS Entertainment didn't even bother to give them their own arc and just limit them as supports...another reason for my low score for this category.Enjoyment, well it was enjoyable to a certain degree, but one would start to get bore after episode 7 and just go for the final episode, in my case , I've skip ep 9, 10 and 11, before going for ep 12. So, it's a 6 over 10.Overall, this anime is 3 over 10 since this anime's theme on food porn coincided with another anime with a food porn theme,  Shokugeki no Soma: The Second Plate, where it has more to offer than this anime. Thought they were shown on different schedules , they both belong to the same season and frankly it's a bad idea for  TMS Entertainment to pit this with the other anime, and that's that.Souma OUT! every seiyuu who did the character's voice were ok, but my score is for the opening and Tsumugi's cute voice, it's a 7 over 10 here.Character, I give this part a 3 over 10, due to the fact that the character's here are quite a dichotomy.

They have fun times and sometimes not so fun times, all the while the show focuses on filial bonding via making and eating delicious food, usually with said widower's student, Kotori.Not much happens...in the show, since it's a SoL series, though there is a touch of character growth throughout. It's a bit predictable, even. Kotori has a precocious crush on her teacher that never really goes anywhere, thank goodness, because it isn't that sort of anime. Kouhei himself is something of a befuddled dad stock character, but the show's warmth and charm make it an easy, cozy, and enjoyable watch for those who take comfort in domestic matters. It's the kind of show that's easy to pick up or put down, since you'll know if you like it or not in the first episode, and I highly recommend it to people who like cute shows about cute people (who aren't necessarily high/middle school girls) doing cute things together. It's an anime you can easily show your non-anime watching friends, too, since it's so sweet and easygoing without a hint of lewdness.

Often times with slice of life they tend to add too many characters within a short episode span, and kind feel overwhelming.But Amaama to Inazuma has a solid cast, mostly between Kohei, Kotori, and Tsumugi. Without a doubt Tsumugi steals the show with her adorable antics and keeps the episodes fresh with her father attempting to deal with her tantrums and school troubles. Its heartwarming to see Kohei try...his best, especially being a single father. But the people around him, with the friends he makes along the way really aid him when at times he\'s unable to understand Tsumugi.All that being said, the cooking is really in the foreground here, and I don\'t recommend watching this show on an empty stomach. Seeing Kohei gradually become more accustomed to cooking and learning to make more dishes throughout the span of the episode is a satisfying arc to watch. And it makes it all the more worthwhile seeing his daughter\'s reaction to them when he does a good job. Even to the point where it makes her cry, which I found to be very sweet. The art is very lively and colorful, and my goodness Tsumugi has the most sparkly and expressive eyes in the show.You\'ll definitely be invested in the characters here, and I do wish there was another season included just to see what other dishes they\'d attempt to make next.

It\'s not necessarily binge worthy, as you\'ll pick up pretty soon that most of the episodes play out pretty similarly.

Here are my thoughts:The anime is mainly focused on a single widowed father and his kindergarten-ish age daughter. Cooking is the primary focus of the show and the bulk of each episode revolves around cooking in some way. This cooking theme is a major component of the anime's appeal, at least from my point of view.I don't like the daughter character's voice actor. She sounds like she has food in her mouth or something. Really unnatural-sounding voice acting in her case. Otherwise, the show's audio is completely unremarkable.Don't really like the character designs, although they appear to be accurate depictions...of the manga art. Animation quality is okay and the art style is bland.Emotional aspects of the show feel forced and artificial. The characters are quite bland and lacking in personality. Spuriously sentimental moments are often forcefed to the viewer in a way that feels crude and unnatural.The main characters are literally imbeciles. To the point that it's both unbelievable and infuriating. Actually, none of the characters are particularly likable.I did appreciate that there was sometimes considerable detail shown in the cooking processes. At the same time though, the most detailed scenes were often the most frustrating because the incompetence of the characters was illuminated to an even greater degree. For example, there was one otherwise okay episode where the characters randomly are gifted fish which was freshly caught off a pier from a stranger on a hot day. The characters gut the fish and proceed to eat it as sashimi on impulse, and even feed some to the ~6 year old daughter character. No sanitation or deep freezing procedures are used to eliminate parasites, so it's fairly dangerous, particularly for a child. I used to eat freshly caught fish raw too IRL before I learned how stupid it was. Anyway, this is just one of many examples where my enjoyment is compromised by the idiotic behaviour of the characters. Generally speaking I'm quite permissive in this regard when it comes to anime, and I'm not the type to ever complain about 'realism', but still the constant incompetence of the characters was off-putting to me. It was well beyond the realm of endearing and deep into annoying territory.Aside from the kind-of-unique premise, this anime does not bring a lot to the table. It doesn't take any risks, yet still it doesn't do anything particularly well. Nothing about it is particularly noteworthy. It's not terrible; I still watched the entire thing. It's just an unremarkable mediocre anime mainly focused on cooking. I like cooking, so from my subjective point of view it was still watchable. It was nothing more than something to fall asleep to at the end of the day.Overall rating: 5/10My initial impression was that this anime had some promise but it ended up just being totally mediocre.

It mixes both the joy of child raising and the grievances that come from its responsibilities in a daily basis, focusing particularly on bonds shared over a home-cooked meal by a father and his daughter.Presentation-wise it is moderately standard both in sound design and artwork. As the former shines mostly on the cooking sections, with slightly rushed step by step recipes which can be implemented nonetheless, the latter is highlighted in both the opening and ending songs, which are respectively invigorating and...peaceful, as is often the case in this genre.On the lower end comes the somewhat formulaic play on each epsiode, starting from early on. Even if done in a suitable manner, it ends up hurting the parental development that the show could potentially achieve, as well as diminishing the conflict presented on each one. As so, it could also be portrayed as a cooking show with an attached story.All in all, I recommend it for its comforting family nature as well as its take on cooking, not so much for its overall parenthood story progress. peaceful, as is often the case in this genre.On the lower end comes the somewhat formulaic play on each epsiode, starting from early on.

Though it takes the form of a typical episodic series with a different recipe every instalment, the series still touches upon more profound themes of fatherhood and grief as father and daughter have to adjust to life after the death of Tsumugi's mother.In this way, it is atypical in its genre– though not fully developed, it explores the hole left in our lives after the death of a family member: how we struggle to fill their role in the life of our loved ones, and how cherished and profound their contributions...are in our lives (even if it is as simple as a home-cooked meal that we miss). When viewed in this light, the challenges that Tsumugi's father faces are more than simply learning how to cook. In a period of time in Japan where the responsibilities of raising children and domestic chores are still placed on women, it's refreshing to see an anime that celebrates the efforts of a single father.The overall tone still remains light-hearted and filled with scenes of general cuteness from Tsumugi and the high-school girl that cooks alongside her and her father.

He's particularly bad at cooking, but one surprising invitation from one of his students, Kotori Iida, to bring his daughter to have dinner at her mom's restaurant, takes them into a cooking journey, from burger to okonomiyaki.Each episode is a self-contained story that surrounds around Tsumugi wanting to eat something, then Kouhei and Kotori rushing to prepare it using a nice restaurant kitchen and appliances.

He's really an endearing guy and you can't hope but cheer for everything to go his way.

Sweetness and Lightning or Amaama to Inazuma for the weebs who can't stand translated titles, is an interesting mish-mash of ideas. Primarily I think it wants to be a food...anime, as everything always manages to come back to cooking, but it also tries to juggle themes of parenting and an implied student x teacher romance. I had a bet with my brother as we were watching it that the girl's mom who was supposedly a famous chef wasn't real, because of how often they bent the plot over backward to have her not be around.

However, I didn't get the same feel for it. The characters and initial plot are interesting, original, cute, and even yummier, and the first few episodes are definitely worth a watch, but after that, it gets monotonous and boring.I personally couldn't bring myself to finish this series because I got so sick and bored of the roundabout plot and gave up on it knowing that I probably wouldn't miss much anyways. The anime ends up focusing too much on just food and ignores character and outside plot development...which is really not what I look for in a good anime. I would blame the manga for dragging down this anime because the plot isn't much better there (caught up as of now) though. If you like the manga, the anime is exactly like the manga, so if you're that kind of person, definitely give this anime a go because it doesn't stray for the manga.TL;DR: just watch the first few episodes and save your time, but if you want to learn how to make a few dishes anime style, give it a go, but don't count on it turning out too well. which is really not what I look for in a good anime.

I'm talking about Amaama to Inazuma, an anime that tries to be heartwarming and endearing but falls short in almost every way.The premise of Amaama to Inazuma is fairly simple. Our protagonist, Kouhei, is a single father raising his daughter, Tsumugi, on his own. When Tsumugi expresses an interest in cooking, Kouhei enlists the help of one of his students, Kotori, to teach them both how to make delicious meals. Along the way, they form a makeshift family and learn important life lessons.Unfortunately, the execution of this...premise is lackluster at best. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real depth or complexity. The humor falls flat, relying on tired cliches and predictable gags that are more likely to elicit an eye-roll than a chuckle.The animation in Amaama to Inazuma is serviceable enough, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of substance in the story. Even the attempts at emotional moments fall flat, with the characters' struggles feeling contrived and unearned.Well, isn't this just an anime that's as exciting as a trip to the dentist? It's almost enough to make me want to switch over to watching paint dry.Overall, I'd give Amaama to Inazuma a score of 4.2/10. While it might appeal to fans of the slice-of-life genre, it's unlikely to win over anyone looking for a more engaging and entertaining anime.--------------------------------------Halo, dan selamat datang di anime yang sebiasa bubur oatmeal tanpa gula.

But the reason I would not recommend it is that it is simply unreal, fake. The child does not act liek a child. She acts like someone without children would imagine a child to act. When she expresses actual trait a children might have, it is sullenness or stubbornness, her father first does not know how to react properly and then apologises to her for not acting properly (e.g. Daddy is sorry for not scolding you enough).The parenting is so wrong here that the cuteness...the authors are trying to go for feels kinda repulsive. the authors are trying to go for feels kinda repulsive.', 'This show can\'t decide if it\'s about lonely individuals finding each other and becoming family, or if it\'s just a cooking appreciation show.Based on the premise, you\'d expect that this show would focus on interpersonal relationships and the difficulty of single parenting.

Demi-chan wa Kataritai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33988/Demi-chan_wa_Kataritai,"[""Monster girls to ecchi are like strong characters to shounen. Just like how a shounen anime would feel strange without a cast of muscular fighters and hotheaded heroes, an anime about monster girls would feel insufficient when lacking the presence of slender harpies and buxom centaurs.But is it possible for monster girls in anime to be presented as something else other than fetish fuel? What if they possess charm, cuteness, and character worth sympathizing for?Enter Winter 2017, and Demi-chan wa Kataritai arrives to answer my call.At first glance, Demi-chan wa Kataritai seems to be a harmless slice of life with a dash of supernatural...elements. Cute girls? Check. Pleasing visuals? Check. No solid plot whatsoever? Check. All these common tropes are present, so some might simply pass it off as another moe-fest destined for the backlog. But don’t be fooled! Beneath an otherwise generic sounding premise lies an anime consisting of likable characters, great social commentary, and the right dosage of comedy.Since it lacks a distinct plot, Demi-chan wa Kataritai primarily markets itself using an all-lovable cast. In this feat, it really succeeds. You’ll be expecting a trio of BFF schoolgirls, a teacher with hilarious romantic issues, and a biology instructor who looks like Okabe Rintarou twenty years after Steins;Gate ended. The catch? Except for our eccentric teacher protagonist, all the main characters are monster girls—or demi-humans, as the show calls it—of various species.What makes these characters entertaining, however, aren’t their abnormalities, but rather their struggles in coping with them to adapt to human society. Hikari is an upbeat vampire girl who quarrels with her sister often because of issues such as placing her blood packs in random places. Machi is a dullahan who feels that her headless presence would forever create tension between her and everyone else. Yuki the snow woman is worried that becoming too close to others would cause them to meet a cold demise. Sakie is a succubus teacher who dresses conservatively from fear of seducing males in her vicinity. Rather than merely being demi-humans for the sake of vanity, the characters of Demi-chan wa Kataritai learn to deal with problems that stem from their irregularities. It’s an interesting formula that always provides each new episode with a fresh perspective.Of course, how can we forget the protagonist himself? Tetsuo might be the only male and human of the group, but such normalcy only makes him even more intriguing. As both a mentor and father figure to the girls, Tetsuo tasks himself with the mission to discover more about demi-humans by conducting casual interviews with them during recess hours. Some interviews will make you laugh, others will educate you more about the girl’s species, and in few instances, these interviews can bring you warm feelings. Whatever the case, Tetsuo's dynamic conversations with the girls represent the soul of Demi-chan wa Kataritai.Admittedly, the show can sometimes veer dangerously into harem territory whenever the girls show borderline lust for Tetsuo due to the intimacy of the interviews. But since Tetsuo is their sole source of help to cope with human society, how can we blame the poor guy for inviting unwanted attention? Thankfully, this point isn’t major enough to turn the show into a full-blown harem like Monster Musume.Demi-chan wa Kataritai also surprises its viewers with a good deal of social commentary. Think back to the girls struggling to adapt to school life because of their differences; doesn’t that sound a lot like contemporary issues regarding prejudice? Though Demi-chan wa Kataritai appears to be fluffy on the surface, it’s certainly not afraid to tackle serious matters during certain points. In one episode, a visiting detective named Ugaki discusses with Tetsuo about the state of demi-humans in Japan. Despite being regarded as perpetrators of crimes in the past, says Ugaki, demi-humans have now come so far as to become respected members of the national police force. Another episode involves Tetsuo realizing the struggles of Hikari’s family to make their vampire daughter feel welcome at home—a responsibility that doesn’t burden them even one bit due to their overwhelming love for their daughter. These problems might only be a fleeting extra for most people, but attentive viewers would be quick to draw parallels between these subtle messages and real-life contemporary issues. Small tidbits like this make Demi-chan wa Kataritai an engaging show to just about anyone.Now that the darker stuff is out of the way, what about the humor? In a time where most slice of life rely too much on their moe factor to produce chuckles from the audience, Demi-chan wa Kataritai thankfully carries a brand of comedy that feels surprisingly genuine. Loudmouthed Hikari is obviously the main perpetrator of laughs, but I also had fun watching Sakie struggle with romantic concepts and Machi being oblivious to non-academic pursuits.  During the second half, however, the show feels somewhat less funny, but that may be due to the story trying to wrap things up for the finale.Character designs in Demi-chan wa Kataritai are nothing groundbreaking, but the show’s bright color palette creates a good match with the uplifting nature of the story. The hair color for the girls and the scenery of the backdrops give me the impression of a city version of Non Non Biyori, another slice of slice series which ironically bears many resemblances to Demi-chan wa Kataritai. The OP and ED themes are catchy enough, but what’s most interesting about them are their visuals. For a small treat, pay careful attention to them as you progress through the show.Proving that anime with monster girls can be something different, Demi-chan wa Kataritai marks itself as an endearing slice of life that plays with the not-so-similar elements of cuteness and social issues. Despite being buried underneath this season’s big hitters like KonoSuba S2 and Masamune’s Revenge, Demi-chan wa Kataritai won’t fail to surprise viewers with its interesting take on an otherwise unremarkable premise.My only wish now is that I can find a real-life figure like Tetsuo to be my life coach. elements.

Not a single bit of this anime bores me with its cute and childish ascription on these demi girls action and their way of voice inflection or the way they talk basically. I mean the premise here might resemble to that of monster musume, but the way the story have been going so far is entirely different. And yes, this is a slice to life anime, well im sure you could tell from seeing the cover of this anime. However, another reason that this anime is just great...would be due to the way the story goes, despite being a slice to life. This anime explores different kinds of trivial and issues that these demi girls may have, while coexisting with humans and how their ability or natural phenomenon of being around humans affects them psychologically, or physically  . Physically as in the arousal of libido drive, or psychologically like fear or being treated differently from the majority, which the majority here would be the humans, and the minority would be the demi.I personally finds these kind of story intriguing and riveting to see, given that they actually go deeper in human's interaction and the de minimis (wtf is this word lmao) they that carries around. Some of these traits, features, or qualities would then resulted in isolation, avoidance of contact with humans, or awkwardness in a group conversation when the demi tries to get involve which has been shown in the anime. And the way they work those kind of motif to represent the themes of possibly discrimination, isolation due to their identity, and so forth is pretty enthralling to see.Some of the dialogue at times is pretty deep as well. The anime explores both human's rational behind their bad behavior, or the intention of doing something to harm other out of their inferiority complex and mental weaknesses in confronting them. Or how public appearances are kept a certain way in a specific environment or occupation to act like a person who are in that social position, and so forth.And surprising the animation is pretty good as well. Aside from the pretty lame ass, and generic looking MC of both personality and their character designs (i mean his face kinda reminds me of the MC from gates, the fantasy army vs military one). Even so, you would prolly fall in love with most of the character within this show, despite the MC looking pretty humdrum and bland. Well you will like him too in the long run.Well but to keep it short, the theme had me digging, the cuteness and the funny kawai desu ne through childish and random cute sounds to weird sounds and its interesting interaction is what make me like this anime, while keep watching for more of its content. But seriously, this anime is so underrated man.

I watch a lot of anime regularly and often dislike most moeblob anime, so it’s pretty unusual that I truly enjoyed this series enough to be smiling in excitement when each new episode aired. This is a review without any plot spoilers beyond the first episode.TLDR/Summary at the endWhat if rare and terrifying monsters were actually cute teenage girls that attended school ordinarily like humans? At first glance, this anime may seem like just...another ordinary fun “cute girl” series, but there is something special---something much more unique about this series that sets it apart from the others. This anime distinguishes itself by beautifully conveying some of the different social consequences of being a monster or “demi-human” trying to assimilate into human society, while the series also injects you with a profound dosage of “cuteness” in the process.Story: 8/10Tetsuo Takahashi or ""Takahashi-sensei"" is a male biology teacher who has been fascinated by the biological nature of demi-human for a while. He’s well-respected throughout the school for his warmhearted approach to students, but he’s never actually encountered a demi-human before since they are extremely rare beings. By a huge stroke of plot---I mean luck, four demi-human girls end up in the same school as him. The story begins from there while primarily following Takahashi as he works to understand and help the four of them with their demi-human characteristics in this show’s ordinary school setting. The story shows the struggles of the four demis and their biological characteristics as they live their daily school lives. Afterall, how does a Dullahan, Vampire, Yuki Onna, and Succubus actually even function in ordinary society? Find out by watching the show :)Considering the core elements of this story, the story itself was absolutely beautiful thanks to its primary focus being different from just “cute girl” eye candy, unlike many other similar anime. There’s a certain degree of realism to the storyline since the characters develop as you would expect a real person to. This makes the characters more interesting and relatable than anime with generic characters. I appreciated the fact that there was very little fanservice in this anime because I feel that it would take away from the genuine fuzzy warmth of this series. However, I also feel that any fanservice in this series was timed appropriately to fit the anime’s settings. The pacing was pretty good; I didn\'t feel that this anime was too slow or moved too fast. Also, the light-humor in the series was timed perfectly and hit hard, which made even it more entertaining to watch. While everything in this series was really enjoyable, there weren\'t really any moments that made me “think” or “feel” strongly about something. That quality is what I feel separates a really good series from a great one, so the story can only get a max score of eight from me.Art: 7/10The art is pretty damn simple in general. The color scheme is basic, but they used a lot of light and vibrant colors to give a pretty light-hearted mood. There is nothing particularly unique about the art style, but this show did do “cute” really well and, let’s be honest, that’s all it really needs anyways. I like the fact that the characters aren’t just “cute” in the sense that they just look like moeblobs with faces. Instead, the characters’ cuteness comes from various hairstyles and facial expression ranges, that were thoroughly expressed through the artstyle. The background art is nothing spectacular and is pretty average, but the 3DCG blended nicely into the backgrounds. The camera angles weren’t really THAT good because of the plentiful amount of stagnant angles, where only the character moves. The animation’s frame-rate is pretty normal for a series like this. Overall, the art is nothing special. However, they did do “cute” rather well, so it deserves a seven to me.Sound: 6.5/10The opening is really good and perfectly sets the mood for the anime. The ending’s pretty generic, but still fits. The background music in this anime is pretty damn unnoticeable except for a few pieces that really stand out. There’s really only one OST from this anime (that I recall) that I would actually enjoy listening to on my spare time. The voice actors/actresses voiced their roles very well, there wasn’t any particularly unique or powerful about their voices but their voices were all pretty mellow and nice to listen to. Overall, the Sound is only slightly better than average, but the perfect opening accounts for the .5 additional I gave it.Character:9/10I feel that the characters were the strongest point of this series. Takahashi-sensei comes across as a mature older adult who is a genuine person when it comes to helping the “demis”. He’s a buff science-minded adult who’s kind of like a father-figure to the demi students. The demi girls each have their own unique personality that I truly came to love and appreciate.Yuki comes across as a shy, misunderstood, kind of awkward girl, but she becomes more confident and we see various other fun sides to her personality as the series progresses. She\'s often the one laughing at jokes in secret and she turned out to be my favorite character in the show.Machi is a very intelligent girl who loves to study and is very humble. She\'s relatively shy as well but is great when it comes to spoken academic subjects like speeches, unlike Yuki.Satou-Sensei is a pretty awkward 24-year old succubus who\'s shy mainly because she often strongly attracts people of the opposite gender because of her nature. Her awkwardness is often the source of the comedy relating to her.Hikari is basically an honest, lovable, and lively extroverted girl. She\'s not smart and not studious. Her personality is very necessary for this story, but I didn’t really see her as anything ""new"" or ""special"" per se. Overall, this series has some really lovable characters; watching them overcome their nature, seeing them grow closer together, and witnessing their group dynamic are probably the most fulfilling aspects of this series.Enjoyment:9/10As I mentioned numerous times throughout this review, I truly enjoyed the entirety of this series this series and actually re-watched some scenes several times!TLDR (Summary)Overall:8/10This series was an unexpectedly entertaining watch as it followed the biology teacher, Takahashi-sensei, as he helps four girl with their demi-human characteristics. The series surprisingly goes pretty deep into the scientific logic of ""demi-humans"". The art was nothing spectacular, but the vibrancy of the colors helped to set a light-hearted mood for the viewers. The VAs and music were only slightly above average, but the opening set the tone perfectly for the series. The characters were the strongest point of the series because of their diverse, non-archetype personalities also because of the group dynamic that the characters create together.Bottom line: would I recommend this to you?If you like light-hearted, school, cute girls, and/or fantasy anime, then yes this is a great series to check out.If you enjoy a nice non-dramatic story, then sure.If you’re looking for romance, fanservice, super powers, or action, then no. It doesn’t focus on any of those.Hope this helps you make your decision! Let me know if you agree or disagree~ another ordinary fun “cute girl” series, but there is something special---something much more unique about this series that sets it apart from the others. This anime distinguishes itself by beautifully conveying some of the different social consequences of being a monster or “demi-human” trying to assimilate into human society, while the series also injects you with a profound dosage of “cuteness” in the process.Story: 8/10Tetsuo Takahashi or ""Takahashi-sensei"" is a male biology teacher who has been fascinated by the biological nature of demi-human for a while. He’s well-respected throughout the school for his warmhearted approach to students, but he’s never actually encountered a demi-human before since they are extremely rare beings. By a huge stroke of plot---I mean luck, four demi-human girls end up in the same school as him. The story begins from there while primarily following Takahashi as he works to understand and help the four of them with their demi-human characteristics in this show’s ordinary school setting. The story shows the struggles of the four demis and their biological characteristics as they live their daily school lives. Afterall, how does a Dullahan, Vampire, Yuki Onna, and Succubus actually even function in ordinary society? Find out by watching the show :)Considering the core elements of this story, the story itself was absolutely beautiful thanks to its primary focus being different from just “cute girl” eye candy, unlike many other similar anime. There’s a certain degree of realism to the storyline since the characters develop as you would expect a real person to. This makes the characters more interesting and relatable than anime with generic characters. I appreciated the fact that there was very little fanservice in this anime because I feel that it would take away from the genuine fuzzy warmth of this series. However, I also feel that any fanservice in this series was timed appropriately to fit the anime’s settings. The pacing was pretty good; I didn\'t feel that this anime was too slow or moved too fast. Also, the light-humor in the series was timed perfectly and hit hard, which made even it more entertaining to watch. While everything in this series was really enjoyable, there weren\'t really any moments that made me “think” or “feel” strongly about something. That quality is what I feel separates a really good series from a great one, so the story can only get a max score of eight from me.Art: 7/10The art is pretty damn simple in general. The color scheme is basic, but they used a lot of light and vibrant colors to give a pretty light-hearted mood. There is nothing particularly unique about the art style, but this show did do “cute” really well and, let’s be honest, that’s all it really needs anyways. I like the fact that the characters aren’t just “cute” in the sense that they just look like moeblobs with faces. Instead, the characters’ cuteness comes from various hairstyles and facial expression ranges, that were thoroughly expressed through the artstyle. The background art is nothing spectacular and is pretty average, but the 3DCG blended nicely into the backgrounds. The camera angles weren’t really THAT good because of the plentiful amount of stagnant angles, where only the character moves. The animation’s frame-rate is pretty normal for a series like this. Overall, the art is nothing special. However, they did do “cute” rather well, so it deserves a seven to me.Sound: 6.5/10The opening is really good and perfectly sets the mood for the anime. The ending’s pretty generic, but still fits. The background music in this anime is pretty damn unnoticeable except for a few pieces that really stand out.

Let me know if you agree or disagree~', 'Imagine being a vampire not allowed to sink its fangs into humans, a dullahan that has to carry its head everywhere it goes or a succubus who\'s occupation forbids sexual temptation. Interviews with monster girls is a social commentary on how difficult - and often scary - it can be to ingratiate oneself into a foreign society. Four Demi-humans have to overcome their own biology for the sake of living in harmony, and it proves to be a difficult adjustment for them to make.Satou Sakie is convinced she will never have a genuine relationship when every man she touches is reduced to a puddle of...lust. The 24 year old succubus lives in total isolation, takes the first and last trains each day, never applies makeup and wears a jumpsuit all to limit the chances of influencing her students and innocent bystanders with her aphrodisiac effect, often to no avail.Yuki Kisakabe also struggles with controlling her powers, preemptively isolating herself from others in fear of accidentally freezing them to death. Underneath her cold facade is a personality no different than your usual perverted high school kid, but she\'s too insecure in her own self control to trust anyone around her. """"If I weren\'t a Demi...I wouldn\'t feel like this"" whimpered a tearful yuki, who broke down in the hallway after overhearing a mean spirited conversation about her.Machi Kyouko\'s head is detached from her own body. She is in CONSTANT need of attention from others around her, much more so than any other Demi, to help assist in basic movement but is painfully shy about asking others to help her. She finds it difficult socializing with those who don\'t have the same struggles she does.The only Demi unconcerned with her nature is the energetic vampire Hikari who is always the center of attention and serves as the source of most comedic moments in the anime. She is often finding herself in mischief and proudly states ""I am, and always have been, just that negligent!"" - much to the chagrin of her younger sister. Despite these flaws, Hikari is a sincerely kind person and sticks up for her friends in times of need. A particularly awesome moment is when she defends Yuki from bullies that were gossiping in the bathroom. I felt like playing a DMX track in the background when she stepped to those girls and exclaimed ""If you want to hang around and badmouth people, you\'d better do it where I can\'t find you"". Hikari also has a subversion to her mythical trope - she loves to eat garlic and can see herself in mirrors just fine.It would\'ve been easy to make these characters a carbon copy of their supernatural legends. Instead they\'re the opposite attempting to live in spite of their oddities. These girls are as lovable can be, but also very sympathetic figures who you\'re made to root for throughout the anime as you quickly forget that they\'re monsters, and every bit as normal as the kind hearted teacher who tries his best to help them succeed.Takahashi sensei brings the cast all together. While the biology teacher may look unremarkable, he sincerely cares about helping the Demi\'s live comfortable lives and stops at nothing to come up with creative solutions to their complex problems. The way that we become excited about a favorite anime getting greenlit for a second season, he does about learning more about the Demi\'s biology and adding notes to his research.Machi is infatuated with Takahashi sensei\'s kindness and gentle approach to helping her adjust to life in a human school. This is sweet, but also uncomfortable when they\'re decades apart and in a teacher/student relationship. I\'m all for a well portrayed forbidden love story (i.e Koi Kaze, segments of Revolutionary Girl Utena) but Interviews With Monster Girls does not establish the proper platform to even tease that development. Sakie on the other hand is a perfect ship for Takahashi. I\'m actively rooting for the two to wind up together.I would\'ve liked to have seen more monster girls. There are so many different legends that can explored in this setting. Imagine a werewolf that has problems with controlling transformations or a siren who refrains from speaking because the dangers of her voice. It also would be cool to see some monster guys. That would be the best avenue to introduce romantic partners for the girls rather than using Takahashi sensei as a harem ringmaster.  It\'s doubtful this anime will get a second season anytime soon with the manga already being fully adapted, but hopefully the sales from this season encourage the production committee to make a continuation when there\'s enough material.AI pictures has taken a lot grief over the past few years for being too formulaic, but Monster Girls is a welcomed addition to a genre that needs more variation than just Moe blob.

I mean interviewing them to get an insight to their true nature. Clearly law enforcement, teacher conduct codes, and statutory rape have different definitions in that reality.It's a cringeworthy story as how NOT to behave around those you're tasked to educate and nurture--and also how to get thrown in jail in 99% of the civilized world.Oh, and apparently Japanese are obsessed with...Dullahans, this one is nowhere near as fascinating and charming as Celty.If you want to watch an anime about the awkwardness of coming of age, with the added bonus that your head is not attached to your body and therefore can do creative and perverted things (I shit you not, this is a line from the show), then by all means turn yourself into the nearest authorities.

A dullahan? Perhaps a succubus? Biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi did! These beings, several species in a class known as “ajin” or “demi-humans”, shortened to “demis”, are scarcely seen in society, though four come to attend the same school as Tetsuo! Interviews with Monster Girls is a cute, heartfelt, surprisingly deep comedy that will certainly impress with its lively cast.Will you like it?You may enjoy  Interviews with Monster Girls if you…-- enjoy light-hearted series with a heavy character focus-- find yourself intrigued by contemporary interpretations of the supernatural-- seek a “feel-good” sort of experienceYou may not enjoy...Interviews with Monster Girls if you…-- generally stray from character-centric series wherein the focus are school girls-- expect the series to be anything similar to Monster Musume no Iru NichijouStoryInterviews with Monster Girls adapts the ongoing eponymous manga series authored by Japanese mangaka Petos, published under the Kodanasha brand.Tetsuo Takahashi, hereafter referred to as “Takahashi-sensei” or simply “Tetsuo”, is a biology teacher who retains an inquisitive fascination for demi-humans, beings very similar to humans yet expressing inhuman and otherwise supernatural characteristics. Historically, they have been viewed with distrust by their mortal counterparts, though contemporary movements and cultural shifts have allowed them to integrate well into society. Even so,  they are exceedingly rare, and few ever have the opportunity to meet such intriguing individuals.Coincidentally enough, three demis come to be students at his Shizaki High School: Hikari Takanashi (a vampire), Kyouko Machi (a dullahan), and Yuki Kusakabe (an ice woman). A fourth demi Sakie Satou (a succubus) is hired to be the newest math teacher. As the series progresses, Tetsuo becomes friends with each of the demis, seeking not only to learn more about them but make their lives and integration into human society more comfortable through a greater understanding of what makes them unique.There’s a certain range of depth Interviews with Monster Girls explores that truly sets it apart from series within its genre. Heavy topics such as discrimination, adaptation, and fitting-in are discussed thoroughly as Tetsuo’s studies of the demis develop. We come to understand how these otherwise normal girls face issues just by existing in, what is to them, a very foreign world, both in physiological and social terms. While, mostly unfortunately, our world is not populated by these fascinating creatures, there are humans that have suffered from the same issues the demis do, allowing for such a real world application to greatly enrich the merit of the story.Genre & CharacteristicsAs the title suggests, the existence of “monster girls” or “demi-humans” indicates the presence of supernatural characteristics, though in small amounts as per the rarity of such beings and their willingness to assimilate human characteristics. While at first glance you may be unsure how beings such as vampires can life safely among their supposed prey in humans, the writers impress well in their justification. Mutations in reproduction are offered as a source of the demis in lieu of otherwise mythological origins, and the supernatural characteristics are explained in creative and believable ways. For instance, the intoxicating effect that succubi have on males is attributed to the production of pheromones or aphrodisiacs. Quantum physics was touched up to describe how a dullahan can exist with his or her head “visibly” separated from their body. Much of the series concerns itself with Tetsuo’s revelation of “how” and “why” demis work, turning it into, at times, somewhat of a pseudo-educational series.Expanding upon a point made earlier, something important to realize about this series is that it is not, as some may initially assume, Monster Musume-lite. While the two series share many similarities, most notably in the “monster girls” aspect, Interviews with Monster Girls is not a harem, nor does it engage in a sexual focus you’d come to expect from an ecchi like Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. While topics of sexual origin are occasionally discussed, they are brought up as a result of Tetsuo’s wish to understand the demis physiological nature, not through personal interest of the girls (yes, even Sakie). A certain demi does develop somewhat of a crush on Takahashi-sensei, though it’s understood that such feeling is one-sided, and more as a hormonal reaction to his dedication to make the lives of demis like herself easier.Since no series is perfect, I want to expand upon something that really holds it back in that, at times, the thematic exposition can often come across to the viewer as either preachy or staged, greatly affecting the otherwise genuine feel of the series. No viewer ever wants to feel as if they’re being lectured to, and unfortunately some scenes give off that vibe. I recall a specific event in an early episode where one of the demis confronts a gossiping duo about their actions, and while the message is important and was received, there could have been better ways to execute the dialogue without having the scene seem like a public service announcement. The best way for a series to convey a thematic message is by not shoving it in your face, as masterful writing indicates an ability to teach without teaching. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the series does not function like the aforementioned, but I can’t deny that there were times where I felt my experience diminish as a result.AnimationThere are a few studios out there that are known for always producing consistently quality animation, and A-1 Pictures, much like Kyoto Animation (though subjectively perhaps not to the same extent) is one of them. Interviews with Monster Girls proves no different. The animation is fairly simple, but it’s executed well, and at times there are moments of genuine beauty. I thought that each of the characters were well designed, often accompanied by bright color palettes that not only helped them stand out but greatly underscored their personalities (such as Hikari with the bright yellow and Sakie with the contrasting red-and-purple).SoundThough the soundtracks of such series rarely offer much impact, you’d be surprised with this one. Interviews with Monster Girls presents itself as a light, cozy anime, and the soundtrack does well to mimic this in the wide usage of soft string instruments. It’s a lot like background noise or elevator music yet without the negative connotations, rather quite the opposite in how it exists behind the scenes yet gracefully adds to the overall engagement.The voice actors across the board performed their respective characters flawlessly, as a seiyuu is as good as they can become their character. Much like their animated forms, how they speak should generally represent their personality in some way, and each character does that fully well. Takahashi-sensei boasts a smooth, deep voice, exemplifying his position as the trustworthy, stable man that he is.In regards to the opening and ending pieces, both are utterly fantastic in their respective roles of initiating and concluding an episode. The opening is particularly creative, introducing each of the demis in a sort of pop-up book style that exudes charm. Over the course of the series, the sequence actually does receive slight changes, making the dynamic nature a nice touch. As for the ending, you receive a very light, introspective progression, with fantastic aesthetics that mimic instances of coloring (or vivifying a blank world, much like the demis do themselves).CharactersThere are five main characters in Interviews with Monster Girls, involving two teachers (Tetsuo and Sakie) and three students (Hikari, Kyouko, and Yuki). Some supporting characters appear and become relevant from time to time, all human, though the focus of the show remains largely on the four demis and our inquisitive main character.Main character Tetsuo Takahashi, full-time biology teacher, part-time demi-whisperer, is perhaps one of the most likable anime characters in the genre. He’s a big guy, much to the credit of his name, but also has an equally big heart.Hikari Takanashi, not to be confused with Takahashi-sensei, is more or less the primary demi of the series. A vampire that loves garlic, drinks tomato juice, and swelters in the heat, she personifies the hyper, energetic, and friendly schoolgirl image, while also proving extremely altruistic towards her friends. Personally, she was my favorite of the girls.Kyouko Machi is one of the four dullahans known to be alive, and the only one that lives in Japan. Polite, intelligent, and shy, Machi, as she as most commonly referred to, is the most reliable yet also most insecure demi of the group. As mentioned before, she also develops a strong attachment to Tetsuo, which itself serves as a cute subplot.Yuki Kusakabe is the singular Japanese demi in her nature as a yuki-onna or “snow woman”. She was often accused of being anti-social, though it was more so because of her inability to control her innate abilities in the presence of others. Much like Machi, Yuki is quite both intelligent and shy, though quite loyal to her friends.Sakie Satou, objectively best girl, is the only adult demi present in the series. Though she’s a succubus, and a damn attractive one at that, Sakie goes out of her way to conceal her body, as merely touching her bare skin can activate her aphrodisiac effect. Ironically, Sakie is a hopeless romantic, and seeks nothing more than a genuine relationship with a companion, a struggle seemingly impossible until the arrival of Tetsuo. Though wary of him at first, Sakie grows to develop a crush on our brawny biological buff, as he is the only man that appreciates her for who she is, rather than the effect she has. If you ship relationships at all, you will hardcore root for these two.In retrospect, what truly sells the show are the characters. These individuals don’t exist as caricatures of their respective demi identities, rather they grow and develop just as you’d expect a real person to do so, and this trait serves as an immense boon to any series. Each personality is so unique and rich in substance they stand well on their own, and the various interrelationships present help develop a variety of paths to explore.  It’s also worth noting that each character, including Tetsuo, receives a balanced amount of attention, so if you have a favorite (or simply like them all), you’ll be pleased.ConclusionIt’s a bit disappointing how Interviews with Monster Girls was likely the most slept-on series of Winter 2017, as if it weren’t for the short duration and sparse instances of artificial moralistic dialogue, this series would have been a strong contender for best of season. Combining excellent exposition with an interesting concept and five great main characters, this anime knows how to tug at your heartstrings in all the right ways. Few anime succeed as well at being an uplifting series that will leave you feeling so fantastic and fulfilled following the conclusion, that is, after you recover from it ending.

You should look from both angles.”-Tetsuo Takahashi Interviews with Monster Girls if you…-- generally stray from character-centric series wherein the focus are school girls-- expect the series to be anything similar to Monster Musume no Iru NichijouStoryInterviews with Monster Girls adapts the ongoing eponymous manga series authored by Japanese mangaka Petos, published under the Kodanasha brand.Tetsuo Takahashi, hereafter referred to as “Takahashi-sensei” or simply “Tetsuo”, is a biology teacher who retains an inquisitive fascination for demi-humans, beings very similar to humans yet expressing inhuman and otherwise supernatural characteristics.

Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the series does not function like the aforementioned, but I can’t deny that there were times where I felt my experience diminish as a result.AnimationThere are a few studios out there that are known for always producing consistently quality animation, and A-1 Pictures, much like Kyoto Animation (though subjectively perhaps not to the same extent) is one of them. Interviews with Monster Girls proves no different. The animation is fairly simple, but it’s executed well, and at times there are moments of genuine beauty. I thought that each of the characters were well designed, often accompanied by bright color palettes that not only helped them stand out but greatly underscored their personalities (such as Hikari with the bright yellow and Sakie with the contrasting red-and-purple).SoundThough the soundtracks of such series rarely offer much impact, you’d be surprised with this one. Interviews with Monster Girls presents itself as a light, cozy anime, and the soundtrack does well to mimic this in the wide usage of soft string instruments. It’s a lot like background noise or elevator music yet without the negative connotations, rather quite the opposite in how it exists behind the scenes yet gracefully adds to the overall engagement.The voice actors across the board performed their respective characters flawlessly, as a seiyuu is as good as they can become their character. Much like their animated forms, how they speak should generally represent their personality in some way, and each character does that fully well. Takahashi-sensei boasts a smooth, deep voice, exemplifying his position as the trustworthy, stable man that he is.In regards to the opening and ending pieces, both are utterly fantastic in their respective roles of initiating and concluding an episode. The opening is particularly creative, introducing each of the demis in a sort of pop-up book style that exudes charm. Over the course of the series, the sequence actually does receive slight changes, making the dynamic nature a nice touch. As for the ending, you receive a very light, introspective progression, with fantastic aesthetics that mimic instances of coloring (or vivifying a blank world, much like the demis do themselves).CharactersThere are five main characters in Interviews with Monster Girls, involving two teachers (Tetsuo and Sakie) and three students (Hikari, Kyouko, and Yuki). Some supporting characters appear and become relevant from time to time, all human, though the focus of the show remains largely on the four demis and our inquisitive main character.Main character Tetsuo Takahashi, full-time biology teacher, part-time demi-whisperer, is perhaps one of the most likable anime characters in the genre. He’s a big guy, much to the credit of his name, but also has an equally big heart.Hikari Takanashi, not to be confused with Takahashi-sensei, is more or less the primary demi of the series. A vampire that loves garlic, drinks tomato juice, and swelters in the heat, she personifies the hyper, energetic, and friendly schoolgirl image, while also proving extremely altruistic towards her friends. Personally, she was my favorite of the girls.Kyouko Machi is one of the four dullahans known to be alive, and the only one that lives in Japan. Polite, intelligent, and shy, Machi, as she as most commonly referred to, is the most reliable yet also most insecure demi of the group. As mentioned before, she also develops a strong attachment to Tetsuo, which itself serves as a cute subplot.Yuki Kusakabe is the singular Japanese demi in her nature as a yuki-onna or “snow woman”. She was often accused of being anti-social, though it was more so because of her inability to control her innate abilities in the presence of others. Much like Machi, Yuki is quite both intelligent and shy, though quite loyal to her friends.Sakie Satou, objectively best girl, is the only adult demi present in the series. Though she’s a succubus, and a damn attractive one at that, Sakie goes out of her way to conceal her body, as merely touching her bare skin can activate her aphrodisiac effect. Ironically, Sakie is a hopeless romantic, and seeks nothing more than a genuine relationship with a companion, a struggle seemingly impossible until the arrival of Tetsuo. Though wary of him at first, Sakie grows to develop a crush on our brawny biological buff, as he is the only man that appreciates her for who she is, rather than the effect she has. If you ship relationships at all, you will hardcore root for these two.In retrospect, what truly sells the show are the characters. These individuals don’t exist as caricatures of their respective demi identities, rather they grow and develop just as you’d expect a real person to do so, and this trait serves as an immense boon to any series. Each personality is so unique and rich in substance they stand well on their own, and the various interrelationships present help develop a variety of paths to explore.  It’s also worth noting that each character, including Tetsuo, receives a balanced amount of attention, so if you have a favorite (or simply like them all), you’ll be pleased.ConclusionIt’s a bit disappointing how Interviews with Monster Girls was likely the most slept-on series of Winter 2017, as if it weren’t for the short duration and sparse instances of artificial moralistic dialogue, this series would have been a strong contender for best of season. Combining excellent exposition with an interesting concept and five great main characters, this anime knows how to tug at your heartstrings in all the right ways. Few anime succeed as well at being an uplifting series that will leave you feeling so fantastic and fulfilled following the conclusion, that is, after you recover from it ending. It’s gonna bite, but don’t lose your head over it.“You can’t look at things in only one way.

They might be right, if you don't mind a borderline harem set in a high school with minimal to no real plot, and about as much conflict as you'd expect for that scenario.  Predictable and, in my opinion, uninspiring, this slice of life meanders through the demis' daily school lives.  Nothing stands out.  It's the essential fluff series that you'll forget about as soon as you're done watching it.The highlight of this show is that they borrowed from multiple cultures for their demihumans.  The Dullahan...comes from Ireland, if I'm not mistaken.  The vampire is ubiquitous to many cultures; almost every culture in the world has something along these lines (Japan is one of the few that doesn't have an equivalent).  Succubi trace back to the Lilin-demons of Mesopotamian culture, though the term we use only dates back to the fourteenth century.  The yuki-onna is classic Japanese.  I like the diversity included here, which is rare for an anime--but that's about where my enjoyment stopped.This premise has plenty of promise--if they would dig into the lore or if the characters were more compelling.  Instead, they focus on minor points and standard high-school-aged anxieties that happen to tie into the demi nature.  I doubt they'll go further than that.Takahashi-sensei is a bland filler character whom I have no attachment to, and the other characters are little better.  The only thing that sets these girls and their succubus teacher apart is their deminess--and with a few exceptions (like the dullahan's detached head), they have no more impact than any other personality quirk.  These are ordinary girls who are supposed to be interesting because of their differences, but they aren't enough to set them apart.  With a different execution they could have been enough to carry the story, but as it is, I'm just bored.One other aspect that annoyed me about this anime is the genericness of certain aspects of Takahashi's interactions with the demi girls and his fellow teacher.  I get that his interest in the girls is entirely innocent, as are their crushes on him--but does every anime of this stripe have to go this route?  I doubt he's the only one to show an interest in them, academic or not.  It's a poor excuse for a relationship of any kind.If you enjoy slice of life and normal interactions between characters, with a little bit of discussion/debunking of standard lore mixed in, you might enjoy this series.  If you want a series with a compelling plot, something more than archetypal characters or, heck, just something besides high school nonsense happening once in a while, I would suggest looking elsewhere. comes from Ireland, if I'm not mistaken.

It is fair to say; they are the bread and butter of modern anime and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. What is rather disappointing is the amount of uninspired and generic slice of life anime that are churned out by studios who want to stay in a shell and only make back their money by the skin of their teeth. Given the limitations of the slice of life genre trying...to mix things up to make an anime more unique isn’t an easy task. And that is where Demi-chan wa Kataritai enters the mix to deliver arguably one of the most peculiar concepts in a slice of life anime. Its concept would be far more plausible in a fantasy anime. Yet it somehow implements this in a very relaxed fashion and in a way that feels rather natural while at the same time delivers all the traits of a modern slice of life title such as cute girls, a calm atmosphere and a comedic tone for the most part. Slice of life featuring cute monster girls isn’t completely original, since a few of them have been finding popularity with some recent ones being Monster Musume. But Demi-chan is potentially the first to use the idea in a way that can serve as more than just otaku pandering bait.As bizarre as the idea behind the anime is, the premise is quite simple. It seamlessly involves a world where ajin also known as demi-humans have been accepted into human society and a biology high school teacher takes an interest into three demi-humans whom he teaches. Demi-chan attempts to explore how this supernatural phenomenon interrelates with the daily life of the ajins. The themes range from bullying, discrimination, being different and accepting ones image in society. All of these themes are depicted through the most mundane tasks in a high school setting. Its portrayal of the treatment of different people isn’t anything noteworthy but it does a fine job at showing a plausible enough representation of the subject. What was however quite disappointing was the lack of depth in exploring these themes. Demi-chan sets up basic dramatic conflicts between its characters to show the audience its themes. But the execution is too basic to have any long lasting impact and it has no interest in broadening its scope to demonstrate how ajin’s are treated on a grander scale which is quite disappointing. While that is not inherently a flaw it takes away from the show’s potential and instead traps it into the confines of the slice of life genre, ultimately condemning it to just CGDCT show for the most part.The characters are very plain and the only thing that sets them apart from the typical archetypes seen in slice of life anime was their whacky appearances.  It takes a decent amount of time fleshing them out and their relationships so at the very least the audience will care a little for them during the more dramatic moments. Demi-chan never tells you to take its characters all too seriously though, and while this might sound conflicting with what the show attempts to execute it is handled appropriately.  Their antics feel a part of the story rather than in the way of it. It never felt it was trying to juggle too many balls at once, usually narrowing each specific plot thread down and focusing solely on it. With the comedy sprinkled in between. Its light hearted comedic segments where it was showing the cast doing nothing but talking and exchanging witty banter was quite enjoyable to see. While the characters were mildly entertaining, they don’t have enough depth to them. It also doesn’t help when the main character has an extremely bland personality and looks disinterested in everything most of time which really puts the whole mood of the show down. Its other main characters don’t have enough complexity to make up for their archetypal personalities and any potential in them was squandered with too much meandering. I don’t have much of a problem with comedy or light- hearted fluff. But demi-chan really did lose its steam by the half way point both with its comedy and concept.As far as demi-chan’s visual presence is concerned, it is non-existent and leaves no lasting impression on the eyes. Aside from some bright colours both the art and animation are very average. The art style itself is nothing to write home about and can be found wherever you look in a similar show. The OST is quite soothing but is also forgettable.Demi-chan suffers from more than just one or two small drawbacks. While the comedy can be enjoyable sporadically; the novelty of the anime wears off rather fast and by its second half it diminishes to the by the book CGDCT show. Its limited scope in the subjects it tries to explore also plays a hand in reducing the freshness of the anime’s premise as the episode count goes by. I wasn’t expecting the anime to portray its ideas on a global scale, but even taking just one step beyond the confines of its genre would have been enough to maintain my interest. Only then could I have truly held this on a higher pedestal. It becomes a victim to some occasional cheesy execution while also displaying infrequent moments of otaku pandering which came off as cringe worthy and immersion breaking. All in all, Demi-chan’s biggest weakness is its inability to break free of the confines of the genre it is in. As it was leaning more towards style rather than substance, the show did display some glimpses of using its potential, but didn’t do much with them and it wasn’t handled with much finesse.I somewhat enjoyed Demi-chan despite my criticisms and the monotonous manner in which it handled its themes. Its character interactions and the cast themselves were mildly endearing. And for what it was going for it did far from a bad job. However not aiming for higher ground confined it to an ordinary show. Nonetheless it still remains one of the better non-sequel titles in the season it aired in. It is forgettable and I would only recommend it to those who are looking for an anime to wind down to after a long day of work. It is not inherently bad per say, it certainly does use some of its potential to show how these deficiencies would affect people on a small scale, but it just didn’t do enough to really separate itself from the oversaturated subgenre of CGDCT. to mix things up to make an anime more unique isn’t an easy task.

I’m sure we’ve all wondered that thought sometimes in our lives right? Needless to say, curiosity can really be a funny thing. In a series like Demi-chan wa Kataritai, there are demi-humans living among society. A male high school biology teacher named Tetsuo Takahashi is fascinated by them and so begins his story in this peculiar yet entertaining tale of monster girls.Based off of the manga, I’d dare say that the anime adaptation captures the magic and feel of the original. For...anime original viewers, monster isn’t exactly a term that stands by its definition. Ask yourself, what do you think of the word “monster” when you craft an imagination? A hideous being born to kill? In monster generic monster movies, you’d probably be right. However, it’s quite different in this series. One might even suggest the title to be misleading with the words “monster girls”. Either way, demi humans aren’t actually monsters but more like humans born with characteristics that are unique and found those in fantasy stories.The first few episodes establishes the basic premise pretty well. Tetsuo meets our main characters – Hikari (a vampire), Kusakabe (a yuki-onna), Machi (a dullahan), and Sakie (a succubus). Anyone who has are familiar with literature or have seen fantasy stories may have heard of one these species before. In essence, they are the “demis” in this show and Tetsuo ends up teaching them in hopes of understanding them better. Despite lacking a complex story, the show succeeds at character relationships. Tetsuo is a normal human so he isn’t different from any of us. However, the demi-humans possesses characteristics that aren’t normal. Take for instance, Hikari is a vampire but avoids biting people. Instead, she drinks blood packs and drinks tomato juice. Her behavior is much more of the antithesis of a vampire as she is highly energetic and often hopes to catch the attention of others, in particular Tetsuo. The character chemistry between him and Hikari is one of the most noticeable ones in the show. Both of them share a friendly relationship and often tries to help each other. This extends to her friends as well as Hikari forms meaningful relationships with demi-humans such as Machi and Kusakabe.Unlike Hikari, Machi is more of the shy type. I mean, if you walk around without a head, there’s probably going to be eyes looking at you 24/7. Even more so, Machi has a strong desire to stay contact with others because of her condition. Tetsuo serve as both a guardian and guide for her throughout the show as they connect and become close friends. Hell, Machi even develops a crush on the guy. Finally on a more serious note, there’s Kusakabe, the snow girl. While Tetsuo is the kind gentleman towards his students, not everyone in this show is so accepting. In one particular episode, a group of girls gossips about Kusakabe that leaves her wonder if she can live in a world with humans. The show does a well job at expressing emotion as Kusakabe feels isolated and even afraid if she will hurt someone. As the show is much heavier on characterization, we get to learn how demi-humans feel about themselves when interacting with humans. This also extends to Sakie, the succubus math teacher. As you can imagine, being a succubus around the male population isn’t easy so she limits herself by purposely dressing in ways that makes her unappealing. Her relationship with the other demi-humans is also explored throughout the show and with Tetsuo as well. In retrospect, the way this show characterizes its cast is very engaging.While the series isn’t heavy in storytelling, some episodes does feature one of the main cast more than others. There are specific episodes that explores the lifestyle of demi-humans such as with Sakie. Furthermore, there also episodes that expands beyond the school setting. One particular episode includes a visit to Hikari’s home that opens up more possibilities to understand her better. It even introduces Hikari’s sister to show how demi-humans interact with human siblings. As such, expect the show’s attempt at making the viewers understand about the characters to be a recurring theme.I have to admit, the show is one of those popcorn entertainment anime that’s hard not to laugh at. I mean that in a good sense though because the humor is done fairly well. Instead of relying on cheap fanservice or shock value, the series has a natural feel of selling comedy. Every character in this series has a personality that will likely make you feel invested about them. Furthermore, the show cleverly times its comedic moments as they aren’t random. The only part that occasionally throws me off is the lack of development overall in terms of the character relationships. While the show maintains a good balance of relationships, nothing really resolves in the end as Tetsuo tries to understand the demi-humans. Also as a manga reader, the adaptation is incomplete so expect some areas to be left out in the dark.Adapted by A-1 Pictures, the series is bright and colorful in the sense that it captures the mood right at mostly all times. Character designs may feel a bit generic but that’s just the way it is. In the meantime, most of the demi-humans all look like normal humans (with the exception of Machi). I believe the purpose of the show is trying to convey that they can live in our society as well no matter how different they seem to be. Tetsuo also has the modern look of a teacher and someone that accurately fits for his age. Between the OP and ED theme songs, the show also has some clever choreography referencing to folklore and pop culture.Ah for a show like this, you can imagine that portraying some of these characters aren’t so easy. It’s never easy to step into the shoes of a non-human character yet the cast does a wonderful job doing so. I have to admit that Hikari’s VA brings the most personality into this series. With her role, the show is like an energetic light bulb. In the meantime, the soundtrack and overall music delivery is well delivered to present itself.How do I feel after watching this show? Let’s just say that I’ve enjoyed this more than I had expected. A show like this really looks generic on paper and some viewers may even question the overall purpose. However, behind those cute character designs lies a much more depth of what you’ll expect out of those demi-humans. Interviews may be boring and stressful but I can assure that this show is the opposite like that. By the time I was finished watching Demi-chan wa Kataritari, I almost wish I was in Tetsuo’ shoes too. anime original viewers, monster isn’t exactly a term that stands by its definition.

As you can imagine, being a succubus around the male population isn’t easy so she limits herself by purposely dressing in ways that makes her unappealing. Her relationship with the other demi-humans is also explored throughout the show and with Tetsuo as well. In retrospect, the way this show characterizes its cast is very engaging.While the series isn’t heavy in storytelling, some episodes does feature one of the main cast more than others. There are specific episodes that explores the lifestyle of demi-humans such as with Sakie. Furthermore, there also episodes that expands beyond the school setting. One particular episode includes a visit to Hikari’s home that opens up more possibilities to understand her better. It even introduces Hikari’s sister to show how demi-humans interact with human siblings. As such, expect the show’s attempt at making the viewers understand about the characters to be a recurring theme.I have to admit, the show is one of those popcorn entertainment anime that’s hard not to laugh at. I mean that in a good sense though because the humor is done fairly well. Instead of relying on cheap fanservice or shock value, the series has a natural feel of selling comedy. Every character in this series has a personality that will likely make you feel invested about them. Furthermore, the show cleverly times its comedic moments as they aren’t random. The only part that occasionally throws me off is the lack of development overall in terms of the character relationships. While the show maintains a good balance of relationships, nothing really resolves in the end as Tetsuo tries to understand the demi-humans. Also as a manga reader, the adaptation is incomplete so expect some areas to be left out in the dark.Adapted by A-1 Pictures, the series is bright and colorful in the sense that it captures the mood right at mostly all times. Character designs may feel a bit generic but that’s just the way it is. In the meantime, most of the demi-humans all look like normal humans (with the exception of Machi). I believe the purpose of the show is trying to convey that they can live in our society as well no matter how different they seem to be. Tetsuo also has the modern look of a teacher and someone that accurately fits for his age. Between the OP and ED theme songs, the show also has some clever choreography referencing to folklore and pop culture.Ah for a show like this, you can imagine that portraying some of these characters aren’t so easy. It’s never easy to step into the shoes of a non-human character yet the cast does a wonderful job doing so. I have to admit that Hikari’s VA brings the most personality into this series. With her role, the show is like an energetic light bulb. In the meantime, the soundtrack and overall music delivery is well delivered to present itself.How do I feel after watching this show? Let’s just say that I’ve enjoyed this more than I had expected. A show like this really looks generic on paper and some viewers may even question the overall purpose. However, behind those cute character designs lies a much more depth of what you’ll expect out of those demi-humans. Interviews may be boring and stressful but I can assure that this show is the opposite like that. By the time I was finished watching Demi-chan wa Kataritari, I almost wish I was in Tetsuo’ shoes too.', 'Demi-chan, or interview with monster girls. a series i was initially hooked onto due to it\'s premise. The first few episodes were actually quite good if i\'m gonna be honest, but as it started to continue, it got more mediocre and as a result i also got bored.Firstly, let\'s talk about the premise and how the show handled it. The story takes place in an age where ""Ajin"" (demi-human), more casually known as ""Demi,"" have slowly started to become accepted into human society. Tetsuo Takahashi is a biology teacher who ends up teaching three such Demi, hoping to understand more about them while also...managing to catch their attention.Now from here, the show could have went 1 out of 2 way, it could have been a cute girl doing cute things type of show, where the premise is just a backdrop and most of the show is the girls having fun in school doing cute things for comedy. The other way it could have went was the serious dramatic route, where the Demis would have their own issues and they would realize that their not alone and then they\'ll break out of their shells. The show opted to take the latter initially with the first 4 episodes, but after that the show starts to diverge and become a regular cute girl show, which would have been fine, but it just went nowhere. Like every episode would have an actual plot point, and most of the episode would just be cute girl stuff until near the end when it realized oh yea we had a plot thing to solve.Secondly, why are all the Demis in this show female? If your show had something to stand on, it wouldn\'t need to rely on cute girls as one of it\'s main selling point. I see no other reason to have made all of it\'s main cast besides the teacher female. It\'s only for1. selling the cute girl doing cute thing like i mentioned earlier.2.so they can have a cute crush on sensei.For the first few episodes it was okay as there was ore focus on the drama of their kind and their problems, but after all of that initial stuff, their defined by nothing more than their species and 1 quirk. The show doesn\'t even try to expand it\'s cast with interesting side characters, the vice principal would have honestly been a great obstacle for takahashi sensei being too bias and realize the Demis dont really need to rely on takahashi as much as they need to, it could have been a heartwarming moment, but it wasn\'t it was mediocre.Thirdly, the show doesn\'t even have a good appeal to back up it\'s circular no where plot and empty characters.The soundtracks are average and nothing to back on, the art is nothing special, the girls don\'t even look remotely waifu material enough to bank on the whole waifu war fandom. Their cute, but their faces dont look all that different, and only machi looks the most varied out of the 3. There\'s also sato sensei who is the least sexy succubus i have ever seen, who\'s plot also went nowhere, she doesn\'t change enough to warrant that much attention to her arc, and neither did a lot of the girls to be honest, the most drastic change was yuki, who\'s serious arc was kinda a big contrast to the other arcs.Last point, the show doesn\'t know what it want to do. It tries to be a cute girl show, yet has a lot of moments that wouldn\'t really fit in one, like the yuki arc. It tries to be serious, but has alot of generic school comedy moment, like the test arc or the pool arc.As the show went on and on, i didn\'t know where the show was headed, and i guess neither did the show. Their lives were made slightly better sure, the whole wanting to learn more about Demi aspect of sensei wasn\'t even remembered by the show, as they stopped caring about it and the girls aren\'t even that cute, which means that after 2 episode, i stopped caring about them.Overall, the show loses it\'s appeal very fast, it doesn\'t actually know what direction to go, it doesn\'t take advantage of it\'s unique setting to do more serious stuff, the characters are boring, and overall i lost interest in it after 4-5 episodes. managing to catch their attention.Now from here, the show could have went 1 out of 2 way, it could have been a cute girl doing cute things type of show, where the premise is just a backdrop and most of the show is the girls having fun in school doing cute things for comedy.

It takes tropes that became popular in porn VNs and doujinshi, and removes the porn. It won\'t even walk the line between the comedic and the erotic, like Monster Musume, and decides instead to use its premise to talk about disabilities, acceptance, and the  feeling of community that comes around people when they recognize how their impairment affects their lives. If I had known about this premise before watching the series, to be honest, I wouldn\'t have. What are the chances of this being...tasteful?Turns out it can be done. The main characters in the series are removed enough from real world disabilities that the comedic parts of their lives don\'t feel wrong, but not so much that I can\'t see that they are struggling in some ways - I can laugh about the relationship between Takahashi, the stoic biology teacher whose interest in demihumans kickstarts the series, and Satou, who happens to have been born a succubus and affects people around herself accordingly. But I can also see how not being connected with her sexuality affects Satou, bringing her to isolate herself and beware human connections, much like a real life sex addict would have to.  It\'s fun and fine to laugh at a dullahan girl\'s misadventures with her head, where she gets nauseated when carried around too carelessly, but the series also calmly shows you how her physical limitations mean that she needs reasonable authority figures who empathize with her and adjust the rules of the school to her condition and for her safety.Moreover, this is never done with a sledgehammer, with flowing tears and melodrama followed by a 4Koma like sketch. The writers know that just a brief remark or acknowledgment suffice to make us aware of how, for instance, she needed to train herself to write without seeing the paper she is writing on, since she can\'t move her head between the blackboard and the paper like a normal person would. These notes do wonders in showing us characters that feel like real people, while letting the laughs flow.This tension between the comedic and the dramatic works because of the character work, and it\'s really tastefully done. I don\'t feel like saying things like \'the vampire girl is about showing you how a highly visible distinction and disability can affect family life\' because, even if the show does showcast it (when they point out that her father and sister dye their hair to make her stand out less, for instance), she isn\'t just about that. She has also many traits that could work with any other anime girl in high school story, and that helps her not be a one-dimensional lesson to be taught, but part of a fun narrative that, while maybe not epic in scope, beautifully animated, or dramatically superbly constructed, I am having great fun following along this season. tasteful?Turns out it can be done.

He tells himself, and everyone else, it\'s ""scientific"" and that he just wants to know more but he\'d do just about anything for a demi. I\'m sure he would lick the dirt off their dirty feet if he could. He emits an air of pathetic-ness that nobody in the anime can sense but you as a viewer can easily see. It just feel like watching someone who has wasted their life away so the only fun...they can get out of their life is to try to live vicariously through children, which isn\'t so bad but the children also happened to be freaky demi children that he is into. You can tell how much he wants the demi children from how hard he tries. It\'s not like it\'s sexualized in any way but there is just no good explanation for it otherwise.The demis themselves are just typical spoiled anime girls with little twists because they are demi. They are perfectly normal kids who get spoiled because of their ""disability"". And then this 40 year old guy, who isn\'t related to them, being super into them is just the whole show.All in all, it was a pretty fun anime for the first half when you don\'t feel like this guy is nearly as pathetic and try hard but eventually it\'s painfully apparent that he tries too hard. And at that point, you just have ask yourself why he does it. And the answer has to just be that he is into freaky demi children. I mean this guy is way too considerate and kind to these kids.

There are very few of them, so not many people actually know how to interact with them, or what even makes them different (as there are very different kinds of demi-humans out there, from very noticeable ones like a dullahan (think of headless horsemen) to ones that show almost no outward signs of their status as a demi-human).In comes the teacher,...who wants to interview those demi-humans about how they perceive the world and what kind of problems they face day-to-day (hence the title).Storywise there is a small thread, however most of the time the themes and interactions speak for themselves.This anime is surprisingly mature for its handling of most situations and (if this is something you are interested in) progressive. The theme is acceptance of difference in a non-shove-down-the-throat-kind-of-way, different people learning about each other and still finding friendship.Let\'s break it down a little further:Story 7/10:Not much to write home about - like I said - most of the series depends on the theme of learning and acceptance for each other and the friendship they share, so no crazy huge plot.Art 10/10:Having read the manga - this anime adapts the mangas theme and ... adjusts the art to really look awesome (personally I did not like the art in the manga very much). Every character (esp. Hikari) bursts into life and is well animated. As I mentioned - as Hikari is the most ""active"" character they flexed a lot with her animations. Really loveable and well done. As I am somewhat of a color-fetishist in anime I loved their use of bright colors and character designs.Sound 8/10:Good music, nothing crazy in terms of sound overall. Good.Characters: 10/10:Every character is his/her own and memorable. The great animation makes them even better in my opinion.Enjoyment 10/10:A Feels Good Anime has to actually feel good. That it does. The characters never act out of line and I wouldn\'t have minded 12 more episodes just to see them interact with each other.I just finished my second full rewatch of this series (Sometimes I just rewatched Episode 11 and the OVA just to give me all arm and fuzzy inside) and I decided to review this series, as I was reminded of how much I liked this show back when it aired.

Sorting through fact and fiction of what we believe about the supernatural, we watch as Takahashi slowly gets to know more about each Demi\'s everyday life while helping them with whatever problems they may face with their birth-given attributes.Storywise, it\'s quite similar to how harems/reverse harems direct episodes. (Note: this is not a harem, it just shares a few similarities. Teacher x Student would be incredibly inappropriate) The first few...episodes are an introduction to each character and a brief description of their ""species"", and the rest of the episodes each focus on one of the already established characters and continues to explore their characteristics and their effect on their surroundings. Mixed in with the calm and peaceful school life, it provides us with an entertaining yet informative experience about the world of Interviews With Monster Girls. There is a little drama scattered around the series, but luckily it\'s done well enough so that it doesn\'t feel like it\'s trying too hard to make the show more interesting.There is quite a lot of information dumps on each Demi-human, so the dialogue is an important part of this show. Although it can seem forced and unrealistic at times, such as a few conversations the Demis have with their classmates, most of the time their interactions with others come out quite naturally and allow us to learn about each Monster Girl without it feeling like a lecture. There are many times where serious issues are brought up, such as bullying and disabilities, giving the show a sense of deeper meaning mixed in with it\'s cute and happy theme. Often they\'ll also throw in a bit of comedy to prevent the sense of boredom, and they do it quite well so it doesn\'t negatively impact on the topic being discussed.I\'m sure you\'ve all seen the usual MC that plagues this kind of anime. A group of girls show up in a guy\'s life, but our poor boy is usually too socially awkward around the opposite sex or too dense when it comes to females. Not Takahashi. An adult with responsibilities, he doesn\'t have time for that bullshit. No more blushing and nose bleeds, Takahashi is able to interact with everyone around him without looking like a complete idiot. Although still a little dense at times, his kind-hearted and level-headed nature allows him to properly perform his job as a teacher and a second guardian.Continuing down our list of characters, a group of four Demis are the real focus of the story. These consist of an energetic vampire (Hikari Takanashi), a shy dullahan (Kyouko Machi), a troubled snow-woman (Yuki Kusakabe) and a succubus math teacher. (Sakie Satou) Each one is born with features that separate them from the norm, forced to accommodate these differences into their lives. Throughout the show, we watch as each one learns a little bit about themselves due to their bonds with Takahashi and each other, using their new found knowledge to grow as individuals.The background characters aren\'t really elaborated on much until the second half of the anime. They\'re mostly there to bring up topics about Demi-humans, so they don\'t really get much character development. This is a huge shame as many of them have interesting views and personalities that would have allowed the show to feel more like an actual school instead of a setting created only to have the main characters move around in. Instead of only becoming relevant in the later eps, some of the focus on the main characters should have been used to explore more interactions between normal students and Demis.So you\'re probably all wondering right? Monster Girl Anime without an Ecchi tag? Does this show still have fanservice? Well yeah, but they only come from two characters, Takahashi and Satou. One has an incredibly set of toned muscle, (like holy shit embrace me Tetsuo!) and the other has a beautiful and admittedly erotic body. (I wanna overdose on Sakie\'s aphrodisiac effect!) We don\'t see their (AMAZING) bodies much as Sakie usually wears clothes that fully cover her so that she doesn\'t accidentally sexually stun any men around her, and a biology teacher doesn\'t get many chances to show off his ripped build in a school setting. What we do things is done well enough so that it doesn\'t feel like a cheap way of getting more viewers.Finally, the animation needs to be brought up. There is nothing really breathtaking about this anime, but it\'s not the type to rely on heavy sakuga to appeal to its viewers. Like the show, it\'s quite colourful and cheerful, but is still able to properly express any feelings the current scene requires, may it be happy or sad. There are a few times where the animation quality dips a little or looks slightly out of place, but other than that the show is pretty consistent across episodes.The wonderfully charming show that is Interviews With Monster Girls is a fresh take on the usual School and Supernatural Girls tropes.

Well worth the watch if you enjoy Slice of Life animes that are different from the usual ""cute girls doing cute things"" we see often.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Another day, another anecdote that I must repeat (to some extent) because it just fits too well to pass up.One of my favorite film quotes of all time also happens to be said by my favorite Pokémon of all time, Mewtwo. In Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo delivers the following line.“I see now that the circumstances of one’s birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.”It’s a relevant quote and a relevant series given Demi-chan wa Kataritai. An anime that channels both “monsters” and self-worth...in wonderful fashion.STORYDemi-chan wa Kataritai’s structure is like that of most other slice-of-life anime. Lighthearted comedy, down-to-earth setting, cute girls. The works. However, it goes even further, delivering a worthwhile experience that the viewer can take to heart and apply in their own lives.To get there, the anime creates a strong foundation. The main premise itself – the interviews – is a format that works very well. Takahashi-sensei sits down with Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, and Yuki one-on-one, asking them questions about themselves and, more importantly, about the origins of their demi traits. It’s exposition that feels natural because not only does the audience learn something new but also Takahashi-sensei himself also learns right along with them.Their traits mostly derive from known legends in the real world. Vampires bite. Succubi seduce others. Dullahans carry their heads around. Snow women aren’t too fond of hot weather.Demi-chan wa Kataritai doesn’t only explain away their traits with known ideas; it also takes some creative liberty to make them that much more interesting. Vampires use blood bags supplied by the government to satiate their hunger. Succubi inadvertently attract those around them due to an aphrodisiac effect. Dullahans’ head-to-body connection may represent a worm hole which allows for the transference of food and vocals. Snow women produce ice when under physical or emotional duress.In bringing up these topics, the anime gets at the core of its content. More specifically, a mature brand of comedy comes through with ease. Hikari’s suggestive description of Takahashi-sensei’s arm during her “Arm I Want to Bite Championship” is hilarious, and his reaction to Satou-sensei’s accidental sexiness when zipping up her jacket strikes that funny bone hard.These jokes and many others in the show are often sharp in timing and quick in wit, leading to a consistently funny anime. To be fair, this comedy is nothing next-level, but its simplistic yet varied nature provides a lot of laughs. Laughs that don’t make fun of their traits but instead demonstrate that they are nothing to be ashamed or afraid of.In fact, this comedic direction gets at Demi-chan wa Kataritai’s most important message.Life should be filled with laughs and smiles. To put it differently, everyone deserves a shot at happiness. Unfortunately, that doesn’t always happen. Life can sometimes throw around its meanness.In Demi-chan wa Kataritai, Hikari and the other girls are portrayed either as people with special circumstances, handicaps, or otherwise noticeable differences. I.e., they are demis. For them, they are the outsiders. The ones who are not the same as most other people.As the anime depicts, their differences cause life’s meanness. Machi can’t make friends very easily due to her uniqueness. A couple of gossiping girls bully Yuki. Satou-sensei must meticulously form her life around her inadvertent effect. Essentially, they undergo societal hardships that prevent them from being happy.These scenes are sad but meaningful. Meaningful because they reflect situations in real life. The audience has most likely encountered people at work, at school, or at a restaurant who have their own differences. Differences that have them being treated unfairly or in a way that isn’t right. By extension, it keeps them from obtaining the happiness that they deserve just as much as everyone else.Indeed, Demi-chan wa Kataritai argues for such happiness. It’s in Hikari sticking up for Yuki by giving her two cents to those bullies. It’s in Takahashi-sensei taking the time to sit down with the girls and seriously listening to them. It’s in the support they receive from their family, friends, mentors, and each other.Their demi status is fundamentally a part of them, but that doesn’t make them anything less. In fact, it makes them who they are. Takahashi-sensei puts it best in episode four: “It isn’t how you’re born that makes you ‘like’ something. It’s how you live with what you are.” Even better, he goes on to explain that that doesn’t mean one should “neglect” those differences, saying, “You can’t look at things in only one way. You should look from both angles.” Otherwise, one will “miss their individuality” and “won’t understand their troubles.”When all is said and done, the person as a whole matters most. And again, the anime demonstrates this mindset – both with the demis and the non-demis. Himari, the younger of the two twins, looks out for her older sister Hikari however she can. Yuki and Satou-sensei connect over a bunch of silly manga. Takahashi-sensei’s professor friend inspires Machi to pursue her studies so she can further understand herself. And all the girls deliver a heartfelt video message to their sincere teacher to cheer him up as best they can.Everyone involved proves that a person isn’t defined by words like “vampire” or “succubus.” That what makes people who they are isn’t about where they come from or their genetic foundation or the culture in which they were influenced. Rather, it’s about their moral fiber. Their strength of character. Their goodness of heart.That’s Demi-chan wa Kataritai’s message: No matter if different or demi or somewhere in-between, people deserve to be happy in their own skin.In all honesty, Demi-chan wa Kataritai shouldn’t be classified as deep or profound. It doesn’t have top-tier writing since it doesn’t explore all sides to the same degree, sticking mostly with a cheerful, optimistic tone and cutting back on the realism it strives for. In turn, its different instances of drama can feel somewhat stilted. It punctuates the drama with tears, but that tone and the surrounding comedy are around often enough to keep the show from landing its lows.These issues don’t take anything away from the show’s beautiful message. The only issue that really does is the semi-harem approach. There’s no ecchi, what’s shown is nowhere near distasteful, and it can actually setup more laughs and extra opportunities to understand the girls and their feelings. However, the anime wants to be semi-serious, and, realistically, only one girl has a shot at romance with Takahashi-sensei (i.e., Satou-sensei). So, this approach of keeping his relationships with the girls on a kind of status quo comes off as slightly unnecessary in the long run.Regardless, the climax of the anime’s drama happens in the second-to-last episode, leaving the final episode open for the show to deliver one last side story. It’s a wise decision because it ends the season not on an emotional level but rather on something simply happy and fun. A state that the show wants its audience to feel – regardless of creed or upbringing.ART/ANIMATIONDemi-chan wa Kataritai supports its story with an expert set of visuals to say the least.One of the more interesting choices in the show are the characters’ designs. For Hikari, Machi, and Yuki, the anime uses a clever technique. By having the girls wear white blouses and brown skirts, these very plain outfits accentuate the main features of each girl. Hikari’s yellow “horn” hairstyle and sharp fang. Machi’s shining flame and orange-haired (disembodied) head. Yuki’s teal-cool hair and glazed eyes.These color choices are smart, too, aligning with the characters and their personalities. Yellow for joyful, orange for warmth, and teal for pleasantness.Satou-sensei and Takahashi-sensei earn praise here as well. Satou-sensei’s red tracksuit, low, long ponytail, and glasses are an “unattractive” look designed to conceal her aphrodisiac effect, giving her a design that instantly characterizes her whole person.As for Takahashi-sensei, his lab coat immediately signifies his teacher role, and his red undershirt complements the white of said coat and his black, spiky hair. But his look also does something similar: hiding his absolutely ripped bod. A bod kept hidden until the final episode so as to include even more comedy in the anime (thanks to Satou-sensei’s uncontained reaction).Most interesting of all, though, is Demi-chan wa Kataritai’s visual storytelling. For many of its scenes, the anime will take full advantage of the medium, presenting ideas and developments through the art itself.For example, in episode four, Satou-sensei runs into Takahashi-sensei in the cafeteria. As they talk, she apologizes for her assumptions about him after she realizes how hard he has been trying to understand the demi girls. Through dialogue, she insists on helping Takahashi-sensei. Visually, the foreground concrete pillar separates them both while her side contains red chairs and he sits among green ones. So, when she crosses over to his side of the screen, she both breaks the barrier between them and starts their newfound relationship.Or take episode ten. Following Machi and Takahashi-sensei’s conversation with his professor-friend Souma, she sits down on the grass outside, thinking about what her future holds. Again, her words describe how she has a new path to take in life before her: researching her Dullahan nature. Visually, as she stares up at the sky, two airplanes fly overhead, their contrails crossing one another. A metaphor for that fork in the road, the diverging paths she has before her now as she moves into the future (and takes the one less travelled by, as Robert Frost would write).These couple of examples only scratch the surface of Demi-chan wa Kataritai’s thoughtful artistry. On a more general level, the visuals perform just as swell. Camera angles shift away from common perceptions, and transitions between some scenes are dynamic rather than sudden. It’s a thoughtful, down-to-earth anime, but it does what it can to keep its visuals both varied and entertaining.Beyond the designs and the attention to artistry, the anime provides even more to look at. Tons of reactions for extra comedy (and Hikari gets most of the thanks here). Fluid animation appears frequently. And the soft art style in general continues with the show’s lighthearted vibe.Yes, quite the expert display from the show.CHARACTERSDemi-chan wa Kataritai hosts a cast of five main characters: Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, Yuki, and Takahashi-sensei.Each girl has their quirky traits of course. Yuki loves gag comedy, silliness, and jokes of an uncouth manner. Machi likes to be coddled. Satou-sensei speaks the truth internally to herself. Takahashi-sensei gets lost in thought when seriously thinking about demis. Only the romantic, sexual connection to Hikari’s biting habits flusters her. While not extravagant, these quirks flesh out the girls’ personalities that much more.Together, they carry the show’s strong sense of comedy and its worthwhile message with nothing but ease. However, their most important contribution comes from another meaningful idea: overcoming loneliness.Yuki goes through loneliness as a snow woman. Her body temperature is lower than most others, and she can even produce ice depending on the situation. This last point causes her a great deal of stress. She feels that she can’t be near people for fear of harming them with her cold abilities. Combined with her new environment after moving away from home, she closes herself off from everyone around her.Machi goes through loneliness as a Dullahan. With a body and a head separated at all times, she must make special arrangements for herself, like a harness for studying or eating and a small doggy house where her head sleeps at night. Sadly, her appearance sometimes makes people uncomfortable. Both because they have never seen someone like her before (she’s actually only one of the three of her kind in the world) and because they don’t want to touch on what they believe to be a sensitive topic of hers.Satou-sensei goes through loneliness as a succubus. As if by magic, she exudes an aura of extreme sexuality that unwillingly makes people around her hormonal. Thus, she goes to large lengths to suppress her aphrodisiac effect. She gets up super early and leaves school super late to avoid as many subway passengers as possible. She wears an unassuming outfit. She makes doubly sure to keep her distance from everyone around her to prevent any accidental contact.Thankfully, Takahashi-sensei is there to support every single one of them.Takahashi-sensei investigates the legends surrounding Yuki’s snow-woman status. Many of the stories harbor harsh feelings and unfortunate ends often derived from longing. In short, they involve negative emotions of some kind.Which leads him to conclude that Yuki’s ice isn’t something to be feared but rather a byproduct of the stress she has been feeling as of late. His insightful words ease her mind, allowing her to finally feel a sense of relief and granting her friends in Hikari, Machi, and even the male classmate whom she initially turned away.Takahashi-sensei also investigates Dullahans. Of Irish origin, fairy tales often depict them in a more grueling manner. How they were harbingers of death that terrorized man both on and off the battlefield. It makes sense, then, why people would fear her.After speaking with her, too, she becomes a lot more comfortable with herself. She takes part in an “experiment” with Takahashi-sensei. She thinks seriously about her condition and what she can do to contribute towards its research. She goes underwater for the first time ever. She’s never hated being a Dullahan, but she realizes now that life has a ton of exciting opportunities out there just for her.And, as expected, Takahashi-sensei works to get to know Satou-sensei more as well. His differing opinions on her nature give her the chance to express her own thoughts, and his careful, subdued reactions to her oft overwhelming effect help to build her confidence.Through his actions, she believes more in her romantic future. That she still has the chance to find a life partner (read: Takahashi-sensei) despite her peculiar circumstances. She may overestimate Takahashi-sensei’s power to fight back against her effect, but he no doubt has given her the confidence to be bolder in the nuanced ways of love.Other people besides Takahashi-sensei do help the girls overcome loneliness. Satou-sensei’s police officer, father-figure friend watches over her. Satou-sensei herself befriends Yuki. And Himari’s dad even carries Machi’s head once. But they are most influenced and aided by Takahashi-sensei. His sincere passion for both wanting them to succeed as students and understanding their personal dilemmas.Takahashi-sensei’s influence leaves one important question: Who looks out for him?This situation is where Hikari comes in.Hikari is bubbly, rambunctious, and outgoing. She is what most people would describe as “the life of the party.” She’s also a vampire. That means she burns easily under the sun, and she gets the urge to munch on the arms of those around her from time to time. That also means that Takahashi-sensei takes the time to learn more about her, too. Just as he does with the other girls.More so than the other girls, though, Hikari goes out of her way to make their lives a happy one. She makes this trait of hers apparent right from her official introduction. She enlists the help of Takahashi-sensei to transport Machi’s body to the nurse’s office since she noticed the sickened state of the Dullahan.Indeed, Hikari is this thoughtful all the time.For Yuki, Hikari keeps her distance out of consideration for Yuki’s feelings when she notices that clinging to her was making her somewhat upset. And she stands up to Yuki’s bullies, declaring how she doesn’t want to do anything she’ll regret even if people say mean things behind her back.For Machi, she’s the first to ask her about how tough it must be to always carry around her head. She also secretly suggests to Takahashi-sensei that Machi use a backpack rather than a duffle bag since it’s easier for Machi to handle. And she later allows those two to make up after they both messed up (giving a “heh heh” laugh and a few winks to boot).For Satou-sensei, she doesn’t do anything directly as she does with Machi and Yuki. Instead, a lot of her actions lead to indirect benefits for the succubus teacher. Hikari’s trust in Takanashi-sensei leads to Satou-sensei’s own rethinking of the man she now loves. Hikari kissing him on the cheek makes Satou-sensei envious and urges her to pursue him a bit more with her aphrodisiac effect. And her pool idea gives Takahashi-sensei the thought of inviting Satou-sensei along which in turn gives her more chances to form the romance she wants so badly.Takahashi-sensei is the rock that supports these girls, but Hikari is their pillow. A fluffy, soft, and easygoing person who doesn’t view them as a snow woman, Dullahan, or a succubus. Rather, she simply sees them as people precious to her.She confirms this pillow analogy when Takahashi-sensei finds himself facing the same feeling of loneliness. The vice principal of the school doesn’t approve of how much Takahashi-sensei has been helping the demis. Both because he is neglecting the other students and coddling the girls too much. These thoughts put Takahashi-sensei down, himself believing that maybe he has been trying too hard.Hikari has none of that. She notices his saddened state, so she rounds up all the girls to say a few words about how he has been such a positive influence in their lives. It’s a touching moment that Hikari caps off with a personalized message she delivers herself.She tells him, “You can never take ‘trying’ too far.” Her words put into perspective exactly what the other girls have gone through. That, like Takahashi-sensei, Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei have themselves been trying hard to not only live with their conditions but also overcome the loneliness that seemed to plague them.As she shouts out her heartfelt thanks for Takahashi-sensei over the ocean, it becomes undoubtedly clear that Hikari embodies the spirit of Demi-chan wa Kataritai. She’s an oddball and a vampire, but she understands that life is about overcoming loneliness and trying way too hard. Because only then can one be truly happy.MUSIC/SOUNDA fantastic set of voice-acting performances back up the awesome cast. Junichi Suwabe as Takahashi-sensei has the manly yet understanding voice down pat, and he can get quite “sultry” with his voice when he wants to. Yoko Hikasa as Satou-sensei deserves a shout out, too. Another veteran in the field, her calmness, mumbles, and internal thoughts demonstrate the range of her characters’ emotions.But it’s Kaede Hondo as Hikari who (once again) takes the top spot. Her contagious happiness and outgoing, peppy speech elevate the character’s likability tenfold.Much of the music within Demi-chan wa Kataritai also earns high marks. From emotional, orchestral ensembles to relaxing acoustic strings to lackadaisical, upbeat tunes, the show incorporates a lot of thoughtful tracks that support the anime almost as well as Takahashi-sensei supports the girls. They may not be as memorable as the story’s message or the characters’ quirks, but they hold strength all the same.The opening track, “Original.,” combines piano keys, a backing beat, and a lot of chimes, bells, and other dainty instruments to give the track a welcoming tone. It’s not afraid to warp its sound, and the vocals provided with the piece are pleasant to listen to. Especially when they harmonize in the background.The ending track, “Fairy Tale,” is another happy little tune. Moderately paced, more piano and chimes create a foundation that’s both light and charming. Soft vocals and a catchy composition round out the track as it starts off quiet, picks up in the middle, and finishes with a lot more passion. Leading it to a quiet end that mirrors the start.ENJOYMENTWhat a wonderful anime.It’s always an awesome feeling when I’m watching a show, I immediately love it, and I continue to throughout the rest of its run. That’s rare nowadays, so it makes the occasion that much more special.For me, what really sold the anime were the characters. I like them all a ton. Machi was too cute with her stares and her body going bonkers whenever she took a daring chance. Yuki’s “Curse you!” acting and her stifled chortles had me smiling wide. And Takahashi-sensei teasing the girls and doing his best to help them made him into a pretty cool dude.My two favorites, though, are undoubtedly Hikari and Satou-sensei.Satou-sensei was amazing. As the romance aficionado that I am, her attempts at a romantic relationship with Takahashi-sensei made me oh so happy. She would get jealous of the other girls’ moments with him, she would get embarrassed at herself for going all out, and she would get extremely excited about her potential future or overly defensive should her father-figure try to say anything even remotely negative about her man.As for Hikari, she is just way too much fun. Her happy-go-lucky attitude. Her silly actions. Her hilarious faces. She was such a treat to watch as she livened up whatever room she happened to enter. Best of all, she represents the show itself, making her my favorite of the bunch.Even without the characters, this show presents something truly kind. There’s drama, sure. But the positivity it maintains – about the girls’ situations, the outlook on life, the care of everyone involved – means a lot to me.Many anime aim for a similar sense of kindness. But they don’t always get there for a variety of reasons: trying to be too cute, the premise isn’t grounded enough. In other words, the whole package feels artificial in its kindness.For this anime, it’s not artificial whatsoever. It nails that kindness and then some. It’s a good show that feels good and is good of heart. And I’m supremely glad to have had the chance to watch something so awesome.Demi-chan wa Kataritai delivers a superb experience in anime form. A thoughtful narrative, thematically consistent characters, and a kindhearted presentation are supported by expert visual direction and a set of fantastic voice-acting performances. Looks like Mewtwo was right all along.SUMMARYStory: Good, a strong slice-of-life narrative investigates the topic of societal differences with so-called demis, providing mature comedy and a sincere message on deserved happiness in one’s own skin, brought down slightly by not enough realistic exploration and a semi-harem approachArt/Animation: Great, simplistic designs accentuate the characters’ traits, visual storytelling engages the audience, and small flourishes amplify its overall artistic meritCharacters: Great, Takahashi-sensei supports Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei, Hikari embodies the tenets of this tale, and heartfelt themes about overcoming loneliness and trying hard persist across the whole castMusic/Sound: Great, fantastic VA performances and a large range of simplistic yet charming tracks from the OST fill the air, and both the OP and the ED keep the happy vibes goingEnjoyment: Great, a wonderfully comedic, positively heartwarming experience the whole way throughFinal Score: 9/10 in wonderful fashion.STORYDemi-chan wa Kataritai’s structure is like that of most other slice-of-life anime. Lighthearted comedy, down-to-earth setting, cute girls. The works. However, it goes even further, delivering a worthwhile experience that the viewer can take to heart and apply in their own lives.To get there, the anime creates a strong foundation. The main premise itself – the interviews – is a format that works very well. Takahashi-sensei sits down with Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, and Yuki one-on-one, asking them questions about themselves and, more importantly, about the origins of their demi traits. It’s exposition that feels natural because not only does the audience learn something new but also Takahashi-sensei himself also learns right along with them.Their traits mostly derive from known legends in the real world. Vampires bite. Succubi seduce others. Dullahans carry their heads around. Snow women aren’t too fond of hot weather.Demi-chan wa Kataritai doesn’t only explain away their traits with known ideas; it also takes some creative liberty to make them that much more interesting. Vampires use blood bags supplied by the government to satiate their hunger. Succubi inadvertently attract those around them due to an aphrodisiac effect. Dullahans’ head-to-body connection may represent a worm hole which allows for the transference of food and vocals. Snow women produce ice when under physical or emotional duress.In bringing up these topics, the anime gets at the core of its content. More specifically, a mature brand of comedy comes through with ease. Hikari’s suggestive description of Takahashi-sensei’s arm during her “Arm I Want to Bite Championship” is hilarious, and his reaction to Satou-sensei’s accidental sexiness when zipping up her jacket strikes that funny bone hard.These jokes and many others in the show are often sharp in timing and quick in wit, leading to a consistently funny anime.

But they are most influenced and aided by Takahashi-sensei. His sincere passion for both wanting them to succeed as students and understanding their personal dilemmas.Takahashi-sensei’s influence leaves one important question: Who looks out for him?This situation is where Hikari comes in.Hikari is bubbly, rambunctious, and outgoing. She is what most people would describe as “the life of the party.” She’s also a vampire. That means she burns easily under the sun, and she gets the urge to munch on the arms of those around her from time to time. That also means that Takahashi-sensei takes the time to learn more about her, too. Just as he does with the other girls.More so than the other girls, though, Hikari goes out of her way to make their lives a happy one. She makes this trait of hers apparent right from her official introduction. She enlists the help of Takahashi-sensei to transport Machi’s body to the nurse’s office since she noticed the sickened state of the Dullahan.Indeed, Hikari is this thoughtful all the time.For Yuki, Hikari keeps her distance out of consideration for Yuki’s feelings when she notices that clinging to her was making her somewhat upset. And she stands up to Yuki’s bullies, declaring how she doesn’t want to do anything she’ll regret even if people say mean things behind her back.For Machi, she’s the first to ask her about how tough it must be to always carry around her head. She also secretly suggests to Takahashi-sensei that Machi use a backpack rather than a duffle bag since it’s easier for Machi to handle. And she later allows those two to make up after they both messed up (giving a “heh heh” laugh and a few winks to boot).For Satou-sensei, she doesn’t do anything directly as she does with Machi and Yuki. Instead, a lot of her actions lead to indirect benefits for the succubus teacher. Hikari’s trust in Takanashi-sensei leads to Satou-sensei’s own rethinking of the man she now loves. Hikari kissing him on the cheek makes Satou-sensei envious and urges her to pursue him a bit more with her aphrodisiac effect. And her pool idea gives Takahashi-sensei the thought of inviting Satou-sensei along which in turn gives her more chances to form the romance she wants so badly.Takahashi-sensei is the rock that supports these girls, but Hikari is their pillow. A fluffy, soft, and easygoing person who doesn’t view them as a snow woman, Dullahan, or a succubus. Rather, she simply sees them as people precious to her.She confirms this pillow analogy when Takahashi-sensei finds himself facing the same feeling of loneliness. The vice principal of the school doesn’t approve of how much Takahashi-sensei has been helping the demis. Both because he is neglecting the other students and coddling the girls too much. These thoughts put Takahashi-sensei down, himself believing that maybe he has been trying too hard.Hikari has none of that. She notices his saddened state, so she rounds up all the girls to say a few words about how he has been such a positive influence in their lives. It’s a touching moment that Hikari caps off with a personalized message she delivers herself.She tells him, “You can never take ‘trying’ too far.” Her words put into perspective exactly what the other girls have gone through. That, like Takahashi-sensei, Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei have themselves been trying hard to not only live with their conditions but also overcome the loneliness that seemed to plague them.As she shouts out her heartfelt thanks for Takahashi-sensei over the ocean, it becomes undoubtedly clear that Hikari embodies the spirit of Demi-chan wa Kataritai. She’s an oddball and a vampire, but she understands that life is about overcoming loneliness and trying way too hard. Because only then can one be truly happy.MUSIC/SOUNDA fantastic set of voice-acting performances back up the awesome cast. Junichi Suwabe as Takahashi-sensei has the manly yet understanding voice down pat, and he can get quite “sultry” with his voice when he wants to. Yoko Hikasa as Satou-sensei deserves a shout out, too. Another veteran in the field, her calmness, mumbles, and internal thoughts demonstrate the range of her characters’ emotions.But it’s Kaede Hondo as Hikari who (once again) takes the top spot. Her contagious happiness and outgoing, peppy speech elevate the character’s likability tenfold.Much of the music within Demi-chan wa Kataritai also earns high marks. From emotional, orchestral ensembles to relaxing acoustic strings to lackadaisical, upbeat tunes, the show incorporates a lot of thoughtful tracks that support the anime almost as well as Takahashi-sensei supports the girls. They may not be as memorable as the story’s message or the characters’ quirks, but they hold strength all the same.The opening track, “Original.,” combines piano keys, a backing beat, and a lot of chimes, bells, and other dainty instruments to give the track a welcoming tone. It’s not afraid to warp its sound, and the vocals provided with the piece are pleasant to listen to. Especially when they harmonize in the background.The ending track, “Fairy Tale,” is another happy little tune. Moderately paced, more piano and chimes create a foundation that’s both light and charming. Soft vocals and a catchy composition round out the track as it starts off quiet, picks up in the middle, and finishes with a lot more passion. Leading it to a quiet end that mirrors the start.ENJOYMENTWhat a wonderful anime.It’s always an awesome feeling when I’m watching a show, I immediately love it, and I continue to throughout the rest of its run. That’s rare nowadays, so it makes the occasion that much more special.For me, what really sold the anime were the characters. I like them all a ton. Machi was too cute with her stares and her body going bonkers whenever she took a daring chance. Yuki’s “Curse you!” acting and her stifled chortles had me smiling wide. And Takahashi-sensei teasing the girls and doing his best to help them made him into a pretty cool dude.My two favorites, though, are undoubtedly Hikari and Satou-sensei.Satou-sensei was amazing. As the romance aficionado that I am, her attempts at a romantic relationship with Takahashi-sensei made me oh so happy. She would get jealous of the other girls’ moments with him, she would get embarrassed at herself for going all out, and she would get extremely excited about her potential future or overly defensive should her father-figure try to say anything even remotely negative about her man.As for Hikari, she is just way too much fun. Her happy-go-lucky attitude. Her silly actions. Her hilarious faces. She was such a treat to watch as she livened up whatever room she happened to enter. Best of all, she represents the show itself, making her my favorite of the bunch.Even without the characters, this show presents something truly kind. There’s drama, sure. But the positivity it maintains – about the girls’ situations, the outlook on life, the care of everyone involved – means a lot to me.Many anime aim for a similar sense of kindness. But they don’t always get there for a variety of reasons: trying to be too cute, the premise isn’t grounded enough. In other words, the whole package feels artificial in its kindness.For this anime, it’s not artificial whatsoever. It nails that kindness and then some. It’s a good show that feels good and is good of heart. And I’m supremely glad to have had the chance to watch something so awesome.Demi-chan wa Kataritai delivers a superb experience in anime form. A thoughtful narrative, thematically consistent characters, and a kindhearted presentation are supported by expert visual direction and a set of fantastic voice-acting performances. Looks like Mewtwo was right all along.SUMMARYStory: Good, a strong slice-of-life narrative investigates the topic of societal differences with so-called demis, providing mature comedy and a sincere message on deserved happiness in one’s own skin, brought down slightly by not enough realistic exploration and a semi-harem approachArt/Animation: Great, simplistic designs accentuate the characters’ traits, visual storytelling engages the audience, and small flourishes amplify its overall artistic meritCharacters: Great, Takahashi-sensei supports Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei, Hikari embodies the tenets of this tale, and heartfelt themes about overcoming loneliness and trying hard persist across the whole castMusic/Sound: Great, fantastic VA performances and a large range of simplistic yet charming tracks from the OST fill the air, and both the OP and the ED keep the happy vibes goingEnjoyment: Great, a wonderfully comedic, positively heartwarming experience the whole way throughFinal Score: 9/10', ""As it's 4am (UK time) I'm going to write a quick review. I'm currently on episode 9 and what I've seen so far, I would say the score of an 8 is perfect right now. This review should be SPOILER FREE, however I have noted main characters and my general impression of them.Story: 8A slice-of-life where we go through the lives of a vampire, a dullahan, a snow woman, a succubus and a high school teacher. There are some good comedic moments and each episode leaves you wanting more. There is little to no drama and is very light hearted, so if you're currently watching...or you've just finished an emotionally draining anime, this is the anime to watch to calm any nerves.Art: 7Nothing spectacular, the OP and ending music are average and nothing to rave about.Sound: 7Again, no special effects needed, however, if and when they are used, it is fine. The voice actors do a great job with the characters and they really portray what the characters are expressing.Characters: 9This is where the characters shine, they all have their own quirks and it feels refreshing seeing these characters develop. There's a vampire who is easy going and fun, a snow woman who is apprehensive of those around her, a dullahan (headless person) who wants to be normal, a succubus who does not want to use her powers in capturing men and a teacher who wants to understand more about these demis.Enjoyment: 8It's an excellent anime to watch when you've got nothing else to do. The comedic timing and overall feel of the anime is great, with nothing major occurring with the characters.Overall: 8I give this an 7.5-8 as I would say the winter animes sucking quite a bit. I mainly look for a good slice of life or romance anime, and with neither of these catching my eye this season, this would be the best out of a bad bunch.I will update this if I can be bothered to when the anime finishes. or you've just finished an emotionally draining anime, this is the anime to watch to calm any nerves.Art: 7Nothing spectacular, the OP and ending music are average and nothing to rave about.Sound: 7Again, no special effects needed, however, if and when they are used, it is fine.

There can also be a form discrimination against others based on their hobbies (gaming and watching anime),  disability, social classes or other aspects. If we spot somebody being discriminated against, it would probably leave a negative impression on us. In fact, the term ‘Discrimination’ has a negative connotation. That is why a show named ‘Demi-chan wa kataritai’—Interviews with Monster Girls—made an indelible impression on me, when it made me consider a new way of viewing discrimination.Firstly, the story plot goes somewhat like this:“This story begins in the age where...‘demi-humans’ which is humans with some sort of special power have been accepted into modern civilization. Tetsuo Takahashi who is a biology teacher wants to study demi-humans and his luck smiles at him and ends up in the same school as 4 of these demi-humans. The story follows as he tries to ‘interview’ these demi-humans and learn more about them but with a lot of failure on his end and comedy at its finest on the other end.”As the summary stated, there are 4 demi-humans: Takanashi Hikari (a cheerful blonde vampire), Machi Kyouko (a kind dullahan), Kusakabe Yuki (a cute yuki-onna) and Satou Sakie (a succubus teacher…yes). Although this show might initially come across as just a cute show with cute girls doing cute things, it actually brings more to the table than that.Every demi-character has her own struggle, which stems from her demi-human characteristics. All of their individual arcs are engrossing. Especially the yuki-onna Kusakabe’s. We see her get bullied by her peers due to an unfortunate misunderstanding and watch her gradually develop self-contempt. The way her problem was resolved made me tear up a bit; I usually don’t feel so emotionally emphatic towards a fictional character, but the resolution scene felt so sincere, heartwarming and realistic that I could not help it. No spoiler, you guys can check it out. Overall, the demi-girls’ predicaments reinforced the negative connotation associated with discrimination and I thought it was done splendidly well.*spoiler*That’s why episode 11 really caught me and, I think, other viewers off guard. It introduced a conflict between perspectives, which later on led to a rather thoughtful discussion of discrimination.Throughout the series, we enjoy seeing relationship development between the male teacher Takahashi and his demi students. But the students basically depend on no other human teacher than Takahashi. This episode portrays Takashi’s relationships in a new light: they depend on him too much.The vice principle of the school suggests that it would have been better for Takahashi to leave the demi girls on their own, as doing so could have given them opportunities to foster independence and overcome their challenges themselves, while bonding with their peers. And as much as this opinion unnerves the audience, who has witnessed how much the demi girls had to go through, vice principle’s statement has an element of truth.I really found it clever how the show then—for the first time— shifted its main focus to four ‘normal’ human students. They begin to talk about the clash of views between Takahashi and the vice principle. What came next was a conversation that I find to be one of the many memorable conversations from this show.*spoiler ends**non spoiler part continues*To be acknowledged and accepted as who we truly are; not just liked for our looks, wealth, skills, connections or other superficial elements. This desire likely resonates with numerous people. However, because we are all unique and differ from each other, we tend to avoid confronting the difference between us and others, especially during our adolescence, to avoid hurting our peers. As a result, we can become unable to see our friends as who they really are; all we are left with is merely a shallow inclusion.In Demi chan wa kataritai, human students assume that demis want to be treated as humans and believe that treating them as demis is, no doubt, a despicable form of discrimination. While their reasoning makes sense, it is ironically the opposite for the demis; they just want to be treated as who they really are—demis. The conversation between the human boys and girls explains how their treatment towards the demi-girls as human girls reject their demi qualities and would be the true discrimination. The show conveys we should learn to face the discrepancy between us and others, rather than compromising and dismissing the difference between us and others. Refusing to recognize the way a certain individual/group differs from us is possibly a more subtle form of discrimination. Only by learning how to acknowledge the difference, we will be able to form genuine friendship, in which we can be accepted as who we are.It is indisputable that discrimination has harmed countless lives in the past. It still does now, and it will likely to continue doing so in the future as well. However, this does not make it fine to simply treat everyone as the same, while portraying discrimination as the evil. Doing so would equal dismissing our individualistic charms and flaws, which are pivotal to defining our identities. Discrimination is not necessarily harmful; it merely depends on the extent of discrimination. It is inevitable that there will be conflicts when coming to terms with the dichotomy between people. However, they are prerequisites to be see others as who they are and also be seen as who we are. What do you guys/girls think?P.S. This is irrelevant to the topic of discrimination. Another reason why this show resonated with me was because of the students’ relationships with the teacher Takahashi. In our rigorous education system (at least for me. I guess it depends on your location and its culture), it is difficult to develop such personal student-teacher relationships. It is possible, but nevertheless. The relationships Takahashi shares with his students are just beautiful. I am glad that there is no usual student-teacher romance stuff…if excluding the dullahan girl. I am glad the show didn’t put too much focus on that element, as it would likely have killed the heartwarming feelinghttps://somebodymonologue.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/what-if-discrimination-is-inevitable/^some gifs included to make the review better.

Throughout the show you get to see alongside Takahashi-sensi the many strange things which make these girls unique, as well as the many faults...and insecurities which make them human.

Our main character, Takahashi sensei, has a slight curiosity to those named demi’s. It’s known to them later on that Demi’s exist in their school, the first one known I believe was Satou sensei, a succubus who tries to avoid crowds for the sake of her, and for the sake of them.Succubus do not...live a normal life, even though we usually just see them as some sort of sexual character. I mean, it’s not wrong, but after the way Satou lives, I see Succubus as something else, one of the most difficult things to live as.It’s sad to live as a Succubus, since it may be hard to love someone when you have everyone attracted to you sexually. It then begins to take a difficult turn on your life and it affects you in a way that you become isolated from everyone and avoid people.But that’s why we have our main character.Takahashi has to deal with many demi’s.The Fun Vampire HikariThe Loving MachiThe Lonely but not so lonely after a while YukiThe beautiful SatouWith Takahashi, developing a relationship with them could prove challenging, but totally worth it in the end.It wasn't hard to befriend Hikari due to her fun and outgoing personality. After that, it connects to Machi and then to Yuki and so on. It becomes a chain.Takahashi wanted to help any problems they may have, so he researched quite often on each Demi one at a time. To see what they like, don't like, and so on. Once the demi’s see this in him, trust begins to be build in such a way where there’s almost an unbreakable trust.You see, I notice that some may view their relationship as odd, and I see where they’re coming from. It can be viewed as weird or uncommon. But when someone truly shows that they care about someone when they aren't usually wanted (because of their characteristics), then of course a strong bond will be created. In this case, Takahashi and his students. He shows genuine love and cares about their well-being and will do anything in his power to make sure they live a happy life where they can live without any worries. With that in mind, I can overlook the relationship that they have.I do seem to enjoy series where humans coexist with those that aren't too fully human. But seeing how the demi’s are enjoying the human life very greatly, we can basically they're living a human life. But of course in Machi’s case, it can be hard XD.But Slice of Life isn't all there, the interactions with the characters can be in a way deep and explores further into the problems and they work together to figure it out.In a way, it can represent modern day discrimination;where certain groups of people are treated unfairly because of who they are.In this case, Yuki.Before she became a bright girl, she seemed to be unsocial and someone who avoids people. The reason for this may be because of the power she wields. But of course, Hikari breaks through that barrier like nobody’s business. She loves Yuki and therefore goes after her.When Takahashi was able to become friends with the demi’s, the world becomes more colourful with a beautiful and stable relationship.Speaking of colours, the schemes used in the anime give it more shine.Seeing how broken some of the characters are, it’s really amazing what Takahashi sensei can do as a teacher, and a father figure.The journey they had together was splendid and the way they care for each other and supports one another, it’s a relationship that we don't see everyday.The OP and ED are amazing with its catchy song and the way the happiness within the demi’s are represented and portrayed to the viewers is awesome.It brings me full joy and I always had a smile each episode and a ton of laughs.Overall the enjoyment was phenomenal. The feelings, the relationships, and the characters. All are good points and it’s definitely one of my favourite of Winter.Although underrated, it’s a 10/10 in my book. live a normal life, even though we usually just see them as some sort of sexual character.

She loves Yuki and therefore goes after her.When Takahashi was able to become friends with the demi’s, the world becomes more colourful with a beautiful and stable relationship.Speaking of colours, the schemes used in the anime give it more shine.Seeing how broken some of the characters are, it’s really amazing what Takahashi sensei can do as a teacher, and a father figure.The journey they had together was splendid and the way they care for each other and supports one another, it’s a relationship that we don't see everyday.The OP and ED are amazing with its catchy song and the way the happiness within the demi’s are represented and portrayed to the viewers is awesome.It brings me full joy and I always had a smile each episode and a ton of laughs.Overall the enjoyment was phenomenal. The feelings, the relationships, and the characters. All are good points and it’s definitely one of my favourite of Winter.Although underrated, it’s a 10/10 in my book."", 'This was a wonderful series in my opinion. Basically its about school girls with special abilities like Vampire, Dullahans, etc. etc. They are faced with problems which they overcome with by the help of one of the teachers Takahashi-Sensei, who is oddly fascinated with them (as such demis).The show is a 7 because the artwork was very typical of a high school anime. The story was great but could have been brought out in different ways. I have to admit I enjoyed this series quite a lot.I would recommend this too anyone who wants a series that is supernatural but, isnt too over...the border. Like how Highschool DxD is very involved, this one is mostly centered around the setting and the development of the characters. This is also where the topic of high school anime comes in. It is basically a highschool harem but instead of the ""high school boy"" its a teacher. the border.

Personally, I don't feel it took the premise far enough - given that there is a lot of deeper cultural baggage & mythologies to explore (and a lot of opportunities for higher poesy if the premise were placed in the hands of a person with a higher vision) rather than just treating the monster girls like mutants. The best episodes comes from when it combines Folklore Study with the scientific mindset of Takahashi in order to...chart out the possible ways that the myth could have come about from the biological deviations that the mutations grant (the Yuki-Onna episode). The Dullahan-Quantum Physics episode was also very interesting, although from what I know they probably got it wrong (I remember reading somewhere that 'observation' in a quantum sense doesn't necessarily refer to human observation). What matters is that they went there - which makes it more adventurous than other shows of its type.Pretty comfy show, but needs more of a Monogatari Series or Moryou no Hako touch. Themes are normal self-help stuff about finding identity - but its interesting in that it makes a statement about the classmates needing to accept the differences of the Monster Girls rather than trying to 'make them human'.I guess this would put it on somewhat the same wavelength as something like Zootopia. Tries to go deeper than the novelty of the premise, but requires a true reach into the unknown, subtle, and nuanced in order to escape from its current level. chart out the possible ways that the myth could have come about from the biological deviations that the mutations grant (the Yuki-Onna episode).

Ranging from interesting characters to funny comedy, Demi-chan delivers for the most part an interesting take on the comedy genre. While Demi-chan does not have a lot of profound meaning or underlying plot, what it does offer is a delightful 12-episode fun ride sprinkled with some deeper moments here and there.Demi-chan revolves around three half-human, half-monster “demis”, Kyouko Machi, Hikari Takanashi, Yuki Kusakabe, and their high school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi. Along the way, a fourth demi by the name Sakie Satou appears. Although this...may just seem like another moe/comedy in the sea of other shows in this genre, I can assure you that it is more than just that.Starting with our main male protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi, or Takahashi-sensei as the demis refer to him as, is a biology teacher who takes an interest in demi-humans. Seeing as he had never encountered one before, he is very eager to meet them.Our main female protagonist Hikari Takanashi is a very cheerful and energetic vampire. She loves to cling to others, especially Yuki since she finds her skin nice and cool. Even though she is a vampire, she does not bite other people’s necks for blood like vampires in movies do, rather she drinks blood packs sent by the government and blood substitutes like tomato juice to quench her need for blood.In contrast to Hikari’s energetic personality, Yuki Kusakabe is a relatively shy and closed-off girl.  She is a “Yuki-onna”, meaning snow woman. Due to her personality, people around her often mistake her for being cold or apathetic, while in reality she just has a hard time expressing herself properly.Rounding up the pack of three is the dullahan Kyouko Machi. Kyouko is in my opinion the most interesting and fleshed out character of the show. At the beginning, she appears nice, but you can tell that she feels a bit out of place. For instance, in the first episode she is talking to some of her classmates and they ask her if it isn’t a long way to school for her, since she said she walks instead of taking the bus. She replies saying that she is used to carrying her head around due to being a dullahan, which makes the two classmates nervous and they shift the subject. Later on Hikari confronts Kyouko about her being a dullahan, which surprises Kyouko but also makes her happy. The classmates from earlier see this, and come over to talk with her again, but this time without being nervous about mentioning Kyouko being a dullahan.Finally, we have the succubus teacher Sakie Satou, or as Hikari calls her, “Sakki”. Being a succubus, she often distances herself from men due to her innate ability to seduce them if they come in contact with her. When she first meets Takahashi-sensei, she backs off like usual, but later on she comes in contact with him by accident. He acts as if her seductive ability does not work on him, which makes her open up to him.Demi-chan has a nice and colourful art style, which sets the mood for the show. Although it is nothing special or groundbreaking, I believe the series would suffer if the art style were different.Any anime with comedy is immediately going to split people into two groups, the first being those who find it funny and the second being those who do not. Regardless of whether you found the comedy in Demi-chan funny or not, we can agree on one thing; the comedy presents itself in a way that not only expands on the characters, but also reflects on some of the problems these girls have to face. Hikari is usually the front of the jokes, since her energetic personality makes them flow smoother. There was occasionally a joke or two that did not make me laugh or chuckle, and this was more apparent near the end as the series was trying to wrap everything up, but overall the comedy was on-point.As I said earlier, Demi-chan does touch upon some deeper elements from time to time. Even though these moments are not the focus of the show, they do add a layer of depth which otherwise would not be there. For instance, in one of the later episodes a person named Ugaki comes to visit Takahashi-sensei to discuss demi-humans. He explains that while demi-humans have been accepted into society, there are still some that cause trouble. He expresses that if the demis that Takahashi-sensei is teaching start causing trouble, the police have to take them away.Saying that I enjoyed Demi-chan would an understatement. Be it the interactions between the characters, the funny comedic parts or just simply the refreshing take on the genre, Demi-chan never ceased to keep me entertained.Overall, Demi-chan takes an oversaturated genre and freshens it up by adding interesting concepts and charming characters. What it lacks in depth is overshadowed by the great characters and execution, and is highly recommended for anyone interested in the genre. may just seem like another moe/comedy in the sea of other shows in this genre, I can assure you that it is more than just that.Starting with our main male protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi, or Takahashi-sensei as the demis refer to him as, is a biology teacher who takes an interest in demi-humans.

That\'s not the only part that kept me going, however, I can\'t really understate how heartwarming and fun this whole series was from beginning to end. The characters are endearing, the struggles can be both relatable some days and foreign the next, and the animations aren\'t too shabby either.What drives the story is the character development of different demi-humans, or ""demis"" as they call themselves. The MC is a teacher who wants to learn more about them for his thesis paper at college, but he also learns to truly empathize with the struggles that demis face on a daily...basis. Sometimes their issues can be boiled down to typical high school drama, while other days their demi status can be causing a real problem in their daily interactions. I found the whole experience heartwarming and wholesome at a level that I don\'t see often today. Plenty of shows are heartwarming, but then they like to aim more at children. On the flip side, some shows think that to be ""real"" they need a bunch of sex and violence to get their point across. Demi-chan wa Kataritai finds the happy medium here, with Sensei treating the demis like adults (when asking about the nature of a lot of their abilities or cultures surrounding them) and expecting adult reactions. There are adult problems that are understood about each of these demis, yet the show goes out of its way to explain if it\'s still a problem. Better yet, if it\'s not a societal problem anymore, the show often explains how they\'ve gotten around it. Blood from blood banks for vampires, divisions of police for succubi, etc. All of it feels like the world has adapted to allow demis to live comfortably, and the show tries to take us on the journey of making it over that last step to a normal life.This show is worth your time, and I rated much higher than I thought I would.

But as it turns out.... this anime is..... very funny xD I love it! Probably one of the top anime in terms of comedic value I've watched!*SPOILER ALERT*Story: So the story revolves around 4 girls(although 1 is a teacher) who are Demi's, or people who have certain mutations and are different from normal humans, and a teacher Tetsuo Takahashi who is interested in Demi-humans to the point where he ends up befriending the...4 girls(Hikari, Yuki, Machi and Satou-sensei) to find out more about Demi-humans and how he can help them in their difficulties. Sounds serious but.... turns out to be more of a comedy gag show with Hikari being the funniest out of everyone. Demi-chan just gets everything right when it comes to comedy although some of the comedy requires a little bit of intellect to understand. Overall, a light-hearted story full of laughsRating: 10/10Animation: I quite like the animation, because the producers actually put in effort to detail out the facial expressions of every character when they're happy, laughing, angry or sad. And that adds to the comedic value of the anime, to a certain extentRating: 9/10Sound: Can't say anything about the opening and ending cuz I just skept them to go right into the anime(yes that's how funny the anime is). The background noise of the anime is... the ost blends well with the anime and the sound effects are good.Rating: 8/10Characters: I shan't go into details of the characters cos that'll take like 2 pages of the review. My favorite character of the show is.... vampire Hikari(some biaseness cos she's voiced by my fav CV) because she's the most funny and laid back character in the series. She always makes the mood so cheerful and fun in part due to her personality which is.... doesn't really give a damm about anything :v. Then there's Machi(a Dullahan) who's a bit more serious and talks about serious stuff and is a very friendly, polite and caring friend in the series. That immediately makes her likable to everyone. Next is Yuki(snow woman) who is.... the introverted and quiet kind of person, though once she opens up she can be quite fun to hang out with. I find her to be one of the more interesting characters in the series cos her sense of humor is peculiar. Then there's Satou-sensei(a Succubus) who well.... i don't exactly like her even though she can be quite funny. Mainly cos well.... she's lame :v. You know that feeling when you like someone but daren't confess to the person cos of reasons and end up doing stupid things in front of that person.... yea, that's one reason I don't like her. Last but not least, Takahashi sensei who's a bit like Machi. Caring, friendly, polite, easy to talk with. That's why he is surrounded by a harem :vRating: 10/10Enjoyment: Thoroughly enjoyed watching this show it's an anime that'll make you laugh in tears throughout!

It isn't really that original considering that there are many demi-human highschool or adulthood anime out there like Monster Musume, but this is more cleaner (less innuendos) than the previous mentioned anime.Also, I really found the episode where Kyouko goes to university to learn about herself interesting to watch. I could relate to that other intuitive supporting character.The art and design is great. I especially like how Kyouko's flames look (not sure if it's because of the colour or the flame itself, but I think it's cool).The music used in the intro and the end...is fine, and probably would be better if a piano version was made. The voices sync with the characters as well as their expressions.It was pretty nice to watch. I didn't like waiting too long to watch another episode after I finished one. However, even if I do like highschool/Demi-human genres, I don't think this would be my preferred anime to watch (I prefer sci-fi, mecha, magic and fantasy).Overall, this was a great anime.

Due to this, the characters are developed heavily, especially Yuki Kusakabe voiced by Shiina Natsukawa the snow woman and a little later on Sakie Satou voiced by Yoko Hikasa the succubus but the other main cast like Hikari Takanashi voiced by Kaede Hondo the vampire, Kyouko Machi voiced by Minami Shinoda the dullahan, Himari Takanashi voiced by Lynn, Hikari\'s twin sister and the main protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi voiced by Junichi Suwabe get a bit of disguised development through many of the banters the characters with each other (not just with Tetsuo mind you).So going by characters, LA will just say it immediately but LA\'s favourite character went to Sakie Satou and no it\'s not because of her being a succubus (but still her natural beauty is a great bonus nonetheless *cough*), but she along with Hikari getting the best comedic skits in the anime for LA. Sakie\'s comedy revolves around her aphrodisiac effects on Tetsuo and BOTH of their overexaggrated expressions are comedic good albeit a running gag and outside of Tetsuo, she DOES talk about Tetsuo or her succubus effects to the other main casts with very hilarious moments. Hikari is probably the most dynamic of the main cast as she not only is the genkiest character of the series, but she like Sakie and Tetsuo interacts with the rest of the cast and she even gets serious and heartfelt especially during Yuki\'s opening arc. On speaking of Yuki, she is probably the next best character, as her being a snow woman, yes she is awfully shy at first but once she opens up and finishes her opening arc, she gains a very great personality and even better chemistry with the rest of the cast afterwords (with usually her running gag of laughing or trying to keep in her laughter from stupid puns). Kyouko Machi the dullahan has some stellar visually comedic moments (you can tell from the possibilities of being dullahan) also with her ""being a dullahan and her many features"" to her behaviour also makes light, again like the rest of the cast, she has great character chemistry. Next is Himari, Hikari\'s human twin sister, the stern yet loving sister to Hikari as well as having a rather tsundere relationship with Tetsuo, ashing out on him whenever Hikari tricks Himari into thinking Tetsuo has done something lewd to her and really her relationship with Hikari is a focal point in the anime in HAVING a ""monster girl"" as a family member, with hijinks ensuing at the same time prior thanks to Hikari. Finally we get to Tetsuo who is essentially both the catalyst and the reactant to most of the anime as a whole and he too has great character chemistry, from his awkward talks with Hikari and Kyouko to fun experiments with Yuki to his talks with Sakie about her being a succubus and her fanserviced effects on Tetsuo. LA will remind you that Tetsuo relationships with Hikari, Yuki and Kyouko are taken is a sorta harem way, HOWEVER he is still a genuine teacher to them and cares for them just not in the harem sense, Sakie is the only exception as she\'s a teacher just like Tetsuo is thus kinda makes sense they are pushing THAT more than Kyouko or Hikari, also to that point LA wouldn\'t mind Tetsuo and Sakie getting together, it\'s the most LOGICAL out of the bunch in LA\'s eyes.  Aside from Tetsuo\'s character chemistry, he does get a bit of character development later on, mainly about his overreaching help towards the demi\'s and his dilemma if his help is isolating the demi instead of familiarizing the demis with humans more other than himself. What can LA say but the character cast are very dynamic and LA said this countless times, but the cast has great chemistry with one another and is probably the main reason to watch this anime.In terms of animation done by A1-Pictures and the animation is actually pretty polished and very detailed to say the least, from the bright and poppy character designs to the beautiful backgrounds and even with it\'s comedic moments, sure it uses chibi faces at times but those faces are still in place of the detailed character designs at the same time and it can still be used to great effect due to the comedic timing, thus the animation is actually a great standout...nice job A1-Pictures.With the great characters, the voice cast in it\'s entirety is amazing, what else can LA say, it felt like the voice cast knew the characters rather than the other way around. LA\'s favourite character goes to...pointing out the obvious...Yoko Hikasa. But still some standouts are Kaede Hondo as Hikari, Minami Shinoda as Kyouko, Shiina Natsukawa as Yuki and Junichi Suwabe as Tetsuo so yeah...the entire main cast.Now, LA kinda needs to point out the elephant in the room, that being Demi-chan wa Kataritai\'s relationship with it\'s more *ahem* suave older brother anime Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou and LA will say the obvious but the fanservice compared to Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a bit more mature and slightly used for comedic effect (see Sakie for the obvious), saying the god damn obvious, but if you wanted see a less fanservice hell anime vers. of Monster Musume no Iru Nichjou, then this is an obvious pick, especially wanting to know a bit more of the world of Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. LA will note that Demi-chan wa Kataritai still HAS fanservice and isn\'t just omitted and limited to Sakie, there\'s sprinkles of fanservice here and there but not to the point of what Monster Musume no Iri Nichijou takes it to.If there were any flaws LA would list out (as much as LA is praising this anime), LA would just point out that if you think that Hikari is too hyper genki and on speaking of which, Hikari herself ""flirts"" with Tetsuo though it\'s taken for comedy so take that like you will, LA just more or less rolled LA\'s eyes at that notion but knew it was SUPPOSE to taken for comedy and was only used ONCE, anyways Hikari might get slightly annoying nonetheless. The most obvious flaw (which LA needs to point this flaw out, it\'s rather an opinion than a solid flaw) is that it\'s just an anime about comedic talking, nothing more and that can deter some of the audience.Demi-chan wa Kataritai is a slight surprise of Winter 2017 for LA, merely due to how a simple premise can do so much with it and even get serious about certain matters (supernatural racism, ""just being yourself"" and pre-conceived notions can hurt) and the best strength LA has been constantly praising is of it\'s characters and their chemistry with one another. If you want to see a good punchline comedy anime with a more ""heart"" to it and greatly developed cast, then Demi-chan wa Kataritai is one to watch. be it playing against the type or using the monsters mythology and using it in a clever way at looking at monsters (be it through science or common sense on the part of monsters\' behaviour) to it\'s advantage through usual comedic stances. Due to this, the characters are developed heavily, especially Yuki Kusakabe voiced by Shiina Natsukawa the snow woman and a little later on Sakie Satou voiced by Yoko Hikasa the succubus but the other main cast like Hikari Takanashi voiced by Kaede Hondo the vampire, Kyouko Machi voiced by Minami Shinoda the dullahan, Himari Takanashi voiced by Lynn, Hikari\'s twin sister and the main protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi voiced by Junichi Suwabe get a bit of disguised development through many of the banters the characters with each other (not just with Tetsuo mind you).So going by characters, LA will just say it immediately but LA\'s favourite character went to Sakie Satou and no it\'s not because of her being a succubus (but still her natural beauty is a great bonus nonetheless *cough*), but she along with Hikari getting the best comedic skits in the anime for LA. Sakie\'s comedy revolves around her aphrodisiac effects on Tetsuo and BOTH of their overexaggrated expressions are comedic good albeit a running gag and outside of Tetsuo, she DOES talk about Tetsuo or her succubus effects to the other main casts with very hilarious moments. Hikari is probably the most dynamic of the main cast as she not only is the genkiest character of the series, but she like Sakie and Tetsuo interacts with the rest of the cast and she even gets serious and heartfelt especially during Yuki\'s opening arc. On speaking of Yuki, she is probably the next best character, as her being a snow woman, yes she is awfully shy at first but once she opens up and finishes her opening arc, she gains a very great personality and even better chemistry with the rest of the cast afterwords (with usually her running gag of laughing or trying to keep in her laughter from stupid puns). Kyouko Machi the dullahan has some stellar visually comedic moments (you can tell from the possibilities of being dullahan) also with her ""being a dullahan and her many features"" to her behaviour also makes light, again like the rest of the cast, she has great character chemistry. Next is Himari, Hikari\'s human twin sister, the stern yet loving sister to Hikari as well as having a rather tsundere relationship with Tetsuo, ashing out on him whenever Hikari tricks Himari into thinking Tetsuo has done something lewd to her and really her relationship with Hikari is a focal point in the anime in HAVING a ""monster girl"" as a family member, with hijinks ensuing at the same time prior thanks to Hikari. Finally we get to Tetsuo who is essentially both the catalyst and the reactant to most of the anime as a whole and he too has great character chemistry, from his awkward talks with Hikari and Kyouko to fun experiments with Yuki to his talks with Sakie about her being a succubus and her fanserviced effects on Tetsuo. LA will remind you that Tetsuo relationships with Hikari, Yuki and Kyouko are taken is a sorta harem way, HOWEVER he is still a genuine teacher to them and cares for them just not in the harem sense, Sakie is the only exception as she\'s a teacher just like Tetsuo is thus kinda makes sense they are pushing THAT more than Kyouko or Hikari, also to that point LA wouldn\'t mind Tetsuo and Sakie getting together, it\'s the most LOGICAL out of the bunch in LA\'s eyes.

But rather than preaching for a certain view, the topic is discussed and usually ended with a ""well, we\'ll see where this goes"" -- because Demis have yet to integrate fully. Doesn\'t feel like a cop-out, doesn\'t feel like a sermon.Honestly, this is the most perfectly *just good* show I\'ve seen in a long time. Along the same lines as Seitokai...Yakuindomo S1 and maybe Hitsugi no Chaika (IIRC): the first few episodes lay out what the viewer should be expecting, and the rest of the series fulfills it very honestly. For that reason, enjoyment is the more important factor in this review. To cover the other points:* Story is simple, cute, & characters are introduced one at a time in the first few episodes.* Nice art, nothing that stood out for better or worse. Environments could be rather bland.* Average OP/ED biz, BGM did its job (again, didn\'t stand out)* Takahashi-sensei is RIPPED.Good premise made great. 8 <- great show, tons of fun, but *outstanding* in very few ways, so not worth a 9.

If you came here looking for another Monster Musume, look elsewhere. The series has a simple premise of 'how do demi-humans fit into regular human society?' It is a joy to see each character emerge from their shells as they learn how to live with their peculiar abilities. Ultimately the show is a social commentary about how difficult it is to adjust yourself to a new environment. Despite this underlying theme, warmth and happiness still fill the entire scope of this show.The characters are this shows strong point and all of them are...highly engaging and unique individuals. This is the type of show where it becomes very difficult to choose a 'best girl'. From vampires to dullahans each character has a defining trait that makes them a joy to watch. If you've ever wondered how a dullahan would live with a separated head, you'll be pleasantly surprised to see how adorable it is.The student-teacher relationships present in the show drive the progression of the story and you can be assured that no romances take place here. The true romance lies with another teacher, who is a succubus. This leads to all sorts of hilarious scenarios where she must evaluate whether or not she is experiencing true love.If you want to feel happy, I definitely recommend watching this show. highly engaging and unique individuals.

Characters are cute but in their own ways different and their own personalities. There is of course moe-effect but it is contained in perfect amount for this kind of anime so everything doesn\'t seem ""sugarcoatedly moe"". This really is a less ecchi kind of monster girl anime compared to monster musume. Both are great animes on their own accord and because they have developed and enjoyable characters that go through everyday life situations and it is really eye-opening to have things looked from different aspects. That physics explanation for dullahans neck was a really funny and intriguing(studie physics...in university level).  And also for example how legends about these demis could have been formed through ages and how and why those stories have or don\'t have ""real"" basis. Eye-opening in such way that there are people in this world too that have special needs or differences that affect their lives in such ways that they are ""similar"" to those depicted in this anime. This really could also make people think how to improve and help those people like sensei does here.So this animes good handling of multiple chars. and warmth radiating atmosphere make this a joy to watch.

This one moved me enough to want to rate and discuss it. It may seem unorthodox or unrelated to some people, but I\'ll be contrasting this with Monster Musume (Everyday Life with Monster Girls), and I\'ll explain why in the review.I watched this one based on a suggestion from a friend and then running across a compilation of scenes from the show on Youtube. His synopsis wasn\'t a very detailed explanation, but the preview bits sold me on checking it out, and I\'m so glad I...did!!**STORY**Honestly I like the premise a lot. It\'s far more realistic than some and the show attempts to go in the same vein as M. Night Shymalan\'s movie Unbreakable. We\'re discussing what people perceive to be the supernatural, but could have a scientific explanation for it. The show doesn\'t try to push this theme too hard, but it makes for a good change of pace from time to time.Now with a good premise like this, you could even explore a lot of the typical HS anime tropes with a fresh perspective. It does feel this was the initial idea, and exposition about the girls feelings is well-done with them coming to Tetsuo for advice at times. For me, the only reason this isn\'t walking away with a 9 or 10 is the dialogue was a bit bland. This could just be the Crunchyroll sub that made it that way, but it just seemed like rather weak dialogue for the characters. Still, the show pulls through and delivers a solid first season. Very glad I gave this a try! What does this have to do with Monster Musume?**ART**I\'m not much of an artist, so I can only give surface-level critique. It looks good, but nothing seemed to deviate too far from the status quo. In my opinion, a 9 is a perfect score for quality, but you\'d need something unique or creative in terms of style to get a 10. This is in no way a diss on it, the show looked great and it was quality work by talented people no doubt.**SOUND**I usually lump in the dub with this rating, but since I\'m basing this on the sub I also have to factor in music. As far as sound quality, the voice actors seemed great and their voices suited the character designs. The OP and ED along with incidental music wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t very noticeable either. Blended in, but didn\'t really stoke my attention. As I said, nothing was bad, just not remarkable enough to warrant anything past ""good"".**CHARACTERS**This section could get huge, but I\'ll keep it simple since I\'m breaking it down for main characters:-Tetsuo: Definitely a +1 to your typical harem male protagonist. He has a realistic purpose for existing and his interest in the girls is not shifty or weird. The ""oblivious guy"" trope gets overdone a lot, but being a science nerd (albeit a very BUFF one for some reason...) it makes sense.- Hikari: Ok, yeah she\'s not THAT original of a character but you still love her to death. She gets most of the showtime out of the girls, but you still like her so it doesn\'t feel unnatural. Her situations and quirks seem plausible, making her a good character to explore and learn about.- Kyouko: She\'s a nice character as well, though I will say she\'s the one who gets sexualized the most out of the demi students. Her breasts are WAY more prominent than the other girls and since she\'s a Dullahan, there are some things that get a bit questionable about how Tetsuo interacts with her (just..you know, laying a teenage girl\'s disembodied head in your lap), but she at least seems to have pure-ish intentions for a young woman. I don\'t think the hints at her wanting to progress a relationship with Tetsuo fit the tone of the show, but it wasn\'t egregiously racy.- Yuki: The one who arguably got the least attention of the 3 demi students. She has the least explanation for her supernatural abilities, but she also seems to get little character development as well. She\'s also another super ""polite"" character, which Kyouko kinda falls under as well. Would have been nice to see her be a little more Tsundere (being a snow woman, figured that\'s a good pun), but she\'s still likeable. Maybe with more screen time she could get developed better.- Sakie: Ok, I feel they just really hit it outta the park with this character (and it\'s not her succubus powers influencing this!!). While the dream power she has is rather implausible, the intense aphrodisiac effect she has seems very plausible. The fact that she tries to conceal it with clothes and lack of contact is just perfectly done. They could have easily turned her into a lewdfest, but they didn\'t and she\'s just the perfect amount of sexiness to make her character believable as a succubus. The touch thing seems a bit overboard, but was done in a funny manner. I feel the ""jiggle physics"" gag was perfectly done, as it\'s something that most assuredly would catch a guy\'s attention and have that effect. Even up to the last episode, they kept this character very classy and could have gone overboard, but didn\'t. I\'d have to say she\'s the best-written character.**ENJOYMENT**My metric for this is always ""How hard was it to turn off?"" and I can say this one was quite enjoyable. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole here. While some of the characters might have room for improvement, the music wasn\'t anything to write home about, and the dialogue could be vanilla at times, the show is funny and enjoyable to watch. I\'m usually not a ""laugh out loud"" person, but this show made me choke on soda a few times mid-sip. The combination of everything is just very well done, like a quality cheeseburger...it doesn\'t need crazy flavors or outlandish ingredients to be good, it just needs to be quality ingredients with love and care put into preparation...and it shows with this anime. I watched the whole first season in two sittings. The first 8 in one sitting, then the last 5 after that. I liked it!**OVERALL**You can tell the people making this liked what they were working on. There\'s an endearing quality to the whole thing that\'s hard to pinpoint. Like with other great shows, it\'s something you just sit and enjoy. It\'s not trying to throw you narrative curveballs to feign originality or toss out tacky fanservice to cover a bad story/characters. It handles the content well, and even with the slight gripes it\'s more room for improvement rather than pointing out something that\'s ""wrong"". The most I could toss at this show as far as negativity, is that in some things it tried to be too ""safe"". Being quite honest, it\'s hard to find that unreasonable as their approach these days with how expensive and risky animating a series can be.""So what does all this have to do with Monster Musume?"" you ask? Well I saved this for the end because this is rant-ish but very relevant to Interviews with Monster Girls...I\'m no prude and I\'m honestly VERY anti-censorship because censorship is not a voluntary thing, that\'s forcing YOUR morals on others without their consent. I also watched the entire Monster Musume series a couple of times, so I did finish it and watched it more than once (the Crunchyroll TV version). So I don\'t want that series censored or for it to not exist, but please keep that preface in mind when reading the rest of my comments.M.M. was basically softcore hentai and beneath that was SOME good writing, (will cover that in a review) but the focus for the show was the loud fanservice. The monster-ness of the girls was more along the tangent of getting to a girlfriend archetype than their actual differences from humans and how that plays out/exists. Not a literary sin itself, but more like misappropriated potential. If the lewdness was turned down, I would have liked M.M. a lot more. I also had the same problem with Ichigo Mashimaro, though it\'s to a much lesser degree than MM. There was much better writing in Ichigo Mashimaro but the sexualizing little girls was rather aggravating and bothersome to me.Now here\'s where Interview with Monster Girls comes in. Here we have a great show that explores the concept with much more richness and detail, without over-the-top fanservice, and I certainly hope it explodes and is as successful as MM was, or maybe more. I believe both should exist, but it\'s annoying to see good writing get overlooked for lack of fanservice. BOTH should exist in this world, as the writers intended, but a series shouldn\'t have to toss that in to be good. I would feel awkward watching MM with ANYONE, but I\'d feel comfortable watching Interviews with Monster Girls with nearly any anime fan.

Demi chan wa kataritai is an anime that at first glance looks like your typical moe-generic anime setting but on a deeper level it has so much to offer for its viewers.The main theme of the anime is to portray the inner struggles of its characters through overcoming them and accepting their own nature. It’s all about finding your own identity and a place to fit in the society....Our characters aren’t your typical normal high school students ,they are supernatural beings that belong to the legends and myths from different cultures and countries. We have a Dulahan, a Snow woman , a Succubus and finally a Vampire.The anime offers an insight on the daily lives of those characters and their struggles to fit in the human world. What’s impressive for this anime is the fact that it never loses his reality approach on each problem of our characters although they belong in the supernatural department. Using psychology , common sense , ethics and physics knowledge the anime goes deeper into the inner struggles of each of our characters to find and understand the root that causes there own problems.Guiding a student to the right path in life, listening to each of it’s small concerns and helping him overcome them is what a good teacher is supposed to do. It’s not about ethics here the problem but more of common sense , a teacher is a symbol of admiration and respect for its students and the anime puts in discussion this topic. In the Japanese education system a teacher is more like a family member for its students , it dedicates all of his time to understand his students and guide them through life. Sometimes a simple “thank you” is what makes a teacher proud more than the grades his students obtain.The transition between the comedy and drama moments is poorly done. Sometimes the emotional atmosphere is ruined by the comic relief acts from the characters.For many people this may not seem a noticeable issue but it affects the overall story it loses some of the dramatical impact delivered for its audience.In conclusion how others perceive you in a society is what usually establishes your own identity. Being different from others is not a bad thing and that’s what this anime tries to deliver to its audience. Understanding what makes you different and accepting your own nature helps you and the ones around you to come to a coexistence.A 8/10 and damn A-1 made a good anime! .Our characters aren’t your typical normal high school students ,they are supernatural beings that belong to the legends and myths from different cultures and countries.

It didn\'t really ""click"" for me, but it is a good show and it is worth watching.Detailed breakdown below:Story:The story is a fairly calm one, pretty much without much drama. There was one awkward place where the story tried to make events more dramatic, but it quickly gave up on doing that. The pacing and overall mood resembles shows like Yuyushiki, ""Flying Witch"" or that one show which depicted life of banking workers (which name eludes me).The story mostly concentrate on character\'s antics, and while events happen...in order, there really isn\'t much of an overarching plot with a grand end goal. So, just a slice of life anime with some comedy.Art:Art is fairly low detailed (still, not as bad as faces were, say, in Mahouka), but animation is quite good. Hikari is very well animated and moved in quite fluid manner, she is interesting to watch. The protagonist, however, looks a bit odd and something about his face doesn\'t look right. Overall it is mostly a cuter designs of characters, with some quality animation.Characters:The girls are interesting to watch, even though they\'re fairly stereotypical and without complex motives. Basically, they act mostly for the purpose of advancing story. The protagonist is really odd in comparison to them, because he displays very little character aside from having interest in talking to ""demi"" (which is never explained). Basically, it is almost as if he got no personality. Still the girls are interesting enough, and when they get screen time, they counterbalance oddness of the protagonist of the story.Enjoyement:It was interesting enough to watch, just it wasn\'t quite what I needed.Overall:I\'d recommend to watch this if you\'re looking for a light-hearted show that doesn\'t have tons of drama to it, and provides some light entertainment. It is somewhat similar to ""Flying witch"" or ""yuyushiki"", so if you liked those, you\'ll probably like this one too.  If you want gore, drama, fanservice and epic fights, though, you\'ll need something else. in order, there really isn\'t much of an overarching plot with a grand end goal.

It got 7.8 score which is more than enough for an anime without an actual plot and just filled with cute girls doing cute things...A-1 pictures is indeed one of the big whale in the anime industry...

I don\'t usually watch this genre of anime and I don\'t remember how I happen to come upon it, yet I will admit I enjoy watching this show. Reading some of the reviews make me question why some attempt to take the show to seriously, there are no major plot points and that\'s okay. What makes the show great are it\'s characters. Yes the teacher might be a little to ""hands ons"" yet it\'s a fictional show based on Demi-humans, normal relationships get thrown out the window. The star of the show...is a young vampire named Hikari, who you can\'t helped to be drawn to and chuckle at all her little quirks and habits. The writing and voice over work behind her is excellent, which brings me to my next suggestion. Stay away from the dub, I love dubs for most shows but this isn\'t one of them. The original voice overs are what makes this show enjoyable. is a young vampire named Hikari, who you can\'t helped to be drawn to and chuckle at all her little quirks and habits.

Although some of it is also used for metaphor and with some of the issues being a subtle social commentary, which makes us all wish we had a Takahashi-Sensei to solve life's issues.If you like comfy character driven slice of life anime, then this should be high on your list. own, or when out and about with others, you know how they react in different situations, and it remains consistent with it.It is also refreshing to see demi's being used in a non-ecchi / fetishist way, they are treated as normal characters and not as fanservice, also they aren't just tacked on characteristics, but part of who they are and affect their everyday lives / how they live.

Yeah, me neither.Story:Takahashi is a biology teacher with great interest in demi-humans (basically mythical creatures), but there aren’t that many around to study. Luckily for him, it turns out that three students as well as a teacher in his school are in fact demi-humans, so he proceeds to interview them in the name of science. I could not foresee which direction this plot would take, but I expected it to become either an ecchi harem with tons of cringe or a wacky comedy. In the end, it decided to be a relaxing slice of life show with...some comedy for good measure, which is probably the best way to go for Demi-chan. It was also a good idea to handle the demi-humans as people rather than species, which quite some fantasy stories love to do. One might expect this show to tackle the subject of potential racism as well, but that only gets touched slightly. I think that’s for the better, as this is not a drama and another anime might do a better work with this matter. We also have one of the students as well as the succubus teacher being infatuated with Takahashi, but thankfully this never gets the main focus. In total, this show knows what it is and more importantly, it knows what it isn’t. If something prevents it from being great, it’s the slow pacing (which does not equal being boring, mind you).9/10Art:Demi-chan is not as colorful as other slice of life/comedy anime out there, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The show goes for “realism” (for the lack of a better word), in the sense that there is no magical abilities or any such thing. Everybody is quite normal, with the exception of the demi-humans having some physical differences (granted, Machi is a borderline case). Unfortunately Demi-chan also takes some liberties when it comes to wide-angle shots, where everything turns a little mushy. Besides that the show looks fine to me. They went for a flashy effect with the pool water in the final episode, which is really nice to look at, but wasn’t really necessary.7/10Sound:All the voice actors do a solid to good job. Takahashi sounds like the nice “daddy” type of guy and all the girls are playing their archetypes well. Even the side-characters like Satake sound pretty good. I didn’t really know any of the seiyuus (which doesn’t say much, since I’m rather ignorant when it comes to individual praise and remembering their names) with the exception of Sora Amamiya, who I didn’t even recognize, which could be considered a good thing I guess. The opening song was okay, though a little too low-key for my taste. It does fit the atmosphere of the anime, so I’m not complaining. I really enjoyed the ending however, which was very relaxing and upbeat. The soundtrack in general was like this and worked well in combination with everything else.8/10Characters:Takashi is an eager teacher, who passionately studies demi-humans, but unlike a scientist, he is very interested in the sociological side of the subject. He tries his best to treat the girls as normal people instead of fascinating freaks of nature (which may sound cruel, but technically, that’s what they are). He also struggles with balancing his research and his actual job, afraid that he might favor the demis over his other students. He is a very likeable guy who has noble motives while being passionate nonetheless.Hikari is his first vict…I mean, interview partner. She was born a vampire, though she doesn’t fit many of the classical vampire tropes. She is a very energetic one and loves to have some fun. But where others of her kind get tiresome after a while, Hikari never crosses that line. She is a really kind girl, always willing to go out of her way to help others and make things more fun for them. Except maybe her sister, but siblings are a whole different matter anyway.Machi was the one character who did not click with me. I thought she was just too…plain. That’s kinda odd, since one of the points of this anime was that the demi-humans are normal people character-wise. But if everybody else has an interesting quirk or something like that, being just there makes you fall flat in my eyes.Yuki starts out as a depressed little fellow who cannot comprehend her inhuman nature, but after having “the talk” (just kidding) with Takahashi-sensei, she warms up (pun intended) to her fellow students. Contrary to the first impression she leaves, she has a wacky side to her, being somewhat of a covert pervert and unable to contain her laughter when hearing very bad, lame puns. I didn’t care much for her Saddy McSadface introduction (which probably makes me a horrible person), but later on I started to like her a little.Last but not least we have Sakie-sensei, a succubus who is ashamed of the effect she has on others and which makes her life as a teacher complicated. She has a huge crush on Takashi and starts behaving like a schoolgirl whenever he’s around (or when she’s at home fantasizing about him). It’s really cute to see her trying to seduce him without using her pheromones or being too pushy. She also does a fine job as a big sister mentor for the demi girls, because as a teenage girl you don’t want to discuss everything with a male teacher.The rest of the cast is of no big importance and does what they have to to move the story along. Most of them turn out to be nice people in the end, after all, this is a cozy anime at its core.7/10Enjoyment:Demi-chan is a nice little show that is easy to consume, relaxing and at times funny. The cast is full of nice people (mostly) and it’s a joy to see everybody having a good time. I don’t think that I will remember much about it in a year or so, but if anybody should ask me about it I’ll probably say “Oh yeah, I liked that show”. In a weaker season this may have even been my AOTS, but with shows like KonoSuba 2 and Kobayashi running the comedy and slice of life departments this winter, Demi-chan may appear a little weaker in comparison. It’s still a solid recommendation for anyone who wants to spend some time watching something with good vibrations.8/10Overall:7.8/10 some comedy for good measure, which is probably the best way to go for Demi-chan.

You've got an interesting concept, paired up with solid characters, there is not much you can go wrong here except for the writing. Thankfully the writing is not the issue with this series. While I know that those watching or have watched the show might bring up the concern about the misuse of a teacher's position...to take advantage of their students. This is because the show presents a strong male teacher constantly giving an extensive amount of hands to the fellow demi-students. But I stand strong with my man Takahashi because he does it right by getting consent from all the students. With that cleared, what are the times you see a lady-killer like Mr. Takahashi, while I have seen some characters in other shows where the guy keeps getting chased by the girls, I have yet to see one where does not try at all to appeal to girls and still get them. Like, seriously, what a gentleman he is, while there a few times I felt he went slightly over the line I feel he makes it up with what he does later. But apart from the show, I think this is quite an accurate depiction of friendly teachers, in school, I do realize that teachers are actually quite childish and they could best be pals with their students. That's a nice takeaway I liked about the show. Plus the incorporation of this 'demi' idea into the real world is done pretty well that it gives that realism to the show. While it's not groundbreaking or anything, I do feel it's an enjoyable watch.-SCORES-Character- 8/10: Got a chad, gentleman for a teacher, the lovely person all around, Machi, the balancer of the trio, Yuki and the cute troublemaker, Hikari. Moreover, Sakie is pretty cute too. What I love about the show is that they managed to make all their characters lovable without trying too hard. Plus I know it's a very common pick but, Machi is the best girl for me. I guess what I wish was that the supporting characters like Satake are more dwelled into.Art- 8/10: Fantastic job, love the characters, they got noses and not all of them have gigantic oppais.Writing- 8/10: While I have read the manga and it's still ongoing so I can't really complain about the direction if there hasn't been one, but I say they do a good job on making the whole experience enjoyable. Plus, there has to be a second season to this right? Right? Please?Sound- 8/10: Nothing too amazing here as the sound can play little contribution to the score, but I'll say it's decent. Intro and outro fit the theme of the show and that's good.Overall, I just would love to see more from these bunch of lovable people, definitely would love to see a second season to this.Light to Decent 8 to take advantage of their students.

I appreciate the focus on character development and attempting to rationalize demi-humans over sexualization and fan-service. While others may argue that it still occurs, when sexual topics were occasionally brought up, they were done a way that felt appropriate and organic to the narrative.Having already read up to volume 6 of the English translation, I believe that this has been a faithful adaptation of the manga so far. I have to admit that when I heard about this adaptation, I was worried. As long as the creative...teams continue to work with similar due diligence, I look forward to any future manga and anime from this series.The animation was beautiful and really did bring the manga to life rather than just being a frame for frame mimic.Overall, this is a good series, especially for those not into fan-service or hyper-antics. As someone who will be going into teaching, I find Takahashi Sensei to be an admirable character.I hope others out their will enjoy. teams continue to work with similar due diligence, I look forward to any future manga and anime from this series.The animation was beautiful and really did bring the manga to life rather than just being a frame for frame mimic.Overall, this is a good series, especially for those not into fan-service or hyper-antics.

BUT thats ok because this show makes up for that (somewhat)Lets get right to reviewingThe story. 7/10. its not the best story under the sun its the cliche girls at highschool theme but oh boy does it make it 10000000000 times better that they're monster girls.Art. 9/10. The girls are so cute and really well animated. The dullihans flame has a great color to it and the succubus' tits bounce like real ones.The sound is an 8/10. Op is fun to listen to and the...voice acting (sub and dub for muh dub people(dont worry im one too)) is great. The voices fit the characters like puzzle pieces.NOW THE CHARACTERS.10/10. Much like yuru camp I loved the girls and the guy(not gay tho). Hikari especially because she was the perfect blend between cute and funny. Machi is fun to watch struggle with her head but she is also cute in ways. Yuki has some cool qualities like her stress sweat turning into ice. Mrs sato is well a succubus so her struggles are fun to watch animated and Mr takahashi is a boring guy in his mid 20's who likes staring at monster girls (much like me)8/10 in enjoyment. Not much goes on but the events that do take place are enjoyable.Overall this show is an 8/10. voice acting (sub and dub for muh dub people(dont worry im one too)) is great.

The anime was short and very cute as well as relatable. It hit the heart more than I thought it would. The girls in the anime have stories and problems that I personally understand. It's nice to see that over the course of the anime that they can work and find ways to overcome their weaknesses. I wished that the story could have shown more screen time with the humans perspective on the monster girls and gave certain characters more screen time. I...would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who loves a calm story that really stirs up emotions. And I saw 13 episodes on Crunchyroll so I don't know if there's been a mistake on MAL, but there is 13 not 12 like it says. Oh and the anime had a beautiful ending and was overall a beautiful anime. would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who loves a calm story that really stirs up emotions.

There were some issues with the way the set up played out.Story - 5:The story was alright. But one of the issues with it is that the main character is a teacher, and all of the students develop feelings for him in one way or another. He does right by trying to avoid their advances (to a certain extent), but they play up them making a move on him and then someone seeing...or finding out about it leading to a misunderstanding. This is overdone.Some of the episodes try to have a bit of a more serious tone as the characters deal with some problems they face, but, at least for me, the problems they encountered didn't seem all that bad, especially for how much they played it up.The setup of the main character being intrigued by the demi-humans is good because it allows him to fill the shoes of the viewer who is also unfamiliar with demi-humans and would want to ask questions as well.They also sometimes set up some new characters or raise some questions that don't get addressed very well, this happened not once but twice, and it definitely feels unsatisfying when it happens.Art - 5:Typical anime art, nothing particularly good or bad about it (except for this really jaring 3d water from one of the later episodes that just felt so out of place, but it only lasted for like 30 seconds max, so I'm not going to take off points for that.)Sound - 3:Boring soundtrack.Character - 6:I thought the most of the characters were kinda boring, nothing too bad about them, I just wasn't too interested.Takahashi is a decent protagonist with only being guilty of lacking any sort of flaws and therefore personal growth throughout the series. He's the protagonist, but the show really isn't about him. I like his inquisitive nature and tendency to get lost in thought.Satou is by far the best character in this series. She has struggles, goals, and growth through the series. My biggest issue is that she didn't get the screen time she deserved. She had like 1.5 episodes about her, which was just enough to set up her powers, struggles, and goals. Unfortunately nothing much came of her in the end, which was quite disappointing.Enjoyment - 7:Despite its flaws I did like watching it, I just feel like anything this show did has been done better in some aspect. or finding out about it leading to a misunderstanding.

I may miss some points, but just please hear me through! I stumbled upon this anime by recommendation, and decided it looked decent enough to give it a try. Demi-chan wa Kataritai is a fairly short, enjoyable anime, but lacked certain elements and a real plot.Story:I think the story is what I disliked most about this anime, as there was no real storyline. Sure, it's cool, four demis together at the same school. But nothing really happens except the demis making friends and accepting their true nature. I suppose it was just a little boring, in my opinion.Art:The art...was very beautiful, everything animated very nicely. No complaints here.Sound:Sound, ahh, the sound! The sound was great, especially the theme songs! The opening song makes me very happy, I really love it! The ending song is nice, too, but especially the opening. The other aspects of sound were good too.Character:The characters were all very interesting, different, and unique. Hikari especially, she's fun. There aren't actually very many characters in this anime, but all were well done and have colorful personalities. They all had good character development, Kusakabe and Machi especially. They both started off quite shy. They would have been good characters even if they weren't demis, but their demi natures certainly helped.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this anime, I really did. But I wouldn't call it one of my favorite animes, due to one fact. It was often boring. Just a lot of sitting around, studying the demi girls. I've mentioned this before though, and it's not fair to say that this anime didn't have any interesting moments. There were plenty. Just not enough for me to enjoy it more.

Good art, interesting premise, interesting cast.(some spoilers)This is a slice of life with demi-humans and that's what it focuses on first and foremost. There's a fairly small cast which worked well in terms of giving the anime more of a focus on each character.There isn't a plot to speak of so don't get your hopes up there.The characters are more or less well written. The main issue with this anime is that it completely neglects one of the most interesting characters, the succubus.You'd think that the MC, with all of his obsessing over demi-humans, would be interested in...studying Sakie the succubus, but instead she gets relegated to more of a supporting cast role. For an anime with an already very small pool of main characters, it was strange to me that they decided to more or less ignore this one.The anime also alludes to some sort of romance plot between the MC and Sakie but never follows through with anything like that. In fact, most of Sakie's character building and basic plotline gets ignored. The anime kind of just fizzles out towards the end of the season and there's no sort of interesting development of any kind. That was by far my biggest gripe. The writers hint at all sorts of possibilities throughout the season but never follow through with any of them.The art was nice, i'll give it that.If you want a really basic slice of life with some demi-human schoolgirls fawning over their professor you might enjoy this anime. Do not bother getting invested in any of the characters because there's very little in the way of character development or plotline. For what it is, this anime still deserves a 7/10. studying Sakie the succubus, but instead she gets relegated to more of a supporting cast role.

It also centers into the points that this does not mean trying to tiptoe around their differences or pretending that these differences don't exist, but acknowledging that people are different and respecting them. It does a pretty good job of conveying this message when it tries, but I felt that the other aspects were kind of weak. The structure of the anime is slice of...life, focusing on the characters every day lives without any sort of overarching plot. Now beyond what message that such shows may want to convey, I believe such shows generally have two core aspects that determine how good they are, the strength of their cast and the how amusing they are in terms of comedy and such. I don't think this show did either of those particularly well. The characters were decent enough in general, but with the way the show flowed I didn't get all that attached to them to the level I do other slice of life anime. I think part of that is that it didn't feel like it delved that much into the characters beyond a simple introduction to them and getting through their original problems, which were resolved a bit too quickly and easily it felt like. I also felt that in terms of how amusing it was it was only decent. The comedy felt somewhat weak and portions centered around that felt like they were dragging on at times. The attempts at explaining phenomenon and legends related to Demis were hit and miss, wherein they were interesting when these were simple, but the attempts at trying more complex explanations were strange, such as the attempt to connect dullahans to quantum mechanics which felt cringe worthy and not even close to the same ballpark to how quantum mechanics actually works.In terms of animation it was decent. The art style, especially in regards to character designs felt a bit too simple and flat considering what the anime is about. The soundtrack and OP/ED were decent but not particularly memorable, though how the OP changed was a nice touch. life, focusing on the characters every day lives without any sort of overarching plot.

Monster folk have sprung into the world, or at least into public consciousness, through poorly understood means. These means are typically alluded to throughout the story in various character interactions, and aren\'t always fully understood by the characters themselves.That sounds like a criticism. I assure you it is not. By leaving the broader circumstances of the setting as a point of ambiguous mystery, the story is magnified onto Tetsuo Takahashi and his Monster girl students. If I have any broad criticism of anime as an entire medium, is that it often lacks focus. Demi-chan wa Kataritai, if anything,...is extremely focused. Ordinary high school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi wants to understand the physiology of Monsters, as well as how they fit in with human students. An anthropological study almost. By keeping the nucleus of the series so deeply focused on its cast individual lives, it can avoid having to world build to large extents. The series also cleverly adds some world details through character interactions in a subtle manner. It works quite well.I reiterate, this is a good angle. I also reiterate, it keeps it\'s focus well.The characters are quality as well. There is no melodrama that is typically found in Shoujo anime. The most dramatic situation involves Yuki Kusakabe, resident Snow Woman (more on her later), and it is far from melodramatic. The four main monster girls Hikari (Vampire), Sakie Satou (Succubus teacher), Kyouko Machi (Dullahan), and aforementioned Yuki Kusakabe (SNow WOman) all have distinct personalities, and are each individually endearing in their own ways.  They have down to earth struggles that keep the series honed in on it\'s wholesome situations that will illicit chuckles from any audience. This pairs well with Takahashi\'s genuine enthusiasm for his work and his students, which is a very infectious character trait.So with such high praise? Why a 6? Before I continue, I will submit that it was almost a 7. The show hinges on it\'s quality cast, so the show essentially lives and dies on them and them alone.The issue largely lay in character development of said characters. I blame this on the meager 12 episode format, but the only character that develops significantly is Yuki. The process of Yuki\'s development from the beginning to the end is very well handled. The cast\'s role in her development is also up to snuff.But she is the only one. The other characters subsist to the final episode on charm alone, but they are all fairly static with the exception of Yuki. It feels underwhelming for such a stellar cast to ultimately be so static. Granted, I noted quite early that the episode count was only 12 and that things were moving quite slowly about half way through. In this sense, I was thoroughly braced for the lack of development.What dunked this charming series from a 7 to a 6 was the pitiful final episode. The charm was still there, but the audience is ultimately left with nothing to chew on. The episode retains the charm, with it\'s character focus being Sakie. But here is the rub: She is dealing with the same struggle she has experienced the entire series and still makes no progress. The episode than meanders into Scooby-Doo antics for the remaining half, followed by a vague sentiment of a promising future into a starry festival sky.I know the previous paragraphs threatens to fly in the face of the ""no spoilers"" guideline, but that description could describe almost every underwhelming shoujo/rom-com ending in anime:- Vague feel good sentiment- Nothing happensThe lack of development across the entire cast can be attributed to external issues such as the short season. The underwhelming final note is the result of writing and decision making, and is unfortunately what kept Demi-chan wa Kataritai from being a little better. It\'s obviously unrealistic for any story to tie up EVERY loose end so concisely, but I just needed a PIECE of character advancement in those final moments to get a sense of satisfaction. I was denied this.In the end, I am recommending this series. Anything above average (i.e. above a 5) is worth watching in my opinion. These characters will capture your attention only to let you down somewhat. But they are still charming and the show has a solid angle to approach it\'s subject matter. I hope the series gets a second season. I will definitely watch because I overall enjoyed the series, but also because I suspect that the character development issue could be solved with more episodes to flesh out the story. is extremely focused.

possible SpoilersAfter finishing Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maids I wasn't sure what this anime could give me that would be in the area of adorable characters, but surprisingly enough this was still a very good anime which had it's own bundle of laughs.The story begins with Tetsuo Takahashi who is a biology teacher that is also very interested in Demi-Humans and to his surprise there happen to be 4 of them at his high school so of course he wouldn't pass this up to know more about them.I honestly liked the story for this show it was interesting founding out more about the Demi-girls and...their kinds history as it takes well known myths like do Vampires hate Garlic, how Dullahan's eat even though their head is separate from the body, what causes a Snow girl to create ice particles and even how strong a Succubus's temptation is , it was very interesting founding out these facts and how informative the show was instead of having to rely on comedy which it had, but wasn't shoved in your face like some anime's.It was also nice seeing the Demi-girls relationship grow with Tetsuo who wanted to know more about them and also help fit more into human society since of course there would be complications from time to time.The characters were great each of the Demi-girls felt unique and had great chemistry together which made you feel like you want to be good friends with them, they ranged from Hikari the Vampire who isn't really into blood sucking and more nibbling your arm, Machi a kind and very self-less Dullahan, Yuki a shy but funny Snow Girl and Miss Satou a very desperate Succubus.The way these characters were was great I loved the jokes that happened from time to time and I was really into the experiments Tetsuo would do to prove theories from myths and legends about their kind to see whether they were true or not, it was also interesting seeing how they fit in human society since each of them has something that can impact their life and make things difficult at times.I really liked Tetsuo as well he was a cool teacher someone you'd definitely want watching your back or having a nice conversation with and I really liked the development of the relationship between teacher and student.There is hints at times of Romance like Miss Satou falling for Tetsuo because she thought her succubus powers didn't affect him even though they did and despite how weird it was Machi also developed a crush on Tetsuo, but luckily this was just one of those high school crushes that doesn't really go anywhere.The Artstyle was very familiar to SAO and it isn't a surprise since it was made by A-1 pictures whose characters do have a familiar feel to them, I liked the OP to this anime too it was catchy and nicely represented the girls in their demi-human area.This was a very fun anime to watch if you're into anime where the main character aren't technically human much like Monster Musume or Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maids then you can add this to the collection except it feels more mature and is much more informative compared to those two so I'd definitely consider this a fun watch. their kinds history as it takes well known myths like do Vampires hate Garlic, how

Unlike the other particularly similar anime to this one which is... well you already know the infamous title of it, this one was not centered around fan service. What drew me to watching this was my interest in mythical creatures and legends and this anime successfully executed and did not leave the premise to which the plot promises. The plot of this was well balanced and there were no unnecessary elements that would ruin this genre. I can hardly complain about anything that seemed wrong in this anime. So...if you like the genre of monster girls in the modern society, you won't be disappointed with this one!Story 10/10: Story was going well and it hints for a sequel. The plot was nice.Don't worry there was also a bit of PLOT in here too!Art 10/10: A-1 pictures certainly did not slack off much in this project of theirs. The Art style is indeed from A-1 pictures.Character 10/10: The main character isn't your particular teenage harem boy who gets really nervous during times and is only forced most of the time by his surroundings. What you get here is an adult with experience and doesn't f**k around. There are some cliche characters but what would be a story without those?Enjoyment 9/10: If you're tired of ecchi being forced on monster girls, then you will enjoy this. But it kinda feels different now that the ecchi element is lessened in this anime. Still... there are still some remnants of it no matter how faint.Overall 9/10: Indeed the anime was slow because because the character development here takes its time for sure. But since the episodes feel short there might sure be a sequel. This anime won't be a waste of time so you should try it! if you like the genre of monster girls in the modern society, you won't be disappointed with this one!Story 10/10: Story was going well and it hints for a sequel.

There are some cliche characters but what would be a story without those?Enjoyment 9/10: If you're tired of ecchi being forced on monster girls, then you will enjoy this. But it kinda feels different now that the ecchi element is lessened in this anime. Still... there are still some remnants of it no matter how faint.Overall 9/10: Indeed the anime was slow because because the character development here takes its time for sure. But since the episodes feel short there might sure be a sequel. This anime won't be a waste of time so you should try it!"", ""This weekend if started watching this serie. And it took me only 2 days to complete it. And a person like me with a concetration problem. I enjoyed this serie alot.The story in short. A teacher is trying to research monsters who are living in this world. Just like normal humans. But he never seen one before. And one day at school he met 3 different monsters.

The art of one student is really great. How the flame is made is just awesome.Sound 8: Standard opening and ending music. Only the opening clip was really fun to watch.Character 9: Ok there are 5 main characters. 1 *cough* normal teacher. And 4 monsters calls themselve Demi. The teacher is just a awesome dude. Very friendly and shows alot of respect to the demi's. Then a vampire child. Great hyper personality and one of my favorites in this serie. The yeah...call it just a headless horseman girl.

Far more tasteful than similar shows in the same vein (Rosario + Vampire, Monster Misume). While there is a vampire it's not often that I see Dullachans/Headless Horsemen in anime's and that's a unique twist. The series seemed like a metaphor for understand and accepting people in society with disabilities and in that regard I think they knocked it out the park. A solid first season that I look forward to expansion on, not the normal style of anime I watch and still very enjoyable as I was able to get...through the season in a only a few days.  I watched the English dub on FUNimation and felt the voices all fit the characters well. through the season in a only a few days.

Good feels and heartwarming moments. And that's not a bad thing.Story - 7/10A good guy opens up to the different people and befriends them. Different as in physically different, as in not human. It's not completely original, but it did put a spin on the monster girl trope, especially after Monster Musume...ugh. The character interactions were genuine and everyone's beliefs were real. I felt the best part about Demi-chan wa Kataritai was the honesty and the reality of the students' situations. Specifics aside, people are often ostracised because they are different, and people automatically think they want to...be treated like everyone else.Art - 8/10Not super high quality, but good. Animations were generally smooth and the character design was cute. Especially in the last episode, at the pool, I liked the attention to detail, like the reflection of light bouncing off the surface of the pool hitting the walls. I guess the producers wanted to end on a high note, and they achieved just that.Sound - 8/10Same deal, not amazing, but good. The OP was alright, nothing much, but the ED reminded me of Nichijou's ED, soft and lullaby-like. I really enjoyed the ED. Sound effects were cute, nothing more that could be said, really.Character - 10/10Numbero uno, they stayed true to themselves throughout the anime, which is great. Secondly, I felt that Hikari, Machi, and Yuki all embraced their tropes,  which usually is a bad thing, but in this case, it worked as we experienced all their ups and downs. Hikari, the vampire, being the outgoing and cutesy girl who has no qualms about going toe-to-toe with anyone, Machi, the dullahan, being the intelligent one who reflects on herself, and Yuki, the snow woman (hence her name), being the shy reserved girl who rarely opens up to anyone. I liked how they all overcame their trope restraints and became friends with everyone. Satou-sensei I feel was just there for the humour, her obstacle wasn't dealt with as well as the others' were. At the end of the day, Hikari is still the cutest.Enjoyment - 10/10I was waiting every Saturday for the next episode to come out. I was drawn by the vulnerability of the characters and, not gonna lie, by the cuteness and good feels that the show brings out. It's a heartwarming anime, and I think everyone should watch it!Overall - 9/10I liked it, other reviewers seem to like it, so what's stopping you from watching it? be treated like everyone else.Art - 8/10Not super high quality, but good.

That isn\'t to say there\'s no fanservice, but it\'s even more tasteful with it\'s delivery and presentation than other A-1 Pictures such as Sword Art Online.The thing that made me completely fall in love with this series, though, is the portrayal of adults as...well...adults. In most other school-based anime, the teachers and parents will all be either cartoonishly strict and intolerant, or just as immature as the students around them. Rarely is there a teacher or parent who feels as real as they do in this series.For example, the parents of the Demi\'s aren\'t just your average couple. It\'s obvious from their first appearance (and their behaviors towards the characters) that they exist as their own people outside of the immediate story. In addition, they are genuinely concerned and thoughtful towards the ""conditions"" that their children were born with (more on that in a moment).The teachers also feel like genuine role models and guides for the children of the school. Even the Vice Principle who is played up as a sort of ""villain"" later on is shown immediately to have very real and very understandable reasons for his actions and choices, acting with the students\' best interest in mind and not because the series feels the need to have a villain.On top of all that, though, they decide to take an interesting approach on the whole ""Demi-human"" thing. Demis aren\'t just monsters born from other monsters. In this universe, being a Demi-human is a sort of genetic defect that people can be born with (For exaplme, Hikari is a Vampie, but her twin sister Himari is completely normal.) Not only does this add the extra question of ""Are they still human, really?"" but it also adds in the question of ""Do they WANT to be treated like a normal human?""With so many concepts to explore, you\'d think that they would fall flat on that. But no. They frequently go into great detail about the conditions the demis have, and how many superstitions surrounding their demi-human race may have come about as a result, but it never feels like a gigantic info dump. It\'s worked seamlessly into the demi\'s own development, or other character\'s  development in understanding and reaching out to the demis.There is so much more I could say about this, but I\'ll just say that it\'s a shame A-1 Pictures picked this up and not some other studio. The Art and Music are really the only detriments to this series, but even so, they aren\'t bad. I\'m just tired of the same A-1 Picture\'s face plastered everywhere on their works.

On top of that it just feels really nice to watch 23 minutes of friendly people learning their strengths & weaknesses, and to see the world adapting in order to make their lives a little easier.It’s pretty low impact TV.

The story revolves around their relationship and their struggles.Sometimes the idea of teacher-student love came in question making me slightly uncomortable.

I’m not really a fan of monster girl stuff just because it’s usually either ecchi or something I’m not interested in. One thing I’ve always been fascinated by with fictional races/species though, is when writers will really try to dig in and explore what makes them unique and different compared to your standard human. This series is basically that in a nutshell, while also having plenty of funny, cute, and heartwarming moments.--STORY--The story is a rather simple one, but it works very well. The show is primarily about Takahashi researching...demi humans by interviewing the girls, and counseling them about any problems they may have. There’s also a side plot of Sakie and Takahashi’s romance, and a decent amount of worldbuilding to explore more elements of the demi humans. The actual science behind the girls’ biology is fascinating and very creative. The writer clearly thought through even minor details, and it really changes your view on how the monster girls would be like if they were real. Also, I’m kinda glad there’s not too much of a focus on a discrimination angle if only because that’s been done to death, and I find exploring the girls’ unique nature as both a disability and unique condition more compelling.I don’t have much to say for the comedy. I’ve seen funnier series admittedly, but that’s only because the show sometimes sacrifices comedy for well written story and character development. Even then, there’s still plenty of moments that made me laugh hard. There’s a few lewd jokes that I feel fall into your usual anime malarki, but that’s more of a nitpick if anything.--CHARACTERS--Takahashi is a great model for a teacher/older male role model. There’s none of the usual anime shenanigans that you might have to deal with a teacher and teenage school girl. One of the girls naturally enough has a crush on him, but he handles it as any adult should in a mature manner. He’s caring, dependable, considerate, etc., while still having a nerdy/awkward side and sometimes making mistakes making him more human at the end of the day.The rest of the girls are well written, and have their own unique traits. They each have their own unique problems as well due to their demi human nature, and it’s a pleasure to see them overcome their problems and develop over time. Side cast is mostly whatever, but they work.--ART/ANIMATION--Character designs are quite nice, and certainly the girls form a clever balance between normal girls and still having their “monster traits”. There’s a lot of expressive faces, and animation ranges from good to just above average.--SOUND--Voice acting is great in this series, and adds a lot to the comedy. Everybody plays their characters very well, and Youko Hikasa in particular as Sakie did an amazing job. The OP and ED are nice, but the soundtrack in general is fairly forgettable.--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION--I very much enjoyed this series, and would recommend it if you’re looking for something a bit more creative and satisfying in the vast amount of comedy and SoL anime. Would love to see more series in the future that explore what makes some of these fictional races unique.

LolA feel-good anime, and I have enjoyed it more than I expected. I think the characters are the strongest point of this anime. Despite the differences in who they are, they still supplement one another by giving us charming and comedic feels.This isn't a romance type of anime, though I had hoped that there was more romantic development between the two teachers, Takahashi and Sakie.

The story centers around a biology teacher named ""Tetsuo Takahashi"" who have a keen interest for these demis and wants to study & understand them, while also helping these demis to overcome whatever troubles they have.What I found to be incredible about this show are the pacing and the visual direction. For an SoL show, pacing is always preferred to...be slow, as these shows tries to portray a mundane life in rather relaxing manner. But this Anime took a different approach and sped it up with it\'s fast paced transitions and cuts, while still maintaining the same energy as your regular SoL show. Calm yet Energetic. The characters were likeable and extremely charming. No character really felt out of place or unnecessary. Another thing I like about the show is how self aware it is. It keeps it\'s balance between fun & drama without overdoing it, but was a little underwhelming at some crucial moments. The social commentary about discrimination is kept subtle and not in some grandiose rebellion way that are often filled with characters throwing tantrums. And it treats it\'s characters as they are, and not some objects that needs to be flashed. What I mean here is that, it never mistreats it\'s characters, and perfectly flashes them out depending on the traits given to them. It rises interesting questions about the setting and gives a satisfying answer to each of these questions that often surprised me, for how well thought and simple they are. The character chemistry is something that\'s worth mentioning. Tetsuo gets along really well with the students, both normal humans & demis. He\'s a very simple middle aged man who understood what\'s his profession is and doesn\'t act all cool & arrogant. Hikari helps maintaining the cute & fun factor of the show with her vampire fang & silly attitude; Yuki & Machi has some interesting character study and Satou is probably the fan factor teacher because, well who doesn\'t love sexy teacher in a full covered tracksuit? The rest of the side cast does their job well, by not being forgettable. The backgrounds really good as well. Character animation is pretty smooth too.Though, I wish the series continued a bit longer and expanded it\'s scale cause while the ideas it introduced are very interesting, it would\'ve been even more interesting if explored on a much larger scale. The Anime confines itself to a high school setting so it didn\'t have much to explore outside that. Only 4 demis were explored, while that\'s a appreciable thing for a 1 cour Anime, it still could\'ve went a little longer.SummaryThis is a very unique SoL Anime with an interesting setting and lovable character chemistry. It\'s different from the all the other SoL shows I\'ve watched and I highly recommend it if you want an SoL that isn\'t slow. be slow, as these shows tries to portray a mundane life in rather relaxing manner. But this Anime took a different approach and sped it up with it\'s fast paced transitions and cuts, while still maintaining the same energy as your regular SoL show. Calm yet Energetic. The characters were likeable and extremely charming. No character really felt out of place or unnecessary. Another thing I like about the show is how self aware it is. It keeps it\'s balance between fun & drama without overdoing it, but was a little underwhelming at some crucial moments. The social commentary about discrimination is kept subtle and not in some grandiose rebellion way that are often filled with characters throwing tantrums. And it treats it\'s characters as they are, and not some objects that needs to be flashed. What I mean here is that, it never mistreats it\'s characters, and perfectly flashes them out depending on the traits given to them. It rises interesting questions about the setting and gives a satisfying answer to each of these questions that often surprised me, for how well thought and simple they are. The character chemistry is something that\'s worth mentioning. Tetsuo gets along really well with the students, both normal humans & demis. He\'s a very simple middle aged man who understood what\'s his profession is and doesn\'t act all cool & arrogant.

However, we also cannot ignore someone's ‘Demi’ nature, because they face obstacles that we never...imagined. You cannot look at everything from one side, it has to be both, if you see only the ‘Demi’ nature, you will lose the individuality, and if you only see the human nature, you will not understand the difficulties that they go through all days. Both are precious, the important thing is the balance between the two.”Interviews with Monster Girls, takes place in a universe where there are people with special characteristics that we only hear about in fairy tales, the so-called Demi-Humans, or simply “Demis”, and how slowly their being accepted into society and even if the focus isn't to bring a deep discussion to such a delicate subject, it manages to explore it in a subtle and impressive way, especially when it shows in greater depth how each of the characters sees their ‘Demi’ side:Sakie Satou, who is a Succubus, so with a simple touch she can cause excitement and desire in the opposite sex, requiring her to dress in countless layers of clothing to avoid causing a big commotion;Hikari Takanashi, who is a vampire, where she can get in contact with the Sun and even eat garlic, but she is much more sensitive to heat and hot days than anyone else;Kyouko Machi, who is a Dullahan, so her head was born disconnected from the rest of her body, needing to carry with her arms everywhere;And Yuki Kusakabe, who is a snow woman, where her body temperature is so low that in times of stress she can exhale a lot cooler air and even cry frozen tears;The way that each of the girls reacts with their own peculiarities, especially how the people around them try to live with them, is something very human and real, some try to treat them normally, others want to be polite and don't want to offend them, and even gossip and bullying are present for them to overcome.Perhaps it is indeed a complicated subject, or perhaps it is simpler than we imagine, perhaps this issue will be resolved in the coming years, or perhaps it will continue to live until the end of our existence...there will still be many doubts and questions, however, instead of isolating ourselves and not talking about it, how about we get together and try to find a solution together?[PT-BR]Preconceito, segregação social, discriminação...essas terríveis palavras sempre fizeram parte do nosso vocabulário desde os primórdios da humanidade, mas como elaborar um assunto tão delicado?Recentemente eu estava assistindo Demi-chan wa Kataritai, ou Interviews with Monster Girls, obra de Petosu ペトス e produzida pelos estúdios A1-Pictures, e acabei dando de cara com uma fala tão poderosa que me pegou completamente de surpresa, que foi a seguinte:“Não é como você nasceu que faz quem você é, mas como decide viver com o que você é.

I don't care too much about giving numerical rankings for each aspect of the show, but it did one thing very well that changed my perspective of the show, and that's what I want to share.I saw a cute clip of this anime on youtube and out of boredom and curiosity I began binge-watching the show this morning, and the initial premise itself put me on edge. The world of Demi-chan wa Kataritai and how Demi's live within it almost put me off of the show entirely, being scarily close to many poorly-executed 'fantasy racism for white people...to understand' kinda media, but it ended up going a different direction entirely, instead almost becoming a metaphor for disabilities instead of discrimination. The show quickly became about making school life for Demi's more accessible and comfortable as the main cast learned what kinds of struggles they face and how to work around them. The show even goes as far as respectfully showing how being tactlessly well-meaning can become overbearing or uncomfortable, but in an understated way, all the while emphasizing the genuine kindness and concern the characters have for each other. Cute and wholesome story aside, the care with which this show handles discussions around accessibility has earned my respect, and imo is worth a watch. to understand' kinda media, but it ended up going a different direction entirely, instead almost becoming a metaphor for disabilities instead of discrimination.

It\'s a shame that this show only has 12 episodes as I feel like a lot more progression can be made. Very good show that shows ""demi-humans"" in a new light. While it does feel bland in terms of events, a lot of character development happens. Would have enjoyed the show more if there were more concrete events that happened, rather than just pure slice of life.While it\'s hard to give a lot of objective reasons on why this show was good, it was just such a lighthearted and enjoyable show to watch.

It’s a laid-back thought experiment, which imagines folkloric beings like vampires and dullahans as everyday humans with rare physiology. Rather than milk its female cast for episodic titillation, it world-builds from its junky premise, imagining the lifestyle and social reality of, and history of prejudice against, those living with subtly or radically different physical circumstances.I have a certain respect for pulp stories that extrapolate to wherever their concepts may lead. Like sci-fi dramas with aliens that are simply lazy stand-ins for other races, ""Demi-chan"" could’ve been a purpose-built metaphor...for disability and prejudice and left it at that.Instead, it goes beyond and spends part of an episode speculating how the Dullahan\'s head virtually connects to its body. Is the neck a miniature wormhole? The rare dullahan ponders a career in research. Another episode covers how the Japanese legal system deals with succubi, those with a supernatural aphrodisiacal aura, who are ensnared in sexual assault cases. The solution is flawed yet believably human.Though much of its drama is ultimately metaphorical, it doesn’t feel forced to that end. The succubus character has a complex over her supernatural allure; can she ever have a real relationship? Perhaps her dilemma isn’t that different from someone who’s conventionally attractive, points out a colleague.""Demi-chan"" still exists within the parameters of seinen manga pulp. It chronicles the lives of cute anime schoolgirls surrounding a ripped male teacher who hasn’t the sharpest sense of professional ethics. It’s also not terribly exciting to watch.

The most extreme girls here is a dullahan. You can occasionally forget the others are even monsters. The succubus is hands down the best character as she actually has multiple dimensions.

The high points are solid and emotionally resonant, but there are a few episodes that feel completely meandering and are mostly un-entertaining. It shines the most when there's genuine moments between the main cast, and I suppose making it constant cheapens it, but there's better ways to fill out the slower moments than they have here. The concept of demi-humans being integrated into society is a neat one, and it lends itself well to helping form the bonds between the characters, but there are times where it doesn't really feel like this concept is as...expanded upon as it could be.Art - 7It serves its purpose and does it well. There are a few moments where it shines, but I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about, although considering the type of series it is I wouldn't expect much more. Consistent, clean, and never really falls below the point of being what it needs to be.Sound - 7Nothing exceptional here either, although that may just mean they've done their job far better than I could understand. Nothing stood out as particularly inventive or really specific attention to detail, once again, serves its purpose and not a whole lot more (so far as I know).Character - 9Definitely far and above the highest praise I can give this series. The characters themselves aren't necessarily deep or complex, or incredibly original even, but it's their relationships with each other and the genuineness to it all that really sells it. It'd be difficult for me to see somebody not finding at least one moment that they find heart warming and sweet. Definitely the best part of this series.Enjoyment - 7...However, I don't think those high moments quite make up for some of the other factors involved. It is, of course, a slower series just by the nature of what it is. However, I still found there were more than a few moments of things just dawdling and not being very entertaining, whether it was the comedy just kind of falling flat, or the characters just not doing anything particularly interesting. I enjoyed the relationships and genuine bonds, but when it came to characters as individuals, they didn't stand much on their own. It really came down to how enjoyable their interactions with each other were. The comedy does hit well a good portion of the time, but there's certainly quite a few times where it falls flat and isn't executed well, at least for me personally. The animation was nothing special, but it was serviceable as noted above.Overall - 7Despite its flaws, I certainly wouldn't say this was un-enjoyable. Was it a must watch, or something to show to friends to get them into the genre? No, I don't really think so. But if you're looking for something heart warming, or are already a fan of the genre, I certainly don't think you'd be wasting your time here.

Im here to provide reasons why i liked or disliked something, not to mark it as bad or good.=- The review -=Demi-chan gives you something that very few games/anime/books/etc do. A look behind the scenes.I mean, we\'re all quite used to seeing monster girls, aliens, robots etc. Anyone reading this review probably has seen or read at least one story about someone ""special"" (werewolf, demigod, robot, etc) living a normal life. But while these stories are entertaining, they usually focus on same aspects - can X love Y? Can X look past Y being different? Can X find happiness? etc.Demi-chan lets you look at stuff that is generally hidden out of view. Have you ever wondered what the daily life of a vampire is like? Or maybe you wnated to know how someone without a head takes a bath? Can succubus lead a normal life?That is what this anime accomplishes. It presents a varied and utterly adorable lineup of characters, who are each special in their own way, and then proceeds to tell you exactly how they are special, and what their lives are like. It is a kind, lighthearted show with plenty of comedy and an occasional heartstring tug, but its the idea of being able to see into someone special\'s actual life, instead of what we see ""out in front"" that makes this so damn interesting.Do not go into this for some elaborate story, deep drama or mind games. Go in for some laughs, ""Oh, so that\'s how""s and an adorable vampire. that some people don\'t. Im here to provide reasons why i liked or disliked something, not to mark it as bad or good.=- The review -=Demi-chan gives you something that very few games/anime/books/etc do. A look behind the scenes.I mean, we\'re all quite used to seeing monster girls, aliens, robots etc. Anyone reading this review probably has seen or read at least one story about someone ""special"" (werewolf, demigod, robot, etc) living a normal life. But while these stories are entertaining, they usually focus on same aspects - can X love Y? Can X look past Y being different? Can X find happiness? etc.Demi-chan lets you look at stuff that is generally hidden out of view. Have you ever wondered what the daily life of a vampire is like? Or maybe you wnated to know how someone without a head takes a bath? Can succubus lead a normal life?That is what this anime accomplishes.

""Interviews with Monster Girls"" proves that, shockingly, yes it can.This show opts for a cute and wholesome mentor/student story (WITHOUT predatory and gross """"""romance""""""), much to its benefit. Though the girls do pine for him as young teens sometimes tend to do, Mr. Takahashi (the central male character) acts as a mature and wholesome adult, dealing with these young girls in a professional, supportive, and at times fatherly manner.

Anime often tries to ride the line between ""okay-ish"" and completely uncouth. If it\'s done well, I usually don\'t have an issue; for instance, The Ancient Magus Bride is one of my favorite shows. However, this was just uncomfortable. Hikari, our ""vampire"" student has a blatant crush on her biology teacher, and in episode 3, kisses him on the cheek. Like, this would never happen? I love the concept of myths coming to life and being around in modern-era countries, but this isn\'t a realistic scenario in a real...school in my opinion, so it feels very forced. Especially when the teacher doesn\'t even react. He doesn\'t tell her no, he doesn\'t blush. He just turns back to his computer to do work. It\'s a really strange scene. This show doesn\'t seem to have a huge fan-base, so I feel like I\'m sort of just yelling into the void, but this show is sub-par at best. The music is bland, and the only part of the show I find consistent is the outdoor backgrounds in shots. This show is a shitty harem attempt and it\'s using an interesting idea to try to cover it up. It\'s a bit of a bummer.I\'m giving this a general 4 (Bad), and won\'t be finishing it, sadly.

Here are my thoughts:This is literally just a typical school SoL show but with a (mostly inconsequential) monstergirl gimmick. That\'s it. The show doesn\'t excel at much, and it\'s not particularly unique or creative. It is watchable though, marginally.Aside from the novelty of ""demi-humans,"" the characters are pretty bland as a whole. Although, the vampire girl is a good character; she has a playful personality. I enjoyed her presence in the show. However, the rest of the cast is fairly bland. I would say that characterization is one...of the weaker aspects of this show, particularly because it is a dialogue-heavy SoL that features interviews of the main characters.This anime has a significant \'romance\' component, moreso than I expected prior to watching. It\'s a shallow kind of romance though. Truthfully, the show probably deserves a harem genre tag. I guess this isn\'t surprising considering it\'s a SoL with a male main character and nearly all-female supporting cast. Most of the story revolves around the main teacher character helping the demi-humans with their personal problems, and in the process learning about their biological characteristics. This story sounds interesting in concept, but in reality the final product is boring and surprisingly generic.The animation quality is mediocre but sometimes the cinematography is noteworthy. During some moments (not consistently) the character animation is above average. The image frame moves along with actual character movement, which can enhance the sparse moments of fluid animation. A decent job is done for facial expressions as well. The art style of the anime is quite generic and lacking in visual detail. The character designs are similarly generic.The voice acting is unremarkable, aside from the vampire girl who does a great job. The OST is also unremarkable.My overall rating: 4/10This is just a typical highschool SoL show, but with a demi-human \'schtick\' added. As a whole, it feels surprisingly uncreative for the premise. It is mostly boring and generic, and it doesn\'t excel at anything in particular. It was just barely entertaining enough for me to watch to completion.I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to anybody. of the weaker aspects of this show, particularly because it is a dialogue-heavy SoL that features interviews of the main characters.This anime has a significant \'romance\' component, moreso than I expected prior to watching.

Cu\'z the last time I\'ve check, they don\'t eat, drink, feel or breathe, since they\'re walking dead.

Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28121/Dungeon_ni_Deai_wo_Motomeru_no_wa_Machigatteiru_Darou_ka,"['There are times you get a reminder that no matter how many swords, boobs and magic you throw at a show it can’t save it from the boring characters among it all. Welcome to the world of Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, where strong personalities are obviously illegal and main characters are inexplicably attractive to women. A 13-episode fantasy story put to screen by J.C. Staff and based on a light novel, ‘DanMachi’ can at times be an enjoyable experience if you shut your brain off. Action is served up in droves but in an equal share comes a bland...cast and a setting that doesn’t exactly shout out originality.StoryWe follow the journey of Bell Cranel. Bell is an ‘adventurer’, one who goes forth to the dungeon to seek fame and glory while putting their life on the line to do so. There he encounters the talented and renowned ‘Sword Princess’ Aiz Wallenstein. Suddenly he’s love struck. With the help of his goddess Hestia, Bell sets out to conquer not only beasts but also his fear of approaching the girl of his dreams.I’ll put my positive first: This is that show that doesn’t dwell on things for too long. Bell makes progression at a ridiculous rate but at least events keep coming and every episode feels fresh in some way. Different enemies provide a new challenge. Some of these enemies remind Bell of when he was weaker and it brings some painful memories. He has to overcome these grim reminders and apply the new knowledge he’s learned to beat his enemies. Some also force him to change up his technique and get creative. For all its terrible harem schlock this is at least a nicely paced adventure.Some of the later episodes had some more interesting fights with more than just some crystals on the line. The cast also expands a little at that point, definitely to the show’s benefit. At that point it really starts to feel like we are watching something interesting come together. There’s also this sense that Bell is really fighting for something he wants and not simply hacking at things for no reason. That’s where the praise ends in this department.Here’s the problem: Bell doesn’t truly earn anything in his line of adventuring. Everything that helps him become stronger is either served to him on a silver platter or overcome through some ridiculous newfound level of power. Through certain attributes Bell is rendered pretty much unbeatable and given an unfair boost of all other adventures. With that you say goodbye to almost all the tension this show creates within the dungeon. If something does hold Bell back it takes no time for him to find a way around it. Some methods he uses to do so are out of left field and not properly explained. When an explanation for them does arrive – very much out of the blue – it comes at a ridiculous moment. While it does excuse a lot of Bell’s powerful capabilities, it’s a double-edged sword. The plot armour simply stacks higher on him.An early scene posits Bell as the runty adventurer who can’t achieve anything and you get the sense that this could be a tough rise through the ranks. But before you know it he’s making a name for himself in the field quicker than you know it. Why? Because of the power of love, which as we all know is far stronger than any physical material. How touching. Why couldn’t his romance simply be a driving force instead of something that literally has the capability to bolster his stats?CharactersWhile the story has redeemable moments, and is actually decently written, the characters reduce this show to a mess on many occasions. Let’s start with our main man. Bell is just another run-of-the-mill anime MC. He’s just… there. There’s no background to his character to at least give us an idea of why he wants to take up adventuring in the first place. He’s an example of the ‘play it safe’ approach to characters. By stripping him of any hard-hitting character faults he gains likeability but at the same time becomes a lot less interesting.Then there’s the pint-sized goddess Hestia who has a bust size and a temperament trying to outdo each other in volume. As annoying as her character can be at least her affection for Bell, compared to the rest of the female cast, actually makes sense. Bell is her only familia member so it’s understandable that she’s going to be a little clingy. The writers play up this fact though to the point that it starts degrading her character. Hestia goes from someone looking for validation and purpose to being a paranoid stalker. A very, very annoying paranoid stalker. Top that off with an abundance of ridiculous fanservice involving her and it’s a great way for me to stop taking a character’s problems seriously. At times we get a peek into seeing a different side of her but it remains hidden in the shadows, presumably for that inevitable second season some time down the track.It would also have been nice if the girl Bell desires so badly, Aiz, actually had some semblance of personality that makes her a worthy target of his affection. I guess she’s a blonde, green-eyed beauty in questionably-designed armour who can swing a sword well. Sure she’s got it on the looks front but the show never once makes me feel like she’s worthwhile being the end goal of our main character – even taking into account the fact she’s helped him out before in some tough situations. In defence of Aiz she at least isn’t going completely head over heels for our white-haired friend. But in the face of that, she still feels like a soulless background object.Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want a character study out of show about fighting beasts in dungeons and levelling up. You’d not be of sound mind to want that. I just want something entertaining with a cast I really want to cheer on. More personality and overall likeability could have been breathed into the group. My problems are only made worse by the fact that every piece of comedy missed the mark. Considering it makes up a large portion of the show you can imagine my frustration when some comedic intervals just dragged on and on.SummaryIf you value strong, interesting characters then this isn’t for you. If you value the creation of original ideas and environments then this isn’t for you. If watching a cardboard cut-out, danger-immune, overpowered main character whose presence makes every female he encounters flood the vicinity in juices of excitement while living with a four-foot god with a breast size that has the second half of the alphabet in its sights then this is for you.The more people keep dishing praise on shows like these, the less encouragement we give studios to adapt exciting and challenging material or create interesting original works. I guess what sells, sells. DanMachi isn’t remotely close to the worst shows I’ve watched but it brings absolutely nothing new to the anime table. There are less memorable moments in this series then there are words in its own title.I’ll be nice enough to say that there were brief moments where I did sit enough and give it some attention. I can see why other people can enjoy it for longer periods than myself. There’s flashy fights and some nicely animated sequences that even got a cynical man like me to sit up and say ‘Yeah. That’s alright’. The story isn’t going to blow your socks off but it never drags. The action keeps coming and the show rarely sits down for a breather. However I feel like a lot of the purpose of the world is kept locked away from us, which got on my nerves. There’s characters pulling the strings from shadows but even as the show comes to a close we learn almost nothing new.I can stop hacking away at the show for a moment when it comes to the art department. With a J.C. Staff anime you know you’re at least going to get some well-polished art and decent animation. Fights have plenty of impact and punch thanks to a combination sound and debris.  You can really feel the weight behind every sword swing, fist flying and rock scattering. The fights are clearly the show’s strong point and the technical side of things have gone a long way to achieving that.Some may find entertainment in the fight choreography - a very fair point - but when a particular outcome always feels certain then I can’t put myself in that boat. There is virtually no interesting complications character-wise. There’s catering for every character trope imaginable. There’s fan service ready to leap out at you from every corner. For everything that DanMachi does right it seems to do two other things wrong.Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon?

Who am I to argue with such a flawless summation? There is no question about what Danmachi is; it’s an otaku-pandering, self-insertion, video-game-inspired LN adaptation. The real question lies in whether you will love it for what it is, or hate it for what it is. In case you haven’t guessed it by now, I fall into the latter category. This shallow, ridiculous, and remarkably unoriginal work is a good example...of everything wrong with anime today.Synopsis: Bell Cranel is an adventurer; someone who explores dangerous dungeons and fights monsters for a living. He and his “goddess”, which is basically a glorified manager, Hestia, make up the smallest “familia” in all the land. This is the story of Bell winning every fight he’s ever been involved in one way or another, making every girl he comes into contact with fall in love with him despite his obvious lack of any charisma whatsoever, and gaining special abilities that nobody else can use for no discernable reason. In other words, it’s your standard LN adaptation.Danmachi’s plot is what you get when you take SAO’s plot and crank it up a notch on the pandering scale. MORE fanservice. MORE blood. LARGER harems. MORE white-knighting from the protagonist. DOUCHIER side characters to make the protagonist look good by comparison. And, of course, LESS actual substance. It’s seriously like someone looked at the already stupid LN video game formula and said “Hmmm, how do we make this even harder to take seriously?” But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start with the first reason Danmachi’s plot is bad: plot armor and melodrama. Much like a battle shounen, it is painfully obvious in any video game LN adaptation that the MC is never actually in any danger. However, the show spares no expense in convincing you that he is using the cheapest tactics possible. Last second saves? Check. Asspulled power ups? Check. Deus ex machina? Check-aruney. The entirety of the plot consists of Bell and the other main characters being put it perilous situations that even the most naïve of viewers can recognize will be resolved smoothly at the last second. Over and over and over again. It’s bad writing, it’s repetitive, and it’s not entertaining.It’s at this point in the review that I realize there were so many things wrong with the show that I don’t even know what to talk about next. This may be a bizarre order of doing things, but now let’s talk about Bell Cranel; the protagonist. Dear. God. What an annoying, insufferable, shallow, clichéd, gary-stu, self-insert, AWFUL character. When you talk about characters who might as well be literally Gandhi, you can go ahead and put this saint at the top of the list. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING would ever cause this guy to do something wrong or immoral. People can betray him, steal from him, assault him, whatever; he just takes the abuse like a proverbial Jesus Christ and instantly forgives all wrongdoings. After all, they wouldn’t want to give off the impression that he is human or anything! Real people don’t have flaws or negative emotions, right? It’s SO much more interesting to have an idealized concept of all that is good in the world without an ounce of moral ambiguity so that otakus can fap to fantasies of the hundreds of sex objects that flock to his holy cock! Oh, and you better believe that he has special abilities that nobody else in the entire world has! It’s not enough that he’s the most righteous organism on planet Earth, but he also has a super special power that enables all of his skills to be as high as they possibly can AND enables him to level up faster than anyone else who has ever lived! Now, I want you to guess the explanation they give for why this makes sense; this is their GENIUS explanation for why Bell has this one-of-a-kind ability that makes him the most special person in all the land: BECAUSE HE’S IN LOVE. …OHHHHH! WELL THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE! FUCK. I mean... just… fuck. I won’t even question it. In conclusion, Bell sucks. Moving on.Unfortunately, the trend of shallow, awful characters continues with the rest of the cast. Let’s start by addressing the elephant in the room; Hestia. Fucking. Hestia. *Sigh… Just… why? I must be the ten-billionth person to ask this, but what the hell is the obsession with her? She is no different than any other 1 dimensional, big-boobed, harem-fodder nobody in a slutty outfit that allows us to instantly identify her as a sex-object, as if we wouldn’t have figured it out anyway. The absolute best description you can give about Hestia is that she functions as comic relief, and I don’t even think she’s very funny. That brings us to Lili, the other 1-dimmensional sex object who occupies the loli, furry, and tortured fetishes all at the same time. Impressive writers. Very impressive. Fetish writers around the world will have to come up with an answer to that. Maybe if she was also a robot-childhood-friend? Anyway, I’m not even going to mention the rest of the harem since they are completely one-dimensional and indistinguishable. Let’s also go over the nameless side-characters; I feel the need to bring attention to the fact that Bell is the ONLY adventurer in the entire world who is not a tremendous asshole. The “villain” adventurers have no depth at all, of course, but they are still made out as such blatantly awful people in order to FURTHER drive home the fact that Bell is Jesus. Not only is this lazy characterization, it’s also blatantly black-and-white morality, which makes the show require even less thought. This is one of the worst character casts since, well, Sword Art Online.Let’s also take a moment to discuss how incredibly creative the monsters in this show are. Danmachi brings us such breathtaking and original monster designs such as, a bunny. A wolf. A minotaur. Oh, and who could forget the floor boss, “literally a titan from Attack on Titan”? Truly masterful creativity from these animators. It’s clear that a lot of work went into this show.This is the paragraph where I planned on talking about how misogynistic this show is and how distracting the constant fan service is, but do I really need to give you that whole spiel? I already briefly talked about this stuff, and I feel like it’s so obvious why these aspects of a show are flaws that I shouldn’t need to explain it. Women with the obedience and dedication of slaves and no complexity whatsoever? It’s every otaku’s dream! And that’s precisely why this show is going to make a ton of money.I could keep going. Really, I could. I could talk all day about what an awful betrayal of the basic fundamentals of writing this show is, but I think you get the idea. The reality is, a lot of people are going to like this show. A large percentage of anime fans are not at all bothered by anything I just mentioned, because for them, a self-insertion work is all they need. That’s fine and dandy for them, but from my point of view, this show and all shows like it are cancer. Danmachi is the antithesis of the clever and intelligent shows that made me become a fan of the medium in first place; it’s a brain-dead, effortless advertisement for the LN that ends incomplete. If you liked SAO or any other similar LN video game adaptation, you’ll love Danmachi. Everyone else? STAY. AWAY.

If you liked SAO or any other similar LN video game adaptation, you’ll love Danmachi. Everyone else? STAY. AWAY. Far, FAR away.', 'Danmachi is a textbook example of an anime that is truly a guilty pleasure in its own right. It doesn\'t have the most impressive writing, there are tons of clichés and fanservice, and the pacing is sometimes questionable but even so it never ever fails to be entertaining, which is something I can\'t say for most anime.Danmachi follows a popular trend in recent years of having a setting that takes place entirely within an MMORPG game world. The difference this time however is that... it actually doesn\'t. Instead, the story takes place in the characters\' real world, but their real world functions like a game....Adventurers gain experience points, earn loot, level up, gain skills and magic etcetera, but it all still takes place in their own actual reality. There is a magical dungeon which adventurers go to in search for treasure in order to make a living for themselves. They have to fight the local monsters found inside the dungeon in order to get the loot to drop, and in the process they level up, gain experience and become stronger. Pretty simple. It\'s a quite fresh take on what is otherwise a somewhat overused concept in recent years.The story begins when a young rookie adventurer named Bell Cranel one day gets his life saved by a female swordmaster within the dungeon. Her name is Ais Wallenstein, a quiet, airheaded yet very powerful woman whom Bell instantly falls in love with. He sets a goal for himself to become stronger so that he one day might be worthy to stand beside Ais as an equal. Upon doing this, he gains a unique ability which makes him gain experience points at an unbelievable rate as long as he stays true to those feelings of affection.Bell is an extremely shy and innocent boy, but also a very passionate one. What I like about him is that he actually feels like a real human being. He\'s not a typical self-insert imbalanced protagonist like Kirito (even if they do have the same voice actor), nor is he a generic shounen lead relying on nakama power. Rather he comes across as a very kind-hearted person who truly cares for those he\'s close to, and will do anything to help them in any way he can. He\'s someone you can genuinely relate to and cheer for during his struggles, and given the nature of Danmachi\'s dungeon crawling oriented storyline, that\'s a pretty important factor.The female lead on the other hand would be the poster girl of the 2015 anime fanart community, namely the illustrious goddess Hestia; perhaps the only character ever who somehow ended up more famous than the series  which she actually comes from. There are numerous reasons for her insane popularity outbreak. For one, she\'s an oppai loli, which is an incredibly rare sight in anime regardless of series, but she\'s also an incredibly energetic, fun and loveable genki girl who keeps breathing life into the show and makes it interesting for the viewer. She\'s madly in love with Bell, but she doesn\'t try to hide it any way whatsoever. She keeps dropping hints everywhere that she just wants him to push her down already, but of course Bell doesn\'t pick up on this very well… because you know, protagonists in anime don\'t do that for whatever reason. Lastly of course there\'s the unmistakable outfit and boob string she wears which took the internet by storm so hard it became an actual fashion trend in real life Japan, but I\'m sure you know all about that by now. Anyway, as a goddess Hestia is the leader of a ""Familia"" which operates more or less like a Guild in your typical RPG, where Bell is the only other member, and thus they spend their lives together in a rundown church, barely scraping by with what little money they can earn. Watching the pair of them living their unorthodox lives together never fails to make me smile.Then there\'s half a dozen other girls as well, either side characters or main characters introduced later on in the story who also conveniently enough end up falling in love with Bell (shocking, I know) so Danmachi is definitely a harem in the end even if MAL might not have it tagged as one. That being said it doesn\'t really focus on the harem elements all that much; it\'s mostly a secondary factor. The main attention is pretty much always on the adventuring aspect itself.The plot progression of Danmachi is fairly straightforward. It basically follows Bell\'s struggles as well as how his relationships progress with the other adventurers he ends up encountering during them. You can probably imagine what a shounen adventure anime about RPG dungeon crawling is like, and that image is probably dead on as far as Danmachi is concerned. What I really like about it though is how it manages to present the dungeon as an environment. It actually feels threatening and ominous the deeper you get inside it. Have you ever ended up in a zone that is way too difficult for your character\'s current level when playing an RPG, and you can\'t manage to find a way to get back out alive? I mean in the kind of game where you only have one life, or at least you really can\'t afford to die? That\'s kind of the same feeling as Danmachi manages to give off to the viewer. As a result, the harder fights in the story feel awfully tense and relatable to any somewhat experienced gamer watching it.Adaptation-wise, Danmachi is honestly pretty rushed as it spans a whole 5 light novel volumes in just 13 episodes. Yet despite that I never really felt like it was too much of a problem. Somehow, someway even from an anime-only standpoint the plot feels perfectly coherent and understandable. In fact as far as enjoyment value goes I\'d even say I liked the anime *more* than the novels, because a) the fight scenes come across better animated, and b) Hestia\'s character is *way* more likeable in the anime. Yes, there is a lot of content from the novels that is skipped, but it feels like it didn\'t hurt the overall story very much to leave it out either, so it works out anyway. The only thing the anime occasionally lacks is some proper explanations of certain skills\' and items\' functionalities, but other than that I don\'t have a whole lot to complain about.All-in-all, Danmachi is far from a masterpiece, yet given the premise I think it delivers a lot more than most people probably expected coming into it. The story has most definitely been done before, but Danmachi adds its own twist to it and more importantly it does it *well*. It goes to show that with proper execution, a time-tested concept is still perfectly viable, and as a result it provides an anime that always leaves you with a smile on your face. Call it generic or shallow or whatever, but that doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s easily one of the most entertaining anime of the year thus far.

The Misadventures of Breastiaa.k.a. My Breastia Can\'t Be This Cutea.k.a. Not SAOis the latest anime to follow the video game trend that\'s become increasingly popular within the anime medium. These video game type series, usually MMORPG based, have gotten so commonplace in the last handful of years that they\'re starting to form their own sub-genre altogether, in a similar fashion to the ""moe/cute girls doing cute things"" craze in the mid-2000s. With an easy premise to understand, little to nothing to...comprehend story-wise, and a ""turn your brain off"" level of entertainment value, DanMachi was tailor-made for mainstream success. But whatever integrity it may have had was lost somewhere in the creases of blue boob ribbons. If Maslow\'s Pyramid were ever accommodated to show the level of quality a title holds, DanMachi would presumably fall somewhere in the lower segments. This isn\'t to say that the show doesn\'t retain some sort of value, but in the bigger scheme of things, it\'s as significant as the crusty end slice of a loaf of bread.Brief synopsis: Set in a world that functions and operates like an MMORPG, we follow Bell Cranel, residential pussy protagonist and one in many self-proclaimed ""adventurers"" that strive to become the best of the best. These adventurers are aided by Gods/Goddesses who descended from the heavens to live among them. With one God/Goddess being the leader, many adventurers join them to form a guild (or for modern day standards, they\'re essentially a gang). After a chance encounter with another adventurer named Aiz ""no personality"" Wallenstein, or better known the world over as the ""Sword Princess,"" our protagonist is motivated to become a better adventurer, if only for a chance to woo her over in the future. With the aid of his Goddess Loli Big Boo— Hestia, he sets off on his journey to do just that.Despite what the paint-by-numbers premise would have you believe, DanMachi doesn\'t seem to understand the construct of its own narrative. Beyond just meeting regulatory standards, the actual story and content itself never quite mesh. It tries to tell a coming-of-age tale, but our protagonist is never shown going through any of the proper stages of character progression usually associated with this kind of narrative. Instead of seeing him make mistakes to later learn from them, all of his conflicts are overcome by the writers splooging out dues ex machinas at every given turn. His advancements aren\'t earned through hard work and determination but are simply handed to him on a silver platter, making him yet another ""chosen one"" figurehead who\'s nuts haven\'t dropped, yet finds himself winning every battle like he\'s the spawn of Guts and Chuck Norris.Why rally for a protagonist if the outcome is always the same? Why portray him as a struggling newbie when he\'s merely going to gain powerful abilities and weaponry without any foreshadowing towards it? The show quite literally writes in a new power-up every other episode (no I\'m not kidding, see spoiler section below), so by the time we\'re at the halfway point, he\'s practically outpaced most of the seasoned adventurers set in the same world. This could have been done in a more believable fashion had they given any of sort of proper explanation behind these events, but DanMachi makes no attempts to do so. It shrugs off all accountability and goes back to dangling boob strings like a set of shiny car keys to keep the audiences distracted from the underhanded ploy taking place.What the show does have going for it, however, is the setting itself.The world of DanMachi doesn\'t waste time debuting its features, with a medieval/high fantasy inspired architecture, it creates an interesting subculture, being anachronistic in its implementation, yet obtuse concept-wise since gaming mechanics are treated as much of a central pillar as its Middle Ages inspiration. Since the game aspects are as much of a part of real life to the inhabitants of DanMachi\'s universe, it\'s quite easy to buy into the world from the get-go. There\'s a weird amalgamation of game physics and natural world properties that the show fully embraces; it\'s grounded in our universe but slightly left-of-center given that game stats and leveling up is treated with the same sense of normalcy that gravity is. This includes adventurers that have to kill monsters to generate income and possibly to keep regular civilians safe. When they defeat these monsters, gems are left behind from their carcass (similar to most MMORPGs). And while the world mechanics and how things function were never explained to any reasonable amount of detail, the implied base knowledge that most viewers would have going in as to how these games work made it feel suitable despite its tendency to underwrite the parameters of its fantasy elements.Does the prospect of killing monsters and taking gems out their hides for a line of profession make sense? Well no, of course not. But was it fun? Yea, it sure was. For an anime that borrows its world functions from video games, DanMachi accomplishes what it had set out to do. It didn\'t place any further foresight as to how the macroeconomics of its world operates but that\'s fine since no one was expecting it to do so in the first place.What I was expecting, however, was better pacing, to be more specific, pacing that wasn\'t the equivalency of the show trying to belch out the alphabet in one breath. After the introductory episodes (1-3) in which the show maintained a steady pace, it then began to rush through plot points and character introductions at breakneck speeds. Where we were initially given a few episodes to establish the person\'s backstory, personality, and motivation, the show later attempts the same kind of effort in just one episode. It\'s as if the show had plans for 2-Cours and was later informed by the studio heads that they canceled plans for the 2nd season, and in a state of panic, the creators condensed everything in its screenplay into whatever schedueled episodes they had left. It\'s jarring, to say the least, doubly so when plot points are whizzing by without any proper setup or payoff. Shit sorta just... happens.But what did have staying power was a pair of underage sweater puppies. The kind of visual eye-candy that\'s predestined to overshadow the rest of the characters involved.The characters of DanMachi is of your garden variety, with many having indistinguishable personality traits from other shows. Our protagonist, Bell Cranel, is your typical dense bishounen beta-male who always strive to do the right thing. The kind of boy scout character that you just want to strangle repeatedly for his unrealistic amount of idealism. And like most protagonists of this ilk, he too has the uncanny ability to attract every female character in the series for no real reason whatsoever. But he isn\'t the one that the show would be remembered for, that honor lies with Hestia.In the same way that Yuno Gasai is more popular than the show she\'s a part of, so too is DanMachi\'s mascot, Hestia. Infamous for her boob ribbon, Breastia has become the subject matter of many fan arts, sending manchildren the world over clambering for their body pillows. With a bubbly personality and an extreme infatuation for our pussy protagonist, she\'s ideal power fantasy material for anyone that chooses to self-insert themselves into the show. The only ""depth"" found here is in the endless cleavage birthed from her unnaturally huge milk jugs. A character who\'s only purpose is to serve as someone\'s 2D desktop waifu.

There are moments where the show boasts decently-choreographed action scenes that get you pumped up, only to be followed up by jarring CGI monsters and choppy animation. This lack of consistency can be contributed to J.C.Staff\'s workload, as they were also adapting Shokugeki no Soma during the same period they worked on DanMachi, which could have resulted in an improper allocation of manpower. The art, for the most part, was appealing, with suitable color choices that made the landscapes and characters pop. The peppy tone in which the characters moved and carefree disposition in how its world was colored to life helped compensate where other departments failed.As far as the soundtrack was concerned, there isn\'t much to say. The opening theme is your standard j-pop track, far from distinctive when placed in a crowd, and could easily be replaced without making so much of a difference. And like most medieval fantasy shows before it, this too has a very standard soundtrack, using all the bells and whistles you\'d expect from something trying to portray that period. That basic Celtic music in pub/Inn settings and those usual orchestral choir sections during fight scenes. It\'s all very standard. And that\'s basically DanMachi in a nutshell, a show trying to portray things it can\'t fully grasp and coming off middling because of it.****SPOILER SECTION******Because of the erratic pacing and contrived plotting, every other episode of Danmachi has the main character receiving a power-up of some sort. 1st we find out that he has ""unlimited potential,"" in other words, he\'s a borderline overpowered beta-male. And then, only two episodes later, he\'s handed another powerful weapon that he never earns. By the 5th episode, he gets a book that conveniently teaches him fire magic. And if that wasn\'t enough, he gets an ability to KO any opponent as a last ditch final attack only a few episodes after. And this trend of gaining a new advantage never stops either, happening all the way up to the very finale of the show, robbing the purpose behind even creating a coming-of-age story. The show actively fights against the idea of earned rewards. And to put the icing on the shit cake, we find out he\'s a Demigod as well, as if being plot armored and overpowered wasn\'t enough of a buffer.And then there were introductions to people that amount to nothing at all.For example, characters like Welf Crozzo was given a backstory, motivation and character introduction within one episode just to serve the role of a plot device. A character whose entire purpose in the narrative is to be Bell\'s blacksmith, yet is marketed as a defining side character despite the rushed-job given to indoctrinate him into the group. This isn\'t just an isolated incident either, as every character introduced after the third episode mark is simply pushed off an assembly line with no time given to even let the ""archetype"" that is their paint to dry.So at the end of the day, you\'re not watching this because it has something to offer, you\'re watching it because there\'s nothing else to do.****END OF SPOILERS****Going into DanMachi, all I expected to get out of it was easy-to-consume entertainment, and that\'s precisely what I got. Because of its simplistic story and surface-level depiction, I never felt frustrated watching it since the show never gave me a reason to care, to begin with.With DanMachi, what you see is what you get. It\'s a show that isn\'t trying to be more than what it is and is honest about that. And while that\'s a commendable attribute, it just isn\'t enough to be anything more than just that. It\'s easygoing content that offers nothing else when it\'s all said and done. DanMachi is the intermission title you watch before watching your next ""must watch"" series. An anime that will forever be remembered for a pair of loli boobs than it will for anything else. comprehend story-wise, and a ""turn your brain off"" level of entertainment value, DanMachi was tailor-made for mainstream success. But whatever integrity it may have had was lost somewhere in the creases of blue boob ribbons. If Maslow\'s Pyramid were ever accommodated to show the level of quality a title holds, DanMachi would presumably fall somewhere in the lower segments. This isn\'t to say that the show doesn\'t retain some sort of value, but in the bigger scheme of things, it\'s as significant as the crusty end slice of a loaf of bread.Brief synopsis: Set in a world that functions and operates like an MMORPG, we follow Bell Cranel, residential pussy protagonist and one in many self-proclaimed ""adventurers"" that strive to become the best of the best. These adventurers are aided by Gods/Goddesses who descended from the heavens to live among them. With one God/Goddess being the leader, many adventurers join them to form a guild (or for modern day standards, they\'re essentially a gang). After a chance encounter with another adventurer named Aiz ""no personality"" Wallenstein, or better known the world over as the ""Sword Princess,"" our protagonist is motivated to become a better adventurer, if only for a chance to woo her over in the future. With the aid of his Goddess Loli Big Boo— Hestia, he sets off on his journey to do just that.Despite what the paint-by-numbers premise would have you believe, DanMachi doesn\'t seem to understand the construct of its own narrative. Beyond just meeting regulatory standards, the actual story and content itself never quite mesh. It tries to tell a coming-of-age tale, but our protagonist is never shown going through any of the proper stages of character progression usually associated with this kind of narrative. Instead of seeing him make mistakes to later learn from them, all of his conflicts are overcome by the writers splooging out dues ex machinas at every given turn. His advancements aren\'t earned through hard work and determination but are simply handed to him on a silver platter, making him yet another ""chosen one"" figurehead who\'s nuts haven\'t dropped, yet finds himself winning every battle like he\'s the spawn of Guts and Chuck Norris.Why rally for a protagonist if the outcome is always the same? Why portray him as a struggling newbie when he\'s merely going to gain powerful abilities and weaponry without any foreshadowing towards it? The show quite literally writes in a new power-up every other episode (no I\'m not kidding, see spoiler section below), so by the time we\'re at the halfway point, he\'s practically outpaced most of the seasoned adventurers set in the same world. This could have been done in a more believable fashion had they given any of sort of proper explanation behind these events, but DanMachi makes no attempts to do so. It shrugs off all accountability and goes back to dangling boob strings like a set of shiny car keys to keep the audiences distracted from the underhanded ploy taking place.What the show does have going for it, however, is the setting itself.The world of DanMachi doesn\'t waste time debuting its features, with a medieval/high fantasy inspired architecture, it creates an interesting subculture, being anachronistic in its implementation, yet obtuse concept-wise since gaming mechanics are treated as much of a central pillar as its Middle Ages inspiration. Since the game aspects are as much of a part of real life to the inhabitants of DanMachi\'s universe, it\'s quite easy to buy into the world from the get-go. There\'s a weird amalgamation of game physics and natural world properties that the show fully embraces; it\'s grounded in our universe but slightly left-of-center given that game stats and leveling up is treated with the same sense of normalcy that gravity is. This includes adventurers that have to kill monsters to generate income and possibly to keep regular civilians safe. When they defeat these monsters, gems are left behind from their carcass (similar to most MMORPGs). And while the world mechanics and how things function were never explained to any reasonable amount of detail, the implied base knowledge that most viewers would have going in as to how these games work made it feel suitable despite its tendency to underwrite the parameters of its fantasy elements.Does the prospect of killing monsters and taking gems out their hides for a line of profession make sense? Well no, of course not. But was it fun? Yea, it sure was. For an anime that borrows its world functions from video games, DanMachi accomplishes what it had set out to do. It didn\'t place any further foresight as to how the macroeconomics of its world operates but that\'s fine since no one was expecting it to do so in the first place.What I was expecting, however, was better pacing, to be more specific, pacing that wasn\'t the equivalency of the show trying to belch out the alphabet in one breath. After the introductory episodes (1-3) in which the show maintained a steady pace, it then began to rush through plot points and character introductions at breakneck speeds. Where we were initially given a few episodes to establish the person\'s backstory, personality, and motivation, the show later attempts the same kind of effort in just one episode. It\'s as if the show had plans for 2-Cours and was later informed by the studio heads that they canceled plans for the 2nd season, and in a state of panic, the creators condensed everything in its screenplay into whatever schedueled episodes they had left. It\'s jarring, to say the least, doubly so when plot points are whizzing by without any proper setup or payoff. Shit sorta just... happens.But what did have staying power was a pair of underage sweater puppies. The kind of visual eye-candy that\'s predestined to overshadow the rest of the characters involved.The characters of DanMachi is of your garden variety, with many having indistinguishable personality traits from other shows. Our protagonist, Bell Cranel, is your typical dense bishounen beta-male who always strive to do the right thing. The kind of boy scout character that you just want to strangle repeatedly for his unrealistic amount of idealism. And like most protagonists of this ilk, he too has the uncanny ability to attract every female character in the series for no real reason whatsoever. But he isn\'t the one that the show would be remembered for, that honor lies with Hestia.In the same way that Yuno Gasai is more popular than the show she\'s a part of, so too is DanMachi\'s mascot, Hestia. Infamous for her boob ribbon, Breastia has become the subject matter of many fan arts, sending manchildren the world over clambering for their body pillows. With a bubbly personality and an extreme infatuation for our pussy protagonist, she\'s ideal power fantasy material for anyone that chooses to self-insert themselves into the show. The only ""depth"" found here is in the endless cleavage birthed from her unnaturally huge milk jugs. A character who\'s only purpose is to serve as someone\'s 2D desktop waifu.

An anime that will forever be remembered for a pair of loli boobs than it will for anything else.', 'Danmachi is an anime made to be simple. First of all, you won\'t see anything complex here. I see it as one of the budget anime, where there\'s nothing special about it, but it sells. It feels like sao season 3, just with more fan service. The purpose that I\'ve found of Danmachi, is to serve as a passtime, and relaxation after you\'ve exhausted the list of must watch anime, or if you want something ""casual"".Right at the start, there is a narration, that quickly shows you a bit of how the world works. Later on, in the first episode you will of course find...out more.  What you will be finding out is, that that world is basically an RPG. It doesn\'t say anything about this being a game, but it simply works like that. People that aren\'t gamers probably won\'t understand most of the stats, leveling and item thingies. There are adventurers, that follow certain goddesess, which lost their divine power, just to have fun with mortals. The purpose is to conquer the Dungeon that is in the center of the world, and beat all the bosses. Doesn\'t sound like anything special, does it? Feels like you\'re watching someone else play an MMORPG, since everything is very easy-going.*Minor spoilers in this paragraphThe adventurer that we are following is Bell Cranel. He is a guy that is naive, wants to be a hero, good mannered. But he\'s STUPID. The first scene we meet him, is when he was being chased down, just to see him soon saved from the strongest adventurer there is, that is supposedly a female. After being saved, he falls in love with her, and his motive is, I MUST GET STRONGER JUST TO REACH HER. Later on I will talk more about her. Soon after we meet his goddess, that is Hestia. I can describe her very quickly. Loli, with boobs, and throughout the entire series, you will only see her going after Bell. This serves to stop Bell from ending up with anyone. Hilarity ensues, except i didn\'t find it that funny, because it\'s the most stupid love triangle. Instead of bell going for the one that is extremely caring for him, he chases the strongest female, that turns out to be an airhead which we will see later on. And because it is all like that, the dialog is extremely stupid, leading to nothing. If they\'re not talking about adventure, they\'re talking about how the sky is beautiful or something like that. Another stupid character he meets, his supporter, living in the guild with the most ridiculous motive (more wine!). She has a very inconsistent personality. At first she wants to scam Bell, for his items. She accidentally falls down, the weapon gets out, and miraculously, that happens in front of a good character related to Bell. Cheap trick just to get the supporter some forced character development. Bell soon gets it back, without him noticing anything, \'cause it\'s Bell! Soon after witnessing her betray him again before his very own eyes, and she tells him that she already betrayed him once before, Bell forgives her, risks his live to save her, and the harem increases. On the question why? He answers that he didn\'t know (but he does! The writer told him, that he will gain a new motive; protect thine friends!) Most of the characters are plot devices that lead to a boring story.Bell cranel has a Premium account, and he\'s the only one. He\'s the chosen one, and while the world seems very balanced, Bell with his unstable personality, manages to do great things, and beat monsters, that realistically speaking, if the world is based on stats, his weapons should just break. What\'s the point in stats and leveling, if it doesn\'t even show how powerful someone is. But he gets an ability, that makes it impossible to lose. Literally impossible, even though it is not instant. He\'s just beating everything through out his screams, that sound really good. He isn\'t a chicken Gary Stu like i describe him, he first falls, and than comes back, it isn\'t like he\'s god mode walking through everything. He also sees invisible people because he feels their eyes on him, perfect logic. Premium account, or hacker? You decide!The fights are very good, not anti-climatic, they also have very nice music, and sounds, and are also animated extremely well. There\'s even a lot of blood going, and you can feel really well how the monsters get sliced up. The music is really epic, but the opening is just, no. It feels like it is for some slice of life show. It should sound more adrenaline pumping and exciting not like this. The music is at it\'s peak in the fights as i mentioned. And this is one of the few anime where i really enjoy the fights. Even though they\'re just shit Bell has to go through. However, the art and character designs are not well done for 2015, but they aren\'t terrible.I didn\'t talk about all the characters, since most of them exist just to be there. Nothing to talk about them, since they don\'t do much for the plot. Even though it is all cliched, by my point of view, i usually don\'t like this stuff, and would rate this even lower. The only special thing about Danmachi is that it is not boring to watch; it\'s so easy-going with many flaws.  It\'s like so simple, that it is fun in the same time, it gives off some kind of a nice feeling. If it is nice why is it only 4? Because the characters, are mostly annoying, and the story is just shit Bell goes through, without him receiving any character development.I\'ve just stated in this Review mostly how I feel about it. It is of course possible for people to enjoy this. Since it is, like I mentioned, very simple. If it isn\'t objectively good, it doesn\'t mean it won\'t be fun. With being simple, and the way the pacing is easy-going, together with intense battles, there is no sin if you enjoy it. It doesn\'t try much to be what it isn\'t, and I didn\'t give 4 since it failed, rather because i didn\'t like it. Since i usually burn this kind of anime down and I didn\'t really hate it as much as I could, most people would still find much more enjoyment in Danmachi than me. out more.

It\'s also old and not how I would\'ve written it nowadays, but since it\'s ""helpful"" I\'m obligated to keep it but not obligated enough to watch this show again to refresh my knowledge and polish the review. So, you know, have fun but don\'t talk to me about it.]So, I’m gonna do my first review on something dangerous. Something with a lot of fans, and a lot of haters. One side will hate you regardless, unless you can squeeze yourself in the middle somehow.Sadly, no. No, I...cannot. You already know which side I’ve chosen. I did not like Danmachi, so much that I won’t even bother copy/pasting its (ridiculous) full name.Frankly, it’s nothing more than a cashgrab, one that doesn’t make me feel bad about all the anime torrents and unofficial websites that everyone outside of Japan uses. It’s the perfect money-maker. You have a modern, popular concept with a general, an average shounen protagonist, and some nice, juicy fanservice to make sure you don’t look away and so the merchandise sells. Oh, and we’ll throw in some blood as well. It worked for Attack on Titan, so we might as well.Danmachi does nothing to separate itself from anything. It’s simply a watered-down action/adventure anime meant to please those who ride on the most popular anime, for those who are easily amused. Like a Taylor Swift song. I’d try to tell you to not watch it, but who am I kidding. It’s already gonna have a fuckton of seasons, so it already won. GG Danmachi.Well, we’re already this far in, so let’s start talking about it.The story.Danmachi takes place in a fantasy city with its most notable feature being the dungeon: a tower that stretches so high that it disappears into the clouds. …Did I lose you there? Yes, the dungeon is a damn TOWER, no matter how many times it’s referred to as a dungeon, or how many times you actually see someone go DOWN in the dungeon. Either this tower is not actually the dungeon and is instead some random point in the setting that the camera likes to see, or nobody really knows what a dungeon is.Well, hey, the world itself seems to be pretty weird. I mean, the people here have actual stats and levels, like an RPG. Except this only seems to apply for combat in the dungeon, at least from what I heard. And generally, people that fight in the dungeon are only those who have received powers from a god. I’m assuming this is the only area of civilization in this series’ entire world, since actual gods and goddesses seem to put a huge focus on it, and they basically have their own currency and everything. Iiiiit’s a small world aaaafter all…And now, cue the main character, believe it! Kirito is a young man with the simple ambition of becoming stronger! He truly is an hero, because when the going gets tough, he always has a convenient way out! …Wait, what? Oh, sorry. I meant Bell. Not Kirito. Same rules apply, though. Bell, who even has Kirito’s voice actor, is your basic protagonist. He wants an adventure, he wants to be stronger, he’s heroic, he’s fighting for recognition, and he’ll never give up on it! Believe it!! Overall, this is just the start of Bell’s adventure into an underground sky tower, so a lot of results are just him getting something, from power-up to party member. In the most basic sense, it’s nothing special. In a more specific sense, it’s still nothing special.The rest can essentially be summed up as “shit happens”, which can be expected when there’s nothing really at stake in the plot. Bell and his partner Hestia seem to be just fine in their small house, but I guess it’s just not enough so LET’S GO KILL THINGS. Oh, and Bell wants senpai to notice him. Really, I just laugh that Bell works so hard to get attention from some emotionless girl who saved him a couple times, and then casts aside the girl who’s constantly supported him. Priorities.But along with Bell’s dumb, pointless motives are his abilities, his ways out. His growth in strength is LITERALLY determined by his emotions in battles. Basically “do it 4 da waifu”. There’s one fight towards the end where he fights someone that can turn invisible. Why this person isn’t like the strongest person in the show is beyond me, but anyway Bell ends up defeating him because he could “feel his eyes on him”. Okay, Bell. Sure. It’s not like this crap is uncalled for, though, because the plot itself has predictable outcomes. I mean, call me crazy, but I think the person that smirked darkly at the end of a scene MIGHT be up to no good. But first, a word from the main villain on what she’s about to do.But you know what really makes me displeased? The characters.Bell Cranel, the main character. A young man with the goal of becoming stronger, inspired by his dead family member! Truly riveting! 10/10 character! No, he’s just some typical, beginning adventurer who likes to play the hero. Nothing else. But what I actually hate is that this show tries SO HARD to get you to like him. In the pilot episode, there’s a scene where some asshole in a bar starts ranting about how utterly terrible Bell is, not knowing that Bell is like 10 feet away. This scene goes on for MINUTES, just blabbing about Bell being a scrublord tomato dork who will never have his dream girlfriend as his girlfriend. I can feel Danmachi’s cold, dead hands grabbing me by the shoulders yelling “FEEL BAD! LOVE HIM! LOVE HIIIIIIIIM!” as it shakes me violently. It not only wants you to feel bad, but makes you want to be him, as he tries to be the badass hero you dreamed about in your early childhood, only this time he has a fair supply of titties surrounding him. I think I’ve complained enough about him. Let’s move on to the other lead.Hestia. Oh my god. I heard about this character before I heard about the actual anime. I saw the dumb hestia.dance thing and that she was “hestia bestia” or some shit. I hate whoever is responsible for this. Hestia became unbearably annoying by the show’s end. She obviously loves and supports Bell, who lacks the brainpower to actually realize that, and she becomes clingy and gets mad whenever Bell’s around one of his many harem members. In context, this isn’t a recipe for disaster or anything, but it’s so overdone that it gets ridiculous. Hell, she’s ruined some scenes entirely, like one time where Bell and Aiz have a conversation by themselves, only to be interrupted by Hestia yelling at Bell, including some 5-10 minute long scream. It was the 592nd time that I’ve contemplated suicide. Really, I want to know what is so appealing about this character beyond the fanservice. She’s literal, walking fanservice, and even then you can find much better. I mean, come on.Liliruca: a furry with one of the most ridiculous and idiotic backstories I’ve ever heard. Her familia does everything for wine, basically. And as for herself, she couldn’t cut it as an adventurer, so she became a supporter instead. Despite the name, it’s apparently so useless that she was bullied for being one, despite being kept around. Basically, her backstory is that people are assholes to a facepalming degree, and she therefore takes it out on the first honest person she meets. What a nice girl.Aiz. There’s nothing to say about this character, really. She’s strong, Bell loves her, and that’s about it. She’s some quiet, passive person who doesn’t show any real personality. She herself seems to have the pointless goal of getting stronger for no reason, so at least they have something in common I guess.Anyone else doesn’t get enough screentime to be worth mentioning. And now I’ll throw in the flavor parts.The soundtrack is actually pretty decent. It didn’t exactly jump out at me, but there were times where it got my attention enough. The opening is absolutely garbage, though, I mean there are bad shows with great openings so I’m not biased, but it is seriously one of the most lackluster openings I’ve heard in a while. The ending theme isn’t very interesting either, but I’d be a liar if I said I actually cared about ED’s. Then you have the visuals, which are pretty solid. I’m not a master judge in this part, so all I can tell you is that it’s not bad.I think I’ve covered what I need to say. Danmachi is just not worth your time if you want to take something seriously. Even if you’re super casual and into the basics like Fairy Tail and Bleach, I still encourage you to shy away from this and expand your horizons. But who am I to say what you can’t like? I for one certainly did not this, though. The 2/10 I gave it may or may not be fair based on my comments, but most of all it’s given this score to note it as one of my least favorite anime, ever. Of course, I don’t flat-out expect you to agree, and if this was poorly written instead of being just disagreeable, there’s a helpful/unhelpful button. After all I am inexperienced in both watching and reviewing, but I hope I have at least some merit in my words. Regardless, thank you for your time. cannot. You already know which side I’ve chosen. I did not like Danmachi, so much that I won’t even bother copy/pasting its (ridiculous) full name.Frankly, it’s nothing more than a cashgrab, one that doesn’t make me feel bad about all the anime torrents and unofficial websites that everyone outside of Japan uses. It’s the perfect money-maker. You have a modern, popular concept with a general, an average shounen protagonist, and some nice, juicy fanservice to make sure you don’t look away and so the merchandise sells. Oh, and we’ll throw in some blood as well. It worked for Attack on Titan, so we might as well.Danmachi does nothing to separate itself from anything. It’s simply a watered-down action/adventure anime meant to please those who ride on the most popular anime, for those who are easily amused. Like a Taylor Swift song. I’d try to tell you to not watch it, but who am I kidding. It’s already gonna have a fuckton of seasons, so it already won. GG Danmachi.Well, we’re already this far in, so let’s start talking about it.The story.Danmachi takes place in a fantasy city with its most notable feature being the dungeon: a tower that stretches so high that it disappears into the clouds. …Did I lose you there? Yes, the dungeon is a damn TOWER, no matter how many times it’s referred to as a dungeon, or how many times you actually see someone go DOWN in the dungeon. Either this tower is not actually the dungeon and is instead some random point in the setting that the camera likes to see, or nobody really knows what a dungeon is.Well, hey, the world itself seems to be pretty weird. I mean, the people here have actual stats and levels, like an RPG. Except this only seems to apply for combat in the dungeon, at least from what I heard. And generally, people that fight in the dungeon are only those who have received powers from a god. I’m assuming this is the only area of civilization in this series’ entire world, since actual gods and goddesses seem to put a huge focus on it, and they basically have their own currency and everything. Iiiiit’s a small world aaaafter all…And now, cue the main character, believe it! Kirito is a young man with the simple ambition of becoming stronger! He truly is an hero, because when the going gets tough, he always has a convenient way out! …Wait, what? Oh, sorry. I meant Bell. Not Kirito. Same rules apply, though. Bell, who even has Kirito’s voice actor, is your basic protagonist. He wants an adventure, he wants to be stronger, he’s heroic, he’s fighting for recognition, and he’ll never give up on it! Believe it!! Overall, this is just the start of Bell’s adventure into an underground sky tower, so a lot of results are just him getting something, from power-up to party member. In the most basic sense, it’s nothing special. In a more specific sense, it’s still nothing special.The rest can essentially be summed up as “shit happens”, which can be expected when there’s nothing really at stake in the plot. Bell and his partner Hestia seem to be just fine in their small house, but I guess it’s just not enough so LET’S GO KILL THINGS. Oh, and Bell wants senpai to notice him. Really, I just laugh that Bell works so hard to get attention from some emotionless girl who saved him a couple times, and then casts aside the girl who’s constantly supported him. Priorities.But along with Bell’s dumb, pointless motives are his abilities, his ways out. His growth in strength is LITERALLY determined by his emotions in battles. Basically “do it 4 da waifu”. There’s one fight towards the end where he fights someone that can turn invisible. Why this person isn’t like the strongest person in the show is beyond me, but anyway Bell ends up defeating him because he could “feel his eyes on him”. Okay, Bell. Sure. It’s not like this crap is uncalled for, though, because the plot itself has predictable outcomes. I mean, call me crazy, but I think the person that smirked darkly at the end of a scene MIGHT be up to no good. But first, a word from the main villain on what she’s about to do.But you know what really makes me displeased? The characters.Bell Cranel, the main character. A young man with the goal of becoming stronger, inspired by his dead family member! Truly riveting! 10/10 character! No, he’s just some typical, beginning adventurer who likes to play the hero. Nothing else. But what I actually hate is that this show tries SO HARD to get you to like him. In the pilot episode, there’s a scene where some asshole in a bar starts ranting about how utterly terrible Bell is, not knowing that Bell is like 10 feet away. This scene goes on for MINUTES, just blabbing about Bell being a scrublord tomato dork who will never have his dream girlfriend as his girlfriend. I can feel Danmachi’s cold, dead hands grabbing me by the shoulders yelling “FEEL BAD! LOVE HIM! LOVE HIIIIIIIIM!” as it shakes me violently. It not only wants you to feel bad, but makes you want to be him, as he tries to be the badass hero you dreamed about in your early childhood, only this time he has a fair supply of titties surrounding him. I think I’ve complained enough about him. Let’s move on to the other lead.Hestia. Oh my god. I heard about this character before I heard about the actual anime. I saw the dumb hestia.dance thing and that she was “hestia bestia” or some shit. I hate whoever is responsible for this. Hestia became unbearably annoying by the show’s end. She obviously loves and supports Bell, who lacks the brainpower to actually realize that, and she becomes clingy and gets mad whenever Bell’s around one of his many harem members. In context, this isn’t a recipe for disaster or anything, but it’s so overdone that it gets ridiculous. Hell, she’s ruined some scenes entirely, like one time where Bell and Aiz have a conversation by themselves, only to be interrupted by Hestia yelling at Bell, including some 5-10 minute long scream.

Regardless, thank you for your time.', 'I decided to write a review for ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka"" due to some of the hate I saw it receiving and wanted to provide my perspective. This is my first review so don\'t expect it to be well polished.Story: The story isn\'t this rpg\'s strong point. Truthfully, this rpg doesn\'t have a single strong point. It\'s a combination of different things that make this rpg enjoyable to watch. The story isn\'t really explained in detail. We are really just given an explanation of gods and goddesses and the aspects of the anime develop more and more with each...episode. The best thing I find about the story is that it\'s not really there. This allows me to enjoy each episode separately and be surprised by the things they introduce. It\'s the same reason why Gintama is enjoyable if you have seen that anime. Many people compare this anime to SAO but I find it more bearable to watch because things aren\'t as serious until certain points.Character: The main character, Bell, is simply setup to become a hero. It\'s like in an rpg game where the main character is meant to have the best stats and skills as they level up. People say the main character just becomes overpowered after a few episodes but I feel that he is reasonably average. He is always shadowed by the sword princess, who he wishes to surpass. He isn\'t the strongest person around. I hated Kirito in SAO because he was ridiculously overpowered. It didn\'t really explain why he was overpower either. The other main character, Goddess Hestia, is a great component of the show. With her addition, I feel that this show is a parody of the usual harem. Several times Hestia will point out the amount of times she finds Bell with a different female. In addition, none of the other female characters display the amount of affection that Hestia shows except Lili. Other characters are introduced but never really expanded on.i. I feel that this anime could improve a lot if they added more character expansion, especially with Freya who seems like the main antagonist.Art: The art is simple but I feel they use the money they save to add in a decent amount of action and quality animation. I was surprised at how well animated the fight in episode 8 was. However, I really wish the Dungeon and it\'s enemies had more variety. In the later episodes, it seems like they are trying to remedy this. The dungeon definitely holds a lot of promise. The characters could also use more design. They show a lot of expensive equipment available in shops around the city but you don\'t see even the best fighters with anything flashy equipped.  We all know that the strong people are suppose to have cool armor.Overall: A feel like this anime is so enjoyable because of how average it is. I never have any high expectations. Every episode I watch is good and I know that the following episode will be good and so forth. I hate anime where you wait a week for a new episode and that episode is nothing but talking and a complete let down. That never happens with this show. Every week is worth the wait. This anime didn\'t start off boiling hot and simmered down. Instead, it started out cold and is slowly warming up, just like an RPG. Because it\'s a mix of comedy, action, and harem , every episode has the possibility of being either full of jokes, action, or character/relationship development. episode.

JC Staff capitalizing on the video game anime craze was already a flag, but to go this far... is pathetic. This is every anime you have ever seen. This is everything wrong with anime. This anime is the exact reason why anime is ostracized at face value. This is what anime viewers should be trying to stop.There is a story. It is hyper-simplistic. So stupid that anyone could understand it. Yet the plot points make little to no sense. The main character Bell Cranel starts his adventures with his well-endowed companion,...the goddess Hestia. Why this girl is supposed to be Hestia I have no clue. She does nothing Hestia-esque. Her character design has nothing to do with Hestia. She\'s blatantly an oversexualized little girl with a bra made out of string. A quick aside - bras made out of string do not exist. They do not exist because they do not work.So Bell Cranel and his representative goddess have to go into a dungeon to, like, do adventures or something (unexplained). But Bell Cranel is very weak so every episode an unforeshadowed deus ex machina pops out of nowhere and saves him. There is no character progression and no power scaling boundaries set. Then things get really crazy, because the bad guy gives Bell Cranel a very strong power for no reason at all.The bad guy gives the main character super powers for an unexplained reason. All of the main characters powers are given to him for an unexplained reason. The villain, the evil character, the bad guy gives the protagonist, the good guy, the hero, his super powers. The rest of the anime is spent on everyone being impressed that the main character has super powers. Please note that it is completely unexplained why the bad guy gives the good guy his super powers. And why he can just have super powers.And of course there is a harem. Of course the camera angles settle on poorly animated breasts whenever a girl is on the screen. Of course the fight scenes are embarrassing and the main character has to use his unexplained super power to kill the bad guy. I have no clue if this is supposed to be an underdog story or not because Bell Cranel is so overpowered yet everyone in the world wants to help him. Everything is contradictory.The writing is abysmal. It is the worst writing I have seen in anime in a while. Every single character is an archetypal character with an archetypal backstory. There are three episodes spent on the lolita character they introduce in the middle of the season that are obvious and cringe worthy in terms of direction. You knew exactly what was going to happen. Every single scene was predictable, yet the script was just rehashed lines. The script is the nail in the coffin with gems like ""I\'ll save you because you\'re a woman."" They took garbage, put garbage on top of it, threw in a couple of minotaurs and little girls and sold it for 76 bucks per blu-ray after the current Yen to US Conversion rate. If you buy this anime, it\'s associated manga or light novels, figurines, buttons, pins, moist towelettes, and so on... you will hurt my feelings. I\'ll consider it a personal attack.DanMachi is so terrible and so idiotic. Nothing is ever explained and the most random drama ensues at the most opportune times. The final episode is just one huge monster battle for, once again, a completely unexplained reason. Every episode something crazy happens and it simply does not get explained. Like Hestia\'s Divine Powers, or why Hermes is a jerk, or what Hephaestus and Crozzeo\'s relationship is... and... and... everything. But don\'t worry because I\'m sure everything will be explained in season two! Even sarcastically that hurts to type.Only watch this anime ironically. If you watch this anime ironically I\'ll still be upset with you. Take my advice like a doting mother or teacher who said you can redo a paper. I really care about you, anonymous, I really do. I want you to love anime. I want people to respect your great taste. I want you to succeed in life.

Why does this anime exist?!All these questions and more - completely unanswered in season two of ""Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon!""', 'When you see a title this long and silly, then you may also be asking yourself if you should watch the show. “Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?” That’s the translated title for this series which really sparks a bit of curiosity. Just judging on the surface, you can tell the story has relations to dungeons and girls. What you may not expect would be the presence of goddesses that really spices up the excitement.For the purpose of this review, the series will be referred by its shortened title “DanMachi”. Adapted from the light novel of the same...name, DanMachi is essentially a fantasy adventure show. The setting takes place in a fictional world known as ‘Orario’. While this name isn’t anything special to remember by, its features crafts many possibilities because of the existence of Dungeon. This is a basically a location that contains all sorts of supernatural creatures ranging from minotaurs, dragons, goblins, etc. Why do people visit this place? The answer is simply for the rewards. Although the series isn’t based on a MMORPG game, it has similar themes in that monsters drops valuable loot. At the center of the story is a young man named Bell Cranel. DanMachi chronicles his adventure as he picks up girls in dungeons in this world of bizarreness.The series is pretty straightforward. No less than 5 minutes into the first episode and we can see that Bell gets himself in a bit of trouble involving dungeons. Perhaps trouble would be an understatement because Bell’s life does get put into jeopardy when he gets trapped by a minotaur. Luckily, a young girl by the name of Aiz coms to his recuse. This encounter not only saves Bell but he also falls in love with her. Ironic really. The girl picks up the guy in this case. However, this isn’t what it all seems. As the series progresses on, Bell gets involved in acquaintance and relationships with many other girls. Perhaps the most prominent of them is a goddess named Hestia. She is part of a group known as Hestia Familia where he and Hestia are the only two members. Bell is shown to work very hard every day to get by. As a character of only 14 years of age, he takes a lot of responsibility and display insurable amounts of courage as the story progresses. Alongside is Hestia who supports and unknown to Bell also is in love with him. So in essence, Bell already has a girl picked up but he just doesn’t realize it. In Hestia’s case, she throws a lot of hints towards Bell that he fails to recognize. Although they don’t act entirely like lovers, they are very close. And this is where the fun comes in. DanMachi crafts relationships in this series with a comedy formula. It never tries to act too serious despite some of the dangers that exists in this show.Girls. A main emphasis in this show is how Bell meets them during his adventure. From the elegant swordswoman Aiz to mischievous traveler Liliruca Arde, the series continuously shows Bell’s development. A strong point about his character is how he can influence others with his kindness. It also gets some of them curious such as the case of Aiz. She often wonders about how Bell can get so strong in such a short of time. Over the course of the show, Bell develops a relationship with Aiz through their training sessions. There’s also harem tropes that becomes more and more evident as Bell builds connections with them. While it’s not fully shown whether Aiz likes Bell or not, there’s definitely a certain curiosity that she has for the young man. As generic as this seems, I actually find the series to be genuinely entertaining. This is because Bell isn’t overpowered nor is he a weakling. More like a balance of both, it gets the viewers curious about how much he will improve. Characters such as Bete Loga and Freya are also surprised at his improvement despite their initial outlook of Bell.In terms of story, the show follows a rather straightforward set of mechanics. There is no central antagonist introduced in this season nor are there any game tropes that indicates some sort of setting that relates to MMORPG survival. It’s simple with established mechanics such as the Familia, groups in the story with specialized skills including item crafting and monster hunting. So in essence, the series almost has a slice of life-like tone at times. What it sets differently apart from some adventure is mostly the relationship building. To be quite honest, there’s perhaps far too much of it. Bell and Hestia’s relationship makes up the core of the show. While some episodes doesn’t exclusively focus on this, it still ultimately communicates the message to the audience that the pair is inseparable. Unfortunately, Bell treats Hestia more like a close friend than a girlfriend. And this becomes a source of annoyance for Hestia. It can also be a source of annoyance for the viewers as it shows how dense he can be. Romance is subtle as we don’t really see much development except on casual levels. Despite this, the show often transits between relationships and fantasy adventure. What I do find disappointing is that the focus is too much on our two main characters. Even as a prominent character in the show, we don’t learn much about Aiz from this adaptation. There’s little we see from her background but only her personality on the surface. Similarly, her guild mates are often trying to impress her (both guys and girls included). It’s paltry in the end in terms of characterization. On the other hand, it’s nice to see that Bell can make friends outside of his Familia such as Welf, a blacksmith who made his armor and a member of the Herme Familia. In this way, it shows how Bell interacts with other characters that are not so close to him while allowing the audience to see his other characteristics.Based on the light novel, I am on most parts satisfied with the adaptation. While it’s not frame by frame faithful to the source, it captures the most important parts. These include the magical contents such as the various items that are shown. Skills and abilities that Bell learns are also introduced such as the Fire Bolt. In the background, there’s a considerable amount of world building. In fact, the world fiction of the show is one of the features that is very noticeable. The supernatural creatures that exists in their world are crafted to make them look real. While it isn’t unique compared to most fantasy adventure stories, DanMachi attracts appeal to any fan who wants to see how their world functions. From dampy dungeons to enchanting forests, this show exhibits an attractive appeal to fantasy. It even has a good amount of explanation for how stats and skillsets work including limitations to adventurers’ levels. The comedy can sometimes feel a bit of a hit or miss but on most parts flows well with the story. It can also mislead viewers sometimes as some episodes that are seemingly indulged by humor turns serious with the buildup and execution. For such a goofy title, that’s saying something.J.C. Staff is behind the wheels to operate this show. What you see from the preview is what you get. The artwork retains a fantasy atmosphere with its elegant world. There’s careful texture that decorates the world of Orario with what it has to offer. The dungeons is still the most prominent feature as the show creates its features to look legitimately menacing. At the same time, it also display a good fixture of concrete detail. These ranges from the various monsters to the magical elements that are displayed throughout the show such as Bell’s abilities. Fans who wants to be serviced will feel pleased at times because the show does show a bit of skin. These include Aiz’s partially broken armor, Hestia’s outfit, or even the inevitable bath scenes. It’s also noticeable that character designs for the series puts a lot of emphasis into the female characters. All the gods and goddesses are designed to look beautiful or seductive. In the case of Freya, she also display a bit of yandereness with her expressions. However, the character expressions is a bit silly for its own good at times. This is mostly coming from Bell especially in the first half of the show that makes him react more like a kid than an adventurer. His puppy crush on Aiz brings this out the most. On the other hand, who can forget about Hestia’s jealousy when she sees Bell hanging out with a girl?Surprisingly enough, DanMachi’s soundtrack matches very well with its consistency. If there’s any first impressions, soundtrack should be one to name especially for its battle oriented OST. The extensive fighting in some episodes as well as the thriller-like feeling of dungeon conquests flows quite well with the intense soundtrack. It brings a heavy feeling and even bit of realism of what being part of an adventurer is like in the dungeons just by the sheer music too. The OP and ED theme songs are more lighthearted. And in general, most of the humorous and slice of life scenes has a more relaxing feeling. Finally, there’s the voice mannerisms. Hestia is a big of mixed bag. Her voice sometimes sounds like a spoiled brat while other times shows a very caring friend. Aiz’s soft voice makes her one of the more calm characters; a bit of contrast to Bell’s personality. And then there are many other characters with a wide dynamic range of voice expressions. The ones that stands out the most are the goddesses such as Freya while others…well, not so much. Bell would fit into that category as his voice matches mostly as a teenager.So what does DanMachi really try to appeal? If it’s a fantasy and adventure story, then that’s a success with its fantastic world fiction and mechanics. When it comes to characterization though, that’s more of its Achilles’ Heel. It does make up for it with concrete relationships especially in the case of Bell and Hestia. Other times, the show tries to capitalize on Bell’s adventure by presenting us his improvements. Now I do have to say that the comedy feels a bit repetitive while other times, the story’s consistency feels blend. As a 1 cour show, expect certain elements of the original source to be omitted or changed. Still, DanMachi is a story that shows how fantasy can be fun. It may not feel original but it has a lot of reasons to make us think of its title. name, DanMachi is essentially a fantasy adventure show. The setting takes place in a fictional world known as ‘Orario’. While this name isn’t anything special to remember by, its features crafts many possibilities because of the existence of Dungeon. This is a basically a location that contains all sorts of supernatural creatures ranging from minotaurs, dragons, goblins, etc. Why do people visit this place? The answer is simply for the rewards. Although the series isn’t based on a MMORPG game, it has similar themes in that monsters drops valuable loot. At the center of the story is a young man named Bell Cranel. DanMachi chronicles his adventure as he picks up girls in dungeons in this world of bizarreness.The series is pretty straightforward. No less than 5 minutes into the first episode and we can see that Bell gets himself in a bit of trouble involving dungeons. Perhaps trouble would be an understatement because Bell’s life does get put into jeopardy when he gets trapped by a minotaur. Luckily, a young girl by the name of Aiz coms to his recuse. This encounter not only saves Bell but he also falls in love with her. Ironic really. The girl picks up the guy in this case. However, this isn’t what it all seems. As the series progresses on, Bell gets involved in acquaintance and relationships with many other girls. Perhaps the most prominent of them is a goddess named Hestia. She is part of a group known as Hestia Familia where he and Hestia are the only two members. Bell is shown to work very hard every day to get by. As a character of only 14 years of age, he takes a lot of responsibility and display insurable amounts of courage as the story progresses. Alongside is Hestia who supports and unknown to Bell also is in love with him. So in essence, Bell already has a girl picked up but he just doesn’t realize it. In Hestia’s case, she throws a lot of hints towards Bell that he fails to recognize. Although they don’t act entirely like lovers, they are very close. And this is where the fun comes in. DanMachi crafts relationships in this series with a comedy formula. It never tries to act too serious despite some of the dangers that exists in this show.Girls. A main emphasis in this show is how Bell meets them during his adventure. From the elegant swordswoman Aiz to mischievous traveler Liliruca Arde, the series continuously shows Bell’s development. A strong point about his character is how he can influence others with his kindness. It also gets some of them curious such as the case of Aiz. She often wonders about how Bell can get so strong in such a short of time. Over the course of the show, Bell develops a relationship with Aiz through their training sessions. There’s also harem tropes that becomes more and more evident as Bell builds connections with them. While it’s not fully shown whether Aiz likes Bell or not, there’s definitely a certain curiosity that she has for the young man. As generic as this seems, I actually find the series to be genuinely entertaining. This is because Bell isn’t overpowered nor is he a weakling. More like a balance of both, it gets the viewers curious about how much he will improve. Characters such as Bete Loga and Freya are also surprised at his improvement despite their initial outlook of Bell.In terms of story, the show follows a rather straightforward set of mechanics. There is no central antagonist introduced in this season nor are there any game tropes that indicates some sort of setting that relates to MMORPG survival. It’s simple with established mechanics such as the Familia, groups in the story with specialized skills including item crafting and monster hunting. So in essence, the series almost has a slice of life-like tone at times. What it sets differently apart from some adventure is mostly the relationship building. To be quite honest, there’s perhaps far too much of it. Bell and Hestia’s relationship makes up the core of the show. While some episodes doesn’t exclusively focus on this, it still ultimately communicates the message to the audience that the pair is inseparable. Unfortunately, Bell treats Hestia more like a close friend than a girlfriend. And this becomes a source of annoyance for Hestia. It can also be a source of annoyance for the viewers as it shows how dense he can be. Romance is subtle as we don’t really see much development except on casual levels. Despite this, the show often transits between relationships and fantasy adventure. What I do find disappointing is that the focus is too much on our two main characters. Even as a prominent character in the show, we don’t learn much about Aiz from this adaptation. There’s little we see from her background but only her personality on the surface. Similarly, her guild mates are often trying to impress her (both guys and girls included). It’s paltry in the end in terms of characterization. On the other hand, it’s nice to see that Bell can make friends outside of his Familia such as Welf, a blacksmith who made his armor and a member of the Herme Familia. In this way, it shows how Bell interacts with other characters that are not so close to him while allowing the audience to see his other characteristics.Based on the light novel, I am on most parts satisfied with the adaptation. While it’s not frame by frame faithful to the source, it captures the most important parts. These include the magical contents such as the various items that are shown. Skills and abilities that Bell learns are also introduced such as the Fire Bolt. In the background, there’s a considerable amount of world building. In fact, the world fiction of the show is one of the features that is very noticeable. The supernatural creatures that exists in their world are crafted to make them look real. While it isn’t unique compared to most fantasy adventure stories, DanMachi attracts appeal to any fan who wants to see how their world functions. From dampy dungeons to enchanting forests, this show exhibits an attractive appeal to fantasy. It even has a good amount of explanation for how stats and skillsets work including limitations to adventurers’ levels. The comedy can sometimes feel a bit of a hit or miss but on most parts flows well with the story.

This time, I found one I actually like.It\'s called ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka"", what a mouthful! Translation is \'Dzun-ge would be wrong I\'ll seek a meeting to sound day\', I swear that\'s the Google Translation.There is a short name some use ""DanMachi"", don\'t ask me I have no idea. Google Translation is \'Dan-Machi\'.A lot of the time; most of us get caught up in the story, or the music, or the dialog, or the artwork, or the characters.But then there is the forest, hiding in all those trees. And...DanMachi is one of these shows, that shows us that sometimes the forest is more important than the trees.***I\'ll discuss the Anime\'s specifics in a moment, but I want to have a word about the meanings of things. Sometimes Anime has a meaning that shines far above the actual artwork. DanMachi is one of those rare shining lights.For once, we have a show that stands up and shouts to the highest mountaintops.That our faith in our fellow Man, is more important than the impending threats, the suffering that is a consequence of standing up for our friends, and loved ones. That courage in the face of enemies, in the defense of our true friends and loved ones, speaks louder than any fear.And the fact that no one else sees it, isn\'t the same as if it never happened at all. Things that are important in our life, are not, unless we are willing to suffer to protect them. Things that are important, has nothing to do with the property we own, or the school we go to, or the stores we frequent.The valuable things are those items we carry with us for our entire lives, that enrichen it, and make the days we live in the future, seem richer for knowing those things.All of that leads us to DanMachi, and a little fellow that would not surrender his belief for temporary freedom from fear and pain. And because he stood up and fought to protect what he held dear, his faith in the strength of the friendship and love of his fellows; his fellows responded in kind.In other words, those things many would find a weakness in his character, was exactly the forces martial\'d, to bring about the friendships he gained. These friendships and loved ones were a direct consequence of his behavior. All of these people that centered upon him, as a compass point; were not there to form a harem, or a club. They are friends and neighbors, their behavior paid for, by his offering his spirit of neighborhood to his fellows.First.The spirit of neighborhood, and fellowship are not weakness; they are an enormous strength. When we forget that, we give a heave-ho to our own lives within the context of our own way of life, without safety, without friends, without community. But most of all, our neighborhoods become embattled contests for survival, and the grace of a civilized culture is the victim.Bell has two character traits that are all to rare in the description of a male hero: charity, and mercy. He gave of himself, in the name of his friends, and they became his neighbors. What is a neighbor, but a person who stands with you, when your sense of community is threatened?What does it mean to be Human? Does it mean we are all born Human? I don\'t believe that. Being Human is to decide to operate by set of principles that define what it is to be Human. Being a Human Being has nothing to do with biology, or procreation, or how we look. It is defined by how we believe we should behave among our fellow Humans.The fact that many try to gain our faith in themselves, as if all Men deserve to be trusted as if we were all Human, is a deceit of the highest order, a con-game. Especially when non-Human Homo-Sapiens walk among us trying to get the results of these values from us, without trading in kind. These are liars, cheats and thieves.Is it any wonder that the motto of the U.S. Air Force Academy is ""I shall not lie, cheat or steal; or tolerate anyone who does.""? Those who do, don\'t stay at the Academy long.The little female character, Miss Arde, is a case in point. She had been beaten, kicked, dropped into terror, mistreated in so many ways; that she had lost her  faith in her fellow Man. But just as in real life, it only took one true faithful spirit to teach her that not everyone had to live as she had. She realized what she was doing wasn\'t living; she had sold her soul to pay for existence.And because of it, she mistrusted Bell\'s motives, even to betraying him because he was an easy mark. True Humans usually are. Until Miss Arde realized that it was the very things she thought of as weaknesses, that were the very causes for Bell\'s decisions to defend her when she least expected it.Weakness? Lost promises? Can\'t relate to people of the same stripe? I don\'t think so. Bell is a symbol of all that is good in Man, and needs to be nurtured for its own sake.***Now I can talk about the basic production of DanMachi.This anime has a wonderful story, that covers an enormous amount of back-story and premise in 13-episodes. I would have appreciated more episodes, to give more depth of history, but this Anime was adequate in this regard, for what was offered.The artwork was very good, even having some parallax artwork in moments where Bell or some other characters are walking down a street, or images of large panoramas are described. This is \'J.C. Staff\' at its finest.The music was, for once, something I could sink my teeth into. Catchy tunes, with fine melodies. Singing that is worthy of the name. Harmonies that work together with the voices, to make something that is pleasant to hear. While I would have preferred to have music that also had import to the show itself, after all, we are dealing with an alternate universe, with Gods who walk among the ordinary gentry. And the basic soundtrack was also appropriate to the moments in the story.The characters were interesting, each one a three-dimensional personality. Even the girls were varied, and while they tended to be way to cute for real life; still all bounced off each other (no pun intended) as people would in a real town, with real neighborhoods. There is nothing unusual about a girl finding herself interested in a boy who has a history of treating other people with dignity and respect. And this happened quite a few times. Rare? Never. Many girls become women who marry such boys, who grow up to be good men.The only thing that began to not jive very well is that even though the beginnings of the tale centers on a little God named Hestia, who pairs herself with her one and only Adventurer, in an old deserted non-Greek-God Worship Church; as they developed in their community, and became somewhat richer, they stayed in the rent-free squatters life-style. Never to be improved upon, as they could afford more and better. Everything in their lives were old, hand-me-down and discarded by every one. Including the building itself.One has to wonder about that. And then there\'s the debt to be paid, by Hestia, for the knife Hephaistios created for Bell. But these items are for another season. If there ever is another one. This show is one of those that deserves another season. After all, we still don\'t have a motivation for the actions of Freya. This is not a weakness, it just needs some more episodes, to place Freya on center stage. Something that was never done, in the interests of developing the rest of the plot. This is not an error. It is an author\'s license.With all of the above, I finish this review of a short, flawed, but otherwise excellent offering. Slickly written, with comedy, pathos, heartfelt emotions; and a soaring set of principles that is all too rare.I give DanMachi a solid 9!

Pfft, it\'s the best way to pick up girls!More commonly referred to as DanMachi, ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka?"" is a fantasy, action, adventure, romance and, to some extent, comedy anime. The tags aren\'t inaccurate, as these themes are visible throughout all twelve episodes. After watching each episode weekly as they were released, I\'ve come to that conclusion that DanMachi is deserving of around a 7/10.Story: 6DanMachi\'s main story line is decent. With plot twists every few episodes, it\'s safe to say that the main story is pretty exciting...and definitely drags you into continuing the series. There are some brilliant moments of tension and the story changes its side character focus every so often, which keeps things fresh. At the start of the anime, the story shows a lot of promise, with an amazing RPG-style fantasy world being shown. However, this is exactly where it falls flat. I found myself asking questions about the world as the anime went on... ""Why is there a massive dungeon tower in the middle of the world (that\'s extremely reminiscent of the one in Sword Art Online?"" ""What other towns and cities are there?"" ""Why did the Gods choose to live with humans?"" ""Who says what the Gods can and can\'t do?"" ""Why do people get exp. like in a video game?"" ""Why did people start going into the dungeon in the first place?"" ""What do the magic rocks that monsters drop even do?"" ""Who put the monsters in the dungeon?"".  I could go on for ages. Point is, they presented a wonderful and interesting world and explained nothing about it. To me, this detracted from the story greatly as I was unable to immerse myself into the world due to the fact I was constantly saying: ""B-b-but that doesn\'t make sense! Why?"". I can only hope that this is elaborated more upon in season two.Art: 10DanMachi\'s artwork and animation is stellar. The character designs are all incredibly lovable and unique, especially the Goddess, Hestia. The weapons, armor and monsters are all terrifying and very well designed. If you were looking for flaws in the animation, you would not find any, with action and fight scenes that are so very clear and fun to watch. The style of the world is just simply awesome, my favorite part being the backstreet alleyway in the city. However, the only drawback with the overall art is that it bears shocking resemblance to Sword Art Online. I understand that it\'s from the same studio, but it\'s as if they didn\'t even try making it different.Sound: 7The soundtrack is good, the battle songs and tavern music definitely add to the feel of the world and help you become more immersed. The opening is catchy but kind of weird and doesn\'t really fit the anime if you ask me. The ending is the same really. It seems somewhat out of place at times, especially when there\'s an intense cliffhanger and then it suddenly plays all cheery and upbeat. Kind of ruins the cliffhanger-y mood.Characters: 8One good aspect of this anime is the array of vibrant and lovable characters it presents. With each character being unique and incredibly well designed, it\'s somewhat hard to find many faults with the characters. Hestia in particular being just so damn cute and hilarious. However, the main issue I have with the characters is with the protagonist. Bell is a pretty normal kid in terms of personality. However, that\'s all he is- he\'s an average kid trying to win over a girl. There\'s nothing unique or entertaining really about his personality and DanMachi relies on side characters for its comedy relief and bizarre traits. Some side characters even have dark and intruiging back stories, with development being shown in some!Enjoyment: 7Despite huge drawbacks with the story, DanMachi\'s animation and lovable characters make it a pretty enjoyable watch.Overall: 7As mentioned slightly earlier on in the review, DanMachi bears striking resemblance with the older, more popular Sword Art Online. In fact, even so to the point where some characters\' faces look identical and the main character has the same voice actor. In short, if you disliked Sword Art Online, it\'s pretty likely you\'ll dislike this too. However, the vice-versa rule applies here too! If you enjoyed SAO, then you\'ll enjoy DanMachi. Althoguh, that\'s not to say it\'s a carbon copy. It does have its unique aspects and is a must watch for any adventure/RPG anime lovers out there. and definitely drags you into continuing the series. There are some brilliant moments of tension and the story changes its side character focus every so often, which keeps things fresh. At the start of the anime, the story shows a lot of promise, with an amazing RPG-style fantasy world being shown. However, this is exactly where it falls flat. I found myself asking questions about the world as the anime went on... ""Why is there a massive dungeon tower in the middle of the world (that\'s extremely reminiscent of the one in Sword Art Online?"" ""What other towns and cities are there?"" ""Why did the Gods choose to live with humans?"" ""Who says what the Gods can and can\'t do?"" ""Why do people get exp. like in a video game?"" ""Why did people start going into the dungeon in the first place?"" ""What do the magic rocks that monsters drop even do?"" ""Who put the monsters in the dungeon?"".  I could go on for ages. Point is, they presented a wonderful and interesting world and explained nothing about it. To me, this detracted from the story greatly as I was unable to immerse myself into the world due to the fact I was constantly saying: ""B-b-but that doesn\'t make sense! Why?"". I can only hope that this is elaborated more upon in season two.Art: 10DanMachi\'s artwork and animation is stellar. The character designs are all incredibly lovable and unique, especially the Goddess, Hestia. The weapons, armor and monsters are all terrifying and very well designed. If you were looking for flaws in the animation, you would not find any, with action and fight scenes that are so very clear and fun to watch. The style of the world is just simply awesome, my favorite part being the backstreet alleyway in the city. However, the only drawback with the overall art is that it bears shocking resemblance to Sword Art Online. I understand that it\'s from the same studio, but it\'s as if they didn\'t even try making it different.Sound: 7The soundtrack is good, the battle songs and tavern music definitely add to the feel of the world and help you become more immersed. The opening is catchy but kind of weird and doesn\'t really fit the anime if you ask me. The ending is the same really. It seems somewhat out of place at times, especially when there\'s an intense cliffhanger and then it suddenly plays all cheery and upbeat. Kind of ruins the cliffhanger-y mood.Characters: 8One good aspect of this anime is the array of vibrant and lovable characters it presents. With each character being unique and incredibly well designed, it\'s somewhat hard to find many faults with the characters. Hestia in particular being just so damn cute and hilarious. However, the main issue I have with the characters is with the protagonist. Bell is a pretty normal kid in terms of personality. However, that\'s all he is- he\'s an average kid trying to win over a girl. There\'s nothing unique or entertaining really about his personality and DanMachi relies on side characters for its comedy relief and bizarre traits. Some side characters even have dark and intruiging back stories, with development being shown in some!Enjoyment: 7Despite huge drawbacks with the story, DanMachi\'s animation and lovable characters make it a pretty enjoyable watch.Overall: 7As mentioned slightly earlier on in the review, DanMachi bears striking resemblance with the older, more popular Sword Art Online. In fact, even so to the point where some characters\' faces look identical and the main character has the same voice actor. In short, if you disliked Sword Art Online, it\'s pretty likely you\'ll dislike this too. However, the vice-versa rule applies here too! If you enjoyed SAO, then you\'ll enjoy DanMachi. Althoguh, that\'s not to say it\'s a carbon copy. It does have its unique aspects and is a must watch for any adventure/RPG anime lovers out there.', 'With an absurdly long title such as ""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"" your first inclination is to think that the show is trying too hard to pander from just the title alone. With Romance, Fantasy, Action, and Comedy spliced in with an element of Harem, your anticipation going into this will probably sink into apathy. But fret not, my dear friends, this anime, shortly titled DanMachi, actually has much more to offer than your prototypical otaku bait anime. If you think a story is essential in anime, that fits this description.I mean the classic stereotype of a protagonist...relatable to your average Japanese teenager when I say otaku bait: A sexy loli girl with a sexy petite body who sticks with the protagonist and a plot that owes itself to another shonen show\'s popularity. In which case, the shonen show DanMachi wants to emulate is Sword Art Online. In DanMachi, a boy named Bell-kun craves to become a great adventurer to prove himself to be a strong warrior in the eyes of so many people by leveling up his attributes to accomplish this feat. Does that sound familiar? Thought so. However, DanMachi is set in an actual fantasy world, not an MMO. So it is a fantasy interpretation of Sword Art in some fashion.For those who might be discouraged by this comparison I mentioned, I assure you that DanMachi isn\'t just another clone for Sword Art Online. For one thing, the plot itself is not of the same magnitude as Sword Art Online. DanMachi\'s story is somewhat barebones and can easily be summed up in a sentence or two: ""Boy wants to be an adventurer to overcome difficulties in life. With the help of his sexy Goddess sidekick, he will be able to achieve this goal."" That\'s pretty all there is to it. By the time I was halfway through it, I had hoped that there was more to it than just this fundamental premise.That\'s the only big gripe DanMachi has going for that keeps it from being great. Still, with all that is said and done, there are many admirable qualities to the show that can add to an outstanding experience. The first one to mention is the characters Bell-kun and Hestia. Individually and together, they add a lot of great hilarious and impactful moments to their dialogue and actions. It becomes evident from the excellent chemistry they both create whenever they are together on-screen, whether they are fighting various monsters together or happily having a lovey-dovey date together, at least from Hestia\'s perspective. Bell-kun himself may seem like a weakling of an adventurer with a soft, calm voice, but he proves himself worthy of rivaling some of the better shonen protagonists you typically see. It also helps that he has a very likable personality that puts him in a comfortable position for us to root for him in his journey.Then we have the one and only goddess herself, Hestia-chan. What can you say about the bootylicious, big-chested, and genki archetypical loli that hasn\'t been said already? I will tell you one thing that can be added to those three categories: Awesome. Why should this title be mentioned in the same breath as her name, you may ask? Most of it has to do with how her personality ranges in hilarious and adorable ways that make her very expressive. These expressions make you feel an attachment to her when she acts serious, humorous, or flirty with Bell-kun. Not to mention that her voice actress, Inori Minase, gives it her all in creating a wonderful character with her remarkably expressive voice. It also provides a delicate balance between her wild and joyful nature and Bell-kun\'s quiet and gentle personality, making their camaraderie even more exciting and hilarious to watch.Besides our two main leads, the rest of the characters are, unfortunately, not up to par with these two. The only supporting role that I can remember liking was Lili, only because she at least had something that made her distinctive from the rest of the cast. That something being that overly large backpack of hers that doubles her small size, go figure. The rest of the supporting cast can be encapsulated into one word: boring. It all comes down to how the writers put minimal effort into making the supporting cast at least somewhat enjoyable so that it doesn\'t seem like the only thing carrying the show is our two main leads. They come down to making semi-funny jokes and getting involved in fight scenes with Bell-kun or Hestia, which are very well done to DanMachi\'s credit.Here is where another of DanMachi\'s strong points starts to bloom. You\'d be right if you thought shonen action shows fighting has gotten tedious in recent years. However, DanMachi manages to set the bar up pretty high with the amount of great tenacity and flair it gives to the action sequences with the monsters and other characters. What helps is how great the animation flows through these sequences with excellent fluid movements with the characters and how they use their weapons in combat. There are the occasional ""cutting corners"" in animation, but not to the point where it becomes jarring. Even outside of the action, the animation leaves a strong impression with how well detailed it shows off its medium-sized budget.Not only does the animation work wonders, but the art design also leaves a solid impression in DanMachi. Not just with the character design but also in creating the world itself. The world is your general fantasy world with a few new things added that you may or may not have seen before. The backgrounds have a subtle elegance to their artistic influence, from the massive scope of the mountains to the urban-style design of the city that our main characters live in. Character designs are pretty colorful and eloquent in how beautiful they look, especially Hestia. Even if you have no taste in petite girls, Hestia will undoubtedly raise a few eyebrows and maybe a few other things.DanMachi was indeed a surprise for me to experience this Spring. Where it lacks from a story and mostly character standpoint, it succeeds in providing a fun action/hybrid anime with its stellar art and animation department and a great duo from Hestia and Bell-kun with their fantastic chemistry. It managed to tickle my action and ecchi bone enough for me to say that it was a worthwhile adventure to take part in. As far as experiences go, this is one where the journey itself is the fun part, while the end of it makes you want to yearn for more. For me, at least, I want more Hestia-chan in the future.

I think Kirito was just overcome by Bell. I can say for sure that any girl in a 1 KM radius would fall in love for Kirito. But Bell just goes beyond that with his 100 KM radius.He gets everything that he wants. A loli, a hot chick, a hot elf and even a fucking god with nice tits. Jeez man this guy...is awesome !Now seriously .. this anime gets stupid because of this. He does nothing whatsoever but still every girl in the town falls in love for him because .. reasons.At a first glance, this anime looked a lot like SAO. The worlds are similiar, the characters are similiar .. but later on this anime actually develops a nice story that I admit, wasn´t expecting for.With the first 3 eps of this show, I was thinking about a crappy Harem action rommance. In the end, there was actually an Harem but the action turned out to be good, as well as the main story.Think about an MMORPG(massive multiplayer online role playing game)  (world of warcraft for instance,). You see that feeling of developing your own character, getting him stronger with new items, upgrading his stats, learning new abilities .. DanMachi has the same feeling for me. I felt like if I was playing a game where Bell was my character, my avatar.The world of DanMachi reminds me a game and that is really nice ! I loved that aspect.

Yah that's it. Some of them get some brief development but I really never cared about them. They are not interesting nor original.But the characters are not the biggest problem. So far no second season has been announced and that's worrying me. If we don´t get a second season then this rate will be much lower. The anime doesn´t end ! It needs a second season to end the story.In short. This anime doesn´t have that quality in terms of character develop. It doesn´t even have good characters in the first place .. only boobs.

I recommend!', ""Overall score: 6.2/10The world of DanMachi (short name for the Japanese title of this series) is interesting. The system that's used in this world is in accordance to what Family you belong in, as it determines how you're going to go on adventures. If you are in a family with a lot of people, then it's likely that you'll be going in dungeons with multiple other individuals. For the main character, since he is the only member in his Family, the Hestia Family, he goes on adventures alone--and that played a big role in his development throughout the series.Although DanMachi is enjoyable, and although...I was interested in its world (as I am a fan of Greek Mythology), I personally did not get more interested in its story and characters until around half-way through. A big part of it is probably because I look for character development, how the characters are involved with the story (even if they are not the main character), and if it's set in a fantasy world: how the world factors into their development and involvement with the story. In other words: I had some issues with its execution (such as what they chose to include *coughs: the harem-like element* and what they chose to NOT include: such as some of the characters' backstory and development--although it was mostly due to having to cover the story in only 13 episodes), but I still enjoyed watching it--as each episode made me want to watch the series until the end, to the least--despite how it actually does end.The animation of DanMachi is nicely done.

If so, that explains why Bell was able to level up so quickly, and grow at such a fast pace (although, admittedly, the knife that Hestia gave him helped as well). However, why Freya pulls strings to put Bell's life at risk (in terms of what she hopes to achieve from that--aside from wanting to see how fast he can develop) still remained unanswered...***(Spoilers section over.)***Overall, the world and animation of DanMachi is something to look forward to while you're watching the show.

The only thing I can say is I'm sick of getting sucked into short lived anime and there god dang for soarr better be MOARRR!!!!! "", 'Ah, role playing games.  The common theatric in a role playing game is you, the player, controlling a little avatar of yourself as you explore the world and level up your skills, making yourself the best adventurer out there.  So, to encapsulate that idea, we have Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, or ""Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon?""  in the Spring 2015 season to tell us this.  Let\'s start our journey!Story (7.48/10): Danmachi as the shorthanded way of calling this show is, takes place in a fantasy realm, a world where Gods...and Goddesses (of actual mythos names for gods that exist within our world) have come down to earth to be amongst their children, sealing off their divine powers in the process.  Here, the people are given blessings by their gods and goddess, given power to do magics and ""level up"" like general RPG style manner and become a member in their familia, going down in a dungeon in order to fight monsters, loot them, and sell them so they can buy more stuff and become stronger, simple RPG mechanics.  Here, we follow the story of Bell Cranel, a beginner adventurer that becomes one just so he can meet girls (hence the title of the show).  Here, he is chased by a deadly minotaur, and is heroically saved by a blond beauty known as Aiz Wallenstein.  And from there, our story begins.The structure of Danmachi is very reminiscent to a standard RPG, where our main character, Bell, starts off at a very base level and slowly makes his ascent up to become stronger and stronger, gaining new equipment, skills, and abilities along the way.  The show really puts emphasis on the growth of the main character as you go by episode to episode, which is nice to see, as you can observe the progress of our main character grind, quest, party build, and improve as the series goes along.  For the most part, the series focuses mainly on Bell and his party, with a group of episodes devoted to each of the three members, with of course, most of the development devoted to Bell.In addition, the show does boast some harem-like aspects that depending on your view of harem, can influence how you enjoy this show.  Cause in a show like this, characters are slowly fed into importance, giving the viewer more and more important and non-important characters to view and know.  And when you have a show that involves a weak little boy trying his love luck in a deadly dungeon, he\'s going to be meeting some lady friends along the way that will undeniable fall for him because he\'s nice.Like good fantasy anime, Danmachi puts slight emphasis on world building, detailing the different parts of the world of Danmachi and explaining the kinds of places and the set of rules that the series follows as you go along.  World building is essential to any good fantasy anime on account of the fact that every anime of this category follows different rules, rules that need to be explained to the viewer, or risk being considered garbage on account of poor explanation to the kind of place we\'re viewing.But there are a couple things that I feel lacking with the show.  For one thing, there are several points the feel completely forgotten or are virtually unexplained.  Not everything in Danmachi is properly detailed completely, which leaves some gray areas in unexplained plot.  The biggest example of this is with the show\'s alluded villain who does cause some ruckus for our MC to solve, taking about 3-5 episodes of runtime, but her motives and her actions just don\'t seem very clear.  In addition, in comparison to the source material, there\'re some missing parallels and some decently important scenes that just never made it to the animated version.Above all, I felt as though the show\'s ending was really kind of a smack to the face, dousing the viewer with a pretty hefty character trait that vies for something of a second season in order to explain that, or something of that sort.  The reason for that is because the show doesn\'t really...end.  It says ""fin"" at the end of the show and it feels like an ending, but there\'s so many plot points that just simply aren\'t resolved.  Bell doesn\'t get the girl (well, he kinda does, but it\'s not official, so I\'m not calling it.), the motives for all of the characters are far from clear, and the show just kinda drops this huge thing at the end, and...that does not sit well with me.Overview:+  RPG-style story that works+  World building-   Plot holes/lack of character motive explanation-   Rushed-   Pretty frustrating endingCharacters (7.64/10): The characters for Danmachi are varied, to say the least.  Like an RPG game, the anime showcases many races from what you would see from any given fantasy world, including normal humans, animal-like humans, elves, dwarves, etc.Bell Cranel is our main protagonist in this series, aka the character who thanks to sheer luck, is also a bit of a harem king in some strange aspect.  As a thief/rouge type of character, Bell is a knife wielder with light armor with an oddly high speed/dexterity stat.  At the start of the series, Bell is a bit of a crybaby/wimp, being unable to pull himself up to the level of being a proper adventurer on account of his Level 1 status, and his chronic fear of minotaurs.  As I have mentioned before, the series goes along with Bell\'s growth as he stacks up numerous accomplishments to make himself be recognized as a proper adventurer (if not a little but OP all things considering).  As a result, Bell is a nicely developed character, as he\'s not too too rushed and he develops over time at a nice pace.  The only issue...is also his chronic fear of the females.  In Harem King terms, Bell rather than being perverted, is the nervous kind, leading him to be reluctant to even try to get close to the girl he\'s fallen for, leading to some frustrating (yet hilarious) running away scenes to the point that not only do characters notice this behavior, but Bell himself does too.  (It\'s...kind of annoying.)And then we have Hestia, the featured goddess of the Danmachi series.  Now, unlike her real world counterpart, Hestia is not a modest woman of the hearth who swears herself to perpetual virginity, but rather a poor goddess wearing a tattered dress who\'s loli sized with large breasts that thirsts for Bell\'s love.  (Quite an opposite, ain\'t it?)  For the most part, that\'s really all there is to her character.  She\'s very clingy (territorial even) when it comes to the only person in her familia (Bell), and acts very childish and throws tantrums every time Bell is in her eyes ""unfaithful"" or something like that.  While she is actually a pretty fun character, giving off a sense of comedic feel for the show, she doesn\'t really actually have much development in her personality, leaving her to be stagnant in that regard.  Her character revolves around Bell\'s existence, so she has no real development parts herself.  She really just serves as a mascot for the series above all.  Hell, if you type in ""boob ribbon"" on google, you\'ll get pics of Hestia\'s dress because of how scarily iconic that blue thing under her chest is now.And then to round out the trio of character mentions, we have Aiz Wallenstein, the girl that Bell wants to shoot for to test his luck in the love game.  In terms of character, Aiz is that cool, silent girl with the oddly adorable blank face who\'s slightly airheaded.  Likewise with Hestia\'s case, she doesn\'t appear all that often, which really saddens me a bit because while her character revolved around Bell to some extent, she still had enough room to be more interesting and overall be a better character, not that she\'s not already a decent character already, but it\'s nice to have a little bit of development.Side characters in Danmachi are twofold, the characters that hang around Bell, and those that are outside of our MC\'s circle that come to know who he is and the kind of fast progression he has in the series.  For the two characters Lili and Welf that belong to Bell\'s party, each one of them develop a small story for each of them, gaining the character development for the series aside from Bell.  They share a lot of focus from the show, which in turn, makes them into better characters that get backstories and character development.  As for the other group, the characters that belong there are for the most part, cast members that bring more life into the world of Danmachi, featuring people that see Bell from time to time on occasion, other gods like Hephaestus, Hermes, and Loki, other girls like Syr and Eina, and Freya...Admittedly, the biggest issue I have with the characters is mostly with Freya.  As the character who seems to be the premier villain for the show, Freya really doesn\'t do anything.  Because there\'re some missing details in the show, a lot of what Freya does canonically, doesn\'t actually get shown and further makes her a little less involved with the show period.  She doesn\'t really have much of a purpose and that really bugs me because I feel like she actually does more than what she is shown to do here in the anime.  (Admittedly, J.C. has a history of cutting corners.)Overview:+  Good character development+  Good main cast+  Lots of races  (This is a personal positive)-   ""Villain"" character didn\'t really seem to do all that muchArt and Sound (7.44/10): In terms of art, the style that J.C. staff went for is a very standard looking style in this day and age.  There\'s nothing really standout about it aside from the fact that it looks decent nice, so generally, I would say that the show\'s appearance really isn\'t all that noteworthy.On the other hand though, the action scenes that the show showcases a lot are very fluid and nice.  It is rather smooth and the nice addition of blood spraying everywhere when a monster or character gets hit is nice, as it shows the battle progress that has been going on.And since this is a harem show, there\'s bound to be some ecchi, so here\'s the obligatory ecchi paragraph that I do with a show that has a great deal of fanservice.  For the most part, the fanservice isn\'t all that obvious.  However, because Hestia exists, we have some...ahem, interesting physics that go around this series.  And because of Hestia\'s design, expect quite a few scenes like that from time to time.In terms of sound, the Danmachi\'s OP and ED are good tracks, with a whimsical OP and a cheerful ED.  Would I say they\'re memorable?  Yes, I would agree that to an extent, they can be considered memorable.  Are they masterpieces?  Not really, but they\'re pretty fun songs nonetheless.  In terms of music in the anime itself, there really isn\'t anything that\'s worth mentioning cause there isn\'t anything that I can actually recall hearing specifically.Overview:+ Decent animation+ Good battle scenes+ Memorable OP and EDPersonal Enjoyment (8.32/10): As a fan of RPGs and harems in general, Danmachi was a show that I knew for a fact suited my tastes in anime.  Sure enough, I was right.  Overall, my thoughts on Danmachi aren\'t really all that significant for it.  It wasn\'t a show that had any thought provoking themes, it had flaws but not any grave ones that hampered the show a staggering amount, and it was overall, fun to watch.Did I like this anime?Yes I did.  It really showcased the RPG element that it was based off of with Bell getting new gear and weapons, leveling up to get stronger, and getting to tougher areas, which really made the show very appealing to me.  The characters were also quite fun seeing as how I\'m a fan of MC\'s that are strong but not TOO strong (still kinda OP at the end though...), and how the overall feel of the show really gripped me into the story at times.What didn\'t I like about this anime?My biggest issue with this series is mainly with the personalities and screen time that a good chunk of the characters get.  Hestia herself while great because of her obsessiveness over Bell, did get irritating at times, Aiz was great but didn\'t get featured as much as I would\'ve liked, and Freya was just kind of...not there for 90% of the series.  Plus those set of lines thrown in by Hermes at the end REALLY pisses me off.  You don\'t end a series by putting in a crap ton of information that can allude to a season two, and then end it with a giant ""fin"" at the end, that\'s just not right J.C.!Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re a fan of RPG fantasy games like I am or you\'re looking for something fun to watch, I\'d say Danmachi fits the bill pretty well.  It\'s not a perfect series on account on some of its glaring issues and use of fanserive, but it\'s a fun show, but far from a masterpiece.  A good show for a marathon on an afternoon of relaxation.Overall Score: 7.50/10 and Goddesses (of actual mythos names for gods that exist within our world) have come down to earth to be amongst their children, sealing off their divine powers in the process.  Here, the people are given blessings by their gods and goddess, given power to do magics and ""level up"" like general RPG style manner and become a member in their familia, going down in a dungeon in order to fight monsters, loot them, and sell them so they can buy more stuff and become stronger, simple RPG mechanics.  Here, we follow the story of Bell Cranel, a beginner adventurer that becomes one just so he can meet girls (hence the title of the show).  Here, he is chased by a deadly minotaur, and is heroically saved by a blond beauty known as Aiz Wallenstein.  And from there, our story begins.The structure of Danmachi is very reminiscent to a standard RPG, where our main character, Bell, starts off at a very base level and slowly makes his ascent up to become stronger and stronger, gaining new equipment, skills, and abilities along the way.  The show really puts emphasis on the growth of the main character as you go by episode to episode, which is nice to see, as you can observe the progress of our main character grind, quest, party build, and improve as the series goes along.  For the most part, the series focuses mainly on Bell and his party, with a group of episodes devoted to each of the three members, with of course, most of the development devoted to Bell.In addition, the show does boast some harem-like aspects that depending on your view of harem, can influence how you enjoy this show.  Cause in a show like this, characters are slowly fed into importance, giving the viewer more and more important and non-important characters to view and know.  And when you have a show that involves a weak little boy trying his love luck in a deadly dungeon, he\'s going to be meeting some lady friends along the way that will undeniable fall for him because he\'s nice.Like good fantasy anime, Danmachi puts slight emphasis on world building, detailing the different parts of the world of Danmachi and explaining the kinds of places and the set of rules that the series follows as you go along.  World building is essential to any good fantasy anime on account of the fact that every anime of this category follows different rules, rules that need to be explained to the viewer, or risk being considered garbage on account of poor explanation to the kind of place we\'re viewing.But there are a couple things that I feel lacking with the show.  For one thing, there are several points the feel completely forgotten or are virtually unexplained.  Not everything in Danmachi is properly detailed completely, which leaves some gray areas in unexplained plot.  The biggest example of this is with the show\'s alluded villain who does cause some ruckus for our MC to solve, taking about 3-5 episodes of runtime, but her motives and her actions just don\'t seem very clear.  In addition, in comparison to the source material, there\'re some missing parallels and some decently important scenes that just never made it to the animated version.Above all, I felt as though the show\'s ending was really kind of a smack to the face, dousing the viewer with a pretty hefty character trait that vies for something of a second season in order to explain that, or something of that sort.

Whilst there is some fanservice, it really isn't as bad as I thought it would be.The story itself is simple and treads a fairly familiar path of a young adventurer who starts of weak but has hidden potential quite apart from a kind and moral heart. The beauty of the story...however lies in how relatable the characters are and the chemistry of the leads. With simple stories, it is not just about the premise but the execution that counts - to that end, the main characters are just a lot of fun.In general I don't really care about art and sound unless they are exceptionally good or bad. In this case, they serve the series well in making us care for the characters and enjoy watching them develop and grow.Whilst this anime is not lifechanging nor particularly thought provoking, it does it's job of holding your attention and providing entertainment throughout the series with no real flaws or particular disappointments. Perhaps the only downside is the short single cour ending leaving a feeling of lack of completion. I sincerely hope that there is a second season because this feels like a 2 cour anime at least to allow an opportunity for some resolution of plot points.In summary, don't let the poor written reviews or your pre/misconceptions about the title and style of anime put you off.If you watch it, the vast majority of you will enjoy it's light hearted style and have a fun time watching it.

That would be because of the expandable content of the story and I really love how the anime is adapted to a video game enviroment where gamers will remember how amazing it was to play and farm for hours in dungeons and meeting new people, then I realize that most of us quit after being hacked/scammed. Now furthermore, I realized this story isn\'t very...stable when it comes to how it moves on and progresses. Like it starts off with a blow then it settles for a while then it skyrockets then lands smoothly. The ending impressed me cause it had hints for a second season which is very very ANTICIPATED by me and I would really love it.Art: 8Well, there\'s nothing so so unique about the art of the anime. To be honest, it\'s an anime catered around males due to the art funneled towards sex appeals of women. But what I didn\'t like is that the anime could have contained more effects in battle like the ones we see in video games, however battles are intense.Sound: 8The opening started with an amazing beat that reminds me of something however when it started the thing just went wrong !! Besides the opening and ending, the anime could have used dubstep in some situations , don\'t get the wrong idea the anime added music and tones that provides a mood.Character: 9One of the main protagonists, Hestia, is loved by everyone for her being tooo KAWAIII and lovely. Sometimes it makes you feel, Why don\'t girls like her exist ? Well the other protagonist, Bell Cranel, is rather the dreamer and is very unique but isn\'t like every other anime protagonist (Too Overpowered) and is balanced yet he must have something in him or else he wouldn\'t be chosen as the protagonist.Enjoyment: 9I loved loved loved and I repeat I loved the anime so much. I wake up on midnight my timing to watch the latest episode. Why you\'d ask ? The anime had everything. An amazing blend of Comedy,Romance,and Superpowers. More over, it\'s very fun to watch because the jokes are too original and has some sort of men humour and also some jokes only women wouldunderstand.Overall: 8If you were to criticize an anime too much, you\'d never be able to enjoy any ... Just go with the flow, it\'s an anime you won\'t regret having a look.

In this world a popular spot to travel and gain high status is by entering and conquering levels within a dungeon. This dungeon contains an assortment of monsters where adventurers, which are the people that embark in these quests into the dungeon, go to defeat these creatures to gain access to their droppings, which in this case are shards. These shards are used to craft magical items and weapons, and can also be exchanged for currency. Some of the residents of Orario join Familias, which are clans ruled by...a diety. The adventurers are ranked by a letter level system, which allows them to gain experience, therefore becoming stronger and gaining new abilities.Sort of sounds like a RPG, but in this case, it’s their real life.PLOT: The story revolves around a young boy of the name, Bell Cranel. Unlike the rest of the citizens of Orario, this boy comes with a unique set of skills that are later unlocked as the plot progresses. He is the only member of the Familia Hestia, as a result, he has to work harder when questing in the dungeon. After an incident in the dungeon, a world known adventurer of the name, Aiz Wallenstein, has to come save Bell. After being saved by Aiz, he falls in love with her and vows to become as strong or stronger than her, so that he may be the one to save his loved ones.The plot mainly revolves around the aspects of maturity, strength, integrity, and passion. With Bell never wanting to give up and setting aside his failures and embarrassments, he makes new friends that join him along his adventure to have him seek the glory he so much deserves. Conquering dungeons and defeating monsters stronger than him, Bell creates a name for himself, as a result bringing fame and new enemies.ANIMATION & SOUND: The animation for DanMachi is superb. It is vibrant, colorful, friendly, and down right awesome. The music never lacks either! Every single scenario, whether goofy and fun, serious and passionate or a battle amongst adventurers and dungeon monsters, the original soundtrack and fluidity of the animation make it come to life.CHARACTERS: DanMachi comes with a set of generic and unique characters and personalities.I may find it difficult not to like Bell, but he sometimes can get on your nerves. I blame the naïve tendency the author chose for him, aside from that he is marvelous main character. It might have taken some time to show his true potential, but believe me when I say that it is worth the wait! There is also Hestia, a loli Goddess with the body of a grown woman! While being a sight for sore eyes, Hestia is an energetic and amazingly kind and supporting Goddess to her Familia. She takes up the role of supporter within a few episodes and it makes her relatable to real life situtaions, but despite being mature and dependable, she is also a jealous and somewhat lazy Goddess. Her love for Bell makes it a fun and friendly venture through this series. Welf Crozzo is a straight-forward and honest person. Lili has a double personality where one shows off despising herself and the other is cheerful and positive. Aiz is caring and supportive. So a unique cast in certain, but generic in aspects of, “we have seen this before”.Don’t worry, it hardly disturbs the progression of the plot and character development. This might be me, nitpicking.CONS: I have very few problems with this anime in general, but with this being a review, I must not be biased and address the issues I had when watching it. I felt some of the battle scenes could have a dragged an extra episode. Towards the end where Bell and company are fighting against the level 5 dungeon monster that appeared on the 18th floor, it seemed too rushed and the montage of still-framed battle scenes took away from the emotional rush I had felt during Bell’s battle against the altered minotaur and the level 5 monstrosity. I also didn’t like Bell’s childish approach to the females’ affection towards him. I wish he had more of a confident personality and took advantage of openings, because at this moment, sure he is in love with Aiz, but I felt that there could have been a change in affection and he would have gained new feelings for other female characters, due to the lack of interaction between he and Aiz.OVERALL: I will give this anime an 8/10. This anime gave me a lot of excitement. It had me wishing the week we go by because it would always leave you in a nice cliffhanger. The character development and plot worked smoothly with each other and backed themselves up, never leading us to a dead end. It never dragged and keep it’s momentum at an all time high. It ended how it started, amazing.Check out my channel for the same review, but with added scenes and music from the anime. :]www.youtube.com/projektbaka a diety.

After an incident in the dungeon, a world known adventurer of the name, Aiz Wallenstein, has to come save Bell. After being saved by Aiz, he falls in love with her and vows to become as strong or stronger than her, so that he may be the one to save his loved ones.The plot mainly revolves around the aspects of maturity, strength, integrity, and passion. With Bell never wanting to give up and setting aside his failures and embarrassments, he makes new friends that join him along his adventure to have him seek the glory he so much deserves. Conquering dungeons and defeating monsters stronger than him, Bell creates a name for himself, as a result bringing fame and new enemies.ANIMATION & SOUND: The animation for DanMachi is superb. It is vibrant, colorful, friendly, and down right awesome. The music never lacks either! Every single scenario, whether goofy and fun, serious and passionate or a battle amongst adventurers and dungeon monsters, the original soundtrack and fluidity of the animation make it come to life.CHARACTERS: DanMachi comes with a set of generic and unique characters and personalities.I may find it difficult not to like Bell, but he sometimes can get on your nerves. I blame the naïve tendency the author chose for him, aside from that he is marvelous main character. It might have taken some time to show his true potential, but believe me when I say that it is worth the wait! There is also Hestia, a loli Goddess with the body of a grown woman! While being a sight for sore eyes, Hestia is an energetic and amazingly kind and supporting Goddess to her Familia. She takes up the role of supporter within a few episodes and it makes her relatable to real life situtaions, but despite being mature and dependable, she is also a jealous and somewhat lazy Goddess. Her love for Bell makes it a fun and friendly venture through this series. Welf Crozzo is a straight-forward and honest person. Lili has a double personality where one shows off despising herself and the other is cheerful and positive. Aiz is caring and supportive. So a unique cast in certain, but generic in aspects of, “we have seen this before”.Don’t worry, it hardly disturbs the progression of the plot and character development. This might be me, nitpicking.CONS: I have very few problems with this anime in general, but with this being a review, I must not be biased and address the issues I had when watching it. I felt some of the battle scenes could have a dragged an extra episode. Towards the end where Bell and company are fighting against the level 5 dungeon monster that appeared on the 18th floor, it seemed too rushed and the montage of still-framed battle scenes took away from the emotional rush I had felt during Bell’s battle against the altered minotaur and the level 5 monstrosity. I also didn’t like Bell’s childish approach to the females’ affection towards him. I wish he had more of a confident personality and took advantage of openings, because at this moment, sure he is in love with Aiz, but I felt that there could have been a change in affection and he would have gained new feelings for other female characters, due to the lack of interaction between he and Aiz.OVERALL: I will give this anime an 8/10. This anime gave me a lot of excitement. It had me wishing the week we go by because it would always leave you in a nice cliffhanger. The character development and plot worked smoothly with each other and backed themselves up, never leading us to a dead end. It never dragged and keep it’s momentum at an all time high. It ended how it started, amazing.Check out my channel for the same review, but with added scenes and music from the anime. :]www.youtube.com/projektbaka', 'Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? is the most misleading title in anime I\'ve ever seen, and it sure was, because, with that tile, it seemed that it would be some harem/fan service show were our main character saves girls, they fall for him ans throw their boobs at his face because why not.Well, I was 50% right at the harem/fan service part, although it is pretty different from the general harem as it was more of ""I like him because of what he does and his noble intentions"" and that\'s all, no lusty feelings (except for the ""villain"" of...the series), but absolutely wrong about the main character, Bell, saving girls. In fact, the first thing we see is an amazing swordswoman kicking the ass of a minotaur in order to save Bell.The series is set in a world where gods and goddesses descent from heavens to join humans, giving up their divine powers and establishing ""familias"", guilds in which  adventurers join and receive the blessing of the god or goddess of that familia. Bell is part of the Hestia familia, which is one of the poorest of all, as he is the only member of that guild and the "" headquarters"" is just an old, tiny church.The characters were the best part of the series. Bell is far more interesting than other characters, as his motivations are more human and feel natural. Besides, his powers actually have some kind of explanation, ome that goes along with the setting. And his relationship with Hestia is amazing! And yes, she\'s the boobilicious character that has appeared everywhere, but, to my surprise, that disn\'t define her character. The fan service was not a main part of the story, and that let Hestia and other girls feel like interesting characters with stories behind them, being two examples Liliruca and Ryu.The animation was impressively good, being solid throughout the series.

In fact it wasn\'t him who picked up them girls, rather it\'s the other way around, we saw Hestia making him her first Familia member,  we saw Liliruca who tricked her way to the MC guy\'s heart, Ryu Lion wasn\'t even part of the MC guy\'s harem, the MC guy\'s moment with  Aiz Wallenstein, for the most part occurred outside of the dungeon and so on and so forth, so the story category of this anime.......(up) was so poor in almost everything that for the most part it relies a lot from the MC guy\'s relationship with his sponsor, Hestia.

As to Aiz  Wallenstein, I just can\'t figure out as to why her character prevents her from competing for the MC guy\'s affection, it was such as waste that she wasn\'t in the last episode that would have added to the anime\'s action genre, also it was quite odd that her character was suppose to be with the MC guy, but instead the MC guy was made to have a loli romance and I\'m referring to Hestia and Lili whom is the only one competing for the MC guy\'s affection. Let\'s not forget the other female character\'s like, Eina Tulle, Syr Flover and  Ryu Lion who were suppose to be the MC guy\'s harem members but were not, pretty much they\'re more of an ambiguity than anything else, so pretty much the character category is as poor as poor.

PEACE!', 'I just had to add a review because of how much hate this show has gotten.First a brief non-spoiler synopsis.  Gods (from several mythologies) basically have given up their powers and come to live among mortals.  Each god can form a ""familia"" (read: gang/guild).  The world is presented as a town with a multi-floor dungeon attached.  Character and enemy abilities are presented as if this were a video game, however the world is NOT set in a video game.  The story follows a boy who joins (and is the only member of) the familia of the goddess Hestia.  The...goddess is in love with him, although he kind of just ignores that fact.  The story is about the boy getting a remarkable skill *exp plus/Super growth* after he gets saved from a near-death encounter with an OOP monster in the dungeon.  From then you watch him grow and try to make it through the dungeon while being sabotaged by *parties you will learn about*.I will keep this short.  It\'s an enjoyable show.  The characters are fun to watch.  The world is interesting (although not fully explored) and you keep wanting to learn more about it.  The main is pretty standard (gentleman, earnest, shy with his feelings, wants to get stronger), and that doesn\'t bother me.  Several of the battle scenes are drawn very well.  The comedy is light hearted and sometimes slightly perverted.  There are obvious fan service shots, but not nearly as heavy as an ecchi show might be.  Plus the main is pure/innocent so the show never gets lewd.All in all it\'s just fun!  Do you like to see a new world get explored?  A main character grow and meet interesting characters along the way?  Well animated action?  If so, just watch this show!  Ignore all the haters.Given I\'m a huge gamer so that might influence how much I enjoyed the show. goddess is in love with him, although he kind of just ignores that fact.

Ignore all the haters.Given I\'m a huge gamer so that might influence how much I enjoyed the show.', 'Danmachi (not typing out the show’s title) was a show that frustrated me.  There are the seeds of something good in this show, but unfortunately, it falls into a bad pattern of pandering and bad characterization that left me pretty cold after a few episodes once I got a better feel with what the show was going to be.I took a shot on this one, as I watched a couple fantasy anime and this popped up on my recommended list and showed a decently high rating.  To be fair, this show isn’t the worst in this genre that I’ve seen, and there are...some good points.The art and color is pleasing.  Danmachi has a pretty nice art style.  Some of the animations and facial expressions of certain characters aren’t the best, but in general, the quality is serviceable.  Many of the battle sequences are pretty exciting and well done enough to be entertaining to watch.  I think that the sound and voice acting is on par with the average show too, and doesn’t feel out of place.The world itself and the town feel like a decent roleplaying setting, perhaps something out of a pen and paper roleplaying game world, and you can get the feel of what they’re trying to accomplish here.  There’s a good amount of material that could have been expanded on to make the viewers more involved, and is one of many huge missed opportunities, of which there are many.Danmachi has a lot of problems, most of which have to do with the issue of shallowness in all aspects that need to be fleshed out to make a show good.The biggest failing is the world building.  Danmachi takes a lot of shortcuts and just expects the viewers to take for granted what’s going on in the world, as not much about it is actually explained.  Some of the fogginess may be planned to be explained in a season two, or with reference to the light novel, but really, not explaining more about the world early on doesn’t give any context for character motivations.  Why be an adventurer?  What’s the allure?  What the hell is the tower for, what are the gods doing and why are they involved with adventurers at all?  Is this the only part of the world where adventurers can ply their trade, where do all the fantasy races come from, etc.  The show just expects you to accept all as presented without much hint to how the world works, and in a fantasy setting, understanding these things is important.Another big failing is the characters.  The biggest problem with most of the characters in this show is that they are poorly developed and in many cases, their motivations are not easy to follow given what’s going on.  Again, most of this could probably be resolved by providing more context.It’s hard to dig too deep on the character failings without spoiling things, but the main protagonist Bell is about the perfect example of a Gary Stu as I’ve ever seen.  I have an extremely hard time with this character because his plot armor is so ridiculous that nothing feels desperate or urgent, even if that’s what the action is implying.  At no time watching this show do you feel that he is in serious danger, or won’t pull something out of his ass at the last minute, and that’s preposterous with what’s actually going in front of you.  There were a few scenes where the deus ex machina is so ridiculous that I rolled my eyes.  Or the love interest saves him, for some bizarre reason that I can’t fathom, more on her below.  I also understand very little of his motivation or background as it is very limited.  He seems like an inoffensive self insert protagonist that every girl drools over just because.  While he does work hard in the dungeon, as I mentioned, nothing ever feels urgent, and his rapid progression plot point feels like a huge cop out as it diminishes his hard work and cheapens the character quite a bit.Other characters beyond the MC aren’t written much better.  The main love interest that the MC is pining after is about as wooden a character as I’ve ever seen.  I get that they’ve written her to be a super powerful, stoic beauty archetype, but you expect there to be some hidden depth that you get a glimpse of here and there that may spark the MC’s interest, but aside from looking like a blonde-haired model, there’s nothing I can see to spur more than a passing interest in her.  I’m also unclear as to why she seems to want to be Bell’s guardian angel and pull his ass out of the fire.  It’s really hard to read anything from this character other than she’s this world’s all powerful sword master who takes down raid bosses by herself, which is a little ridiculous.The character that shows the most depth, oddly enough, is the fan-service poster girl of the show, Hestia.  She’s a little too attached to the MC, her chest is bouncing all over the place and she’s a little too much of a clingy jealous girl cliché, but you actually get to understand more about her motivations and character than just about any other character.  She’ll actually make some sacrifices so her charge can go out and try to impress the stoic girl without a personality.  Her motivations are a little silly, as the MC doesn’t do much that I think would warrant affection from her, but you understand that she’s got her reasons.  Beyond the pandering, she’s seems to be the most sympathetic character in the show, and the one that I felt was actually the most heroic oddly enough.  While I don’t think doting on the MC is worth her time, I understand why she’s doing it way more than I understand why any of the other characters are acting the way they are.To wrap it up, it’s a show that passes on the technical and does provide moments of entertainment, but it’s really hard to like and enjoy the characters as they are written pretty poorly and there’s no real adversity that ever feels dire.  The world itself is hard to get into as they don’t explain much of anything, and you’re really left wondering why anyone is doing what they’re doing.  If you’re bored and like fantasy shows, you could do worse than Danmachi, but I don’t think this show should be scored as high as it is, as there is a lot that needed improvement. some good points.The art and color is pleasing.

It also has no problem being a shameless representation of what light novels are all about; not limited to the ridiculously long titles other books would use as the synopsis in the back cover. So yeah, what do otakus want today? Videogames? Ok. Lolis and tits? Fine. Some generic fantasy land with a generic main character, who is otherwise special? Sure. Just take a big marker and draw a fat vertical line in...the checklist of clichés without bothering to verify anything, for Danmachi doesn’t try to exclude anything, or include anything more.So why the hell am I even reviewing this thing if it’s so bland and mediocre? If it’s the way I describe it, then nobody will care about it and it would go unnoticed. OH I WISH THAT WAS THE CASE but it isn’t. Danmachi happens to be by far the most popular title of the season it came out. Not even the Fate / Stay Night hype was anywhere near the amount of attention this one got out of nowhere. And it won’t fade away from memory any time soon either, thanks to the obsessive nature of anime fans. For you see, all it takes for them to get excited, is to find a single thing that visually stands out. If they do, there is no end to what they will do with it. In Danmachi’s case, that would be a ribbon. Yes, you heard me, a ribbon. Just place it under your boobs and VOILA LET’S HAVE A QUATRILLION COSPLAYS ABOUT IT.And thus came the plague of the endless Hestia cosplayers, who couldn’t stop dressing like her, or drawing her simplistic design, consisting of just a single colored white dress with a blue ribbon under her boobs. How the devil does that make her remotely interesting? Because she is a loli with huge breasts, skintight clothes that easily make her boobs and panties show, she has epic level powers to undo all damages, is obedient to the main character, lives with him in the same room, massages his body, hugs him as they sleep together, while being poor and frail, and needs someone to protect her! SHE IS MY WAIFU! COME HERE BRESTIA!But come on, there has to be more to the character than that, right? I mean, she is a goddess for crying out loud, and there is a whole world of magic, deities, and dungeons out there. Isn’t she part of a much bigger scheme or something? … Yes, you are right, she is. She is a different incarnation of Asuna, the protagonist is another Kirito, the world is another Sword Art Online, and of course both stories are based on light novels. So as you see, Danmachi is a spin-off of one of the most famous anime of all times, that otakus consider a masterpiece. Thus all its fame is excused and well-earned.… Wait, no it’s not. Danmachi is no spin-off of SAO. They also have very superficial similarities. Oh, that’s right, the protagonist is voiced by the same actor who did Kirito. The otakus are right; Danmachi is SAO! Also, just like all successful light novels such as SAO, it is full of interesting ideas, presented in the most basic way and never elaborated, so the fans can imagine any crap they like about them. The more specific the world becomes, the more solid it feels, which is exactly what we do not want from our power fantasies. We want them to be vague, so they will always bend to how we like them to be at any given moment.This is also why our protagonist is so bland. We need to imagine him being as we are; the more personality he has, the harder it is to self-insert and believe we are him, as he goes around collecting harem girls. Because that is what we wish our lives were like; being loved by all the girls, even if we have no personality. But we also need to be able to win them somehow, and that is why we need a power no other man can possess. In the case of Bell, the hero of Danmachi, it’s a skill that makes him level up a trillion times faster than anyone else, and the ability to fuel his special attacks with the power of waifu love, so he can win against any opponent, regardless of how powerful he is. Sounds broken and unfair for everyone else, and also boring because you know the protagonist will always triumph by using asspulls? Yes, but who gives a crap if it makes you win all the time and get all the wet pussycats without having a personality?I could spend a few paragraphs describing other characters, events, and areas, but I see no point in doing that, since they do not deserve it. Nobody else matters beyond the special blandness that is Bell, all other girls cover different fetishes but are otherwise no more interesting than Brestia, and all events follow the exact same pattern of being resolved with asspulls, regardless of their set-up or level of threat. The amount of thought put into the script, is one tenth of what I’ve spent in writing this review.I could spend some digital ink in talking about the production values, but I also see no point in doing that if the actual show is so painfully uninteresting. No amount of pretty colors and nice sounds can make up for a crappy script or a stereotypical roster of meh characters. It’s ok looking and sounding if that is what you only care about in your power fantasies. But that is all it is.Now go back to spending 30 seconds drawing Brestia and her boob ribbon. Do it while it’s still somewhat relevant. By the time the second season came out, most of the hype was gone, because the otakus jumped ship to some other generic power fantasy. Danmachi got lucky by coming out during a season that had nothing else to derp about, but once other derp things existed during the sequel, Brestia and her ribbon were already used toilet paper. She’s now a mostly dusty dakimakura, abandoned on a moisty basement after getting smeared with a gallon of otaku semen. It’s left there, as an exhibit of a time when anime fans had nothing better to do besides crossdressing as a loli with a blue ribbon under their fake boobs. the checklist of clichés without bothering to verify anything, for Danmachi doesn’t try to exclude anything, or include anything more.So why the hell am I even reviewing this thing if it’s so bland and mediocre? If it’s the way I describe it, then nobody will care about it and it would go unnoticed. OH I WISH THAT WAS THE CASE but it isn’t. Danmachi happens to be by far the most popular title of the season it came out. Not even the Fate / Stay Night hype was anywhere near the amount of attention this one got out of nowhere. And it won’t fade away from memory any time soon either, thanks to the obsessive nature of anime fans. For you see, all it takes for them to get excited, is to find a single thing that visually stands out. If they do, there is no end to what they will do with it. In Danmachi’s case, that would be a ribbon. Yes, you heard me, a ribbon. Just place it under your boobs and VOILA LET’S HAVE A QUATRILLION COSPLAYS ABOUT IT.And thus came the plague of the endless Hestia cosplayers, who couldn’t stop dressing like her, or drawing her simplistic design, consisting of just a single colored white dress with a blue ribbon under her boobs. How the devil does that make her remotely interesting? Because she is a loli with huge breasts, skintight clothes that easily make her boobs and panties show, she has epic level powers to undo all damages, is obedient to the main character, lives with him in the same room, massages his body, hugs him as they sleep together, while being poor and frail, and needs someone to protect her! SHE IS MY WAIFU! COME HERE BRESTIA!But come on, there has to be more to the character than that, right? I mean, she is a goddess for crying out loud, and there is a whole world of magic, deities, and dungeons out there. Isn’t she part of a much bigger scheme or something? … Yes, you are right, she is. She is a different incarnation of Asuna, the protagonist is another Kirito, the world is another Sword Art Online, and of course both stories are based on light novels. So as you see, Danmachi is a spin-off of one of the most famous anime of all times, that otakus consider a masterpiece. Thus all its fame is excused and well-earned.… Wait, no it’s not. Danmachi is no spin-off of SAO. They also have very superficial similarities. Oh, that’s right, the protagonist is voiced by the same actor who did Kirito. The otakus are right; Danmachi is SAO! Also, just like all successful light novels such as SAO, it is full of interesting ideas, presented in the most basic way and never elaborated, so the fans can imagine any crap they like about them. The more specific the world becomes, the more solid it feels, which is exactly what we do not want from our power fantasies. We want them to be vague, so they will always bend to how we like them to be at any given moment.This is also why our protagonist is so bland. We need to imagine him being as we are; the more personality he has, the harder it is to self-insert and believe we are him, as he goes around collecting harem girls. Because that is what we wish our lives were like; being loved by all the girls, even if we have no personality. But we also need to be able to win them somehow, and that is why we need a power no other man can possess. In the case of Bell, the hero of Danmachi, it’s a skill that makes him level up a trillion times faster than anyone else, and the ability to fuel his special attacks with the power of waifu love, so he can win against any opponent, regardless of how powerful he is. Sounds broken and unfair for everyone else, and also boring because you know the protagonist will always triumph by using asspulls? Yes, but who gives a crap if it makes you win all the time and get all the wet pussycats without having a personality?I could spend a few paragraphs describing other characters, events, and areas, but I see no point in doing that, since they do not deserve it. Nobody else matters beyond the special blandness that is Bell, all other girls cover different fetishes but are otherwise no more interesting than Brestia, and all events follow the exact same pattern of being resolved with asspulls, regardless of their set-up or level of threat. The amount of thought put into the script, is one tenth of what I’ve spent in writing this review.I could spend some digital ink in talking about the production values, but I also see no point in doing that if the actual show is so painfully uninteresting. No amount of pretty colors and nice sounds can make up for a crappy script or a stereotypical roster of meh characters. It’s ok looking and sounding if that is what you only care about in your power fantasies. But that is all it is.Now go back to spending 30 seconds drawing Brestia and her boob ribbon. Do it while it’s still somewhat relevant. By the time the second season came out, most of the hype was gone, because the otakus jumped ship to some other generic power fantasy. Danmachi got lucky by coming out during a season that had nothing else to derp about, but once other derp things existed during the sequel, Brestia and her ribbon were already used toilet paper.

I honestly don't get the amount of hate for this anime. It doesn't claim to be something very unique or groundbreaking, nor does it attempt to be. So rating it low just because you wanted it to be something it is not, when it never claimed to to be that, is absurd.It's a fantasy action adventure comedy with fanservice, and it does its job well in that department. Sure, it has a cliché good guy main character, and most characters are clichés as well, but that...doesn't necessarily make it a bad anime.The story is decent and the pacing of the series is good. The animation is good and the music is okay. The sense of being in a fantasy MMORPG world is its main unique selling point for me. The journey of the main character and how he discovers himself while making allies and friends along the way is what I like about the anime.If you're looking for a serious thought provoking anime, you're looking in the wrong place.

To try and make it seem like DanMachi is doing something original with the players getting trapped in a video game premise, because for all intents and purposes, the real world IS the video game. Granted, it is fairly interesting seeing simple gaming terms such as leveling up and skills being name dropped in a setting that isn\'t actually a video game, but it...still doesn\'t make it any more original. I really do like the setting though. It isn\'t that much more special than your typical anime fantasy setting, but it coincides well with other plot points such as the gods and goddesses.The actual plot is about as simple as you can get. Our main character, Bell Cranel, wants to become a hero and get stronger so a girl who was much stronger than him at ep 1 will respect and fall in love with him. No seriously, that\'s it. You really can\'t get much more of a paper thin plot than that.The characters are actually worse off than the story if you can believe it. Bell Cranel has many noticeable character flaws, but to his credit, there are some things done to alleviate a few of his problems. Even though he is extremely overpowered after a while, and a bunch of stupid powerful skills and weapons get asspulled out of nowhere to make him ever more powerful, the simple fact that he starts off with basically nothing makes him a little better off. He and his goddess, Hestia, have little to nothing, and his determination to get off the ground and get stronger makes the whole ""become a hero"" plot thing have more humility and humbleness. Unfortunately, there isn\'t really anything to alleviate his massive case of harem syndrome, where almost every single female (keep in mind most of the cast is female, probably to drive home this sole fact) has at least a crush on him. It\'s silly and unrealistic, but there isn\'t much you can do with a harem to begin with, so I won\'t harp on it too much.Hestia was the talk of the town in the anime community for a while with her character design. Apparently combining big boobs with the loli stature and a boob ribbon makes for a riveting character. She does get some decent development early on with her earnest dedication to help Bell as much as she can, but loses lots of screentime after the halfway point, making her character feel fairly insignificant as time goes on.Other than that, there is an incredibly large cast of characters, and many of them have little to nothing other than their standard sole character trait, but I\'ll quickly explain my thoughts on some of the more prominent ones.I think they went too far with Lili to the point where I couldn\'t reason with her actions even though they were explained. I get her lack of trust, but it doesn\'t make sense to me that she would still try to actively hurt Bell after how honest Bell was (Bell was stupid about the situation too, but it kind of comes with the territory with characters of his nature).Welf\'s whole thing with magic weapons didn\'t really make sense.Quiet characters can make some of the best characters if written well, and Aiz wasn\'t interesting. She was just plain boring. Ryu was a little better off, but not by much.For the most part, the art looks like typical J.C. Staff fare. That\'s not really a bad thing, it just has that very soft and faint look that a lot of there shows have. The animation definitely has it\'s high points though. There weren\'t many, but there were a couple of fight scenes were really well choreographed with great use of camera work. Bell\'s fight with a minotaur was easily the best part of the whole series because it not only utilized those elements well, it also created perfect tension.

Spoilers ahead!)I think it is pretty typical for people to have a role model. It might be someone who is always around us, like a family member or a close friend. Or it might be a celebrity or athlete who, while not having direct impact on another’s life, manages to affect countless others by simply being. For me, it is my father. He provides for his family, he works extremely hard, and he always, always wants only the best for his kids. Something simple he does that I hope to replicate is, during Christmas (we call him...Mr. Christmas because he gets so into it), he wraps the base of the trees around his house with green lights and the branches wrapped in red and white ones, so that they become trees of lights rather than simply trees with lights. He is someone I will never fail to look up to, and will always aspire to be. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? is actually a rhetorical question, with it instead focusing on this kind of inspiration, providing its audience with a less than stellar anime.STORYDungeon (the shortening of choice from here-on-out) stars Bell Cranel who has just recently been recruited into the goddess Hestia’s “Familia.” One day, he is saved by Aiz Wallenstein, a legendary woman both in beauty and swordsmanship, which inspires Bell to become someone of her caliber.The show finds some success in its theme on inspiration through the use of role models. Here, in Dungeon, people look up to (or down on) others as a means to assess their own prowess because the benchmarks for what is strong and weak are defined by the people partaking in the tower runs, arena battles, and tavern visits. So the anime depicts these kinds of scenarios to demonstrate how someone becomes better due to the way another acts or carries themself. Bell looks up to Aiz, so the latter goes about training the former; after witnessing Bell’s impressive abilities, members of a guild push themselves harder; and Hestia, seeing her precious family member work so fervently, causes her to do the same, laboring herself to support him. At the same time, the anime also looks at the darker side of inspiration, namely obsession and revenge. Half the reason why the events of the anime take place are due to outside influences caused by a being who, for better or worse, is infatuated with the young lad. In other words, she is so taken by him, so inspired by whom he is and what he can do, it causes her to unleash a rampaging goliath and an extraordinary Minotaur that disrupts the everyday flow. There are also segments where Bell becomes the target of undue hate, turning into a kind of anti-role model. In these moments, people become inspired to conspire against him because of his trustworthiness and status where they trap him with monsters and kidnap Hestia, respectively. Inspiration is normally good, but can often times be used for bad intentions, with the anime covering both handily enough.Dungeon begins to suffer when one looks beyond the theme that is woven throughout. Most notably is the anime’s complete lack of world-building. There are many aspects to the world that are presented: a leveling system, magical spells, a huge tower for questing, a banking system, armors, weapons, varying classes, special abilities, diverse races, a political game of godly proportions, etc. Yet nothing within this list is properly explained despite the anime relying on such facets time and again. Not taking steps to flesh out the setting – especially one steeped in fantasy and fiction – makes it unnecessarily difficult for the audience to be engrossed by the show that needs to make its world distinct and, to an extent, understandable.There is also a glaring issue with the anime’s attempt at a harem. Now, a harem is, like any “story-telling” element, not automatically a negative so long as the execution of it is noticeable. In Dungeon, the harem aspect serves little purpose outside of detracting from the narrative and its goals. One major problem associated with the harem is how it reduces the authenticity of the “romance” being established between Aiz and Bell. It is clear through the anime’s events that these two are the staple couple, so when more and more women are added to the mix, the most important relationship is weakened. The harem also does not influence what happens at large; besides being used for the same jealousy joke, this aspect of the anime does not affect the fighting that occurs or the direction of the plot. A possible reasoning for having the harem in the first place is because it would seem to follow its own theme of role models. That is, the women look to Bell as someone worth striving for. Unfortunately this has more to do with affection rather than inspiration, since the girls are not necessarily looking to be like him but rather be with him.Overall, the theme of inspiration is explored nicely enough but the lack of proper world-building and the misused harem bring the entire package down.ANIMATIONAs if to continue with the anime’s difficulty in crafting a believable world, Dungeon missteps once more when it comes to its art. Again, the problem is foregoing “explanation,” or in this case variety. The dungeon-tower that is investigated daily starts to blend together after a certain point with the same, boring rock formations and color palates. The main city is no different; outside of the bank and the tavern, very little of the area is explored besides what is seen in an intercity scuffle. The most prominent location is Bell and Hestia’s home, but even there it is a bed and a table only.Dungeon does manage to do well with its fight choreography, showcasing easy-to-follow battles and a plethora of combinations between many of the different characters. The character designs are likewise well-composed, with Bell looking like the innocent boy he is portrayed as being and Ryu’s elven robes signifying her beauty both of body and swordsmanship.Actual animation also manages to remain above average throughout the season. Facial expressions are quite detailed, as are the movements of the characters both inside and outside of the battlefield. Bell’s fight with the Minotaur was particularly impressive in this regard.CHARACTERSOne of Dungeon’s biggest problems is not setting up an appropriate antagonist. The person poised to take this role was Freya, the woman scarily obsessed with Bell, but not only is she never looked at in-depth after her introduction but she is so far away from the happenings – she uses pawns and tricks to do her bidding – that the anime makes it inherently impossible to develop or at the very minimum characterize who she is. By not having an antagonist, it confuses the audience about what Bell is fighting for and, more relevant, who he is fighting against. In this scenario, it becomes “Bell versus the world” which introduces even more faults. As has been established, the world of Dungeon is not provided, meaning making it the main adversary is silly since, like Freya, nothing about it is known. Along the same lines, this kind of thinking does not fit with the show’s theme on inspiration. The setting might be seen as something that inspires people to fight for or protect it but Bell is never depicted as doing this. Instead, he is more concerned about the other inspirations in his life, with the world being more or less an afterthought.Arguably the strongest character of the anime is Liliruca. A young, cat-like girl of small proportions, she had grown up to despise the humans that wronged her. Similar to her fake ears, she would come to establish a façade that hid her vile behavior behind the kindness and sweetness she regularly dished out. She would steal, she would lie, and she would deceive anyone around her to get her way, even Bell, the first human to show her the empathy she needed. This should not be taken lightly; he was not exempt from her antics because, as it was shown, it was a deeply-rooted issue that manifested in her past and continued into the present, which made her conclude that the future would likely hold the same outcome. It is not until she completely betrays Bell, is left to die by her other harassers, and is eventually saved (both physically and mentally) by the boy who she wronged for so long, that she breaks down hard. She bawls, weeping over the terrible actions she took and crying from finally finding someone who truly cared for her. Seeing her move from despondency to elation, from child to adult, due to the inspiration she received from Bell was wonderful to witness, making her the best character of the show.The rest of the cast is, unfortunately, placed on a lower tier. Welf is given an episode of his own, but like a lot of the cast members, there is little given about him as well as no development to speak of. Aiz falls under the same troubles; besides her exceptional battle prowess and emotionless nature, the anime spends no time on her actual person, which is odd considering how much of an inspiration she is to Bell. Speaking of the main lead, Bell sits slightly higher character-wise, but not by much. Initially, he is perceived as a coward, as someone who cannot help himself. It is this ridicule from others that sparks him to become better. Not as a person but as fighter because the rest of the anime has his stats leveling up as opposed to his actual self. He has hardships in the form of fights but he remains the same, happy-go-lucky Bell from start to finish.There does exist some symbolism that reflects the characters – Bell has “firebolt” to match his fiery passion; Welf’s “will-o-wisp” ability, that stops enemy spells, coincides with his refusal to work on his own craft; and Liliruca can morph into a bunny like how she use to “morph” her outward self – but it is not enough to make up for the lack of execution that nearly every character faces.SOUNDDungeon’s opening theme starts off alright but quickly devolves into a less-than-stellar track. The vocalist does not seem to have the power to back the song, with the actual music being produced going every which way in terms of beat and tone. The background singers do not help either; they are more annoying than supportive, detracting the listener from actually being able to hear the piece. The ending theme, on the other hand, is nice due to the slow build-up, resounding trumpets, and catchiness that it incorporates. It is a fun piece that captures the (usually) up-beat nature of the anime.The rest of the soundtrack is par for the course. Nothing is immediately noteworthy, with most of the pieces fitting the atmosphere in place. That is, many of the tracks use flutes, guitars, and pipes to give it that adventurous and slice-of-life feel. There are also standard piano pieces for the sad times and triumphant, adrenaline-filled pieces for those fighting moments. It is an okay OST overall that performs at an appropriate level.Voice acting for Dungeon is somewhere above average. A special shout-out is deserved for Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Bell for his on-point screaming.ENJOYMENTAlthough I criticized the anime for having a harem where none was needed, I still liked that aspect. As a romance aficionado, watching as all of the women blushed or fought over Bell was usually enough to make me happy. However, I would have liked to have seen more progress between him and Aiz since it felt like their relationship was tossed on the wayside despite the general importance of it.I was actually a fan of Hestia as well, boob-string and all. She was pretty much there for comic-relief, what with her silly faces, overreactions, and protectiveness of her “child.” She, like the majority of the cast, did not add much beyond her superficial characteristics, but she was still fun to experience over the season.Beyond the harem and Hestia segments, there was not much else I found myself particularly liking. The battles were fine, except the final one; it seemed too all over the place with unexplained details, such as the weapons being used and the offhand comment about Bell being Zeus’s descendent. As for the other characters, I cannot say I was particularly fond of them, either. Many of them are attractive or funny but do not have the same impact that Hestia managed to bring about, so characters like Ryu or Aiz are cool but do not have enough surrounding them to make them worth remembering.While the show’s theme on inspiration is nice as are parts of the art it presents, there is not enough story- and character-wise to make the anime worthwhile. And while the harem aspect is fun it ultimately prevents the show from accomplishing what it set out to do. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? That is still a question up for debate. But at this point it is clear that, if anything, the anime needs to pick up the slack for any continuations.SUMMARYStory: Bad, theme of inspiration through role models is there, but the high focus on the harem and the low focus on the actual world hurt itAnimation: Good, boring art style, nice fight choreography, nice character designs, above average actual animationCharacters: Bad, Liliruca is good but the rest, from Bell to Welf to Aiz, cannot pull their own weightSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, Hestia and the harem antics were fun, but not much else wasFinal Score: 4/10 Mr. Christmas because he gets so into it), he wraps the base of the trees around his house with green lights and the branches wrapped in red and white ones, so that they become trees of lights rather than simply trees with lights.

Now, a harem is, like any “story-telling” element, not automatically a negative so long as the execution of it is noticeable. In Dungeon, the harem aspect serves little purpose outside of detracting from the narrative and its goals. One major problem associated with the harem is how it reduces the authenticity of the “romance” being established between Aiz and Bell. It is clear through the anime’s events that these two are the staple couple, so when more and more women are added to the mix, the most important relationship is weakened. The harem also does not influence what happens at large; besides being used for the same jealousy joke, this aspect of the anime does not affect the fighting that occurs or the direction of the plot. A possible reasoning for having the harem in the first place is because it would seem to follow its own theme of role models. That is, the women look to Bell as someone worth striving for. Unfortunately this has more to do with affection rather than inspiration, since the girls are not necessarily looking to be like him but rather be with him.Overall, the theme of inspiration is explored nicely enough but the lack of proper world-building and the misused harem bring the entire package down.ANIMATIONAs if to continue with the anime’s difficulty in crafting a believable world, Dungeon missteps once more when it comes to its art. Again, the problem is foregoing “explanation,” or in this case variety. The dungeon-tower that is investigated daily starts to blend together after a certain point with the same, boring rock formations and color palates. The main city is no different; outside of the bank and the tavern, very little of the area is explored besides what is seen in an intercity scuffle. The most prominent location is Bell and Hestia’s home, but even there it is a bed and a table only.Dungeon does manage to do well with its fight choreography, showcasing easy-to-follow battles and a plethora of combinations between many of the different characters. The character designs are likewise well-composed, with Bell looking like the innocent boy he is portrayed as being and Ryu’s elven robes signifying her beauty both of body and swordsmanship.Actual animation also manages to remain above average throughout the season. Facial expressions are quite detailed, as are the movements of the characters both inside and outside of the battlefield. Bell’s fight with the Minotaur was particularly impressive in this regard.CHARACTERSOne of Dungeon’s biggest problems is not setting up an appropriate antagonist. The person poised to take this role was Freya, the woman scarily obsessed with Bell, but not only is she never looked at in-depth after her introduction but she is so far away from the happenings – she uses pawns and tricks to do her bidding – that the anime makes it inherently impossible to develop or at the very minimum characterize who she is. By not having an antagonist, it confuses the audience about what Bell is fighting for and, more relevant, who he is fighting against. In this scenario, it becomes “Bell versus the world” which introduces even more faults. As has been established, the world of Dungeon is not provided, meaning making it the main adversary is silly since, like Freya, nothing about it is known. Along the same lines, this kind of thinking does not fit with the show’s theme on inspiration. The setting might be seen as something that inspires people to fight for or protect it but Bell is never depicted as doing this. Instead, he is more concerned about the other inspirations in his life, with the world being more or less an afterthought.Arguably the strongest character of the anime is Liliruca. A young, cat-like girl of small proportions, she had grown up to despise the humans that wronged her. Similar to her fake ears, she would come to establish a façade that hid her vile behavior behind the kindness and sweetness she regularly dished out. She would steal, she would lie, and she would deceive anyone around her to get her way, even Bell, the first human to show her the empathy she needed. This should not be taken lightly; he was not exempt from her antics because, as it was shown, it was a deeply-rooted issue that manifested in her past and continued into the present, which made her conclude that the future would likely hold the same outcome. It is not until she completely betrays Bell, is left to die by her other harassers, and is eventually saved (both physically and mentally) by the boy who she wronged for so long, that she breaks down hard. She bawls, weeping over the terrible actions she took and crying from finally finding someone who truly cared for her. Seeing her move from despondency to elation, from child to adult, due to the inspiration she received from Bell was wonderful to witness, making her the best character of the show.The rest of the cast is, unfortunately, placed on a lower tier. Welf is given an episode of his own, but like a lot of the cast members, there is little given about him as well as no development to speak of. Aiz falls under the same troubles; besides her exceptional battle prowess and emotionless nature, the anime spends no time on her actual person, which is odd considering how much of an inspiration she is to Bell. Speaking of the main lead, Bell sits slightly higher character-wise, but not by much. Initially, he is perceived as a coward, as someone who cannot help himself. It is this ridicule from others that sparks him to become better. Not as a person but as fighter because the rest of the anime has his stats leveling up as opposed to his actual self. He has hardships in the form of fights but he remains the same, happy-go-lucky Bell from start to finish.There does exist some symbolism that reflects the characters – Bell has “firebolt” to match his fiery passion; Welf’s “will-o-wisp” ability, that stops enemy spells, coincides with his refusal to work on his own craft; and Liliruca can morph into a bunny like how she use to “morph” her outward self – but it is not enough to make up for the lack of execution that nearly every character faces.SOUNDDungeon’s opening theme starts off alright but quickly devolves into a less-than-stellar track. The vocalist does not seem to have the power to back the song, with the actual music being produced going every which way in terms of beat and tone. The background singers do not help either; they are more annoying than supportive, detracting the listener from actually being able to hear the piece. The ending theme, on the other hand, is nice due to the slow build-up, resounding trumpets, and catchiness that it incorporates. It is a fun piece that captures the (usually) up-beat nature of the anime.The rest of the soundtrack is par for the course. Nothing is immediately noteworthy, with most of the pieces fitting the atmosphere in place. That is, many of the tracks use flutes, guitars, and pipes to give it that adventurous and slice-of-life feel. There are also standard piano pieces for the sad times and triumphant, adrenaline-filled pieces for those fighting moments. It is an okay OST overall that performs at an appropriate level.Voice acting for Dungeon is somewhere above average. A special shout-out is deserved for Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Bell for his on-point screaming.ENJOYMENTAlthough I criticized the anime for having a harem where none was needed, I still liked that aspect. As a romance aficionado, watching as all of the women blushed or fought over Bell was usually enough to make me happy. However, I would have liked to have seen more progress between him and Aiz since it felt like their relationship was tossed on the wayside despite the general importance of it.I was actually a fan of Hestia as well, boob-string and all. She was pretty much there for comic-relief, what with her silly faces, overreactions, and protectiveness of her “child.” She, like the majority of the cast, did not add much beyond her superficial characteristics, but she was still fun to experience over the season.Beyond the harem and Hestia segments, there was not much else I found myself particularly liking. The battles were fine, except the final one; it seemed too all over the place with unexplained details, such as the weapons being used and the offhand comment about Bell being Zeus’s descendent. As for the other characters, I cannot say I was particularly fond of them, either. Many of them are attractive or funny but do not have the same impact that Hestia managed to bring about, so characters like Ryu or Aiz are cool but do not have enough surrounding them to make them worth remembering.While the show’s theme on inspiration is nice as are parts of the art it presents, there is not enough story- and character-wise to make the anime worthwhile. And while the harem aspect is fun it ultimately prevents the show from accomplishing what it set out to do. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? That is still a question up for debate. But at this point it is clear that, if anything, the anime needs to pick up the slack for any continuations.SUMMARYStory: Bad, theme of inspiration through role models is there, but the high focus on the harem and the low focus on the actual world hurt itAnimation: Good, boring art style, nice fight choreography, nice character designs, above average actual animationCharacters: Bad, Liliruca is good but the rest, from Bell to Welf to Aiz, cannot pull their own weightSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, Hestia and the harem antics were fun, but not much else wasFinal Score: 4/10', ""If you've watched SAO, then you're wasting your time here. The level system is highly over-used and the story is nothing special. The art and sound are mediocre. There is a strong lack of character development (leveling up doesn't count). This, and MANY other cliches killed my enjoyment.Also, getting REALLY tired of hearing the same fucker voice every MC. "", 'DanMachi is a perfect example of a successful formula applied in a very unoffensive, reasonably executed, and acceptable style. This is not a series that pushes any boundaries, or tries any original techniques. It is just a good series to highlight the state of Anime in mid-2015. It\'s not going to be winning any awards, but you could certainly do much worse.- Story -The first term that comes to mind with DanMachi is ""formulaic."" Not in a bad way mind you. It is a fairly nice formula, employed fairly effectively. The story is interesting enough that you don\'t want to toss it. Sure, it\'s the...standard ""becoming a hero"" plot presented so blatantly that the series full on lampshades it. There\'s no suspense, and nothing to foreshadow. The hero is always the nice kid, he always has to overcome a challenge, and he always wins. The only real good thing to say here is that the story doesn\'t try to stick out. It takes you through the paces, shows you the scenes you would expect, when you would expect them, and then gets out of your way.- Characters -Fortunately the characters are a bit stronger. They are relatable enough that they don\'t feel artificial. Each of the main characters gets the obligatory story arc, with the obligatory story about how they are actually really good, but how they haven\'t been able to rise to their potential. All in all, they\'re fun little stories with satisfying resolutions. These certainly aren\'t the qualities of memorable characters, but they never really hit any sour notes either, which leaves a decently satisfying experience.- Art -The one area where the series stands out is the art. J.C.Staff was in good form with the art direction this time. The characters are unique and full of personality. Each certainly has their own style, and range of expressions. All the motions are really smooth and dynamic, and it\'s clear that a lot of work went into making them seem alive.I think they could have done with a bit less of the fan service, but I suppose it\'s to be expected with this ""RPG Game"" genre that\'s been popular lately. My only real complaint in this department would be the backgrounds.  There are a lot of boring caves and reused scenes for interiors. The few vistas the series treats us to are not particularly expansive or appealing. Fortunately these elements are played off in a way that puts the characters center stage, so I won\'t ding them too hard on it.- Sound -Another strong, arguably the strongest area, is the sound direction. The musical score marches the feel and direction of the anime very well, and the orchestral rendition through the entire series give it a nice, uplifting feel. The sound effects are also top notch. You can always expect to hear a fair bit of atmosphere, while the actual primary actions are always sharp, and never blur with the rest of the sound. The voices suit the characters, and the performances are very professional. Unfortunately given the somewhat shallow story you never get to see the actors put to the test, but I won\'t count off for that.- Overall -In all I think the series is fairly enjoyable. It\'s a nice series to watch if you have a few hours here and there, and you don\'t have anything more pressing to do. It won\'t load you up with heavy concepts and stories, and it won\'t be too cheesy that you turn away in disgust. Just a nice safe middle ground. There are even nods to other popular series interspersed throughout, and it\'s a fun challenge trying to recognize them. Give it a try if you simply want a light series for casual watching. Maybe watch it in between marathon sessions of deep, emotional, complex stuff to clear you palate. standard ""becoming a hero"" plot presented so blatantly that the series full on lampshades it.

I like that the character models are somewhat differentiated.Sound: 8 - I\'m not the best judge of this category, but the intro song is alright and the sound effects match the action well enough...that I suppose it deserves an 8/10.Story: 4 - Here\'s where the anime goes wrong. Just about everything that\'s done here is a clone of any number of other anime. There are many shots of a tower in the distance, but instead the story focuses on a dungeon, which goes down. Not very logical, now is it? The workings of this anime are similar to VRMMO-type anime, where there are levels and respawns and such, but it never explicitly tells you that they\'re in a VRMMO. Instead, they tend to take matters very seriously and present this as the real world, just with goddesses everywhere. They actually get some of the lore mixed up, as at first they were showing off some gods as goddesses (ex: Hephaestus), so I thought ""I guess they just wanted to be consistent,"" but then they introduced us to Hermes, a male god. This anime has a lot of missing backstory (why are there walls? Are there any other towns, etc.) and left a lot of things to be resolved in the second season, which I suppose is alright. Hopefully that season or an OVA or two will explain the story better. For right now, it just drops the viewer in, expecting them to understand everything that\'s going on.Characters: 4 - The characters in this anime are very cliche, they fulfill the typical harem roles, that is to say, one alpha and a dozen soulless betas. Other than a few main characters, and perhaps Ryuu, the characters have no personality. In fact, one of the characters (Aiz Wallenstein) is a clone of Mashiro Shiina from Sakurasou, just a pro fighter instead of a pro artist. The characters in this anime are one of its weakest, if not the weakest, point.Enjoyment: 8 - I like this anime. That is because I play games first, watch anime second. If you are not like me, then you will likely be annoyed this anime exists. There is sometimes too much fan service (such as bouncing boobs in the beginning of every episode), and there are quite a few cliches, but overall it\'s okay. I watched it in a marathon, and wouldn\'t mind seeing a season 2 to tie things up.Overall: 6.4 - Unoriginal ideas, but a few good points make this a decent show.

For the sake of being concise, I\'ll refer ""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"" to the popular alias -DanMachi"". Let\'s get in to it!STORY 6/10The story of ""DanMachi"" is set in a fantasy world in the town of Orario. Orario has several dungeons where brave adventurers go to gain glory and riches. There are several families which are led by gods/goddesses who have come down from the heavens to be with humans and interact with them. This is where our main characters, Bell and Hestia come in. The story is really about Bell\'s dream to...be stronger and a hero.Honestly, the story is pretty simple. Nothing fancy but it\'s good.ART 8/10The fantasy setting is animated beautifully and the animation is strongest in the fights . This is shown when the creatures are destroyed and the production studio has paid close attention to the textures and details so points there. The colors are bright and it adds onto the fun adventure feel to anime which is always great.Sound 8/10The opening is pretty good and has a fun vibe to it along with the ending. The OSTs are very well done in DanMachi. We hear casual fun OSTs with the comedic moments and laughs but the music in the fights are impressive. It has a dark and suspenseful tone to it with the viewer getting more tense alongside Bell and Hestia, especially in the last few episodes. The voice acting is amazing! Yoshitsugu Matsuoka voices Bell with a lot of skill and displays all sorts of emotions with him - happiness, shyness, excitement, frustration, fear and of course the humor. I love Bell\'s voice in the scenes with Aiz because Matsuoka does this hilarious yelp of embarrassment which will have you laughing like crazy. Another star voice actor is Inori Minase who voices Hestia. The tsundere and teasing romantic characteristics are captured perfectly with Minase\'s voice. Hestia has these moments of jealousy when she sees Bell with other girls and her voice absolutely shines in these moments where Minase expresses the emotions perfectly.CHARACTERS 9/10Bell Cranel is a 14-year old boy who has big dreams of being an adventurer. He\'s very shonen-esque but has very likable qualities to him. He was raised by his grandfather and has always seen excitement in life. In the beginning, we see he tries to join different families so that he can enter dungeons and finally be an adventurer. Unfortunately, every family he approaches quickly rejects him and sets him off with discouraging words. He struggles and he shows emotion of how hard it is to achieve these dreams. This is one of the wonderful things of Bell. He is very relatable. We see he is constantly underestimated and laughed at, making his dream to be a hero less achievable when no one believes in him. ENTER HESTIAHestia is a goddess who has the appearance of a pretty young girl. She has no followers in her family and is seen as a failure in the heavens. After she sees Bell, she notices the consistent rejection from each family and follows him. She grabs his attention and asks if he wants to join her family. This bond is very well done because of the similarities between the two characters but also their chemistry and incredible faith in each other. Hestia may seem like the typical fanservice type of girl at first but her energy and humor make her one of the shows strongest points. Despite being a goddess, she works very hard and stands against the discrimination to see Bell achieve his dream. She shows romantic affection and teases him throughout the series and it is very heartwarming to see the two in every scene.Liluca is a little girl who Bell defends in an alleyway after seeing her bullied by other adventurers. Both her parents were adventurers but were killed, leaving her alone to fend for herself in a world full of danger. She gets herself into trouble and relies on thievery in order to pay off debts and survive. Despite her efforts, she is constantly looked down upon and suffers physical and mental abuse from adventures, making her hate the idea of adventurers completely. Bell tries to help her and makes her a supporter with him in his dungeon adventures. However, Bell becomes a victim of her thievery and Liluca thinks only of her own survival. Liluca\'s character really highlights Bell\'s kindness and his ability to see the best in others as demonstrated with him still accepting Liluca as a friend. She is confused with his sympathy after being kicked around for so long. Liluca becomes close with Bell and joins the group in their quests as well as being a romantic competitor with Hestia, adding to the humor. Liluca is an okay character. In the beginning, it\'s irritating to see how many times she\'s tricked Bell and it\'s irritating to see her in the battles. I can only think of her screaming ""Beru-Sama"" but her backstory is good.Aiz Wallenstein is a young girl who is hailed as the ""sword princess"" for her impressive swordsmanship and her performance in dungeons. She saves Bell in the first scene of the anime and serves as Bell\'s love interest throughout the show. Aiz presents herself as a quiet, understanding, and caring individual. She felt responsible for putting Bell in danger and trains him to be a stronger adventurer. She\'s a strong girl and represents Bell\'s resolve and dream. He wants to catch up to her and prove that he can be a strong adventurer.ENJOYMENT 9/10DanMachi is really fun to watch. The world is a joy to see and the anime captures the fantasy feel very well. The characters are super entertaining and have some of the best chemistry I\'ve seen in anime. The fights are exciting and the music+animation only adds to the greatness. One of the most enjoyable anime I have seen.OVERALL 8/10This anime is a fun enjoyable experience. It\'ll make you laugh and you\'ll really connect with the characters throughout the show. I strongly disagree with the comparisons people have drawn concerning SAO as I feel the completely opposite emotions with both. This has a really nice balance of action, comedy, romance, and saddness which is great, especially for a 13 episode series.  I\'ll just say I loved this and I highly recommend it to anyone!! be stronger and a hero.Honestly, the story is pretty simple.

This bond is very well done because of the similarities between the two characters but also their chemistry and incredible faith in each other. Hestia may seem like the typical fanservice type of girl at first but her energy and humor make her one of the shows strongest points. Despite being a goddess, she works very hard and stands against the discrimination to see Bell achieve his dream. She shows romantic affection and teases him throughout the series and it is very heartwarming to see the two in every scene.Liluca is a little girl who Bell defends in an alleyway after seeing her bullied by other adventurers. Both her parents were adventurers but were killed, leaving her alone to fend for herself in a world full of danger. She gets herself into trouble and relies on thievery in order to pay off debts and survive. Despite her efforts, she is constantly looked down upon and suffers physical and mental abuse from adventures, making her hate the idea of adventurers completely. Bell tries to help her and makes her a supporter with him in his dungeon adventures. However, Bell becomes a victim of her thievery and Liluca thinks only of her own survival. Liluca\'s character really highlights Bell\'s kindness and his ability to see the best in others as demonstrated with him still accepting Liluca as a friend. She is confused with his sympathy after being kicked around for so long. Liluca becomes close with Bell and joins the group in their quests as well as being a romantic competitor with Hestia, adding to the humor. Liluca is an okay character. In the beginning, it\'s irritating to see how many times she\'s tricked Bell and it\'s irritating to see her in the battles. I can only think of her screaming ""Beru-Sama"" but her backstory is good.Aiz Wallenstein is a young girl who is hailed as the ""sword princess"" for her impressive swordsmanship and her performance in dungeons. She saves Bell in the first scene of the anime and serves as Bell\'s love interest throughout the show. Aiz presents herself as a quiet, understanding, and caring individual. She felt responsible for putting Bell in danger and trains him to be a stronger adventurer. She\'s a strong girl and represents Bell\'s resolve and dream. He wants to catch up to her and prove that he can be a strong adventurer.ENJOYMENT 9/10DanMachi is really fun to watch. The world is a joy to see and the anime captures the fantasy feel very well. The characters are super entertaining and have some of the best chemistry I\'ve seen in anime. The fights are exciting and the music+animation only adds to the greatness. One of the most enjoyable anime I have seen.OVERALL 8/10This anime is a fun enjoyable experience. It\'ll make you laugh and you\'ll really connect with the characters throughout the show. I strongly disagree with the comparisons people have drawn concerning SAO as I feel the completely opposite emotions with both. This has a really nice balance of action, comedy, romance, and saddness which is great, especially for a 13 episode series.  I\'ll just say I loved this and I highly recommend it to anyone!!', ""Despite all the hate this anime got becouse of Hestia becoming incredibly popular in no time, this anime is really good, I really enjoyed it. The plot is good and I really like the whole RPG theme they added even tho it's not a legit game like SAO or /Hack. The characters are really cool and every single one of them has enough screen-time to get to know them well, not like many other animes these days that only focus arround the MC and barely use the other characters. Some fight scenes are really damn epic, like Bell's fight against the OP Minotaur... Damn that...shit was rad.The only bad thing I see about it It's how the the last episode finished in a huge cliff-hanger and It had a lot of plot holes. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see another season of this, I bet It's going to be epic.Give this one a go, you won't regret it. shit was rad.The only bad thing I see about it It's how the the last episode finished in a huge cliff-hanger and It had a lot of plot holes.

Also for a short series, I was never really bored, it was for me, like discovering a new MMO. I liked the angle of living in an RPG world without being ""trapped"" in a game, the world itself is a game, but that\'s how it always been. I don\'t know what else can explain why I liked this anime so much, story-wise I was so intrigued by discovering the setting and how the world of this anime works (like how...it would work if it were an mmo) that I wasn\'t even concentrated in the story. I loved seeing new high-level zones, combat, analysing what kind of classes there would be, professions, new beasts, etc. I felt integrated in the world itself out of my curiosity. Outside of that, radically speaking, I really don\'t know why I memorize this anime so much.In short, it\'s an better version of SAO, with better waifu material. it would work if it were an mmo) that I wasn\'t even concentrated in the story.

Yes it's a harem comedy, but I love the RPG aspect. The combat sequences can be quite intense, and the visuals are quite appealing.  It was very well animated and the music went very well with everything. Bell can be a frustrating character sometimes, and Hestia's high-pitched whining can grate on one's nerves a bit,  but overall, it is a fun show and I really hope for a second season. I am a...bit disappointed that the show was only 13 episodes long, but it leaves me anticipating (and hoping for) the release of season 2. Will definitely be checking out the light novels and Manga as well. bit disappointed that the show was only 13 episodes long, but it leaves me anticipating (and hoping for) the release of season 2.

How unique? just barely at all actually.STORY:This anime does not have a real story. The plot hinges entirely on one thing; ""I am the protagonist and I want to get stronger"", that\'s it. It is absolutely the most clichéd thing you could possibly imagine. However, a cliché exists because of a trend, and a trend is formed because...it works. In this case we have a terribly mediocre story that serves as the backdrop for the events of the series which allow for character interactions (We\'ll get to that), world-building, action and comedy.A simple meal well prepared can be very enjoyable, even if it is unimpressive. That is my best non-spoiler summary for the story.ART:Much has been made of the waves created by Goddess Hestia and her breast-ribbon, but I will not lie, I did not even notice it until I finished watching the series and read someone\'s review where they could not stop talking about it... I thought the art was serviceable , although I had a few SAO flashbacks, primarily in a couple of the supporting female characters. But these are minor qualms, the overall style and establishing shots of the city and deep levels of the dungeon are beautifully drawn with great detail and (occasionally) intense imagination.However, as with the rest of the anime, it reaches far but only hits the mark a few times, though in my opinion these few times are enough to raise it above mediocrity. The worst one can say about the art is that it is not unique enough. It is however, memorable.CHARACTER:And here we reach the core of the series, there are two main characters in this anime; Goddess Hestia and Bell Cranel. They are both very stereotypical and clichéd characters to the absolute maximum. Bell Cranel is the typical shounen lead with massive sex appeal to the female characters, extreme drive to ""Get stronger!"" and an absolute pure heart, basically a straight arrow with no edge to him whatsoever. Goddess Hestia is the typical female lead that fawns over Bell but gets ignored.Individually they are awful characters... but what really saves it is that they have fantastic chemistry. This is what we call an emergent property in that the result is something greater than the sum of its parts. Hestia and Bell are an adorable couple with a very believable friendship. In a world with goddesses, demons, monsters and magic, the chemistry between the two main leads grounds us in a very human element; The emotional support and mutual belief that these have for each other.The friendly support characters include a Sword Princess (Ain Valley-naniga), a very small pseudo-furry girl and an ill-included late game addition, a blacksmith. Of these three main support characters, two are extremely poorly developed and one has a surprisingly decent arc. They do their job in that they fill the background of what is entirely Bell and Hestia\'s story. Nothing more nothing less.OVERALL:Here is where I will probably blow your mind ... but not really because you already saw the overall score. This is a great anime, it is very simple, very clichéd and predictable like you would not imagine. But as I said in the beginning, a simple meal, well prepared can be a very enjoyable experience.The action, when it really kicks into high gear, is fantastic. The animation is fluid during the major fight sequences and the soundtrack works beautifully in conjunction with the fight choreography (Ex: The Minotaur fight). The chemistry between leads is believable and fun, the pace of the story is brisk, and the drama is kept firmly at bay throughout barring a couple of establishing scenes which are very brief.Basically it is a light, enjoyable, short anime that knows exactly what it is. Like eating ice cream along with a couple of strawberries, it looks good, it tastes good, and although you know there is very little substance to it, you will still find it enjoyable. It is not a substitute for a full course meal but it was not trying to be. I highly recommend this, but let it be made clear that this is not a substantive anime, it is fluff, it is popcorn, it is light. That is all. it works.

It got stucked in my head for thinking because the story is left unhandled, well I hope they make a better adaptation next time. Let's start then.Story 7/10The story is great, I like it. I admit I like this kind of story. At the first, MC is alone and finally met with his new friends, and then he try to be stronger and reach someone stronger than him. It will happened here. Well, the story wasn't bad, and wasn't good either. But it make...me pretty disappointed because it left me with no clue about why Bell have an abnormal growth?, why the Goliath appeared and attacked them?, or where the fuck is Aiz's party? Is they already left the dungeon? When? I just got no clue about it tho, so I think the story is pretty bad, I wish they make something better next time.Art and Sound 9/10I like this part from anime, the art is nice and enjoyable. The sound is great, the OP and ED are great and very enjoyable.Character 7/10I like the MC actually, he pretty strong and he like to adventure in SOLO mode instead making a party to help him. But what he gonna do is easy to predict. I wasn't bothered anyway, I also like the other character, but I must say I really hate Lili. She is the most annoying in this story, she almost make me drop this, such a waste. The character wasn't bad too, it fulfill my expectation of the character, so my hope isn't too high or too low.Overall 8/10Danmachi wasn't bad anyway, it just that they not put a lot effort into this. If they gonna make 2nd season, I hope they make it better than this one. But overall, this anime is very good, I recommend this to you who want the MC is  overpowered and he is surrounded by girls with big boobs because he saved them before and they fall in love with him. The title is also suck, I dunno why but I feel it so suck.Feel free to give feedback if I wrote something wrong in the comment section or you can PM me already, so see you later. me pretty disappointed because it left me with no clue about why Bell have an abnormal growth?, why the Goliath appeared and attacked them?, or where the fuck is Aiz's party?

You will be finding yourself constantly asking questions of the details that have been missed, but I believe the author main focus is the action and learning to grow up. Hopefully once season 2 hits, we'll get to main story of what's happening.The art is definitely outstanding compared to most anime out there. The action scenes are extremely well done and they don't blur out like most anime when it comes...to quick action scenes.

I would seriously only watch the anime instead of the manga because the manga doesn't justify all the actions that is happening in the anime.Overall, I really did enjoy this anime as it was something new and the author tries to start something new that isn't part of the main stream.

Can't wait for season 2."", 'This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)[Synopsis]: In the city of Orario lies a labyrinthine structure of floors called the Dungeon to which adventurers and craftsman journey from far and wide in attempt to make a name for themselves and explore the mysterious Dungeon. Adventurers partner up with gods and goddesses to form Familias in order to better vanquish the monsters of the Dungeon and form guild-like communities with one another. Bell Cranel (Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu), the sole member of the Goddess Hestia’s (Minase, Inori) Familia, is a fledgling adventurer with aspirations of love and heroism. Along with his goddess Hestia, he strives to...become a strong adventurer so that he can fulfill his dreams[Characters]:The characters were a minor point of strength for DanMachi due to its fairly large recurring cast as well as the small quirks and abilities exhibited by each character. The show didn’t focus too much attention on the development of characters outside of Bell and his companions and so the side characters came off a little flat however their basic traits and designs worked well enough to keep them interesting and occasionally memorable despite this. At the same time however, the show offered up a great deal of fan-service and many of the characters, especially the more uninspired members of the cast, frequently showed up for no real reason beyond this point which somewhat cheapened this element within the show.Bell Cranel, the protagonist adventurer of the show, is good-natured and exhibits most of the traits you would expect of the action show protagonist. One thing I will say is that he has quite a timid disposition – especially around women, however this somewhat sets him apart from the more typical shounen leads in that he gives him a good place to start from in the development department as well as an extra point of comedy and interest. He is amiable to nearly everyone he meets however also proves fairly thick-headed to any romantic interests exhibited by other members of the cast in typical fashion for a show with harem undertones. He has legitimate development throughout the show however only so much as can be expected in its 13 episode length and therein doesn’t change drastically but rather in more subtle ways.Hestia, the lonely goddess who inducted Bell into her Familia after failing to recruit others, is extremely protective and caring of Bell and works hard in all that she does in order to better help him in his quest to become a strong adventurer. While she, as a goddess and head of a Familia, has some plot relevance as a character, she mostly occupies a comedic role within the show. She is often jealous of other women that try to get close to Bell and can be quite petty in how she brushes them off and covets Bell however at the end of the day they have a good relationship and her affection for him is genuine beyond that of a comedic dynamic. One of the real problems with Hestia – and this is a problem that I see elsewhere in the cast as well, is that she exists almost purely for the sake of comedy and fan-service however the show, while cashing in on these aspects, attempts to paint her as a more legitimate figure. This approach doesn’t quite work for the show and by the time it wanted me to take the character of Hestia seriously, I simply couldn’t and anyone that was able to was most likely swiftly undermined by another gag or a crotch shot.There are a good deal of somewhat interesting characters elsewhere in the cast and some probably more so than the main duo at times as those close to Bell also receive character insights and development. There are antagonistic presences in the show but no great overarching enemy which needs to be defeated – despite this the show avoids feeling overly formulaic in this aspect and the obstacles Bell must overcome are not so straightforward in their depiction yet the show still exhibits a pretty predictable course of events.[Art/Animation]:I feel that the first thing to talk about in this section are the wonderful designs from Yasuda Suzuhito – his style is conveyed well in this adaptation and each character feels quite visually unique without feeling outlandish amongst the other members of the cast. People that have enjoyed his work elsewhere would do well to watch the show if only for this reason.The character designs aside, the animation of the show was consistent throughout and was played up for the more important scenes in exciting fashion. There were a couple quality drops here and there infrequently but never during a key moment and not so often that they would become distracting from the scene or setting. As the show deals primarily with venturing into the Dungeon, I would be remiss to not give some critical attention to the monsters that dwell within. They weren’t all that creative or even innovative, featuring mainly things like minotaurs and corrupted beasts however overall they felt pretty par for the course and at least each represented somewhat of a formidable threat and in that way avoided being truly dismissable.[Story]:The story, while not necessarily a strength of the show, was done well enough and primarily succeeded in its minor character introduction arcs and it’s finale. The story itself is more or less what you would expect from the premise and so the fact that nothing drastically different and more complete grows out of it should come as no surprise. The end goal of picking up girls and of becoming a hero are a bit abstract and so the show doesn’t work so directly towards these things – choosing to build itself up to key moments and at other times meander about in a more comedic and laid back manner. At the end of the day the show is about adventure and so the lack of a more typical core story doesn’t really hurt the show. One of the negative things I will say about the plot is simply that it felt like the 13 episodes adapted up until a point in the light novels and then ended. This is not to say the show arrived at a good conclusion and didn’t have a thrilling finale, simply that the ending does not leave the viewer with a feeling of completion or full on closure due to it’s source material being on-going.Between Bell’s initial escapades and the introduction of his companions and acquaintances the show features primarily action and adventure however will have the odd episode occasionally which is more comically inclined and so someone who can enjoy both sides of the show will ultimately enjoy it more however the show does not forget itself so much to lose its audience who is more interested in the world and the Dungeon. The actual system at play within the world is quite reminiscent of the classic MMORPG elements found in shows like Sword Art Online and so DanMachi is often compared to them for this reason. I think the show does enough for itself to at least stand out differently than its similar cousins however at the end of the day, there is monster looting, guild-like communities, and a protagonist voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. Despite these similarities, one should not base whether or not to watch the show on their previous enjoyment or lack thereof of things like SAO because DanMachi is ultimately a different show and goes about things differently. The only reason I would give for someone avoiding the show on this topic is if the viewer in question had a problem with the system of things that SAO originally tried to capture and not because of any other qualms about the show.[Music]:The music was definitely a strong point of the show and worked well with the show’s intense action scenes and occasional monologues. The soundtrack was never exploited in a way where I felt that the show relied on one or two songs too heavily and so the music felt fresh and exciting throughout.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Coming from the action/fantasy/comedy genre I think it is fair to say that the show aimed to be fun and I think it achieved that. It didn’t take itself seriously enough to be a full-blown action show however it certainly had its moments and even a majority of the time was spent in that way – it kept things light while still investigating darker themes which I felt worked well for the show. The plot may have come off as a little stereotypical and overly pandering to the interests of it’s audience but I don’t think these things had the power to ruin the show.While I may have enjoyed a few characters such as Ryu and Aiz, the majority of the cast came off as pretty bland however not quite forgettable because of their individual abilities and the way the show chose to highlight these minor intricacies especially near the end. While the show attempted to offer a wide range of characters whom I could invest myself in, I was only able to do so with a select few because of characters like Hestia who trivialized the rest of the cast and mainly furthered the show’s harem dynamic.Rating: 6I gave DanMachi a 6 because at the end of the day it was enjoyable and had some awesome characters and action scenes and whatever qualities within the show that weren’t enjoyable or where’t aimed at me were not enough to completely outweigh what parts I did enjoy. It wasn’t as good as a good many other action shows and I don’t think it did anything particularly innovative however if I had to summarize whatever praise I have for the show, it would be that it offered up a fun cast of characters (regardless of their shortcomings) alongside a well established and quite typical action/fantasy story.[Recommendations]:I would recommenced DanMachi to any fan of great action sequences and the more typical shounen action show dynamic. It did these things well on top of providing mediocre to decent comedy. Fans of SAO would feel right at home watching this however at the same time, those who disliked SAO I feel would be safe giving the show a shot despite its similarities. Those interested in the romance or the harem elements of the show would perhaps find enough content to sate themselves however I would warn that the show doesn’t explore the romantic side of things all that much though it does have more romantic comedy than I thought it would. become a strong adventurer so that he can fulfill his dreams[Characters]:The characters were a minor point of strength for DanMachi due to its fairly large recurring cast as well as the small quirks and abilities exhibited by each character.

The soundtrack was never exploited in a way where I felt that the show relied on one or two songs too heavily and so the music felt fresh and exciting throughout.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Coming from the action/fantasy/comedy genre I think it is fair to say that the show aimed to be fun and I think it achieved that. It didn’t take itself seriously enough to be a full-blown action show however it certainly had its moments and even a majority of the time was spent in that way – it kept things light while still investigating darker themes which I felt worked well for the show. The plot may have come off as a little stereotypical and overly pandering to the interests of it’s audience but I don’t think these things had the power to ruin the show.While I may have enjoyed a few characters such as Ryu and Aiz, the majority of the cast came off as pretty bland however not quite forgettable because of their individual abilities and the way the show chose to highlight these minor intricacies especially near the end. While the show attempted to offer a wide range of characters whom I could invest myself in, I was only able to do so with a select few because of characters like Hestia who trivialized the rest of the cast and mainly furthered the show’s harem dynamic.Rating: 6I gave DanMachi a 6 because at the end of the day it was enjoyable and had some awesome characters and action scenes and whatever qualities within the show that weren’t enjoyable or where’t aimed at me were not enough to completely outweigh what parts I did enjoy. It wasn’t as good as a good many other action shows and I don’t think it did anything particularly innovative however if I had to summarize whatever praise I have for the show, it would be that it offered up a fun cast of characters (regardless of their shortcomings) alongside a well established and quite typical action/fantasy story.[Recommendations]:I would recommenced DanMachi to any fan of great action sequences and the more typical shounen action show dynamic. It did these things well on top of providing mediocre to decent comedy. Fans of SAO would feel right at home watching this however at the same time, those who disliked SAO I feel would be safe giving the show a shot despite its similarities. Those interested in the romance or the harem elements of the show would perhaps find enough content to sate themselves however I would warn that the show doesn’t explore the romantic side of things all that much though it does have more romantic comedy than I thought it would.', 'Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, also known as Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, is an anime series that takes viewers on a thrilling adventure through the depths of a dangerous dungeon.

I don't see any flaws in this anime from start to finish. Everything is perfect in my opinion from the fight scene, music, characters, and stories. Starting from a fight scene that was really thrilling and cool, it felt like the fight was really not an anime anymore but a big action film. This is very impressive where they show the MC that develops from zero to hero, from training to death to finally become very strong. And when the fight scene must be accompanied by action music that makes really hype and feels great. Plus there is also a harem...and some fan service that is relaxed because after fighting. The last one is the animation that I really like, the animation is very smooth and sharp. The studio really shows their abilities as much as possible so that everything looks perfect. Thank you season 1, very good. and some fan service that is relaxed because after fighting. The last one is the animation that I really like, the animation is very smooth and sharp.

I love the whole idea of the power behind the main boy Bell. I just love how they are starting from nothing and working their way up.Music:One of the interested aspects of this anime is that it is often set in dungeons or in medieval taverns, so the music is made accordingly. The music is perfect for every scene.Characters:Honestly, even knowing very little about Greek mythology and all the different gods, its so wonderful to see them all interacting. Its more funny when you understand it more, but every character is...so perfect.Story:I really love how the adventures are going and the story is just so perfect. Bell is so innocent and pure, and it is absolutely hilarious to see that. I just enjoy every episode so much.Final thoughts:I loved this anime and am glad to hear that a third season should be coming out in the next few years! I can't wait for more, as this is absolutely hilarious and so etchy (sexual). I love how competitive all the Gods are and can't wait to watch Bell grow to be a bigger and more mature man. so perfect.Story:I really love how the adventures are going and the story is just so perfect.

Those were also my father\'s last words before he went on a long quest, a journey to pick up girls from the dungeon. Sadly, it has been 15 years now and he never returned or the girls that he was supposed to pick.-Everyone used to say bad things about my Father, and I think they still do that he left his family behind to pick up girls from the dungeon, but I don\'t think he did that I believe him...in that he would leave us for such simple reason, there\'s gotta be some kind of mystery a real authentic reason about the illuminati ""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls "". I always wondered why is it wrong, what makes it wrong? From the Early Men times, men have been trying all sorts of techniques and unique ways to woo women. Now that I think about it, Early Men used to live in caves and caves=dungeons, there gotta be many scenarios where our Ancestors would try to pick up girls from the caves they used to live in, but why is that?

I noticed a number of other reviews touch on this as well and to put it simply it's because it's true the plot is sorry and lazy. This series breaks no ground whatsoever but for this seemingly monstrous flaw what is quickly and easily over looked is that it refines and prefects everything* else.Where this series really...starts to shine is it's attention to detail, from the venders to the environment nothing is just there for the sake of convenience. The armors differ in style from character to character and any wall or building may be broken in the heat of a fight. It borrows a nearly exclusively from the RPG level progression and crafting systems where there are guidelines for what each person should or shouldn't do if they wish to stay alive buying better armor and equipment is vital to progressing.The combat is beautiful and rich where frequently the weapons are knocked out of characters hands or broken in battle but as apposed to leaving themselves wide open while trying to regain their particular weapon it is far more likely that a character will try to take an enemy's weapon and kill him with it. The fighting is also quite bloody as them protagonist is regularly soaked from head to toe in blood both his and monsters, which provides a nice contrast to the clean polished visuals of the often cutesy cast.The series also does the GetBackers thing where most everybody starts off as a rival or enemy and later becomes an ally true the mindless goodwill other the lead character. Which is also where the harem element sets in nearly every girl falls for him though it doesn't seem as contrived as in most anime as he is an inherently adorable individual. As he slowly gathers other party members they take on more intense foes though more of the fights are won through teamwork or dumb-luck than an overwhelming power. It's since of comradery is the gem at the core though every character has their own purposes for adventuring and their own setbacks which lead to mistakes and weaknesses in the groups. It's that which gives it so much of it's dynamic and that which leads it to be more than it appears.It;s not about what this show does that's new that makes it good as it does nothing new but it refines all of it's elements in ways that are normally overlooked that make this show great. I loved it and would recommend this to anyone. starts to shine is it's attention to detail, from the venders to the environment nothing is just there for the sake of convenience.

It is very modern, and why shouldn’t it be, as it came out just last summer. So not only does it look fantastic from an art standpoint, but from a emotional aspect, this show will pull on all of your heartstrings as the people endure hardship and trial after trial, the emotion is their eyes and their faces is so real and strong it takes the show to a whole new level. This with the pretty frequent use of blood, but not gore, shows the...depths of what each character is going through and how difficult things are getting. The differences in character design are pretty significant as well, the use of a multi-race culture made for some interesting, albeit generic, characters. Fanservice is pretty abundant when it comes to some of the main characters but that doesn’t exactly mean bad, it is not over used and it is only readily apparent in the story in a few episodes so I wouldn’t let it stop someone from watching it. However, I caution those who want to image search this show, because things can get raunchy fast.The sound design and the music in this show are absolutely phenomenal. Both the opening and closing songs are catchy and the animation that goes with them is clean and clever, it really shows how connected all of the characters are. That being said, even the music used in battle scenes is fantastic because it invokes a real feeling that demands to be felt in that time. Now, I may have already been feeling that, but at the same time I cannot deny that it magnified the emotion 10x. Moving away from music, the sounds that we hear when things are happening are something that I don’t hear very often in shows; the breaking of the rock being split, the differences in the punches thrown, it was so satisfying, and sometimes rage inducing to hear what I’m seeing and takes me that much deeper into this world.The story is not something to be written off. In fact, it is refreshingly original. While there are a few unanswered questions, as to how the system that they live in came about, but these are questions that when we are dropped into the middle of the life for these people we will have for sure. The whole story with the Familia and how each adventurer has a place in life and a Goddess to follow, it is something I haven’t seen done before and I like to see it done this way. All in all we meet the aspiring adventurer Bell Cranel who is on the verge of death by a monster that should have been nowhere near where he was. But at the last moment the Sword Princess, Aiz Wallenstein, steps in and cuts the Minotaur in half, covering Bell in blood. He screams and runs back to his Goddess Hestia who realizes he has gained an ability that means he has fallen in love with Aiz without even realizing. Then as the series goes on Bell is working to catch up with Aiz, showing his unconditional kindness to people that do not deserve it, and beating every odd put up against him, this is extremely important because he, wants to be a hero, he wants to save the girl, he wants to protect his friends.First, the title of this show made it seem like Bell was going to be this salty guy trying to pick up all the women he could find, however I was presently surprised to know that Bell was actually an underdog who can’t hardly talk to a girl he likes, outside of his Hestia. We do learn later on in the show where the title comes from, but that is better left unsaid. Even as the show would go on and on I felt that he was kind of a wimp, but I loved his determination and his spite because it is a drive that I also share. Now I’m not trying to become a fairy tale hero, but I know that when I want something to happen, then I get it done. When the main characters are in distress and you see the absolute lowest of the low that humanity can take to get what they want, it makes my stomach churn and tighten when we watch people that are clearly deserving getting beaten near death, and you want to scream into the darkness of the cave “Bell! SAVE HER!” While it might not always be a girl alone, it still is how a person like me would react. Or when Bell would be the one under attack, the show makes you hate the attackers so much for being cheap and being completely consumed by jealousy and their inferiority to Bell. But after this entire scene Bell still shows the kind of grace that I strive to have. This is a show that sparks emotion both good and bad and I love it when a show makes me feel this way. The characters are memorable and their relationships are fun to watch play out, even if some lead to just dead ends or are forgotten. It is the type of show that makes you want to take a plunge back into an RPG, and be a hero again. Sadly only with a spinoff series following the Sword Princess on the horizon, we might not see much of Bell Cranel in the future. Still the show makes me want to be that hero, but more than that I would strive to be better than a hero, but to be an Argonaut.Overall Score: 9.9/10 depths of what each character is going through and how difficult things are getting.

Now, I won\'t pretend to be some sort of anime sommelier or connoisseur, but on purely based on that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you finish an anime, Familia Myth (lets call it that, it\'s shorter than ""is it wrong to pick up chicks in a dungeon) is up there with some of the very best anime that I have ever seen. Here\'s why:Storywise, this anime is good, not fantastic, but not average either. Obviously with...this sort of anime, the hero is never in any real peril (or at least you know he isn\'t), but the way this show convinces you that the situations and events are gonna lead to Bell\'s untimely death is fantastic! This is largely what contributes to that sense of satisfaction at the end of each episode, and indeed the end of the season. Another nice aspect with the story is the way it plays with the RPG theme, I know others have said this, but it really does emulate that feeling of discovery when you first pick up a game, like you are enjoying the story vicariously through Bell. OH THE ENDING IS SO GOOD JUST WATCH IT (stereotypical but good).In terms of characters this anime is also pretty darn good! Aside from Bell being the sort of stereotypical fairly plain hero personality-wise, the rest of the characters are all pretty cool, and are developed really well. The two criticisms I have are: One; Hestia is kind of weak as a character and fairly useless throughout, but in the second last episode she almost makes up for it, and Two; Welf could have been developed a bit more, and he was only present for a short while, but hopefully if there is a second season this could be resolved. Also Aiz and Bell\'s relationship could have been developed a bit more, but it was good aside from that. Overall characters in this anime are pretty strong, with a good showing of strong female characters (RYU FOR THE F****** WIN!!).Character design was excellent. It was nice to see a main character that didn\'t just have black hair for once, digging the white on red colour scheme for bell. Lilli was also darn, really fit the supporting character image well! Oh also the fanservice was pretty tasteful (if you can even call it that) for an anime which has a girl with white sheet vacuum-formed to her breasts on the poster, and it never really obstructed the story\'s progression, which is always a plus, so points for that.Sound design was actually flipping cool, this is definitely one to watch with a good pair of headphones on. A special mention goes to the ending theme song - holy crap it got me pumped for the next episode every time, and really added to the sense of enjoyment!Speaking of which, in terms of enjoyment, this anime is up there with the best, each episode was really fulfilling and felt like it was contributing largely to the story\'s progression (also pacing was really good). THE ENDING HOLY SHIT THE ENDING - ok I have literally just finished watching it, so I am still full of those end of season feels, so I may be slightly swayed in favour of this anime, but seriously the ending was good. Just go watch this anime, please?And there we have it, the end of the review. Overall This anime is really good, go watch it.

I really hope it gets a second season!', 'After seeing ""Sword Art"" i had lost all hope in watching an anime that involved gaming characteristics(as of 2010\'s on).My main problem with ""SAO"" is that it was rushed through,therefore making the actual anime shit.The games themselves were not a bad concept though,however alot of people get these two mixed up and rate ""SAO"" high instead of rating the game concepts.When ‘DanMachi’ was announced i didn\'t know what to expect,hell i didn\'t even know what kinda anime it was going to be.The name alone kept my attention for months until it actually aired,after seeing the first episode i still wasn\'t all that sure about it.However...i continued to watch it and was hooked by the end of episode 2.After watching all 13 episodes i have to say that my faith in gaming anime has been restored.It does have some what of a simple story for now but its really hard not to enjoy,making it an individual standing out from the crowd.Plus it\'s gradually easing through the story not being rushed.The characters are unique enough that you may find yourself attached to some of them by the end of 13 eps (Witch is pretty good considering some animes have 20+ eps with no good characters) .The way the gaming characteristics are is truly unique and entertaining,"" Omori Fujino"" really stepped outside of the box when making this.As far as the graphics go J.C. staff did an excellent job.Now alot of people are saying stuff like ""big boobs every where"" but honestly they must watch nothing but gradeschool anime girls(they may fall over dead if they watch something like Ikki tousen).In ""DanMachi"" there are quite a few female characters(MC  and non MC) that all have different size funbags(as desert punk would say).I guess people just can\'t use peripheral vision anymore.Anyways with all that being said i would have to say ""DanMachi"" may very easily end up being a timeless classic like ""Cowboy Bebop"" in its uniqueness of course.So if you haven\'t seen ""DanMachi"" i highly recommend that you do. i continued to watch it and was hooked by the end of episode 2.After watching all 13 episodes i have to say that my faith in gaming anime has been restored.It does have some what of a simple story for now but its really hard not to enjoy,making it an individual standing out from the crowd.Plus it\'s gradually easing through the story not being rushed.The characters are unique enough that you may find yourself attached to some of them by the end of 13 eps (Witch is pretty good considering some animes have 20+ eps with no good characters) .The way the gaming characteristics are is truly unique and entertaining,"" Omori Fujino"" really stepped outside of the box when making this.As far as the graphics go J.C. staff did an excellent job.Now alot of people are saying stuff like ""big boobs every where"" but honestly they must watch nothing but gradeschool anime girls(they may fall over dead if they watch something like Ikki tousen).In ""DanMachi"" there are quite a few female characters(MC  and non MC) that all have different size funbags(as desert punk would say).I guess people just can\'t use peripheral vision anymore.Anyways with all that being said i would have to say ""DanMachi"" may very easily end up being a timeless classic like ""Cowboy Bebop"" in its uniqueness of course.So if you haven\'t seen ""DanMachi"" i highly recommend that you do.', 'I can understand why this show gets the hate it does, but I think some of it is undeserved.Story wise there is a strange collision of mythos that actually works some how.  A few bits to highlight:- Hestia is an odd interpretation, though some of it fits. Classically she is the Goddess of hearth, home and family, so here feelings towards Bell kind of fit, but she\'s also classically under a vow of chastity.  She\'s also one of the oldest in the Greek pantheon, so really she should get more respect from the other deities.  She is a somewhat non-confrontational Goddess, lacks...the kind of domain specific skills that the others have, and is generally less well known, all of which fits her character in DanMachi.- Hephaestus... I\'m not going to say much on her other than that there is precedent in relevant mythology for Gods to switch sex for fun.- Freya, being a Norse Goddess, is tricky.  I don\'t think she\'s classically as mean as she\'s being portrayed here, but she is a patron for love, sex, war and death, so it\'s not a huge leap.- The tower. Comment was made about it not featuring much, which is wrong.  That is the tower of Bable, Old Testament biblical mythos.  Apparently in this world the consequences of building a tower to the heavens was different.  It\'s visited often as the dungeon appears to be under it. The dungeon goes down (not up like in SAO) and is likely an allusion to the Labyrinth of Daedalus.- The general portray of the deities as fickle troublemakers is pretty consistent with their original stories.As an establishing season it\'s not terrible, but it would have been nice to have had more information about Bell\'s first skill.The art is touch less complex than some anime, but it\'s still pretty good and consistent.Sound I have to heavily mark down just for how many times a slightly whiny ""Bell-kun!"" ""Kamisama!"" is heard.  Could make a drinking game out of just that.  Otherwise it\'s not bad, the opening and closing songs are pleasant (though they don\'t grab me quite as much as some others have) and the BGM stays in the background properly.Characters... That\'s where it gets tricky. The harem aspect is painfully over the top, particularly since he makes it clear he\'s only interested in Aiz.  Having so many of the female characters inexplicably throw themselves at him actually gets in the way of the story... Although I suppose that is somewhat realistic.The lack of solid male characters is also disappointing, they\'re mostly shown as weaker fighters than their female peers and/or as chauvinist jerks. The few exceptions are kept in the background.  This will hopefully be balanced out as the story progresses.Many characters are suffering from trope overload, though they do at least seem to have some personality beyond that.  I\'m willing to write that off as a necessity of establishing their identity and purpose in the plot even though it could have been done better.Having Hestia be a loli-big-boobs is definitely a fan service choice, somewhat redeemed by the fact she knows she\'s well endowed and makes light of it.  It\'s also justified for her to have those boobs, considering her position of Goddess of family.Bell demonstrates depressing amounts of naivety on many occasions, particularly regarding his skill slots. This may frustrate you.That pattern continues through the series, a lot of apparently pandering choices and tropes that start to get deconstructed or explained but aren\'t fully satisfied before the end of the season.  This is a show that could well get better as it goes on, assuming it doesn\'t crash and burn first.So essentially, Season 2 will be the make or break season for the anime.  Hopefully it gets that second season.Overall I enjoyed the show... It\'s just silly enough that you can ignore the flaws and enjoy it as a comedy, assuming harem isn\'t a deal breaker for you.  Just try not to look too hard for some deeper meaning or moral tale, I\'m not sure there is one yet. the kind of domain specific skills that the others have, and is generally less well known, all of which fits her character in DanMachi.- Hephaestus...

For the protagonist, it might just be the other way around.Story: 7/10Unfortunately, this is one of those action/adventure/romance shows that scrapes the surface of action, adventure, and romance, but doesn\'t really go all the way in any of these categories.  Though I must admit I found myself wrapped up in the plot and interested in the storyline and potential romances, I always...ended up wanting just a bit more of everything.What bothered me the most was the harem going on, because even though there was clearly a girl Bell liked and wanted to end up with, things kind of just... fizzled out and every single chick in the series ended up falling madly in love with him. While this tends to be the case with a lot of romance/action shows, it is frustrating to have zero romantic closure in a show.Art: 9/10Let\'s talk about character design. Because it was good. All the characters were attractively drawn, the backgrounds looked awesome, and the art matched.  It was some good art. Not particularly unique, but I have zero complaints.Sound:6/10The opening for the show was fine. The music was fine. Nothing really struck me as memorable, and I never found myself saying ""wow I like this music! It really fits!"" But all in all, it was okay.Character: 7/10Our protagonist, Bell, begins the series as a weak hero who often times has to be rescued by the very girls he wishes to protect. I know this turns a lot of watchers off, because frankly, watching someone try and fail to be awesome is kind of disappointing. But fear not, potential watchers! Actual character development occurs, and Bell\'s determination ends up paying off in a very satisfying way.  To be honest, Bell is a bit of a bland character in that he has very strict morals and seemingly no flaws other than that he\'s \'too nice,\' which is sort of a running trend with noble heroes these days. That beings said, Bell is still a very likeable and interesting character (he\'s just a bit predictable.)The other characters (AKA all the girls in love with Bell) don\'t seem to be very developed.  Honestly, while they are all interesting and they help add to the story, there is only one female character I can think of who actually had a decent back story (and she was probably the only one who wasn\'t head over heels for the protagonist.) The rest of them were really all there just to \'like Bell.\' I was most disappointed with the girl that Bell likes the most, because she seemed to be the flattest and most two-dimensional of all.Enjoyment: 7/10I did not enjoy the romantic part of the show. But I enjoyed every other part. The action was interesting, the adventure had me hooked, and I laughed a few times at the comedy.Overall: 7/10Just a fun show to watch to pass the time.  I thought it was good, but it didn\'t change my life or anything. A little cliche can\'t hurt you, and all in all, it was a good ride. ended up wanting just a bit more of everything.What bothered me the most was the harem going on, because even though there was clearly a girl Bell liked and wanted to end up with, things kind of just... fizzled out and every single chick in the series ended up falling madly in love with him.

After seeing a large amount of the low overall ratings, I thought that there wasn\'t enough credibility where it was due.I will avoid including spoilers in this review, but I won\'t deny the fact that this is my first review and I also won\'t deny the fact that I am a huge gamer, which probably influences the reason why I enjoyed Danmachi as much as I did.Story : 8The story of ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka"" takes place in a...video game setting, where ""adventurers"" join a ""family"" belonging to a god(the gods referring to Greek mythology, e.g. Hestia, Hephaestus, Hermes, etc.) Unexplained as it is, there is a dungeon area where it becomes apparent that these adventurers journey to battle against monsters to earn money and gain experience. However, their statistic boosts(strength, agility, vitality) will not take effect until they return safely to their ""family\'s god"" where the god will then boost their stats.The first thing people will compare this to is the popular anime Sword Art Online, but I want to refrain from comparing to other animes. In my perspective, Danmachi has a unique storyline the fully met my expectations.Art: 7No, I\'m not rating this based on all the fanservice contained within this series. The quality of the art in my perspective is above average if you take into consideration how much art capability has progressed over the years. Furthermore, I won\'t deny that the costumes of each character appealed to my tastes.Sound: 8In hindsight, I\'m actually giving the sound aspect an 8.5. I enjoyed the voice actors emotion placed into the characters, the sound effects during all the battle scenes, etc. I genuinely enjoyed each of the soundtracks.Characters: 7I found each character having a very unique setup, although I don\'t know how to explain it, but unlike most characters from other series, they\'re too focused on the main character Bell Cranel. Of course, he\'s the main character, but they all revolved around him in a way that I didn\'t extremely enjoy and I\'m unsure of how to explain it. :xI won\'t deny that the humor that was incorporated into each character legitimately made me laugh at the appropriate scenes though.Enjoyment: 10Completely biased opinion right here, but the unique plot line was my type of anime right here. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again, the day after I finished it. The comedy was fantastic, the action was great, and I loved every single moment of it.Overall: 8I\'m restraining myself here cause I know that this is a review that I\'m proposing to others, yet in my own perspective.Overall, I gained a lot more enjoyment compared to what I initially anticipated with this series. video game setting, where ""adventurers"" join a ""family"" belonging to a god(the gods referring to Greek mythology, e.g. Hestia, Hephaestus, Hermes, etc.) Unexplained as it is, there is a dungeon area where it becomes apparent that these adventurers journey to battle against monsters to earn money and gain experience.

So, I started watching Danmichi just to kill time and as expected it has harem setup in 1st season but I like Bell\'s character development too much so i continued to 2nd season, In this season story...started to progress in good way and I really loved that, and still this season was somewhat boring. But I\'m glad that i didn\'t drop it here, I\'m glad that i didn\'t miss the beauty of this adventure story, art, plots and sound track which began from the very next season that is season 3.Season 3 was completely different and I never thought it would be this great. Episode by episode its getting improvement and what I truly love in this season is Bell\'s character development. His understanding towards two different races and fighting against all odds to save his friend really made me cry. The last 4 episodes were truly phenomenal. This whole season completely changed my thought and forced me to say it\'s worth watching Anime. I was expecting that the next season would be slow pace with normal story but J.C.Staff completely broke my expectation. I was not aware of the greatness of the next season and I\'m glad that I didn\'t took spoiler dose before watching.MOST IMPORTANT:The next season, the 4th season of Danmichi took me by surprise. It\'s what we call don\'t let them know your next move. God damn seriously!? how the f*** this change completely from 1st episode; this season is not normal fantasy anime I mean it\'s a True Adventure and fantasy Anime I have ever seen. It\' plot is so well written and adapted into anime, Its so DARK, GRUESOME, SPINE-CHILLING and give HORROR vibes throughout the series that will keep you at the edge of chair. With each episode it\'s getting better and better with Soul-stirring music and tracks. I was literally shouting like ""run run...please run"" etc. and I cried so many times mostly at the epic episode 20 I cried so hard; it was so heart breaking. If this didn\'t make you cry, didn\'t let you shed tears, then you are so cold person.I don\'t even believe how th 1st season started and how it ended, it was just fabulous.

I have no idea why this anime is being rated so low and it pains me to see such a masterpiece being underappreciated. Sure, the quality isn\'t breathtaking and it seems like a simple enough story. But I assure you if you give it a chance you\'ll be begging for more.I\'ve never written a review before on any anime. I like to think of myself as a lurker not really investing in any show and for the most part sticking to western tv. But every once in a blue moon I like to...settle down and heal my aching lonely heart with a little good old fashioned harem/romance. Don\'t judge me... or do, I really don\'t care.That being said, let me lose my sh*t on this one.  I\'m a sucker for gods. I don\'t care for your everyday anime gods, but the Greeks knew their stuff.  This anime has that feel. Raw godlike power, but also relatable.  Instead of flaunting their gifts the gods have sealed away their divinity and now live like humans, immortal but feeling and thinking like us.  This alone would call for a 5 star review but it gets better.The romance is perfect. A Goddess falling in love with a human is only a background story going on. Giving us men a chance to focus on the battles and ever increasing strength and power of the seemingly weak main character. Although this isnt a harem it still has several similarities with them. There is almost no other male characters that have a chance and therefore is completely stress free and relaxing to watch.  Really enjoyable and smooth going down. Like a nice bowl of pudding.The Goddess is ironically ungodly cute and although all the deities seem to be female even when logic would refuse to let that happen, it only seems to add an air of light heartedness.  With my 15 second attention span, my normal refusal to watch anything with subtitles and my crippling depression from too many cringe videoes on youtuve and a minor obsession with memes, I was STILL able to binge-watch the entire series.Simply put, there is NO insestual themes, no ""panty shots"", no cringe material to mention. I can\'t find fault with this!  I am a firm believer that anime is a sin against humanity.  Full metal alchemist, shuffle, Hellsing, and a few others are the exception. But this?  This is the Jesus to the world of evil. THIS is where God laid down an anime to take the sins of the others and say ""look here! Not every anime is a lifeless demon possessed, will to live taking, soul tainting, work of satan. Behold!

This anime is the cringiest, has no plot and is out of touch with basic human emotions.Every two episodes you will come across a scene that makes wish this anime doesn`t exist. Let me give you an example. A supporter girl betrays mc by cheating, stealing, attacking and luring him into a trap...that she set. MC being gullable still looks for that girl to ensure her safety. MC is striken down by monster then that girl steals valuables from mc. Mc just watches the girl stealing the stuff and running away.

I normally don't really care about the actual action itself I always think about the consequences of the fight for example if someone's going to beat the army general and win the battle or something. This fight scene though I was enthralled by everyone and I don't really know why.To be honest though the ending didn't really wrap anything up it opened up...some more questions specifically about who Bell is and what the god's have to do with the dungeon.Some things about the characters, I think that all the characters are quite good when you get rid of some of the females obsession's with Bell. Bell is a bit cliché as a main character but I'm a fan of that so It's ok, Lilly has quite a nice background to her and i think they made a solid character with her. Aiz is a strange character and they didn't elaborate enough on her I thought so she's kinda just Bell's trainer/idol/love interest?, the rest of the character I thought were fine I liked Welf too he was interesting to find out about.I didn't pick any flaws in the animation in fact I thought it was pretty good, some of the particle effect's looked great, the music was good, they managed to set the mood quite well and the OP and the ED are catchy but not enough for me to look for afterwards.One thing to look out for which is pretty obvious from the name of the show, fan service, it's there but honestly I think it's at acceptable levels the only thing that really bothered me was the silly rivalry between Hestia and Lily.I really do think this show needs a season 2, Gods be just that it's not like countless other season 2's that just fail on all accounts.8.8/10 (Last fight scene boosted this by about .5) some more questions specifically about who Bell is and what the god's have to do with the dungeon.Some things about the characters, I think that all the characters are quite good when you get rid of some of the females obsession's with Bell.

The premise of the series and the main character are nothing especially unique and new but that does not take away from the series.Everything about DanMachi is, at the very least, decent. I would say the most lacking components are the story and the sound. The story was certainly rushed...in certain areas due to the fact that this season was a promotion for the light novels. As per usual, much content from the original source gets cut out in the animated adaptation. As for sound, the OP and ED were okay, they weren\'t especially memorable or catchy to me but that is just my personal opinion; the music for the relation building scenes versus the action and hyped scenes certainly did their job.What stood out most to me from ""DanMachi"" was the awesome quality in art and style. When all other aspects of a show are good, even greater animation can turn an average show into a memorable series that allows the viewer to really become immersed within the world presented.I won\'t lie, I do enjoy me some ""plot"" here and there, and DanMachi doesn\'t disappoint in this regard; however, if you refuse to watch a show or will only watch a show if there are scantily clad girls or mandatory bath scenes, then please try and look past that going into this series as there is much more than meets the eye. Only you can really be the judge so why not give it a shot? in certain areas due to the fact that this season was a promotion for the light novels.

The story isn't amazing, the protagonist isn't something admirable, there's not very much development but is still enjoyable if you like a bit of fan service and just cute scenes.Now for the full review:Story 7:The world it's set in is very interesting. It's very RPG like except instead of logging out at the end of the day or being stuck inside some virtual reality, it is reality. Being able to choose a god/goddess then having stats to level up was quite interesting. All in all, the world was very interesting.Unfortunately, despite...the interesting aspect of the world, the story falls short of any actual development. The protagonist, as usual, has some amazing unique trait, in this case, he levels his stats faster. And judging by the title, you'd suspect that the series has something to do with the protagonist with picking up girls in a dungeon... which really doesn't happen given the fact that the guy tends to run away from girls and blush at their slightest movement.After several eps, what we have is: guy is saved by girl who becomes love interest, then very little happens between them until the recent ep. Also, the reason for why he is dungeoning is not explained except for a few hints that it may relate to his grandparents. Bell-kun (the protagonist) supposedly grows with every dungeon run but we don't really see/know his progress other than whenever his goddess tells him/us as all his combat action consists of is hack and slash. He does gain a new power at some point, the ability to cast fireballs but then he hasn't really shown it since that episode.There is also the case that he gains an amazing knife that would probably equate to legendary or epic in terms of WoW quality except we also don't know what it really does besides us being told that it is legendary/epic, but becomes worthless when outside his hands.In conclusion, not very much story has developed other than largely character introductions, which isn't really story.Art 9:The art is pretty nice and consistent, I didn't really notice anything jarring. The art style also allows for the characters to be cute.Sound 8:It would be a 7 if it were not for Hestia's voice actor. She fits perfectly with the attitude/character of Hestia and I cannot help but love her voice alone for it. Typically, Hestia has a very normal female voice, being not excessively high pitched cute-esque. But she is also able to change the tone of her voice to suit the current situation as well.Music-wise, there wasn't really anything that made me inspired or thrilled like AoT. It was just average.Character 6:This is largely caused by Bell as everyone's screen time is quite minimal.Bell - The largest problem with Bell is that he's so clichéd with his voice choice and attitude that you could easily copy him into another harem with scared/shy protagonist and it wouldn't feel any different. Bell is the typical male protagonist who gets a harem of girls pretty much by simply existing. His love interest is kind of interested in him which is explained by that she feels responsible for almost getting him killed.--Lili is interested in him because he's so nice despite everything he did to her, which also brings up another fault of Bell is that he's too nice. When Lili and he first met, he gave her an equal portion of the loot despite it being unheard of, which means that Bell really has no idea what he's doing in dungeons besides hack and slashing.--Hestia is interested in him because he's the only member of her familia and also because... who really knows.--Syr is interested in him because he patroned her workplace that one time and because... who really knows as well.To top it off, he doesn't really seem to notice their feelings but does get shy when they do perform some ecchi stuff to him.Overall, I don't even think Bell knows what he's doing besides hacking and slashing inside a dungeon everyday.Hestia - Her character is quite cute and attractive but we don't really know what kind of purpose she serves in terms of being the goddess of Bell. In fact, we're not sure what the gods/goddesses are really for besides inheriting their old powers from before they came down to earth(or whatever).Enjoyment 8:There are times when it becomes so cheesy, so clichéd that it's just a cringe-fest and most of these revolves around Bell's character. Otherwise, the lighter side of the story and more everyday interaction is quite fun.Overall 8:It's not an amazing anime, but it does have its appeal. This is definitely an anime for those who enjoy more ecchi/comedy type of genres and is definitely a turn off for those who want deep character interaction as well those looking for a developing plot, which this anime is missing both of. the interesting aspect of the world, the story falls short of any actual development.

Video Review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdfRyQTAiC8Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Also known as DanMachi for short.The anime at first was torn to shreds by nearly every person online calling it Sword Art Online Giant Titty Edition. But I will hands down say that this anime had better pacing and story progression than Log Horizon who people swear by for some reason but bash on this Anime???\x0bAnyways I'm going to get first to the heat of the debate, a lot of people bash that this anime copied the floor level idea and RPG idea from Sword Art Online. Those...people though fail to realize that Floor Levels weren't an idea created from Sword Art Online, but in fact this idea has existed long before SAO's existence. Almost every Dungeon Crawler RPG has floor levels, I mean just look at Diablo, it's pretty much fighting on different floors with increasing leveled enemies per different dungeon/floor. The truth of the matter is that people keep comparing DanMachi to SAO when in reality the anime shows have totally different premise.Looking at the broad picture Sword Art Online is an anime based on being trapped in a MMO similar to Guild Wars 2 or WOW with different sections devoted to different tasks like Villages, Dungeons, Main Quests, etcetera. On the other hand, DanMachi is an Anime based on the what if the world of a game like Guild Wars 2 was real and not a game. So in that perspective DanMachi is closer to the source of material than Sword Art Online. DanMachi is the real answer to what would life be inside a game rather than pretend to be trapped in one. With that said I love both of these anime shows, but I think it's an unfair comparison of the two seeing that they are looking at the same thing but in totally different perspectives.Now let's actually talk about what the anime is about, the story takes place in Orario a fictional world which contains monsters in all sorts of forms. In the story certain individuals take on the role as Adventurers who visit the dungeon to defeat monsters and take their shards. The shards can be used to craft magic items and are also used as the world's currency. Adventurers join groups called Famiria and each Famiria is serves a resident deity. Now I understand this is a lot to take in, but basically an Adventurer joins a Famiria to make adventuring easier and there deity can help tell them how they have improved after training at the dungeons. It's important because you need to know when you can move up a floor so that you as an Adventurer don't get killed. Also in a Famiria you can meet others to help make leveling up easier, and also get your back if you get rushed by to many enemies.This particular story follows Bell Cranel, a solo adventurer under the goddess Hestia; Hestia is Bell's deity. Bell is at the start the only member of the Hestia Famiria, but he works extremely hard each day to improve his abilities. During the beginning of the story while Bell is still fairly new as an Adventurer a high level monster escapes a higher floor and Bell is nearly killed but he gets saved by Aiz Wallenstein. After this he pretty much fell in love with her but throughout the story he is mocked on how he was saved by a girl, and he wants to prove to himself and everyone that he can surpass Aiz, and not be saved by her all the time.Of course first off I'd love to tip my hat off at the story because the progression and overall pacing is just so good. To add on the plot never got too deep but from where Bell started to where he wanted to get through you see a wimpy kid grow into a true Adventurer which honestly felt nostalgic to me. The show in general felt like an actual hero adventure, almost as if I was reading a book about a fairy tale hero.The Art and Animation was splendid, nothing to ground breaking but nothing fell flat and everything popped. The most notable thing I can say about the Art is that the world felt like a world I'd want to be in. The fight scenes were so good as well, well animated and drew me in with suspense wondering what would happen next and once again felt like a true story about an adventurer.The characters were just awesome and though they didn't explain the background of every character the main cast of characters did get a back story which were also amazing. You saw what the other characters went through so you knew where they were coming from rather than just being plain ol' support characters.  The best part is that this anime pretty much set some amazing ground work because its story, characters, and world. The one that I want a little more story of is Hestia who despite being a major character didn't get much story. I'd also like to know how and where the deities come from.The music was perfectly suitable for this anime, the opening theme really helped describe the anime, adventures, struggle, and above all friendship which everyone knows is the perfect combination of a heroic anime. The ending song feels just so adorable, with a Chibi Hestia running followed by all the other characters but all I can really say is that it's amazing. The anime in general screams Adventure, Friendship, Struggles, and Happiness! Although there are some kinda dark moments in this anime it was still the right balance for something like this.But before we get into the review I do want to mention one of the major gripes of the anime which is it's slight harem roots that it shows. It doesn't get to the extent of girls falling all over him but there are some ecchi scenes that pop in here and there, and it isn't as overly exaggerated as some people make it out be, I'd say Nisekoi put the girls in more awkward situations than this Anime does by a long shot and Nisekoi is amazing!Now onward to the review!Story - 9 | Astonishing!DanMachi's story was superb and much better than what I was expecting. I will admit that I came in with extremely low expectations. I had heard the worst from a few reviewers online, so I was honestly expecting total garbage with overly done ecchi scenes like Sakura-Kiss status. So once I started I got hooked, I didn't see an anime this good coming until the summer or later, and honestly I'm glad it came when it did. Spring brought new anime shows that just weren't that good honestly, not terrible but many didn't give me incentive to continue watching. This anime's story was amazing, it felt like I was on adventure the whole way through! However, the only thing I can say bad about the story is a small gripe that screams season 2. We learned a lot about the characters, the particular location of this world, and of course how this world all works and functions. But the one thing that is missing is exploration, they never really travel that far from where the anime starts, and no it isn't bad but I just wish this anime could've been 24 eps with more adventures ahead but this is more of a desire than gripe one could say.Characters - 10 | Unforgettable!Before you lose your mind, a 10 doesn't mean perfect because there is no such thing as perfect. That aside this anime has unforgettable characters especially the main character in the Hestia Famiria. What I mean by unforgettable is that the background story, personality, and how the character was introduced were all a good mix. None of the main characters ever blended into the background or felt like there were there for only support. The story didn't only center around Bell despite him being the main character which allowed the characters to have existence outside of Bell's sight so that you saw the struggles that not even some of the other characters in the anime saw. You kind of knew more about the characters than any other character which felt quite nice. When something would happen that would affect a character you knew it before anyone else and were wondering how things would play out. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and I hope a Season 2 can only help grow those characters and explain other things that the show didn't get enough time to explain.Art/Animation - 9 | Astonishing!First above all I want to say that everything in the anime felt perfectly fit for each other, the background and characters felt as one in the same world and everything felt colorful and popped out well. The animations were extremely good but not silky smooth like some other anime shows are starting to do now but this anime wasn't a slouch either. The best way to say it is that it's an anime that feels perfect and right together in Art and Animation, I think what makes the Art and Animation feel like something higher than a 7 or 8 is how good they complement each other. I just wish the animations could be a bit more silky smooth like we are starting to see lately on some shows cause this anime could've jumped to a 10 depending on how much of the anime was buttery smooth. But the anime as it is now is still beyond average, but something about this anime makes me want to demand more so I could just be picky.Music/Sound - 8 | Amazing!The voice actors and music do its good on the anime, everything felt like a beautifully wrapped package of nice voice acting with an amazing OST to back it up. The fight scenes had music perfect for the moment that kept me at the edge of my seat, and the moments that admired the scenery were partnered with nice background music. But above all the Opening and Ending songs were good, they felt silly and wacky but showed a side of the world that not many shows like this would ever show. You saw an Adventurer also enjoying his daily life with the people he cared about and the music helped emphasize that alongside with Action, Struggle, and Friendship!Enjoyment - 10 | Unforgettable!What can I say about this Anime that I haven't already said, the characters are amazing and have their own back stories that actually hold up and this gives the characters recognition from just a typical support character and helps amplify towards how you feel about that character. The Art and Animation complement each other and help bring the world to life by making not only the world pop but the characters too and making them not seem transparent and feel more real. The OST helped bring the most intense moments to life with heart pumping songs and assisted in catering the most real moments with soothing music to help empathize with the current scene. But of course above all the story had a point A to point B, which took me on an adventure of a life time with amazing characters in an amazing world and all I can truly say is that A and B are not the only letters in the alphabet so I hope a Second Season can take me on more explorations beyond just the world we got to see and help expand the characters even more!Final Rating: 9 | Astonishing  [Exact Rating - 9.2]A perfect anime doesn't exist but this is close enough to that for me, the story, characters, ost, and art was just up to par with everything I consider amazing and honestly this anime is what I'd personally consider the best way to start Summer's amazing line up of 2015 anime shows. If you want an anime that will take you on an adventure in a world where a zero becomes a hero and you want watch him slay cool enemies alongside probably some of the best supporting characters in a long time than this anime is definitely up your alley. While this anime isn't a Sword Art Online clone the few similarities are the story progression and the sense of adventure both of the anime shows carry. I think the one benefit is subtracting the love interest from SAO that this anime doesn't take as seriously, yes the character acknowledges a girl but the story never becomes about the romance between characters which while I don't mind, SAO kind of centered the anime around the relationship between Kirito and Asuna while in this anime is stays more faithful the point A to B and the adventure and struggles between that. Summing up the anime, I'd say it's best to ignore all reviews and come in with a clean mind and judge for yourself what the anime is but don't be surprised when you find yourself giggling, laughing, and going over the edge of your seat on the action scenes.(I apologize if there are any typos) people though fail to realize that Floor Levels weren't an idea created from Sword Art Online, but in fact this idea has existed long before SAO's existence. Almost every Dungeon Crawler RPG has floor levels, I mean just look at Diablo, it's pretty much fighting on different floors with increasing leveled enemies per different dungeon/floor.

I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and I hope a Season 2 can only help grow those characters and explain other things that the show didn't get enough time to explain.Art/Animation - 9 | Astonishing!First above all I want to say that everything in the anime felt perfectly fit for each other, the background and characters felt as one in the same world and everything felt colorful and popped out well. The animations were extremely good but not silky smooth like some other anime shows are starting to do now but this anime wasn't a slouch either. The best way to say it is that it's an anime that feels perfect and right together in Art and Animation, I think what makes the Art and Animation feel like something higher than a 7 or 8 is how good they complement each other. I just wish the animations could be a bit more silky smooth like we are starting to see lately on some shows cause this anime could've jumped to a 10 depending on how much of the anime was buttery smooth. But the anime as it is now is still beyond average, but something about this anime makes me want to demand more so I could just be picky.Music/Sound - 8 | Amazing!The voice actors and music do its good on the anime, everything felt like a beautifully wrapped package of nice voice acting with an amazing OST to back it up. The fight scenes had music perfect for the moment that kept me at the edge of my seat, and the moments that admired the scenery were partnered with nice background music. But above all the Opening and Ending songs were good, they felt silly and wacky but showed a side of the world that not many shows like this would ever show. You saw an Adventurer also enjoying his daily life with the people he cared about and the music helped emphasize that alongside with Action, Struggle, and Friendship!Enjoyment - 10 | Unforgettable!What can I say about this Anime that I haven't already said, the characters are amazing and have their own back stories that actually hold up and this gives the characters recognition from just a typical support character and helps amplify towards how you feel about that character. The Art and Animation complement each other and help bring the world to life by making not only the world pop but the characters too and making them not seem transparent and feel more real. The OST helped bring the most intense moments to life with heart pumping songs and assisted in catering the most real moments with soothing music to help empathize with the current scene. But of course above all the story had a point A to point B, which took me on an adventure of a life time with amazing characters in an amazing world and all I can truly say is that A and B are not the only letters in the alphabet so I hope a Second Season can take me on more explorations beyond just the world we got to see and help expand the characters even more!Final Rating: 9 | Astonishing  [Exact Rating - 9.2]A perfect anime doesn't exist but this is close enough to that for me, the story, characters, ost, and art was just up to par with everything I consider amazing and honestly this anime is what I'd personally consider the best way to start Summer's amazing line up of 2015 anime shows. If you want an anime that will take you on an adventure in a world where a zero becomes a hero and you want watch him slay cool enemies alongside probably some of the best supporting characters in a long time than this anime is definitely up your alley. While this anime isn't a Sword Art Online clone the few similarities are the story progression and the sense of adventure both of the anime shows carry. I think the one benefit is subtracting the love interest from SAO that this anime doesn't take as seriously, yes the character acknowledges a girl but the story never becomes about the romance between characters which while I don't mind, SAO kind of centered the anime around the relationship between Kirito and Asuna while in this anime is stays more faithful the point A to B and the adventure and struggles between that. Summing up the anime, I'd say it's best to ignore all reviews and come in with a clean mind and judge for yourself what the anime is but don't be surprised when you find yourself giggling, laughing, and going over the edge of your seat on the action scenes.(I apologize if there are any typos)"", 'Today we are directly skipping to the review.

Everything in this anime is simply terrible. The characters' development are mediocre, and you can't even enjoy the series quite well as everything inside it sucks. Perhaps the only good thing is this anime was Bell fighting the minotaur... Nothing else.By watching Sword Oratoria, I tend to think even more than I already thought before, that Ais Wallestein shoulda been the main protagonist. Seriously, I don't read...the manga or stuffs like these to see if Bell Crannel's story can actually be far interesting, but if it's, it was poorly adapted. I think the company would have earned more if they started the anime with Wallestein's story, as it is way more explained, and far more developed than this sorryful excuse of anime. I had dropped it long time ago, and I regret myself cotinuing it. I'm sorry if I'm being too harsh, but perhaps even Yosuga no Sora has more story than this, and I'm not even kidding.If you want to watch something interesting related to this, go watch Dungeon ni Deai: Sword Oratoria. It is supposed to be a side story, showing what was happening to Ais whilst she wasn't near Bell Crannel. But it's far, far more interesting, and the story is way more developed and explained. I never thought I'd been writing about an anime saying it's original content is surpassed by a side story, but in the case of Dungeon ni Deai, it is. Enjoy yourself with it, and not this sorry excuse of anime we have here.PS: However, even so, Sword Oratoria has some flaws as well. Firstly some unnecessaries yuri scenes, and secondly, it develops well only from episode 04 onwards. But even so, give it a shot!

This season is just some kind of introduction, so it has nothing else than the growth of an unknown weak adventurer into a heroe. Still the reason why I give the story a 7 is because this premise is good enough but with no second season it achieves little.Some of the biggest insults agains this anime is the typical: Generic SAO clone, which this anime isn't if you bother to watch both animes. First, this...anime, which is an introduction as I said before achieves the goal of telling the story of an adventurer as an adventurer, not as nothing else. What I mean is that this anime tells you about the adventurer himself, not the plot around him, at least as for this season.ArtThe art was pretty good, I can't really say anything more in this aspect. The fights were also animated awesomely and the characters look good.Sound: I didn't really paid attention to the sound, but I do know that the anime never had a single time in which the music was bothering. At the same time I can't remember an awesome song, so that's why the 9.Character:The characters in themselves weren't developed, aside from Bell, the protagonist which is developed, but not significantly, since the anime is just an intro for a possible next season. I have no problems with the characters being done as they were.The characters are well drawn, even though some people have issues with Hestia because she has boobs. A problem would be if those were just shown all the time leaning against Bell's face or the camera, but that's not a problem with this anime.Harem:The anime doesn't have exactly a harem as most people think of. At the first 2 or so episodes the anime looked like it would be just a harem story, but is quickly abandoned the idea. Yeah, in the later episodes there were some harem-ish situations, but they were just like 3 scenes and a pervert scene.Overall: Getting this together I think that 8 would be a good score for this anime. The main problem is that this NEEDS a second season or for the viewer to want to read the novels. If there's not second season planned then this will just be a NO for anyone who doesn't plan to read the novels. anime, which is an introduction as I said before achieves the goal of telling the story of an adventurer as an adventurer, not as nothing else.

Like some animes, this is one that you have to get a few episodes into until you reach the good part of it.Story 7/10At first, we have a young white haired boy that wants to become stronger. He gets attacked by a minotaur and is saved by the ""Sword Princess"" Aiz. Our main protagonist Bell Cranel falls in love with her. The anime follows out with these two parts of...it for a majority of the time. With this you have all your other characters pushing him along their way with their own ideals and personal opinion. I personally disliked that this took up so much of plot with Bell becoming almost obssessed with becoming stronger to the point I couldn\'t stand it. Although there were parts where I found extremely pleasing to watch, its shine was dulled by the overdone screen time the ""supporter"" Lili had with her own personal problems and waters down the anime to having just a good story. On a more positive note, there were some enjoyable fights happening unlike some stories that could care less to even bother. I especially enjoyed the extensive ones which I won\'t spoil any details on. On episode 12, I probably had seen about the worst fight with Bell just getting tossed around. I was hoping for another possibly epic fight, but we have some magic caster that can just go invisible and beat up people. The plot was pretty predictable but enjoyable if you don\'t pay really close attention to every detail. You probably will hate it if you want a more serious and less heavy smashed fan service anime. The ending will be a hit or miss for some of you. For me, it was personally a huge miss because how predictable and unsatisfying it was. Overall, there were some good fights that weren\'t a waste of time, but some had me going ""why?""Art 7/10Here we have a pretty standard art with nothing special to it. It looked consistent and had a bit of a dark color to it throughout, but no wow factor. Everything seemed to be in pretty decent proportion most of the time except for when the heads were oddly shaped in a few cases. Therefore, a solid 7 fits well.Sound 8/10The sound to me was crisp most of the time. Background noises fit well in most occasions and nice background music wasn\'t bothersome to the point I ever really couldn\'t ignore it. Sometimes I found myself enjoying the music altogether.Character 6/10Prepare for a wall of praise and criticism. This is the biggest flaw of ""Is it Wrong to Try to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon?"". There were 3 characters that I never really wanted to ever smash their face in the entire time, and that\'s  Hephaestus, Welf, and Aiz. Welf has a pretty mysterious background and we learn some interesting things about him. He isn\'t overly annoying and has a few odd ideals, but that\'s what makes him a good character unlike the other open book ones. Also, he isn\'t a huge chick magnet like Bell with everyone not caring if he sees them all naked. I just wish he got more screen time. Aiz, my favorite character, is some apparently overpowered princess with a sword that is attracted to Bell in some weird way that I found myself laughing at. She always has her wow moments and beats the crap out of Bell by barely doing anything. Overall, she\'s just an interesting character that keeps everything from being completely retarded and in chaotic. I just wish that she wasn\'t so stupid sometimes. Hephaestus was another cool character that got about close to ZERO screen time. Every other character is just downhill from there. We have Hestia, which is supposedly a goddess but seems just more like a loli punch in the face fan service in her clothes that look like a kid cut up with scissors? She\'s annoying and clingy which makes sense why only Bell is in her familia. She also just adds fuel to this harem. Bell has his good sides and downsides. He has a great composure as the main to be our central protagonist, but it\'s more of the obsessive girls around him that ruin him. I feel like if you take them out of the equation, it could be a better anime altogether. (Except for those people that just watch for the fan service..)  Bell is also retarded in a way like Aiz, but in a way more outgoing and naive way. He trusts everyone and loses just about everything, then says ""Oh well, it\'s ok!"" like nothing ever happened. Also, he is way to overpowered like your Kirito in Sword Art Online. I mean we have a lv2 kid who can destroy everything just because he has the skill to overcome any situation. To keep this from being too long I\'m only going to touch on one more poor character out of the load. This may hint to spoilers a bit. Be warned. Freya is some goddess that is obsessed with powerful adventures. She dresses in skimpy fan service packed clothing for some random creepy reason and watches Bell through her magical ways. I could say a crystal ball, but I\'ll leave it at magical. The authors tried to add her in as a kind of foreshadowing effect, but never do anything with it. I can call this a failure of suspense and failure of a character entirely. If the characters weren\'t done so poorly, this anime could be a lot better.Enjoyment 8/10The concept of giant dungeon MMORPG was portrayed extremely effectively with a pretty decent and standard lore in this shounun. If you\'re a gamer like me, you\'d be drooling over this anime if it were a game. Who wouldn\'t want to have a world where you kill monsters in a dungeon (with who knows how many floors) to make a living and power up as a game? You gain completely random stats based on your ideals and character. Occasionally, some episodes lacked luster and defines harem, but good ones left a lasting effect for me to completely tolerate any little bits of filler while I tried to process what just happened. If you\'re not a fan of RPG games or don\'t care about that, then I don\'t recommend watching.Overall 7/10I can give a solid and respectable 8 for this anime. If we didn\'t have such annoying characters ruining the actual depth of the story, I could (again being said) give a possible 8. The last major part that weighed me down on this brimming with potential anime was the final fight. I feel it was too straightforward because of Bell\'s skills. He\'s gotten boring to watch because of how unstoppable he is now. I would have much rather seen Aiz take that fight on over Bell. We never really got to see her have a major fight, but some other badass moments with her blowing up a minotaur in Bell\'s face, causing him to panic like a baby without a bottle. it for a majority of the time.

A long time ago, gods from the heavens decided it was time for them to have some excitement in their life, so they went down to the world, to live with the inhabitants below. Now this world has a place known as the Dungeon, where creatures when slayed by Adventurers, drop shards which can be exchanged for many things in the world. Bell Cranel is one of these adventurers, and goes on these...adventures in the dungeon in order to improve himself. He’s not trying to pick up girls intentionally, but he does think the stronger he gets he’ll move closer to the girl he looks up to, Aiz Wallenstein. Accompanying Bell, is his goddess, Hestia who helps him with his stats and management. The show really has nothing to do with picking up girls in a dungeon, but more of an underdog story to reach your goals.The story is rather generic to begin with. A protagonist goes out of his way to challenge himself in order to improve himself, to get those around him to notice him. The big overarching problem I find with DanMachi is that the world that the story takes place, needs a better explanation. After doing some extra research, yes the world they do live in is real, just with RPG elements. They don’t explain how this came to pass, you’re just going to have to accept it’s a real world with RPG elements. And that feels like a cop out, they already explained that gods came into the world, why don’t they expand on that, besides came down onto the world and lived with the residents. The plot overall is average, it’s nothing special, but it’s not bad. It just really needed to work on its lore, and it doesn't help that the story is kind of generic.Characters - 6/10Bell Cranel is our main protagonist of DanMachi, and he literally fulfils the job criteria of almost a lot of protagonist in this type genre. Is he weak, but’s gets stronger as the series progress? Yes. Is he a nice guy? Yes. Is he a somewhat good looking teenage boy? Yes. Does He attract a lot of girls along the way? Yes. And is he oblivious to the obvious surrounding girls who want him already? YES. Now to be fair I like Bell as a protagonist, he’s not douche as the title would've suggest him going to dungeons to pick up girls for his own enjoyment. I do like how the story centres around Bell, and we get to see him really grow as the series went on. But perhaps the reason he grows a bit slow is because he’s completely naïve and trusts everyone despite how they look.Hestia is Bell’s goddess and he is her familia. Apart from being the character for her iconic blue ribbon and tone of amount of fan service, she is fulfils the role as the main female protagonist. She has an obvious thing for Bell, and gets overly jealous for all the girls he obliviously attract. As the series go on, there isn’t really much development for her character other than the fact she starts off worried about Bell, but starts to have more confident in him later on. So it’s a shame for a character with that much hype to be underdeveloped, but then again she was hyped for ribbon.Unfortunately, the main cast aren’t all that interesting compared to their supporting cast. Each supporting cast character has a purpose, as they all play a role in levelling up Bell. Each supporting cast character backstory is interesting enough for the time it was shown and they are important to the storyline. Aiz, is Bell’s driving force to become stronger. Lili, not only being Bell’s supporter, helps him grow as a leader. And Welf Crozzo, despite his many appearance in the opening and ending, only shows up for the last 4 episodes, shows to be the Big Brother type Bell needed to help him move forward. Because they are supporting characters, they get their fair share enough of screen time. However as for a general overview of the cast, I must say it’s not a very strong cast, sure they all fulfil their role and are interesting in some way, but there wasn’t really anyone you could delve very deep into. There wasn’t really anyone that caught my eye.Animation and Sound - 9/10, 6/10Here is where DanMachi shines brightest. The animation for the fight scenes in DanMachi look incredible. It is well animated and well-polished, it moves smoothly and looks clean. What I like about the animation is that we get enough of it to be well entertained, it doesn’t go by quickly, but at the same time it doesn’t drag too long. The art design is clean as well, and it really fits that bright fantasy world setting. Each character has a unique design, but that being said unfortunately I find the monster designs kind of generic. They come in range of typical fantasy creatures, with very generic looking designs and they give them red glowing eyes to signify it’s a monster, but this only applies to the common monsters, I do like the designs of the Boss Monsters, they look cool. Throw those in with the amazing fight scenes and you have an epic animated sequence.As for the soundtrack of DanMachi, all I can say is it does its job well. It’s a fantasy genre so expect something to mesh with it. You get a lot violins and pianos here and there. There is even a good accordion for the bar scenes, which is really nice to have in the fantasy genre. It really makes you feel like you were in that fantasy world. However all I can say is that I didn’t find anything outstanding in the soundtrack, even for the epic fight scenes, the soundtrack for it didn’t sound suspenseful enough for it, it should’ve been more intense to add as if the protagonist was going to lose, but it was very quiet. For the opening and ending songs of DanMachi, they are catchy with cute sequences to go along with them.Enjoyment - 7/10I’ve seen many shows like this before. It is rather typical and generic. It’ll have to do something special to really get my attention, however the story is rather basic and the cast of characters aren’t all that interesting as a whole, individually their fine, but there need to be more from them. The most enjoyment I got out of the show was watching the action scenes and incredible visuals, which is where I think the anime shines. You feel so immerse the world because looks good, and filled with nice colours. And as a typical fantasy lover, I do enjoy this type of show very much. The show besides the concept and title, isn’t really breathtaking as a whole.Verdict - 6.5/10For the story of DanMachi I give it an 5, as I believe it’s an average story at best, it’s been done many times and don’t get me wrong it’s pulled off well and was evenly paced, but it’s so generic you most likely seen it many times. Plus the whole lore behind their world vaguely explained.For animation and sound I give them a 9 and 6 respectively. The Animation is incredible to look at, it really depicts the fantasy world very well. The action scenes looked good and the designs of characters and boss look good, it was just the common creatures that were lacking. The soundtrack does a decent job of fitting in with the fantasy theme, but it was really lacking anything special. But the opening and ending themes were catchy and cute though.The Characters of DanMachi get a 6 from me, as they are generic, but without them the story wouldn’t be nearly as good as it could’ve been. Each character had a purpose of helping Bell grow, but that is all there is to them. There wasn’t really any character that stood out from the crowd. No one was really special.For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7, as I have seen many depictions of this type of genre before. The story is really basic and the characters are lacking a spark to them. However I enjoyed seeing the world that was created, through the visuals and being a fan of the fantasy genre. I wished they explained more on the world, as that was something I found a bit confusing, seeing how everything worked. But I got enough dose of action when it came the fight scenes, as there was plenty of them and they were paced.For the overall score after rounding it all up I give DanMachi a 6.5/10. It has basic plot and a generic set of characters who have their moments. The soundtrack is nothing special, but it’s the animation that pushes it forward. The depiction of the fantasy world and the action scenes were the best thing about the series. I recommend this anime to fantasy fan, as the world is gorgeous to look at, but for the rest there have been many other shows that have been done better. adventures in the dungeon in order to improve himself. He’s not trying to pick up girls intentionally, but he does think the stronger he gets he’ll move closer to the girl he looks up to, Aiz Wallenstein.

And we both enjoyed it quite a bit, we really did. It was aesthetically pleasing to the eye and we got a good laugh of out of it for the first few episodes.Then when it hit about episode 3, we started noticing animation errors or noticing that the same soundtrack was playing in the background again. Events became predictable (not that they weren't already, but we were able...to ignore it because of the fun we were having) and the charm of it quickly began to wear off.As we approached the finale, we started watching it more as a chore, we wanted to at least see it through to the end. And overall, the finale was just not satisfying enough for us to not feel watching this anime was a waste of time. Sure, we'll remember what the character's designs were and what their personalities (or in Hestia's case, assets) were. Even if some of the RPG elements in a functioning fantasy world seemed enticing at first, we'll probably never rewatch it, or recommend to anyone. to ignore it because of the fun we were having) and the charm of it quickly began to wear off.As we approached the finale, we started watching it more as a chore, we wanted to at least see it through to the end.

Bell was the main character, and around him were many girls who really loved him and worshipped him. (Harem) which I didn\'t see ""Harem"" in genre.2. Bell\'s personality is annoying and uninteresting, he is just pathetic, always being sorry for everything and a real coward.3. Bell is OP. To avoid spoilers, I\'ll just say he\'s really OP.From reasons 1-3, I\'ll rate the characters with a rating of 54. Interference in every interesting scene. When...there\'s an interesting scene between Bell and a girl, it always has to be ruined, making it into ""Comedy"", well some people may like it at least.5. There isn\'t a story line or developing plot. The anime just ""happens"". Characters come every some episodes, adding to the count of the girls more girls and make it more Harem.Story will get 3.6. Opening and ending were boring and uninteresting. Well, as far as I know, openings should be cool and make the watcher want to watch the anime.Well, not this time. I\'ve heard the opening and ending and then I\'m every episode I skipped on the opening.The soundtrack wasn\'t really good and not noticeable.Sound: 5Art will get 7 since it was OK.

It has its own style and twist to it and for me comparable to SAO in enjoyment.Great story and plot, awesome fights and a great main character; Bell is simply awesome you really form an attachment and find yourself rooting for him all the way. He's one of the reasons I enjoyed this show so much.Art is simply beautiful with the fighting scenes giving you goosebumps.If you haven't watched this yet...I urge you to do so cause its one of the best shows of this genre and you won't regret giving it a chance.

Ahg! Full of fanservice? What? Maybe it's because I just got done re-watching some of Monster Musume, (Which is like all fan service). I don't get how people could say DanMachi has a lot of fan service!There is a bit. But to say there is a lot is freaking crazy.Then there are the people saying it's full of cliches. As if that's a bad thing! It doesn't matter if something has cliches. It's the way the story is executed. And DanMachi is wonderful in execution. Some of these scenes brought me to...tears! And that isn't exactly a common occurrence for me. I could name the anime that have made me produce flowing tears on one hand!Cliches are wonderful when they're done right. They can bring comfort due to their familiarity.But it didn't even occur to me that it might have cliches until I saw people talking about it in reviews...The video game setting has been becoming more common recently, is that what they're talking about? I love that sort of thing. And DanMachi is a special case, I love how it cuts out the reality portion and just gives us the game world. The main character isn't even a person from our world sent to their world. If anything that makes it not a cliche, or at least I would think so. But no.This is one of those anime where the main character seems to have girls fall for him left and right. But come on, given everything that happens in this anime their reasons for liking him at least feel realistic. They range from hardcore love to small crushes and I understand each of them.It doesn't feel forced like the girls in SAO did.Now, on the surface, it does seem like he's oblivious to their affections. But I don't know, I'd give them a point here and admit it was a cliche. But there's just something about Bell's body language that makes me think he knows what going on, he's just not sure what to do with it so he's trying not to focus on it... If that makes sense.It's not so much a spoiler without the contexts. Or at least I hope not. But there's a scene where two of his closest friends. Hestia and girl No2. (let's make it vague so it's even less spoiler.) start fighting over Bell. He runs off to get away from their bickering for a bit and just outside he pauses to listen. He knows, there's no way he doesn't know.Not with that smile.But enough of that. I don't watch these anime for that. I watch them for the fantasy worlds.I love all the small details that make the world feel even more real. I love the factions and the goddesses, I love the dungeon. It reminds me of a Playstation one games I started playing last week. Azure Dreams! The dungeon in DanMachi is a lot like that one.In case you haven't heard of it, it's a lot like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon with a fantasy theme. I wouldn't be surprised if the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games were inspired by RPGs like this. But I honestly wouldn't know. I might be into this stuff but the information around themis a total blank for me. lolI just play and watch 'em. haha.A lot of video game anime have at least some connection to the real world. Some game anime take a lot of time away from the game world to be in the real world. Like Recovery Of An MMO Junkie! Hardly any gameplay was shown aside from standing around talking and sitting in a tree.(╬ Ò ‸ Ó) WOW, That's like SOOOO exciting. NOT!Don't get me wrong, I actually liked that anime. But I don't like it as a video game anime. It's trash as a video game anime.Sometimes we see some fighting, especially at the start, but it's sooo unsatisfying compared to the stuff we see in DanMachi.(҂⌣̀_⌣́) But that's because the game isn't the main focus in that anime, it's the romance that they're interested in. They should be giving attention to both but they hardly try.When I watch a video game anime I want to actually see the VIDEO GAME! DanMachi gets that, it gets it so much that we don't even have a real world to take away from the video game world. σ(≧ε≦ｏ)Imagine, gamer friends, imagine if the world of a JRPG was a real place. That's what DanMachi explores, and it's great. That in and of itself might not be so rare, but an anime that takes place solely within a world of a game without a connection to the real world, without the main character being whisked away there, as far as I've seen is.It's nice to have this kind of anime play out this way for once. I'd love to play a video game based on it. I'd love to see even more of this world. It isn't just some guilty pleasure anime. Not for me, it isn't.For me, it's an inspiring story about a boy who lost everything and wants to become stronger. A boy no one saw any potential in until a goddess who understood how he felt gave him a chance to prove himself.Every episode we see him fighting harder and harder to grow and to change and when we see him succeed it feels deserved. He isn't another OP anime character who out of no where has these god-like powers and one hits everything.He's a guy who works for everything he has. He's a character that won't give up no matter what and it feels so good when he finally wins. Because we watched him work for it.that's something a lot of anime forget. It takes effort to be the best. Sure, it can be fun to watch characters who are already the best take control of the situation and win. Like Shiroe from Log Horizon. He was an expert with the game before him and all the other players got trapped there. He's great, but wasn't anyone else curious about what it was like for him at the start as he was learning the ropes and improving? We don't get to see that side of him.Because Bell is a new adventurer we get to watch him work his way up from the bottom.I don't get the hate. And I don't get how the hate managed to get upvoted to the top of the reviews. it's ridiculous.¯\\_( ◉ 3 ◉ )_/¯ But at the end of the day, every anime is a sack of shit or a masterpiece to somebody. It just happens to feel nicer when more people agree with you.Still, a seven score isn't half bad~! And a 7.83 at that! That's practically an eight.This anime might have some bad reviews up at the top, but the score shows me it's far from being underrated. It would be too sad if that was the case. tears!

The dungeon in DanMachi is a lot like that one.In case you haven't heard of it, it's a lot like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon with a fantasy theme. I wouldn't be surprised if the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games were inspired by RPGs like this. But I honestly wouldn't know. I might be into this stuff but the information around themis a total blank for me. lolI just play and watch 'em. haha.A lot of video game anime have at least some connection to the real world. Some game anime take a lot of time away from the game world to be in the real world. Like Recovery Of An MMO Junkie! Hardly any gameplay was shown aside from standing around talking and sitting in a tree.(╬ Ò ‸ Ó) WOW, That's like SOOOO exciting. NOT!Don't get me wrong, I actually liked that anime. But I don't like it as a video game anime. It's trash as a video game anime.Sometimes we see some fighting, especially at the start, but it's sooo unsatisfying compared to the stuff we see in DanMachi.(҂⌣̀_⌣́) But that's because the game isn't the main focus in that anime, it's the romance that they're interested in. They should be giving attention to both but they hardly try.When I watch a video game anime I want to actually see the VIDEO GAME! DanMachi gets that, it gets it so much that we don't even have a real world to take away from the video game world. σ(≧ε≦ｏ)Imagine, gamer friends, imagine if the world of a JRPG was a real place. That's what DanMachi explores, and it's great. That in and of itself might not be so rare, but an anime that takes place solely within a world of a game without a connection to the real world, without the main character being whisked away there, as far as I've seen is.It's nice to have this kind of anime play out this way for once. I'd love to play a video game based on it. I'd love to see even more of this world. It isn't just some guilty pleasure anime. Not for me, it isn't.For me, it's an inspiring story about a boy who lost everything and wants to become stronger. A boy no one saw any potential in until a goddess who understood how he felt gave him a chance to prove himself.Every episode we see him fighting harder and harder to grow and to change and when we see him succeed it feels deserved. He isn't another OP anime character who out of no where has these god-like powers and one hits everything.He's a guy who works for everything he has. He's a character that won't give up no matter what and it feels so good when he finally wins. Because we watched him work for it.that's something a lot of anime forget. It takes effort to be the best. Sure, it can be fun to watch characters who are already the best take control of the situation and win. Like Shiroe from Log Horizon. He was an expert with the game before him and all the other players got trapped there. He's great, but wasn't anyone else curious about what it was like for him at the start as he was learning the ropes and improving? We don't get to see that side of him.Because Bell is a new adventurer we get to watch him work his way up from the bottom.I don't get the hate. And I don't get how the hate managed to get upvoted to the top of the reviews. it's ridiculous.¯\\_( ◉ 3 ◉ )_/¯ But at the end of the day, every anime is a sack of shit or a masterpiece to somebody. It just happens to feel nicer when more people agree with you.Still, a seven score isn't half bad~! And a 7.83 at that! That's practically an eight.This anime might have some bad reviews up at the top, but the score shows me it's far from being underrated. It would be too sad if that was the case."", '[a spoiler free review]I know this Review is pretty late as Danmachi or Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka or Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? (gawd damm no matter what language this title is always long) came out in 2015 but regardless i hope this will serve as a help to some in the future.Danmachi folows the story of the albino grandson of the ""legendary"" Kazuto ""Kirito, The Black Swordsman, Beater, Kazu"" Kiri-gay-ya? (they have the same voice actor in Japanese so you cant say im wrong) Bell Cranel and his personal goddess of...hotness who is the literal granddaughter of Uranus (google it if you dont believe me) and their adventure through the giant dildo that penetrates earth and everyone calls ""the dungeon""Bell Cranel is your typical dull brained-harem centered protagonist who enjoyes his relaxing life alongside a goddess whos literal nickname is ""Loli Big-Boobs"" and whos best friend is hepatitis or Hephaestus, alongside that she also holds the title of being one of the ""Big 3 Virgin Goddesses"".SO Bell cranel pretty much has everything a typical heterosexual man can wish for, so what does he decide to do?he decides to go into the dungeon and pick up girls (WHAT A MADLAD PLAYER) where he will meet the legendary sword princess who dips him in tomato sauce ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), and overtime he will amass a harem of 3-gods ,2-amazonas, 2-nekos, 2-elves, 1-human, a shouta and a random dwarf(only is kinda funny if or when you watch the show but otherwise not accurate).The Shows overall quality is pretty mediocer but its something ive personally found to enjoy a lot due to how stupid it is and how seeing the progression of plot armor thicc and big dicc main character.The story is nothing special and i might even be able to name 100 shows similar too this (if i cant now i will in the future ;Þ)The art is basic and something you\'ll find anywhere but the show is bright and i like bright anime\'s so a + from meThe sounds are pretty decent as the ost includes a legendary arrangement of songs which make the basic anime video game fights fun and exiting to look at.personally id recommend you\'d watch the show while eating or drinking something sweet as it will keep you happy throughout the show and amplify the moments of adrenaline.The show is something stupid but prolly a 50/50 coin-flip must-watch at least in my opinion.Specially since this has in some part become a part cultural phenomenon of anime as a whole leaving such ancient quotes as ""Hestia is Bestia""Even though im personally #TeamAiz the boba fett character who had 149 words of dialogue in this anime ;)Hope You\'ll EnjoyBest Regards.

Ser_Junkan', 'There\'s a lot of hate that gets thrown at this show. But I\'m here to tell you that it\'s okay to like it. It may not be Champloo or Steins;Gate or even Grimgar, but you\'re allowed to like it. Not every anime needs to be an exercise in critical reflection.There\'s a lot of people comparing this to SAO and if you liked SAO you\'ll probably like this too. But by no means is that an insult. If you like Magi, you\'ll like this too. If you like RPG and Game type anime you\'re in for a nice time.The protagonist is kind and in no way...obnoxious. He\'s not moody or overly immature. He exists in a world in which he\'s not totally OP and encounters real challenges. Female characters don\'t suddenly become useless when he shows up. It\'s a nice, fun show with just enough drama to keep you going. There was definitely a part where I was saying ""don\'t worry there\'s other episodes, he can\'t possibly die"" followed by ""OH MY GOD HE MADE IT"".If you\'re not into semi light-hearted, floor clearing, fantasy rpg anime then avoid it. But I for one quite liked it and hope you all give it a shot. obnoxious. He\'s not moody or overly immature. He exists in a world in which he\'s not totally OP and encounters real challenges.

I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and you should give it a shot as well!"", ""The series starts with a narrative that gives some insight into the world of DanMachi, explaining the source of the powers that people possess. Some of the story elements are from RPG's like the level up system.The system is used in many contexts in the show to signify not only character growth but status in their society, as in a ranking system. Though it has been used in other stories like Sword Art Online, or Log Horizon, unlike those series this series incorporates it into their world as a fundamental part of the social structure. This is the case with the Gods and their...roles as well, as they seem more like rich patrons at times who fund various people who are part of their 'Familia' or Family.This becomes very apparent when we see the Hestia Family, consisting of only Bell Cranel and the Goddess Hestia, who live in an abandoned church. Being a small Family they lacked the wealth of the larger and well established Families.Bell Cranel is a very enjoyable character, being presented as a young naive teenager with dreams of romance and adventure, a kind heart, humble and honest demeanor.After falling in love with Aiz Wallenstein he strives to become stronger so as to be closer to her.Aiz appears as a mysterious young women, and is later revealed to be the 'Sword Princess' an extremely powerful sword user, as well as one of the highest level adventurers mentioned in the series.Though I liked that the writers tried to present her as being mysterious I did find her character to be too mysterious. She is very expressionless, and seems somewhat detached. Her lines through out the anime are few and far between, and her character is developed probably the least through the series.Mainly the story focuses on the adventures of Bell, and his interactions between various other characters he meets. Lili a small hobbit like girl with a charming personality, but whose dark past influences her motivations. Welf a young passionate blacksmith, and most importantly the relationship between Bell and Hestia his Goddess, who is infatuated with him, and his boyish charm.The art in the anime was done very well. A bright pallet, well drawn characters, with well done action scenes. They did well in presenting a fluidity to Bell's motions, and fire effects. I thought the eyes to be very expressive, though Aiz again is an exception. The character design was also varied as non of the characters really look alike aside from a set of twins who are part of Aiz's Familia.The sound of the anime really brought depth and power to the scenes. The crunching of the gravel and rocks under the hooves of a Minotaur, and its howl. The voice acting in the Japanese anime was spot on and brought life to the characters. Bell was soft spoken as was Aiz, and I would suggest if anyone did wish to watch the series to watch it in Japanese, as I find English voice actors to be atrocious and far less skilled then their Japanese counter parts, lacking the ability to convey emotion.The series hints at an overall plot, but does not really delve too deeply into it. This is primarily a character driven anime, following Bell and his perspectives, as well as a few others. Though I did like the fast pace, it seemed at times that they wanted to cram too much content into each episode, and after reading some of the manga I realized that they left a good portion of the story out to do so. Not important elements, but enough that it may make the anime appear to lack depth in some areas as some of the parts fleshed out in the manga, are left undone in the series.Though it has qualities of a harem it really doesn't go too far into that realm, nor does it have many scenes that could be described as being ecchi. The few times they use them are humorous, and help reveal the shy nature of Bell, but they are not a large part of the series. The romance in the series is not really strong either, we get a sense of the affections numerous female characters have for Bell, but he doesn't seem to be that interested in most of them, again except for Aiz, whom he has an unreasonable infatuation for, yet the series never really tries to establish a solid relationship between Bell and Aiz, only hinting at a mutual affection.Though it does share similarities with other anime, one should try not to compare it.  I found it better then Sword Art Online as i enjoyed the main character more. Though Bell does become very powerful I find that it was done well enough to be consistent with the themes of the story, as the overall theme is about a boy who wishes to become a hero.Overall I found this anime to be quite enjoyable, and have watched it several time.

In the town Orario is a place commonly known as ""Dungeon"" where many adventurers come to fight monsters and use the loot they get to make a decent living. Together with his goddess Hestia, he works really hard to fulfill his goal, meeting several friends along the way, and growing up as an adventurer, as well as a person.The people of Orario city join familias which...offer services such as dungeon crawling and item crafting. It\'s a sort of guilds/clubs that you can find in MMORPGs mostly.DanMachi has 13 episodes which means that the story is moving very fast, and the story isn\'t told in the best way. It\'s really interesting, but it feels cluttered into 13 episodes, as if somebody tried to rush the synopsis.The point of the story is that you always need to have a goal in your life, no matter how hard and impossible it is. After all, that is what makes it a worthy goal - worthy enough that you devote your life to it. Also, you should never try to do everything on your own. Don\'t carry the burden by yourself, there is always somebody who can help you and take a piece of it. Don\'t close up, somebody will come sometime for sure. ^_^CharactersIn DanMachi we have two main characters.First MC is Bell Cranel. Bell is a 14 year old boy with white hair and red eyes. He likes to wear light armor and uses a dagger as a weapon. He is a kind, shy, and easily intimidated. Throughout the story he doesn\'t change at all. He does what he believes is right, even if it costs him more than it\'s worth. He cares about his friends, especially his goddess Hestia. He has a special relationship with her because she took him in and offered him a familiar when he needed it the most.Second MC is Hestia. Hestia is a goddess also known as ""Loli Big-Boobs"" representing her stature and body (she is small and has big breasts okay? Fanservice OP). She is very energetic and kind. She sees potential in Bell so she tries her best to support him in his goal. She is hard-working when it comes to helping Bell but in truth she is lazy  and a glutton, which makes most other deities dislike her. She made Bell her first member of familia and granted him ""God\'s Grace"" a.k.a. her blessing.ArtDanMachi is made by studio J.C.Staff. That means the art style is similiar to that of: Toradora, Kaichou wa Maid-Sama!, Shokugeki no Souma etc. Characters are done well, even thought it\'s not the best to be honest. MCs are done well and few other support characters. The rest of characters look boring, and their expressions seem to vacant for the situation.There is also way too much fanservice.Music/SoundsOP and ED are...meh. I didn\'t mind it but I don\'t feel like listening to it again either. It\'s just average. The sounds are done really well though. The grinning, grunting, sighs and sounds of desperation are...realistic. I was really surprised by how well they are done. I haven\'t seen many anime with that good sound effects. They are amazing :3SummaryAll in all, DanMachi is a cute anime, with a setting that I personally am a sucker for (dungeon crawiling). I\'d call this a less serious version of Sword Art Online, with much more fanservice.Talking about fanservice, there is a lot of it here, so if you like fanservice, you will love this anime.

Now, I have to say the setting is great.  I loved SAO (Sword Art Online) and this setting was no different, adventurers going into Dungeons and leveling up and obtaining higher level powers.  I found it interesting with the addition of the Gods and Goddesses, which was refreshing.Art was good, typical is my opinion, nothing...more to say.Sound - loved the music is was fun, intense at times and allowed the viewer to be enticed by each scene.Character - Now, let me preface this with it was only a 13 ep season...the character development could have been existentially better.  I'm a sucker for the weak character growing and becoming popular with everyone when he shows just how powerful he can become.....but there NEEDED to be more. There are a number of anime that have this story line (and I love most of them!) but this development to me needed something.....extra to make this first season better.  The cliff hanger wasn't there for me; there needed to be another extra bite for me to keep wanting the second season. I will wait for the second season, but not on the edge of my seat.Enjoyment - I loved watching this anime. I was looking and watching and waiting at every event and turn waiting for the next development.Overall - Like I stated earlier I love this type of genre and will never stop!  It's a very predictable story line, but that doesn't stop it from being great! If you're into character development then you might be disappointed, but remember this is MY opinion and everyone likes different levels of development.  So to end my first review....good anime, I wish there was something else to add to the excitement of a second season, still a good watch, so set some time aside and watch it!-No_way_bro_ more to say.Sound - loved the music is was fun, intense at times and allowed the viewer to be enticed by each scene.Character - Now, let me preface this with it was only a 13 ep season...the character development could have been existentially better.

If you're into character development then you might be disappointed, but remember this is MY opinion and everyone likes different levels of development.  So to end my first review....good anime, I wish there was something else to add to the excitement of a second season, still a good watch, so set some time aside and watch it!-No_way_bro_"", 'To all the guys out there, it can be really annoying if you flirt with a girl while playing MMOs, especially in a dungeon. Never ever try to pick up a girl in a dungeon and here is why: Enjoy reading my review on the anime Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?/ Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka? (This is even longer than ""Beautiful Bones"" 😑😑).Plot & Story Line 💭📜Now where should I start when it comes to this anime? It is an action, adventure, fantasy, romance anime produced by Genco in 2015. It has...a rating of 7.88 and is quite popular in the anime world. I always tried to avoid watching it because I thought it was just another mainstream, fantasy anime with a MMO-like setting without any actual story. But I was so wrong!Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is a story about Bell Cranel, a very enthusiastic young  adventurer who makes his living by selling crystals he gets from killing monsters in the dungeon. He is the one and only member of the Hestia family formed by the goddess Hestia. In a world full of other large families and strong adventurers, Bell is trying to get stronger and become a great adventurer just as his late grandfather was. Soon, a very exciting, funny and moving story begins that becomes better episode for episode.As said in the beginning, the setting of the story seemed too mainstream and is in fact something you\'ve probably seen before, but the makers still made it unique. It is the story that carries a lot of excitement. It starts off as a simple story but becomes more complex episode by episode. As more characters are introduced the story becomes heavier and definitely more interesting. The thing about this anime is that the story is actually carried more by the side characters. They are always the trigger for the happenings and events that our main character, Bell goes trough. His story, on the other hand, is still in the center but with a lot of question marks. Thing is, those are not plot holes but something we\'ll have to wait for in the second season. Watching the anime you slowly get to see the larger picture that is Bell\'s life and his past. I must say this, in the beginning I didn\'t think that I\'d love it so much, but it was the end that made me fall in love with this anime. An exciting story gets an amazing and logical (not a typical non-sense) plot-twist that gives you answers to most of your previous questions but creates a lot more.The genre adventure is just right for this anime but action is also an indispensable part of the description. The fights, powers and skills were just the right thing for a fantasy/action fan like me. The fights are thrilling and unforeseen, whereas the powers are just magical. They really contribute to a better story and entertainment of the anime. You enjoy every second of the anime always wanting more and more.Now, despite a little bit of harem and fan-service going around in the anime I pretty much enjoyed it. The story also carries a lot of humor with it and some really funny moments that make my laugh really hard. As for the romance, there are some romantic but mostly funny scenes that are all part of the little harem around Bell-kun. Still it is enjoyable and doesn\'t actually ruin the story in any way. Moreover, I though about the perfect match for Bell the whole time and I just hope it won\'t become another ""I love Emilia"" thing in the end.In the end I\'d like to mention the very moral of the story. No, it is not the answer to the question Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon, that is just a nice metaphor for the excitement and fun the dungeon offers. The moral is to always believe in ourselves and never compare ourselves to others. We are all unique and the heroes of our own stories, so why the steady wish to become a sidekick of someone else\'s?In short, if you want a funny, exciting adventure that will boost your self-confidence in just thirteen episodes this anime is a thing for you. Also if you\'re a fan of a lot of magic, action and fantasy be sure to give ""Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon"" a try.Characters 👩👦As said, all the characters in Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon contributed to the story. The makers really put a lot of effort in the development of personalities of each character. The three characters that I liked the most and I wanted to see more about were definitelly Bell, Hestia and Lion.Now, Bell is reminds me of myself in some points and that is probably why I liked him as a character. Always seeing the good in people, always looking from the more beautiful side, Bell is a dreamer who is working hard to achieve his goals. And one more thing about Bell, he is the first over-powered MC I didn\'t hate instantly. Hestia is an adorable and impulsive little goddess. She hasn\'t that much of a special personality but is sweet and caring. I hope we\'ll find out more about her and her past in the upcoming season.The character I liked the most is a side-character that is probably always forgotten, Lion Ryu. The reason I liked her so much is her past. She has a really dramatic past but deals with it in her own way. She is a strong, independent young woman that is always on the side of justice and the weak. I loved her personality and especially her wind-powers. She was just amazing.Animation & Style 🎨📺The animation of  Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is amazing. Bright colors, amazing backgrounds and beautiful settings. I especially loved the character design. All characters have something special and have a really unique design. The style is typical fantasy like and I loved it.Conclusion 📌✅To conclude everything, I\'d say that  Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is an anime for almost everyone. Despite its mainstream setting it has a really intriguing plot and a moving and exciting story. The characters are not the best one\'s I\'ve ever seen but at least they don\'t ruin the story. The animation and style are on point. So, if you want an anime with a good story to make you laugh and just relax for about 6h  Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is an anime for you! a rating of 7.88 and is quite popular in the anime world.

I didn\'t know much about anime or knew any friends that were into it at the time so I just kinda picked up random series that I thought sounded interesting and in doing so I ended up stopping on a series called Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? I don\'t really have to explain why I thought this sounded cool as i\'m pretty sure anyone reading this review found...the title to be pretty  ""interesting"" to say the least.I really didn\'t enjoy this anime that much but I also didn\'t hate it. It wasn\'t god awful but it certainly wasn\'t that great. It kind of reminded me of SAO but if SAO\'s main male wasn\'t edgy for the sake of being an edgy annoying basta... Sorry I really don\'t like him but anyway back to this show. The main character\'s not totally unlikable as he never really made me totally want to hit him but at the same time he wasn\'t interesting at all.. He was just stale, he wasn\'t all that funny he wasn\'t relatable of likable at all but at the same time he wasn\'t arrogant or anything, he was just... nothing. As for the rest of the characters, I can only consider one the slightest bit memorable and that\'s the Goddess, Hestia. The only reason I consider her memorable is because of her... personality, she seemed more like a main character than Bell, she actually seemed to somewhat have a personality and we got to see her relationship with the other goddess\' and god\'s, she was actually pretty likable and we got more of a backstory to her than with the actual main character Bell. she set up all the the jokes for the most part and made this show go from a complete train wreck to a decent anime. She certainly wasn\'t the best character in terms of development but allot of people do find her to be the most likable character in the show.Despite what this title says this series doesn\'t have much to do with ""Picking up girls in a dungeon"" sure he gets allot of girls and stuff but the premise of the show isn\'t picking up girls in a dungeon, it\'s such a click-baity title that i\'m surprised it\'s not the title to a YouTube video. The art work was pretty basic in terms of todays standards and the fight scenes were mediocre a best. The only real way i\'d ever recommend you watch this anime is if you want to just learn about Hestia or just stare at her... Personality, but even than you can do that on lots of other ""sites"" and get a better story than this one. It\'s not bad but it\'s also not that great, not to mention there\'s only one season so if you do decide to give the series a shot i\'d just recommend reading the Manga, I have never read the manga so I can\'t really say if it\'s all that good but I have heard it\'s about as good as the anime. the title to be pretty  ""interesting"" to say the least.I really didn\'t enjoy this anime that much but I also didn\'t hate it.

The distant, overly-capable love interest, the hero that needs to grow up, the friend with a support role, several side love interest who don't stand a chance; anyway all very well done but with no excitement. The main character is the weakest link, since he is just the hero as designated by the plot, he goes into the dungeon as every other adventurer, but because he got an special ability which lets him level up faster...he becomes stronger. Thus he has no admirable qualities to set him apart from the rest, he was just chosen.Plot: it is generic, but competently executed. There is a half thought mystery thrown into the mix, which it's not develop in the 13 episodes, one of those read the manga animes. The whole harem aspect it's the worst part, the love interest is determined very early on, so you know the rest have no chance. This results in a series of female characters with no purpose.Animation: the color palette is an intriguing choice. It is very bright, and it contrast very well with the darker parts of the dungeon, but at the same time is very artificial, almost takes you away from the story. In the end, it's so bright an unreal that makes it hard to take serious the more dramatic aspects of the plot.Conclusion: an enjoyable anime just to pass the time, but it's very shallow.

It has probably my favorite anime fight scenes of all time. Anyways, this anime is about a boy named Bell Cranel who, one day, is saved from a minotaur by this famous swordswoman, Ainz Wallenstein. Bell instantly falls in love and realized that if he wants to be her girlfriend he would have to be able to stand side by side with her. Which meant that Bell had to get stronger.This anime follows the journey of a weak MC who strives to get stronger and stronger to reach his goal. The anime utilizes...its CGI so well and the markets and streets feel so alive. The characters are all bright, colorful, and have meaning. Bell's partner Lilli has this hearttearing back story that makes u understand why she does what she does (watch the anime) and when you see how Bell acts toward her it makes you appreciate him a lot more. You can tell Bell truly appreciates his friends and cares deeply for them, willing to sacrifice himself.The action and intensity in this anime is so well done. I won't spoil much bc it's the best fight scene of the anime but there's one scene that puts you on the very fucking edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. The fight is so brilliantly well done with the CGI and music. The fucking ost, Argonaut, is so epic and just adds to the atmosphere of the anime. The comedy is also well done combined with cute characters and situations. Just amazing. This anime is a definite 10/10 highly recommended for those who want to see the growth of a weak MC, zero to hero anime.

There's a massive variety of body types, facial structure, shades of blacks & browns and other small details to make these characters stand out in a crowd, without making them look out of place.Cohesion is one of my favourite things in this show, there's no CGI crowds in the busy streets - Everything has variety, background cast members look like they could easily be main cast in another show (Some literally are) - Buildings have variety and style. It's all really high quality.The music too is fantastic, it has a sense of wholesomeness to it. The vocal tracks are all delightful and set a mood of light-hearted adventure, while the background OsT is varied and suitable for any moment the show has need of it - Honestly Danmachi excels at being a modern anime, it never feels like its a light novel or manga that's been ported to the tv screen, rather everything blends together almost immersively.The direction of fights and ecchi alike is expert and really it's hard to believe this anime is 7 years old - If someone tells you the show is 'just fine' production wise, then I can only presume they've accidentally watched something else, I give Danmachi full marks in all three regards.Also note worthy is the dub - I love the original sub and dub did take some getting used to but once you do, you'll realise its spot on - The voices all fit, and Bell's VA does a great job of making awkward phrases like 'My Goddess' (Kami-Sama in the sub) sound like something Bell would actually say despite being a mouthful.There's a light breezy quality to the dialogue and Lily's voice-actress (One of favourites in general ever since Full Metal Panic) does a brilliant job, with episode 6 being one of her best performances to date in my opinion.Sub or Dub you can't go wrong.Character and Story;If you've read any of my stuff by now than you know my usual spiel - Anime owes you nothing, judge everything on its own merits yada yada - But I think that definitely does apply here to Danmachi. Indeed it is a show you have in some ways seen before, a show about a young man becoming a hero and saving girls in an 'epic' fantasy world - And you really shouldn it for that.Danmachi is clear from the offset and the whole way through that it is a show about adventure, mythical heroes, Gods, and the people you meet along the way - So judge it on how well it does those things, on how much fun the adventure turns out to be - If you can do that, not get caught up on whether you've seen such & such an idea before - Then you just might find yourself having a whole lot of fun!And none of that is to say the show lacks depth by any means, we'll discuss it more past the spoiler tag but in short this is a show where you'll meet morally grey characters, the likes of whom owe money to drug dealers, others who will sacrifice innocence's to save their own and more still who are just bored immortal gods.They may not always seem the 'deepest' on a surface level, but Danmachi's characters and stories are full of subtext, motivation and goals.For an easy not too spoiler-y example we have our protagonist Bell. Bell has some self-confidence issues but on the words of his grandfather and in an effort to make up for his past - Decides to become an adventurer.After gaining something to aim for in the Sword Princess(An exceptionally powerful woman who spends more time rescuing Bell, than he does other girls) and someone to protect in his Goddess, Bell struggles to become stronger over the course of the show.What I love about Bell is he's understated. He'll monologue about feeling weak, or fighting for his friends but usually only when sh*t hits the fan - Bell is seldom if ever depressed, he never really sits around the house, nor does he get upset when personally insulted. Bell is sort of a shoen hero but less preachy - None of this is to downplay characters like Shinji of Eva who show their insecurities, or shoen protags who yell their mission statement at every enemy - Those are their own thing.No what endears me so much to Bell is how grounded he is - He doesn't have a mental illness, so he's not depressed about being weak, its just something that crosses his mind sometimes - Something I'm sure many can relate too.There's a fitting childish innocence to him - When he finds a magic book in an early episode, it attempt to chide him, call him naïve for his image of power - And he plainly responds while smiling with that's just how he is.What more fitting of a protag could you ask for in a show about pure adventuring?It's in this way that you will find Danmachi to be like the best harem anime of days gone by - Simple, light-hearted, easy to follow and enjoy - But with depth, with things to say and a whole lot of heart and care put into its story and cast - I for one love it for that and maybe you will too :) .If you haven't seen it, than I'd say almost everyone should give it a go - If you hate fanservice it may bug you a bit in that regard but honestly most of it comes from Hestia, the Greek god of Hearth, so that feels rather appropriate.Like I said at the top, Danmachi S1 is a fun, satisfying watch all by itself and well worth the short time it takes to watch - It gets my full recommendation as one of the last ten years most solid shows.Spoilers Ahoy - Oh beloved God of Subtext!;One might ask why for my 25th review I have chosen Danmachi - Over the course of these reviews we've discussed all manor of sensitive topics, from the place of fanservice, questions of ped0f*llia, war stories, viewer entitlement, and so on.From School Days to Super Lovers and Gundam - Amongst all that Danmachi may seem a little underwhelming.True enough I actually struggled to find a central point to base this review around - Normally I listen & read to others opinions and takes, to get an idea of the discussion around a show - And I did go to Danmachi's review page, to be filled with dismay at so many negative reviewers in the top 10 listings - But in the end I stopped reading them before I'd properly started.That's in part because Danmachi isn't the sort of anime that begs for deep analysis or vigorous debate - Rather it asks to be enjoyed.As already mentioned I put Danmachi with the likes of 'Shuffle', super genre specific anime, that colour inside the lines - But do so wonderfully.At times Danmachi can straight up feel like a homage to everything we love about classic anime and even just stories of heroes in general - It's a show that makes you want to smile.And with that much care and love comes depth - My favourite example being Lily.Between episodes 3 to 6 we get a brilliant arc, culminating in one of my all time favourite episodes of anime.Lily at first seems like she will be a classic anime architype and I'm sure many probably write her off as such, but watch Danmachi on its own terms and you'll find so much more.That Architype being the 'Thief With a Heart of Gold' - The type who steal to make money for family or friends and whom the hero 'saves' and shows a better way of life to - But Lily isn't that at all.Lily has no one to support, no lofty goals - She got picked up by a drug-cartel as a child and simply wants to escape.And in this pursuit Lily will steal, cut and maybe even kill.I want to break down this arc a bit, because most clearly of all it seems to be an allegory for real life drug abuse, hiding in an adventure anime.The Soma Familia are addicted to a super potent wine, which you can have as a stand-in for drugs, alcohol, gambling or any other vice you like. The group gets you in with a free or cheap first sample and then pushes you to further and further extremes as your addiction grows.And society? It doesn't really care. We see the guild staff just sigh when a desperate Soma complains about guild rates, with Bell's guild advisor only taking an interest because of Lily & Bell's partnership.People of authority like the Loki Familia are fully aware of the Soma's debauchery, criminal activity and suffering - Yet show no particular interest in intervening.Everyone seems to hold the view that what the Soma clan does is its own business however corrupted - And interestingly this doesn't change after the arc ends, no one cares anymore about the Soma's than they did before.And there's a real complexity here - Lily is not an addict, although it will come back to haunt her in later seasons - No Lily is in-debited to a dealer. This is fascinating because it would already be a near unique plot line to have a 'druggy waifu', but for it to be someone not addicted, but trapped in that world by meer association makes it all the more impressive.The arc quickly makes clear that Lily is not a 'good person' but also not a 'bad one' either.She didn't ask to become an orphan on the streets, nor to be beaten and abused by adventurers - But equally she has chosen to betray sometimes innocent people - And she is willing to possibly murder Bell for the chance at her own freedom.But it goes way deeper than that. The Arc is full of small moments that lend it authenticity - When we briefly see the other members of Lily's Familia from her POV in episode 6, we find they are ghostly pale, tinted green almost with bulging diluted, dreary eyes and a watchful, sleepless wariness - These are people driven made by their addiction and Lily sees them for what they have become.Likewise I absolutely love the reactions of the show's 'good people' - Everyone without exception is cautious of Lily, the guild advisor, Loki and even goddess Hestia - Only the elf Riou shows any sympathy, and even then its just sympathy and nothing more pro-active than that.When Bell asks Hestia if they can shelter Lily, you don't get the answer you expect from this type of anime - Instead she is apprehensive, she asks in all earnest if Lily hasn't brought this upon herself - And in a way she has.Ultimately it takes alot to help an addict - We might all pass one on the streets and think 'The goverment should do something' or 'Someone should help that poor soul' - But in truth do you have the compassion and the strength to do so yourself?Could you really take in a borderline stranger? If anything the compassion is the easy bit, empathy is baked into us all, some of us are just better at ignoring it than others - No its the strength you need, to know that if they fall into old ways, wreck your house or steal your money, lashing out at you - That you will have the strength, like Bell, to reach out and drag someone into the light.Bell becomes a physical hero in the first 3 episodes sure, and he overcomes himself in episode 8 - But to me its episode 6 that makes Bell a hero, a 1 in 10,000 kind of person who can truly 'save' people.Lily expresses this herself, her apprehension towards all adventures is indictive of the feelings addicts have for the police - At best the police ignore them because they just aren't equipped to help - But at worst they beat, arrest and harass addicts to up crime stats and statistics, while in reality helping very little - With the no police or guards in Danmachi, the adventures are there own self-governing police force, and one that openly ignores the Soma addicts.As Lily lies, broken and physically beaten, surrounded by death - She reaches up to the ceiling and asks God why the fu*k she had to be born this way, into this world, surrounded by these people - Why she couldn't escape the trap of society no matter how hard she tried - And then Bell just comes back.I love the moment when Lily hits Bell over the head with his own dagger - Its visceral, impulsive and in one single moment communicates all the feelings that the music, directing, incredible voice acting and all show.In that frame where she thwonks him on the head you have her frustration, anger, disbelief and inability to allow herself hope all in one instant.But moreover, along with being a story about drug addiction, aiding the world building greatly with a surprising amount of nuance - As well as showing that Bell being a Hero is more than just being strong enough to fight monsters - This arc is also part of Danmachi's thematic core - Finding the good in the quagmire of shite.The show does a great job of hiding it, but Orario sucks - As mentioned there's no police, the economy revolves around a hyper lethal monster slaying profession, there is an appalling percentage of orphans in the cast alone - So on, so on - Yet it doesn't feel that way.Hestia and Bell's tiny basement hovel, feels like a home - The city streets full of muggers, cheats and addicts seem inviting and exciting - And even the dungeon has floors like 18 that look like a fresh paradise.Hermie's attempts to show Bell how ugly humanity is in the final episodes of the show - But Bell kind of just says F*ck off, without saying a word, while kicking the crap out of Goliath with all his allies. Because no matter the darkness, Bell and his friends are on their adventure, and for every cruel action, their is a kind one.Lily left Bell for dead, that isn't hyperbole, even if she hoped for his survival, she clearly accepted the chances of murder - But she isn't a bad person, she's just human - And I love that.We see it again with Sir.Oka with the 'Pass Parade' and in many other places allowing these characters to feel quite real.Or in perhaps one of my favourite lines from the first OVA, where Oka claims he can't get out of the hot-springs, less everyone should see his erection - Because of course he has one, why wouldn't he? That's both funny but grounding, realistic and relatable all at once.Every Little Helps - Danmachi's Method of Realism;So now that we've used the Lily Arc example to make clear how much more depth and consideration Danmachi's characters and story have, than what people give it credit for - Let's talk on some other topics like its form of realism.If you're looking for the logistics of an RPG style adventure, then you're better off with Log Horizon - If you want the gritty realism and reality of fighting fantasy monsters, try Grimgar of Fantasy & Ash, another brilliant single cour Tv show.But while not on their level, Danmachi opts for a 'comfy' level of realism.Its never too in your face, with just enough detail to stop you from asking 'How does such and such a fantasy thing work'.The supporters are a simple explanation for how the adventurers stay supplied in the dungeon - The trade of magic stones for money at the guild creates an easy to understand economy.The idea that if they found a safe zone in the dungeon adventurers would automatically colonise it with an inflated local economy seems down right natural.These realism touches are never too in-depth, because they aren't really important - The supporters give a good reason for Bell to meet Lily, but you could easily find other methods - No these small touches, down to the Loki and Hephaestus  Familias travelling together - Are all here to make your viewing more leisurely - You don't have to ask extraneous questions - But you equally don't need to do homework to keep up.Poke hard enough and you will find holes - The crystals that light floor 18 are BS - There is no reason given for why they mimic a day/night cycle, nor any explanation of how plants grow & synthase with crystal light - But who f-ing cares.This is a fantasy world and it the author wants to have a crystal with the power to mimic the sun, in order to create a beautifully landscape, perfect for an epic battle - Then heck ya, that's what adventuring is about, being free to have fun.That's why I love the 'realism' of Danmachi, its never overbearing but just plausible enough to help you get immersed, to make the world more believable while still fantastical.From the rust on discarded swords at the edge of dead adventurer's graves - To Loki the trickster God being able to convincingly go as a man or woman - To Hestia, God of the Hearth being a figure who represents warmth and a home (let's go home being a line she repeatedly uses). To the way it turns the borderline misogynistic idea of a saving timid girls in dungeons - Into something more wonderful.Because make no mistake, the girls of Danmachi ain't weak - Lily's survived years on her own, The Sword Princess is a contender for the best of the best - Every one has things they are good at and things there bad at in this world - And often Bell's being a Hero has little to do with dragon slaying, and more to do with being a good person.I've actually tried to write reviews of Danmachi before but failed because, in effect I just end up gushing about it.The way Bell overcomes a minotaur far stronger then the original but than in ep 13 in a super quick moment we even get to see him save someone else the same way he was saved in episode 1.The fact its a minotaur in a labyrinth in a story filled with Greek mythology inspirations - The fact the story's 'princess' is a 'Sword Princess' who you have to catch up to rather than rescue. The way Bell inspires and motivates even those who are far stronger then him.Heck try watch Danmachi and its spin off in tandem, few eps of one and than a few of the other - It works really well to make the whole thing an awesome 25 episode show + Hot-spring OVA for good measure.Hell even the god-damn Ova, like it really goes hard on the hot-springs troop, you get every shot and swimsuit you could ask for combined with genuinely funny jokes through out (I love my boy carving the Hephaestus statue on the fly while her voice tells him not to use her as a distraction😂).Oh and did I mention the fights are fu*king awesome from direction to choreography to the rule of cool usage?!And that's kind of the point and why I chose this as my 25th review to boot - Danmachi is a modern version of what got so many us all into this medium in the first place.Its art is brilliant, its environments memorable, its characters tackle subjects you just can't get in tv for western youths - Its story and hero moments are plain badass, its wholesome and fun and makes you want to smile all the time for a myriad of different reasons as its character interact in genuine groups with true feelings bonds however simple they may be.Its well though out, brilliantly paced to have no filler but still make bundles of time for characters to just interact and its characters and world feel grounded and authentic yet still larger than life and 'silly'.You don't have to watch 5 seasons, waiting years in between - These 13 episodes are a complete package. You don't feel compelled to argue its politics, nor feel weirded out by how far it takes it gimmicks.In an anime landscape where 'Salve Isekai' is quickly becoming the new thing - The purity of Danmachi is delightful - Its romances are straightforward, its plot simple - It is anime as you remember it, rendered with the music and animation of the present day.It doesn't need an isekai truck hooked with a smart phone, it doesn't need to deconstruct anything, or push the boundaries of Ecchi to new highs - It doesn't need to be self-aware, or force you to wait for the next season in a never ending tirade of seasons that when looked back on feel almost like sudo-filler.Its a classic anime, with none of the needless addons we've gained over the yearsDanmachi is pure adventure, and whether people understand fully why or not, its easy to see why it captured so many's attention - Danmachi is pure anime goodness, and I love it.Thanks for reading,-Momentie. be quite watchable - But moreover when JC got it right, they would swing for the homerun.Danmachi, or 'Is it ok to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon' is one of those quintessential JC staff shows - A relatively simple premise full of troops on its surface, a stupid long title name and with plenty room to expand for sequels - Like the best JC staff shows its first 13 episodes are self-contained, sure there's many over-arching questions remaining and plenty more story to be told but if all you're interested in is whether you need time to watch 5 seasons of this - Then no, you can watch the first 13 episodes by themselves and than never go further - They're cohesive and self-contained enough to be really satisfying and rewatchable in the same way classics like Zero no Tsukaima's individual seasons were back in the 2000.For those looking for a little more convincing, lets run down the spoiler free production details;Music, Animation and Direction;Traditionally Studio JC have what I call the 'Mr.JC' scene - This retaining to most of their animes looking good enough, only for MR.JC himself to kick in the studio doors and animate an incredible fight scene in the middle of the anime that makes all the rest look petty, before leaving again and returning to the usual, serviceable style - 'Aria the Scarlet Ammo' is a really good example of this.Danmachi however is an exception to the rule, almost every scene from fanservice to action has a quality to it - The background art is detailed and vivid, and the fights are some of my favourite in anime, especially those in episodes 8 and 13 which have a glorious amount of kinetic energy to impacts and attacks.Even simple sparing matches between budding adventures have a real pace and excitement to them.This is aided by the colour pallet, while a few characters do, you will find most of the primary cast of Danmachi break alot of standard character design - Rather than having one defining feature, candy colour hair for example, Danmachi's heroes are instead drawn in great detail. There's a massive variety of body types, facial structure, shades of blacks & browns and other small details to make these characters stand out in a crowd, without making them look out of place.Cohesion is one of my favourite things in this show, there's no CGI crowds in the busy streets - Everything has variety, background cast members look like they could easily be main cast in another show (Some literally are) - Buildings have variety and style. It's all really high quality.The music too is fantastic, it has a sense of wholesomeness to it. The vocal tracks are all delightful and set a mood of light-hearted adventure, while the background OsT is varied and suitable for any moment the show has need of it - Honestly Danmachi excels at being a modern anime, it never feels like its a light novel or manga that's been ported to the tv screen, rather everything blends together almost immersively.The direction of fights and ecchi alike is expert and really it's hard to believe this anime is 7 years old - If someone tells you the show is 'just fine' production wise, then I can only presume they've accidentally watched something else, I give Danmachi full marks in all three regards.Also note worthy is the dub - I love the original sub and dub did take some getting used to but once you do, you'll realise its spot on - The voices all fit, and Bell's VA does a great job of making awkward phrases like 'My Goddess' (Kami-Sama in the sub) sound like something Bell would actually say despite being a mouthful.There's a light breezy quality to the dialogue and Lily's voice-actress (One of favourites in general ever since Full Metal Panic) does a brilliant job, with episode 6 being one of her best performances to date in my opinion.Sub or Dub you can't go wrong.Character and Story;If you've read any of my stuff by now than you know my usual spiel - Anime owes you nothing, judge everything on its own merits yada yada - But I think that definitely does apply here to Danmachi.

That's both funny but grounding, realistic and relatable all at once.Every Little Helps - Danmachi's Method of Realism;So now that we've used the Lily Arc example to make clear how much more depth and consideration Danmachi's characters and story have, than what people give it credit for - Let's talk on some other topics like its form of realism.If you're looking for the logistics of an RPG style adventure, then you're better off with Log Horizon - If you want the gritty realism and reality of fighting fantasy monsters, try Grimgar of Fantasy & Ash, another brilliant single cour Tv show.But while not on their level, Danmachi opts for a 'comfy' level of realism.Its never too in your face, with just enough detail to stop you from asking 'How does such and such a fantasy thing work'.The supporters are a simple explanation for how the adventurers stay supplied in the dungeon - The trade of magic stones for money at the guild creates an easy to understand economy.The idea that if they found a safe zone in the dungeon adventurers would automatically colonise it with an inflated local economy seems down right natural.These realism touches are never too in-depth, because they aren't really important - The supporters give a good reason for Bell to meet Lily, but you could easily find other methods - No these small touches, down to the Loki and Hephaestus  Familias travelling together - Are all here to make your viewing more leisurely - You don't have to ask extraneous questions - But you equally don't need to do homework to keep up.Poke hard enough and you will find holes - The crystals that light floor 18 are BS - There is no reason given for why they mimic a day/night cycle, nor any explanation of how plants grow & synthase with crystal light - But who f-ing cares.This is a fantasy world and it the author wants to have a crystal with the power to mimic the sun, in order to create a beautifully landscape, perfect for an epic battle - Then heck ya, that's what adventuring is about, being free to have fun.That's why I love the 'realism' of Danmachi, its never overbearing but just plausible enough to help you get immersed, to make the world more believable while still fantastical.From the rust on discarded swords at the edge of dead adventurer's graves - To Loki the trickster God being able to convincingly go as a man or woman - To Hestia, God of the Hearth being a figure who represents warmth and a home (let's go home being a line she repeatedly uses). To the way it turns the borderline misogynistic idea of a saving timid girls in dungeons - Into something more wonderful.Because make no mistake, the girls of Danmachi ain't weak - Lily's survived years on her own, The Sword Princess is a contender for the best of the best - Every one has things they are good at and things there bad at in this world - And often Bell's being a Hero has little to do with dragon slaying, and more to do with being a good person.I've actually tried to write reviews of Danmachi before but failed because, in effect I just end up gushing about it.The way Bell overcomes a minotaur far stronger then the original but than in ep 13 in a super quick moment we even get to see him save someone else the same way he was saved in episode 1.The fact its a minotaur in a labyrinth in a story filled with Greek mythology inspirations - The fact the story's 'princess' is a 'Sword Princess' who you have to catch up to rather than rescue. The way Bell inspires and motivates even those who are far stronger then him.Heck try watch Danmachi and its spin off in tandem, few eps of one and than a few of the other - It works really well to make the whole thing an awesome 25 episode show + Hot-spring OVA for good measure.Hell even the god-damn Ova, like it really goes hard on the hot-springs troop, you get every shot and swimsuit you could ask for combined with genuinely funny jokes through out (I love my boy carving the Hephaestus statue on the fly while her voice tells him not to use her as a distraction😂).Oh and did I mention the fights are fu*king awesome from direction to choreography to the rule of cool usage?!And that's kind of the point and why I chose this as my 25th review to boot - Danmachi is a modern version of what got so many us all into this medium in the first place.Its art is brilliant, its environments memorable, its characters tackle subjects you just can't get in tv for western youths - Its story and hero moments are plain badass, its wholesome and fun and makes you want to smile all the time for a myriad of different reasons as its character interact in genuine groups with true feelings bonds however simple they may be.Its well though out, brilliantly paced to have no filler but still make bundles of time for characters to just interact and its characters and world feel grounded and authentic yet still larger than life and 'silly'.You don't have to watch 5 seasons, waiting years in between - These 13 episodes are a complete package. You don't feel compelled to argue its politics, nor feel weirded out by how far it takes it gimmicks.In an anime landscape where 'Salve Isekai' is quickly becoming the new thing - The purity of Danmachi is delightful - Its romances are straightforward, its plot simple - It is anime as you remember it, rendered with the music and animation of the present day.It doesn't need an isekai truck hooked with a smart phone, it doesn't need to deconstruct anything, or push the boundaries of Ecchi to new highs - It doesn't need to be self-aware, or force you to wait for the next season in a never ending tirade of seasons that when looked back on feel almost like sudo-filler.Its a classic anime, with none of the needless addons we've gained over the yearsDanmachi is pure adventure, and whether people understand fully why or not, its easy to see why it captured so many's attention - Danmachi is pure anime goodness, and I love it.Thanks for reading,-Momentie."", 'I just recently watched DanMachi and I can say that it\'s a good and worth watching anime.

The story was pretty plain and simple, a bit exhausted type though. I am more of a 'in depth' type of guy who enjoys a good storyline , but unfortunately this anime didnt have that much to offer, I really hate an anime that leaves too many loopholes in the story even if its for our enjoyment.This anime had too bland a story to begin with , Yet you cant expect much depth from a 13 episode anime, it is rushed , it takes an aweful lot...of time to depict the silly love relations of bell yet, kind of tones down on the battle scenes which really drive the anime forward.All said and done, I really enjoyed it , I'm sure that not everyone would have the same appreciation. Almost every female character has a crush on bell and it kind of seems cliche'd and the MC has a mysterious ability that allows him to become very strong in the limited amount of time.When I watch an anime I naturally envision myself as the MC , naturally( although overrated ,) I loved the anime.It is pretty obvious that the creators havent given us the last and there is still more to come, depending on the rest (if it will come,) the anime cannot be satisfactorily critiqued.The antagonist is apparently the goddess of beauty(I didnt acre enough to remember the name) and she plays a rather subtle role in the anime. There are ties and backstorys that need to be said, and they didnt focus on Hestia's or Aiz's past.If you enjoy the girls falling in love with the MC and the MC becoming stronger very fast and becoming the hero then this is the anime for you.I like that sort of thing and therefore loved it.If I enjoy an anime I tend to overlook even the obvious faults.It really does need a second season for it to fully emerge .In a nutshell , this anime is not everyone's cup of tea, but it can be pretty sweet to some who enjoy it.You should really think before you start up on this or you might regret it later on.Opinions to improve my reviews are welcomed. of time to depict the silly love relations of bell yet, kind of tones down on the battle scenes which really drive the anime forward.All said and done, I really enjoyed it , I'm sure that not everyone would have the same appreciation.

I think that\'s rather an unfair comparison.  Where Sword Art Online is an uninspired dumpster fire where I can sum up every single character in three words or less, this show at least has characters with some recognizable traits, and while none of them are particularly the most fleshed-out or original I\'ve ever seen, none of them succumb to outright cliches, though they definitely are all very familiar tropes.  I found myself smiling at the characters\' antics, and while I only really laughed out loud twice, I never really found myself cringing...like I did so often with the dialog and character interactions in SAO.  I give SAO a 2 at most on my most generous day, and came to that conclusion four episodes in, and since I give this show an 8, I\'m going to cease comparing them together now because, like I said; it\'s just not a fair comparison.  The differences between the shows comes in small ways, but small changes and slight variations are all it takes to take a dumpster fire and turn it into a campfire, something you can toast marshmellows over without running for the hills for the stench.This is no luxury resort of a show, but it\'s like a good camping session in the woods with your friends, to continue the analogy; you might hold a few fond memories afterwords, and while it\'ll never compare to the much more polished vacation experiences, there\'s a sort of ""every-day fun"" value to the time you spend on it.  You have to be particularly cynical and easily-dismissive to give this show a score to indicate that it\'s actually bad, in honesty, and I think a lot of the lower scores given are given in rebellion to its popularity in relation to its overall quality rather than in actual critique (I could be entirely mistaken, of course), but I found enough aversions and inversions of cliches into workable tropes, enough appeal in the art design, and enough in the simple but digestible plot to find the overall experience a fair net positive.Part of my own enjoyment comes from my own biases; I love anime that adapts cultural elements outside of Japan into its setting and does it well, and surprisingly enough this show actually pulls that off rather nicely.  Again, not the deepest lore or anything, but it is very much its own thing in the right areas.  I actually would probably drop the score by two points if it was just another example of an anime fetishizing Japanese culture, because that is a cliche that has long worn out its welcome.  I normally dislike \'every girl wants this guy just because\' shows, but at least this show provides some believable explanations for why they do (for the most part, anyway, there\'s two examples I can think of where it wasn\'t really explained at all, but they were minor characters, anyway, so...whatever), and not every girl is all over him, anyway.  In fact, there\'s only really two that are, and with one of them it\'s played off more like a puppy-love crush (I\'m not referring to whom you think I am referring to, in all likelihood; the analogy is unrelated to the character) than outright adoration.  The one character who DOES throw absolute adoration at Bell, the protagonist, is Hestia, and to be fair, in the context of the show, that makes perfect sense...and frankly, I found her adoration of Bell to be adorable in and of itself.My own score might be a point or two above what most people will give it, and that is entirely understandable, but given I\'ve seen some absolute crap (SAO, Asterisk War, Naruto ((The filler episodes anyway)), G Gundam, etc.), and some absolute masterpieces (Madoka Magica, Gurren Lagann, Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bebop, etc.), and a bunch of stuff in between, I\'d like to believe that I\'ve got a fairly good range of reference to draw from, and if you look past sheer surface value and compare this show to its contemporaries, there\'s enough here that is its own thing.  Nothing stands out in particular, alas, but then again, nothing here offends the senses or sensibilities, either, so while this will inevitably end up in the discount rack of my memories, it\'s never going to go into the trash or bargain bin, either.

It has everything: a generic ""nice guy"" protagonist that is randomly given ultimate power, a bunch of female characters enamoured with him for variably shallow reasons, a purely serviceable setting and plot. It\'s visually appealing and relaxing to watch, just the same way as those trashy isekai shows are, but I don\'t think it does anything fresh or brilliant enough to deserve much of the praise it gets.On the bright side, there are some really cool elements in the setting that are mostly yet to be explored...- the pasts of most major characters, the role and real powers of the gods, the nature and function of the titular dungeon are all more or less blank slates.

He is able to fight because of the blessing he received from his goddess Hestia. In this anime we watch Bell grow as an adventurer.So like...I said many people compare this show to SAO which makes no sense there are enough key differences in DanMachi that make it much better than SAO, and I'm gonna name most of them.1.

It makes sense why he is as strong as he is unlike Kirito who just pulls his power out of his ass. (Side Note: so it only makes sense if you have read up on who Bell's grandfather is but that is a spoiler in itself)4. Bell doesn't become the strongest in 3-4 episodes.5. The male characters (besides Bell I mean) actually do shit and it's not just Bell and his Harem doing shit.6. Not all female characters in DanMachi like Bell.That's all I can think of right now but DanMachi is better than SAO and it's a very good anime. If you can't see how minor differences in some characters can make a show much better than another very similar show please, stop writing reviews. I said many people compare this show to SAO which makes no sense there are enough key differences in DanMachi that make it much better than SAO, and I'm gonna name most of them.1.

I was actually really happy that J.C staff handled it really well and that season turned out to be one of their best seasons. Dungeon is an anime packed full of adventure, comedy & like many anime out there, harem....Instead of starting off in a cozy place with many things, Bell, the protagonist of the show starts off in a run down building with little money to start off with. This is a really useful concept to use for something like Dungeon as it will be easier to show how much Bell has improved ever since from the start of the show, as the spotlight of the won't be on how rich they are or how nice their base looks like, instead, the spotlight will be more on Bell.STORY : 8This anime really shines at the parts that are more emotional & powerful moments during the run of the show. I will have to give props to the VAs and staff of this project for pulling this out incredibly well. It really establishes the character development really well. Take Liliruca as an example, that moment was pretty powerful and would have been able to catch some people's hearts for sure. The contrast between Bell's smile & Lili's hatred and anger really brought out the emotions to the brim. How all her sorrow and pain just got released that one instant was just so good. Some might say that moment was a cheap trick to remove all the bad things she has done, I don't agree with that. I believe that moment was a really pure and cute moment between Bell & Lili, the fun adventures they had together, how Bell forgived her for stealing, changed Lili's view on adventurers. That moment proved all that at once, this is what I believe.Well, that was my favourite aspect of this series. No series in my opinion can be fully perfect, or there is no point releasing new ones. This show like all shows, has flaws. This show's Romance is established in a way that ends up in anti climatic moments. I know this show isn't heavily focused on Romance but since it is getting constantly implied into the show's context I feel that there is a need for me to note that out. The fact that they didn't push Welf's friendship and his importance to Bell further was a bit infuriating. Since it was only 13 episodes, I won't pursue that too far.ART : 8The art in this show is basically the definition of fan service. The only person I can be referring to is the lazy goddess, Hestia. Her with her boob jiggle physics really is the sauce for this anime's fan service. Setting that aside, the art itself is pretty decent. I really like the idea of having the dungeon being placed at the middle of the whole entire city. It made it feel like the dungeon is a really important place in this city, which it is. However it would have been better if they made the dungeon look more intense, it almost seems that every level look the same, except that foggy one. Other than that, I really don't have complains, everything else isn't amazing, but still pretty well drawn.SOUND : 8Do I have anything to rant about sound... I guess I don't have much but I'll make an effort to write about it. The voice actors were pretty well suited for the characters that they were voice acting as. I love how Bell is getting voice acted by the harem king himself, Mr Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. Bell's higher pitched sound shows how he is still young, carefree & happy. The soundtracks were not bad, they did their job when they needed to, such as battle scences or emotional scenes. Those are the times where I feel like soundtracks play quite an important role. The OP & ED were quite enjoyable to listen to, the lyrics were well composed according to this story's plotline. Well done team.CHARACTER : 9I enjoyed the character's personalities and development throughout this short 13 episodes. The character that gets the most spotlight for character development is easily Lili, gosh that scene hits me every time. Our girl loli big boobs also known as Hestia plays a role of a goddess who has no money & skill. However, I really like how she plays the role of a mother like person & a jealous girl who doesn't want Bell to be with any other female other than herself. This is their way of compensating how lack of funds & skills & also to keep her more relevant. Bell is that typical light novel protagonist that cares for his friends & has some ridiculous OP abilities that make him OP.. That is all.ENJOYMENT : 9I really enjoyed watching Dungeon, this is a show that has Comedy & Adventure blended together pretty well. The fight scenes were also something that I looked forward to every episode, (Well I suppose that is the reasosn you watch something like Dungeon right?) Anyways, I feel like there is no reason for me to not enjoy a show about somebody picking up girls in a dungeon even though he doesn't actually pick up any girls inside the dungeon..OVERALL : 8Overall, I will recommend this show to anybody that is just chilling with anime & will not critic it like a crazy person. If you take this show to a critical perspective, it's honestly just another generic show featuring a powerful protagonist, with a bunch of fan service to spice things up. Don't take things to a critics level, and you might have a good time watching ' Is it wrong to pick up girls inside a dungeon ? ' or whatever it's called.Recommended if you are not a hardcore critic.

Hitting on women in a dungeon is the last thing you'd expect from this neurotic child.I could go on and on but I don't think this anime deserves an in-depth analysis since it's so shallow and half-hearted in its execution.

Never found the answer, not eager to keep searching.STORY - 4/10(Evaluation for the quality of the story of this series is made void of other factors, like the artistic value, sound and characters)We can all agree that a story is what makes an Anime worth considering or not. When it comes to this series, honestly, the story is so mediocre, that you\'d confuse it as an adaptation of a...children\'s storybook. It was a combination of simpleton thinking and unnecessary over-complication. What I mean by this is that this anime on one hand is so simple that you\'ll say it\'s cliche every 5 minutes or so, but on the other hand, is so complicated that you can hardly understand what is going in a particular scene.That\'s why I\'d say this Anime is an adaptation of a 5 year old\'s imagination. It\'s a cliche story of a boy who is a loser working hard to become a hero to impress girls and in the end succeeds in doing so. Somewhere along the way, I asked myself, ""am I watching an Anime written by a Sword Art Online fan?""The pacing was obviously rushed to the point that the climax didn\'t develop more than 2 episodes and the ending got everyone saying; ""That\'s it??"" The lack of exposition and proper development of the settings in the Anime made it hard to follow the plot. I swear I asked myself ""What is Hestia doing? Why are there weird symbols and stuff?"" almost every episode.The story is overall quite disappointing but I guess it doesn\'t completely ruin the enjoyment of the Anime. (I\'ll explain more below) If you are the type to watch Anime based on the quality of the story, don\'t bother with this series. If you\'re going to watch this series, expect many plot holes (like the explanation of how the universe in this anime actually worked), a rushed climax resolution, and a disappointing ending.ART - 8/10(Evaluation for the artistic value of this series is made void of other factors, like the quality of the story, sound and characters)The art was very good in a sense that the setting felt realistic enough for you to experience and indulge the events as they are happening. I actually almost forgot that the story was bad because the Animation was good.The Victorian-esque setting worked and anybody would be convinced that the story would\'ve taken place in Victorian times. It suited the premise of the story and it helped compliment the adventure. The art was enough to make you react to it (like the realistic depiction of blood made me uncomfortable since I suffer from Hemophobia) and is quite memorable. The character\'s designs were perfectly suited to the target audience (younger audiences) where the colours and curves of the characters are exaggerated to give a youthful and sexually attractive feeling. This also made the characters look suitable in accord to their traits and personalities, and they were unique enough to make you able to distinguish their behaviors just by their looks. The animation panels were fluid and consistent enough for anyone to overlook any minor changes or fluctuations. The backgrounds however, were nice, but not special. It wasn\'t breath-taking enough to make me pause the video and say, ""wow"" thus I couldn\'t really rate the art higher than 8 for this reason alone.In a sentence, I would say the art is good enough to make you keep watching even if you hated other aspects of the anime (story, characters, etc.)SOUND - 6/10Firstly, let\'s talk about the opening theme. Any fan of ecchi would expect the theme to be joyful youthful and sound a little bit enticing (if that\'s the best word to describe it), and well, that\'s more or less what you get from this series. The theme isn\'t bad enough to deserve being skipped every episode, but it\'s not special enough to earn a spot in your Itunes playlist. In fact, give yourself a week and you\'ll probably forget what the theme was like.Secondly, the OST. It is not special, not enjoyable, but not trash. There were some tracks that aided in the development of the story, and didn\'t overpower the plot, but some scenes lack the track to make it feel emotional and strong. In other words, the background music won\'t make your heart beat faster when the scene is supposed to make you feel excited, but isn\'t trash enough for you to consider muting the video.Thirdly, the voice acting. (BEAR IN MIND, I WATCHED THE SUBBED VERSION, THEREFORE MY THOUGHTS WILL BE BASED ON THE JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS). I had no problem with the voice acting. In fact, I guess it was to a certain extent good enough for you to believe that the voice actor was actually the Anime character. The voice actor for the main character even made it believable that he is somewhat innocent and just wanted to be a hero. All in all, I must say, the voice acting was fair enough to merit the sounds of this Anime a score of 6.CHARACTER - 4/10This is another aspect where I had quite a problem with the series.The main character was probably the only one I must say deserves to be glossed over. After all, he\'s a young boy entering adolescence, obviously he\'ll be quite impulsive, unstable and to a certain degree quite the pervert.The other characters however, where your typical set of girls. Ms Perfect, Ms Pervert, Ms Powerful, etc. The characters are so cliche that you wouldn\'t even bother remembering their names. Their development wasn\'t good either. It was rushed and quite illogical. For a perfect heroine who has everything she wants suddenly feel pity for a boy who\'s being picked on for starting from the bottom, it felt like a stretch to me. I didn\'t see the coincidence in the bar (this is where their relationship started to develop) to be believable and realistic. It sounded like the producer wanted to force the main protagonists to get along for no apparent reason. The backstory and exposition behind the characters were too rushed to the point that the character\'s motives isn\'t something you figure out from the events, but rather it is something directly told to you. They are definitely not special and memorable, so you wouldn\'t even remember their names. Not even the main hero, in fact.ENJOYMENT - 5/10Okay, let\'s be fair. Good story and perfect character development isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea. Some may prefer blatant fan service and simple humour. I took that into consideration. Throughout the series, you will not run out of fan service, and if that rocks your boat, hey, great! The girls in this anime will keep you entertained!But in a holistic evaluation, not even the fan service was enough to compensate for all the shortcomings of the series. The story will definitely annoy you at some point and the characters will fade away from your memory faster than you know it, and this will make it quite difficult to enjoy the series to the max.That being said, this doesn\'t mean this Anime is completely unwatchable. To a certain extent, the adventure was exciting enough for you to keep rooting for the cute little hero. Even if you may get bored along the way, isn\'t that what the fan service is for though? You will somehow get through this Anime without gouging your eyeballs and cursing the kami, that\'s for sure.VERDICT = MEDIOCREOVERALL RATING = 5.4/10 children\'s storybook. It was a combination of simpleton thinking and unnecessary over-complication.

It is a light comedy anime, light plot and i dont really find anything really especial going on. There was a bit of suspense at one point which led to nothing really. Also, it could probably need a second season.It tends to get a bit boring. Of course, we see the rise of a hero; from a weakling to struggling to be powerful, fighting. It doesn't quite leave the after effects of a good anime, where you really want to rewatch it, but it's an alright watch. "", 'For generations the question has been asked, over and over again, ""Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon"". Truth be told I went into this show not knowing what to expect, seeing as how depending on the answer to this question, my life, the world even, could fall into ruin. For real though, this show doesn\'t really bring anything new as the sole purpose for its creation is to pander to the easily satisfied masses who are more likely to watch a fan-service show filled with swords and magic than a psychological thriller. This show falls into the still growing genre known...as \'Not Sword Art Online\', a genre of anime that follows in the fart cloud left behind by their great predecessor SAO. While some have managed to at-least create a more interesting environment, none have really pushed any boundaries. Now I look over all the reviews and see low scores, and in fact I agree with them for the most part, however you will notice that my score is significantly higher than the majority of the reviews, and that is because while a bad show, like SAO I found some enjoyment in Danmachi. I\'ll try to keep it short and sweet. So without further ado, let\'s get on with my criteria and the scores given in each section.Character: 6Character Development: 5Little no interesting characters, and to put the cherry on top, there was no real character development aside from Bell powering up which doesn\'t count. Bell follows the trend of somehow being the protagonist, the desire of all women on earth, and yet also the most undesirable and normal individual. This is most likely in order to appeal to those at home who have no social life and feed off of anime in order to feel as if they\'ve accomplished something in life. The only character that I liked, and only reason why I gave improved marks in this area is thanks to Lili, the only character with an interesting backstory, as well as the only character who goes through some form of true character development.Plot: 5Pacing: 5The story is like the vanilla ice cream of anime, there is nothing special about it, literally nothing. Hero is weak, for some inexplicable reason he has the ability to grow stronger faster than anyone else, he becomes the strongest, and then fights to save everyone. The great Demolition_D commented on this show, and I couldn\'t agree more, it’s basically ""Sword Art Online: fat fucking titties addition"". The show isn\'t even well paced, it jumps around too much, granted that it’s in order to get us to the action faster, it doesn\'t hurt to slow down at times and just have an interesting conversation about the world they live in (and I said interesting, that doesn\'t include any of the BS they talked about in the show).Music: 6Art: 8The music was okay, kind of sad that the music is one of the qualities making sure this show doesn\'t get a failing grade, usually in my reviews the music\'s grade is lower than the total, however this show was bad enough that its lack luster music was helping compensate for its atrocious, well everything else. The art was outstanding though, however with the amount of money they had to animate it, it better damn well be pretty, I wasn\'t about to sit through an ugly show that also had no story.Enjoyment: 7Truth be told, I am a simple man, it doesn\'t take much to make my stupid brain smirk or smile, and while that is both a good and bad thing, it allowed me to enjoy the show a lot more than most people did. Would I re-watch it: no. Would I recommend it: no, I\'d sooner recommend SAO than this, however that\'s just exchanging a pile of crap for a slightly smaller pile of crap.Final Verdict: 60/100And when it all comes down to it, the answer is yes, yes it is okay to pick up girls in a dungeon. as \'Not Sword Art Online\', a genre of anime that follows in the fart cloud left behind by their great predecessor SAO.

The art was outstanding though, however with the amount of money they had to animate it, it better damn well be pretty, I wasn\'t about to sit through an ugly show that also had no story.Enjoyment: 7Truth be told, I am a simple man, it doesn\'t take much to make my stupid brain smirk or smile, and while that is both a good and bad thing, it allowed me to enjoy the show a lot more than most people did. Would I re-watch it: no. Would I recommend it: no, I\'d sooner recommend SAO than this, however that\'s just exchanging a pile of crap for a slightly smaller pile of crap.Final Verdict: 60/100And when it all comes down to it, the answer is yes, yes it is okay to pick up girls in a dungeon.', 'The title is a cute hook, which fails to deliver, because the protagonist doesn\'t actually pick up girls in a dungeon.I didn\'t expect a whole lot from this, and I wasn\'t disappointed -- there wasn\'t much to it.  If I were a lot younger, I might have liked it, but now I need my stories to have more depth.Story (5/10): Here\'s your generic RPG story. It has enticing aspects, like the gods from various pantheons have descended to this vaguely medieval fantasy land and formed guilds, so-called ""familias"" to further their specific interests.  Since I love mythology, that idea made the anime tempting,...but alas it doesn\'t do much with this.  Yeah, Hephaestus is a great weapons smith (and a girl), but Loki (also a girl) mostly throws drunken parties.  Hestia, Greek keeper of the heart, home, and domesticity, who is our protagonist\'s patron goddess doesn\'t show anything much of her roots, and neither do the other gods.  And why does Hephaestus have an eye patch?  He was lame, not half-blind in Greek myth. Hestia, surprisingly, doesn\'t even have a proper familia, our protagonist Bell is her first and only follower.Adventurers who seek divine blessings trawl the dungeon in search of magic stones and dropped items that can be acquired by fighting monsters.  There\'s a system for gaining stats, skills, and levels, but the gods don\'t actually seem to be running this. The gods also have no say over the dungeon and are in fact not allowed to enter it.  Maybe the dungeon is running things; it does seem to be sentient at times. Not a bad story by any means, but it has no depth; it feels duct taped together.Character (4/10): Bell feels largely like the insert character for a harem anime, which this one sort of is; he\'s naive and dense, but well-meaning and a nice guy.  There isn\'t much in-depth development -- sure, he starts out as a bit of a coward and overcomes that, and we even see him work with Aiz to become a better fighter, and he powers u a lot faster than is apparently normal -- but somehow I never felt a single thing that brought me closer to caring about his fate.  I didn\'t root for him (or against him), not to gain more power nor to win his fights nor to hook up with one of the girls who compete for his favours.Hestia is not quite the big-boobed airhead she seems to be at first; she\'s actually a hard worker and tries her damndest to give Bell whatever she can so his adventuring can be successful.  He doesn\'t even notice how hard she works, he\'s that dense.  She sees the two of them as a romantic couple, he doesn\'t.Liliruca becomes Bell\'s ""supporter"", and I like what they\'ve done with the standard, disposable NPC hireling whom everyone treats like dirt -- they gave her a backstory, and she gets an actual character arc complete with redemption.  If only she hadn\'t started out being a callous bitch who left Bell to die, I could have warmed up to her.There are other characters here, but you know, I am already tired writing about this.  Pretty much every character arc is tossed away anyway after giving us some backstory to whet our appetites.The thing that keeps this from being a true harem is that Bell\'s admiration is basically directed at only one person, Aiz Wallenstein, the Sword Princess, champion of adventurers and so far out of his league it isn\'t even funny.  Aiz is also completely stoic, even when Bell falls into her breasts.Art (6/10):  Character design is ok, a bit simple, nothing fantastic, but most are easy to tell apart.  Too much big boobage for my taste.  Background art is nice, but again, with few exceptions (the 18th dungeon floor), not special.  The animation is where this show shines -- some of the best action scenes with excellent choreography I\'ve seen in a while.Sound (5/10): OP and ED standard.  I liked the BGM quite a bit.  I might try and find the soundtrack so I can say something more substantial about it.  Voice talent is fine, nothing stands out for me.Enjoyment (5/10):  Lukewarm, flat sodapop.  All the ingredients were here for making this a really good story, with lots of injokes for RPGamers, an interesting premise with enough variation from standard RPGs to potentially make this superb.  And yet I didn\'t feel a thing.  I didn\'t root for anyone. I wasn\'t at the edge of my seat in the fighting scenes, even though they were so well done.  The entire thing felt paper thin -- something I could have enjoyed as a preteen but not now. but alas it doesn\'t do much with this.

And if you\'re reading this, then you\'re probably wondering whether or not to watch this title and while I could say the short answer, ""yes.., yes you goddamn should"", I will give you a little bit more, where I talk about the story, characters, artstyle and so on. So let\'s BEGIN!I will start with the story. What interested me so much and just drags me in, is the way everything is built. I\'ve seen many titles, but, in my opinion, none of them were as successful as this one and here\'s why....You\'ve got a very wide and fleshed out environment, with just brilliant ideas and characters and it really feels alive. The reason why I\'m talking so positive about it, is because sometimes writers who are using a source for writing, whether it is a mythological, fictional or a real story, they don\'t fully grasp the amount of info that is at their disposal. They only use what\'s on the surface, but there\'s a lot more deep within and the more you see, the more you are able to write, to change and implement. This very crucial, because otherwise you get an \'\'Ok-ish"" story, with not a lot background and it will be hard to write something that\'s truly good. That\'s why this story is so damn good, because the writer did his research and knows what he/she is doing.Now for the characters, further continuing what I said, it seems that the writer studied greek mythology at some point. And that is very cool for many reasons and because of this, the writer was able to create some truly unique characters, each having their own personality, that is pretty well thought through. The MC is also very cool, having his own secrets, that even he doesn\'t know, but one thing is for sure, that once all the cards are played out, it will be very interesting and worth watching. So, I\'m excited for the journey ahead, since the interactions between the characters and the world itself haven\'t failed me yet, and they probably won\'t in the future.As for the anime artstyle and music, well, it\'s really good. J.C Staff is a relatively old studio and they\'ve been improving, pretty much since the beginning, hence the reason of the sheer amount of popular titles that they have. So, if you have watched something from their huge ass library, you pretty much know what kind of quality to expect here and you probably won\'t go wrong with this one. The art is good and together with the amazing music that they chose, it really makes me even have goosebumps and tears of joy, which is pretty rare.Finally, I give it a solid 10/10 and even then, if you are still not sure. Then atleast do it for the waifus.That\'s all from me for today, and till next time, PEACE, I\'M OUT! ^^ You\'ve got a very wide and fleshed out environment, with just brilliant ideas and characters and it really feels alive.

Bell is honestly a sweet and caring guy who just wants to get strong for Hestia. But because this is anime he is always getting into the most uncomfortable sexual situations. And yeah there's a lot of unwanted gross fanservice when it comes to the female characters. It can be a bit hard to get past all of that.But if you do it's honestly a...cool premise. There are lot of really interesting characters and the fighting system is quite fun. The battles are pretty awesome without feeling like they last 80 episodes. The animation isn't jaw dropping but is clean and nice to look at. I think this show is worth a shot and I fully plan to keep watching, but I can understand it's not for everyone. cool premise.

Like come on, the legit title gives away that it is a harem.. so don't be surprised.What I probably enjoyed the most about it was how the MC leveled up and progressed through the story. We really get to see him grow, achieve new levels, and of course impress some of the ladies on the show.The one thing I probably disliked which made me give it a 8 instead of a 10 was Hestia. I don't really like how she is over jealous and freaks out every time...she sees the MC with a new girl. She is annoying at times, however she has so little screen time that it makes this issue not big enough to destroy the anime series.All in all, I would highly recommend watching this series if you enjoy either an OP MC, harem anime, or series where the MC shocks others.

Enjoy!"", ""Fun anime to watch with a couple of problems that tend to annoy me a fair amount.~~ SPOILERS ~~So a couple things i would bring up is1. The character starts to get really powerful. The entire goal for the MC is to get as powerful as a very high level person.  Named Ais. She is as far as i know she is the most powerful person. Yet what took her a long time to get to where she is now the MC is able to get some giant ground in just a month or two. He is really powerful and it tends to...get annoying in all forms of media. Including this.His goal is to get more powerful than Ais. I would really like in the end if he has to face that he can't get as powerful as some and the Ais person still remains more powerful. I probably didn't explain this as well as i wanted.2. There is one of the most annoying things anything can have. A Harrem. If i remember their our 3 or 4 love interest. Harems are annoying and pointless. You will always get one character that certain audiences like more than an other but it will obviously never happen between them. There is also  never a time when the MC actually confesses his love to one of the women and they go out. Harems our one of the worse things in Manga or Anime.3. Finally. This show does not know the term Consistency. We have a MC going through tons ton crap and fighting all these high level enemies within a couple hours. He finally escapes. A couple days later after he is healed and rested he gets into a fight where the enemy is invisible. The enemy is the same level or lower and is able to destroy the MC with punches alone. This doesn't make any sense because he was just fight tons of Minotaur's little ago and now he can't even take a couple punches in a not to the death duel between him and another person with weaker gear.~~ SPOILERS OVER ~~Overall it's a fun show to watch and i also get the feeling when the show was green lit to be made that the producers sole purpose was to go and make what SAO should've been. The parallels between this and SAO is kind kind of weird. We have the same Voice actor as Kirito ( How ever you spell his name) Duel wielding swords and overpowered character. Only thing missing is for this MC to be a total asshole. get annoying in all forms of media. Including this.His goal is to get more powerful than Ais.

I\'ve done some personal write-ups on my personal blog before but this anime convinced me to post here.Overall, I loved the story.  I literally planned to casually watch this as a filler type series while between Photoshop assignments and work.  Instead, I ended up binge watching this straight through in one day.That\'s how much I loved the story.  However, the ending made me feel very ""wtf"", as I do not read manga.  After watching this series I can only say that this had to be aimed at people reading the manga...to continue the story, because everything built up in the last episode then it ended so frigging abruptly.  Unfortunately I cannot say why in this review without giving spoilers, and the rules to the right here say not to do that, so I will leave it at that.Truly this is an outstanding anime.  And literally the only possible complaint I could find on it was indeed the fact that at the end it seemed to not have any ""wind-down"", like what happens with friendships/etc.  I did get excited at first because the way it ended I was like, ""Oh, cool, there has GOT to be more episodes or a second season"", but from what I understand the second season is pretty much a repeat of the first season but now we\'re looking at it from another character\'s perspective.  No other episodes exist besides those two seasons.With that said, I still give the story, art, sound, character and enjoyment a solid 10.  Because that is truly my experience.  Overall I gave an 8 because the sudden end without closure sent me wailing on Google Searches for a season that\'s just not out there.If you are looking for a great anime based on gaming with some romance involved, you will love this.  Despite the sudden ending, which again is probably attributed to the fact that I do not read manga, this is an outstanding show.  In fact, watching it has made me decide to subscribe to an MMO I haven;t played in forever, so on that note I sign off and say thanks for the awesome show. to continue the story, because everything built up in the last episode then it ended so frigging abruptly.

So why would I give it such a high rating? Because the show itself seems to not only accept these traits about itself, but thrive in them. Sure, half the characters are little more than eye candy, and Bell is (almost) as bland and boring as our favorite ""hated"" protagonist, and yet the show somehow still manages to make me feel for each and every one of the characters. Without going into details on any specific character, each character has...a motivation to them, something that drives them to continue going into the tower and risking their lives on a daily basis just to fulfill that motivation. And each character has an incredible dynamic with the rest of the cast that they interact with. tl;dr: DanMachi isn\'t about the story, it\'s about the characters. a motivation to them, something that drives them to continue going into the tower and risking their lives on a daily basis just to fulfill that motivation.

BUT Bell is also annoyingly naive yet has everyone drooling over him within seconds of meeting him, and as much as Hestia is adorable and likeable, I just wish they made Ais have more screentime and better development. If she's the inspiration behind Bell wanting to become stronger, is this legendary fighter, has beast skills, etc., then I want to see more of her and have a parallel growth of...Bell and Ais together to convince the audience to ship them.

Besides all these it revolves pretty much on the main character assembling rather a party of female characters and adventuring into the dungeons ... It's share of romance goes from main character chasing a girl, while others are already noticing him and chasing after him.A good anime to watch if you like to start a new adventure in some dungeons and defeat some monsters. sort of, and original plot.

I have noticed this seems to of become a normal thing to make a whole sentence be your title for certain shows lately.Let’s talk about the characters first, like how most of my reviews go. The first character I would like to address is Bell Cranel, our main character. He is a rather naïve, childlike boy who became an adventure after he lost his Grandfather. He dreams of becoming a hero and to impress the ‘Sword Princess’ who saved him on one of his first few dungeon expeditions. Now, even after watching...the show, I am not fully sure how their leveling system works but they do make a very big deal about how fast he seems to level up. This show feels a lot like a video game in that way when they talk about leveling. I have to say, he felt very much like a ‘Mary Sue’ style character as he really did not have very many flaws or weaknesses that I could tell. Every time he met a girl they would fall for him, every time he did an action it would normally come out for him in the end, so on. But there was this charm about him that kept me watching. He actually did grow as a character which I think breaks him of the types of Mary Sue’s that people don’t like. Maybe even broke him of that character class all together later on in the series even if he started out as one.The next person I would like to bring up is the goddess Hestia. Hestia is the Virgin Goddess of the hearth, the family, and the state within Greek mythology… oh wait… That’s her real life counterpart. In this show, the Gods and Goddesses came down to earth in order to live among the humans and have groups of people who worship them. In turn, the people that worship them become adventures who can fight monsters. These worship groups are called Familia. I am explaining this now because Bell is the only person in Hestia’s Familia… and she is overly thirsty for him. She becomes jealous if Bell even looks at other women, seems to obsess about him, and tends to whine when she isn’t able to get him alone or when he shies away from her advances. She may be a very popular character, but to me, I think Bell is a bit stronger of a character then her. I do agree that without her, we wouldn’t get half of the heartfelt moments as we do and she really does show how much she cares about him… but I don’t think I like her much as a stand alone character.As a lover of mythology, I truly loved how they added the different gods and goddesses within the world. They have gods of all different religions: Greek, Japanese, Norse, Mesopotamian, and so on. And each of these gods and goddesses has their own Familia’s based on what the god’s specialty was. For example, Hephaestus’ group are the largest arms and armor producers in the city while Soma’s group is a large producer of a very expensive wine which seems close to a ritualistic drink in India and Hinduism (Soma is another name for the moon god Chandra if people are checking on this). Now while most of the Gods and Goddesses have similar things to their original mythos counterparts, there are a couple things I frowned on. Namely changing some of their genders like making Hephaestus and Loki woman for example. Still not fully sure why they had to make them female but ok?The animation is very beautiful and the fighting scenes have a lot of energy to them. There are a couple times when Bell is moving that his body seems to be deforming or losing its form but I think they were just trying to show how much faster he was going during the fight. If you are looking for something that doesn’t have the same look as every other anime that has come out in this time frame though, I don’t think this will help. We still have the normal curvy girls bodies and large eyes for the innocent characters. While the fighting scenes are good, they are similar to many other anime that have fighting scenes that again have come out around the 2015s and later. It’s basically typical J.C. Staff Studio normal at this point (which does not mean it’s a bad thing though).I watched the English voice acting for this one, and I think it was fairly good. From what I could tell, some of the voice actors were little known names or newer voices in the industry. Bryson Baugus who did the voice of Bell has only been voice acting in anime since 2016 and it was 2017 when this anime got dubbed. It seems like it was only his 11th anime according to wikipedia (I know, sometimes you can’t trust it). There are names you know and love, and are pretty easy to pick out, like Luci Christian or Shelley Calene-Black but they could of easily of used even more large names then they did and I am happy they let some new people shine.Dispite the name that it has, I had a rather fun time watching it. At first I thought it would be a very perverted type of show with the main character actually trying to pick up girls but it turned out that the show had much more heart to it. We still had a lot of perverted things happen but that’s what you get in comedy anime so eh. You got to pick and choose your battles on that one.

But if you liked SAO, you will love this show. It is really funny, it is my kind of comedy. The maincharacter in this story is a kind hearted person WHO gets Wayyy too much girls too choose from. This show has a konosuba feel to it with the comedy and use of animation ;). Overall i loved it, it is unique in a way, and if you dont mind the mainstream weebs, and you...like konosuba or SAO you should like this too.Conclusion: I NEED SEASON 2Rating 8,7/10 like konosuba or SAO you should like this too.Conclusion: I NEED SEASON 2Rating 8,7/10', 'Overal This show will stay as one of my possible top 100 that ill watch throughout my time. With its flaws it still seems to be quite well crafted and good for a season one. I personally have gripes with the shows semi reliance on innate powers but that is what this Genre of anime is all about so it did not bother me. It managed to not have the SAO Kirito complex that plagues some of these shows because there is something that always stops our lead character forcing his reliance on other people. There is strong character development between Hestia, Bell, Wolfe, Lili...and The Sword Princess. Although the other character are somewhat left behind except for Freya and Hermes. They cruntched in a lot of build for Alf in the last two episode and it felt rushed to do so, even though the episodes themselves did not feel rushed. The episodes had phenomenal pacing that mixed well with the other elements to make the story work. So that is why I give Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka a 8 out of 10.Thank you for reading my first review ever.

There are not long or deep narratives to wrap your head around.  You don't even have to really watch each episode to know what is going on if you jump in the middle of an arc.  It is easy to dislike the show for what it is, a cliche harem adventure anime with cool stuff thrown in, a recipe for enjoyment.  For me personally, that is all I need to consider an anime to be good.  If you delve into character developments so long and convoluted that you have to take notes like you are...in some kind of lecture hall, you are looking for the wrong kind of show.The story is what any pure adventure story should be, the kid wants to be the very best to achieve greatness.  Throw obstacles and more goals in his way to create a sense of character development and you have a sturdy framework that fight scenes and boob jokes can be attached to.The art is great.  The characters have a wardrobe that changes often and each character's equipment was cool and well put together. I personally would love to cosplay as Bell if I had the time to put to it.  The city are full of meticulous detail.  The art for the dungeon definitely was focused on key scenes and the final episodes however. I wasn't as impressed by any special details or work put into the dungeon where most of the show took place.The soundtrack is excellent.  I liked this soundtrack better than almost any other anime for mood setting and general ambiance.The characters are plain.  I cannot argue that.  If you want more character development in the anime and it is the only reason you don't want to watch this, then just 'head cannon' the hell out of it.  I personally like to imagine Bell is dealing with more inner struggle with the girls he is stuck between and is realizing that Aiz may not be what he is looking for. But I do admit the fact that every girl in the anime wants Bell is quite annoying and one of the reasons I often dislike an anime.Ignoring some of the random oddities that make me shake my head at times, I can enjoy this show more than almost other I have seen.  I can sit down after watching something that truly made me feel unwell (ecchi harem anime recommended by a friend) and remember that there are some anime that are just fun to watch.In the end, I wish there was more DanMachi to come, but I know this is just another show for some easy money.

Yes the anime is cliche, but it makes it work. The main character is not a three dimensional character at all and most times it seems like he falls under the cliche category hero, but through this you'll find yourself adored by his selflessness and awkwardness. The females he encounters are the opposite. I find that once you look deeper and past the boobs, you'll find characters that have motivation for every single one of their action with their characters...becoming more and more intricate as their histories are unveiled. No this is not a perfect anime, but it was an entertaining one. becoming more and more intricate as their histories are unveiled. No this is not a perfect anime, but it was an entertaining one."", ""I will preface this by saying I went in with no hope whatsoever for this show and merely for the purpose of being entertained. Given its name and notoriety for fan-service, I expected something along the lines of Konosuba, but that would fall far short.Now for my opinion (for what it's worth). First off, I WOULD NOT CALL THIS A COMEDY. I remember shouting this at the t.v. at one point, while in the grip of powerful emotion. There are some funny moments. However, there are some major feels about halfway through.I've read a lot of reviews about boring characters. Okay. There are a...few who remain one-dimensional the whole way. However, I actually got invested in several (and I'm a bit of a snob!) Like most anime, there is a theme of wanting to get stronger. But there are also themes of forgiveness that were very touching.Next I want to address the plot. Many have expressed boredom. I don't know what you want from a show, but I found the first half of this one to be very interesting. And not necessarily for its world, but for its character interactions. Now the show does seem to devolve some after the halfway point. The first half of the show is really why I rated it as high as I did.All this to say that I don't think this is a bad anime. Are there boobs? Yes! But what anime doesn't take a moment or two to focus on that anymore? I did not start feeling distracted by the fan service until the very last episodes. However, if you are looking for a really good laugh like in Konosuba, your time might be best spent elsewhere (like on Konosuba!)Side note:  If you end up liking the show, there is a spin-off series about Ais Wallenstein that is also fairly entertaining. It runs parallel to this show but from her perspective and answers a few questions you don't even know you want answers to. Not the best plot and the fan service gets stepped up, but enjoyable all the same—especially if you are a completionist like me. few who remain one-dimensional the whole way.

The animation, fight scenes and voice acting were all very well done. If nothing else, this anime is enjoyable when you don’t really think too much about what you’re watching. 2/2Did the anime accomplish what it was attempting to do stylistically?DanMachi on a stylistic level did not take many risks or do anything that I’ve never seen before. It accomplished its role as a...semi-RPG inspired anime, but did nothing along the way deserving of praise. 0.5/2Was the anime mostly original?If I was going to describe DanMachi, one word I would definitely never use is original. DanMachi almost serves as a 13 episode experiment to see how many clichés one anime can fit into a season. You have your insert-yourself male protagonist who inexplicably has incredible luck with the ladies, cheesy RPG game-esque setting, big breasted female characters with little substance, fanservice galore and unstoppable OP main character with almost no character flaws. 0/2Did the anime rely too much on filler content?DanMachi this season is 13 episodes in duration, there were no recap episodes or episodes that otherwise seemed to branch from the main narrative. 2/2Would I recommend it to others?I certainly would not recommend this show to people looking for a cerebral and thought provoking anime. If you’re looking: for nicely done fight scenes, well-endowed women, a God-like main character whom everyone seems to like and not much in the way of substance in between; this is the show for you! 0.5/2Total score: 5/10 semi-RPG inspired anime, but did nothing along the way deserving of praise. 0.5/2Was the anime mostly original?If I was going to describe DanMachi, one word I would definitely never use is original.

They\'re just all meek and mild and can\'t say no to anyone, which gives the impression of being bland and featureless, while in...reality they\'re doormats who hurt everyone by being blandly nice to them. Bell adds to this a ridiculous painful shyness around the woman he actually likes (you can tell who that is because it\'s the only woman with whom he has basically no relationship to speak of). I don\'t mind that lots of women are interested in him; in a world of jerks, he\'s actually a nice guy, and he\'s doing some pretty impressive things. It\'s not unrealistic that this would get him some attention. Of course the women would want to talk with him; of course the men would see him as competition (though let\'s be honest, a lot of the women would see him as competition too). The issue is that he has no idea of how to talk to people. So he doesn\'t talk to people. So the charm ought to wear off pretty quickly, like when you see that cool guy across the room, go up and talk with them, and it turns out they\'re boring.The other flaw with this characterization is a certain scene involving napping in which our Nice Guy acknowledges a previously totally unrecognized creepy side, and somehow has an internal struggle about whether to act on it. Please. NOTHING in the rest of this man\'s characterization would suggest he would even consider acting on it. And at the very least he\'s intelligent enough to know that it would be social suicide if he did.That said, the harem is awfully frustrating. There\'s maybe three, four characters that have more pronounced crushes than passing interest. And that\'s what they are--crushes. They just want his attention (or possibly his money and free labor...). But the squabbling, led by everyone\'s favorite Clingy Jealous Goddess, just gets tedious, and becomes an excuse for a lot of pandering to the viewer that feels cheap and insulting. And enough with the fan-service. We have a freaking Internet, if I want to watch cartoon boobies I can go find actual porn.Look I am all about the love triangles/polyhedra. I will ship a furniture documentary if I think that ottoman really loves the sofa and you can show me why they belong together. But there\'s gotta be some actual romance there. Nobody involved in this seems to have a motivation other than competitiveness and attention-seeking, and I don\'t really care which lunch table Bell sits at. Relationships founded on ""I really need attention and you\'re enough of a pushover that you\'ll endlessly provide it"" are as unsatisfying to watch as they are to be in.What else... the vast majority of the conflicts have entirely too low stakes. I mean we use all the shonen battle anime tricks to try to raise the stakes--monsters power up, become invincible, smash things, rocks fall, swords break, speed-lines happen, special attack names get shouted, etc. But none of that matters, because no one watching this has the slightest bit of doubt that Bell will prevail through his Magic of Prevailing or whatever the excuse is this episode. None of it is earned through hard work (other than a stubborn dedication to the ideal of Best-ness). We get a couple training scenes but there\'s never the impression that he\'s actually working hard for this. And more importantly, none of his victories are ever paid for with sacrifice. He doesn\'t have to give up anything to become greater than what he is. Where\'s the drama in that?The worldbuilding--it\'s fine. I mean it\'s stupid, and a little cringey to hear people explicitly talking about someone\'s level, but I\'ll roll with it if there\'s a good story. There just isn\'t.At the end of the day, this is 13 episodes of what really could have been a training montage on the way to the actual arc of the story. What is it Bell wants to do? Impress a chick? Build a familia? Save the world? Get elected dog-catcher? NOBODY KNOWS. So we\'re stuck watching him grind out levels. And the show becomes ""Is it wrong to screw around in a dungeon trying to get enough exp and geld to be better able to screw around in a dungeon some more?""I would be happy to watch this if there were a weighty choice between a couple plausible romance interests with earnestly developed relationships. I\'d be happy to watch this if Bell\'s victories came at a cost. I\'d be happy to watch this if we were moving toward something.

I\'d be happy to watch this if Bell\'s victories came at a cost. I\'d be happy to watch this if we were moving toward something. But Slice of Life of your favorite JRPG is better done with Let\'s Play videos....all that said... real S2 when?', ""Hello everyone.First of all I write the good parts in this review, because I enjoyed this anime all along, and I got a bit addicted to it, because I thought it's a great anime. I enjoyed the storyline, the characters, and the fun that they created, although it is a fine anime if you just want to laugh a lot.In the second part, I will tell the bad parts which disturbed me quite a bit and why I had to give 6 to it in the end. The story is fine, the characters are fine, but the fact is that there are too many free...wires left unfinished. It feels like the story is incomplete, also the relationships between few characters are left so open, that it disturbs me quite a bitSo in conclusion, I wished to give 9 or 10 to this anime at the begining because it was a lot of fun and it also captivated me with the story and the main characters love and attitude towards Aiz, but in the end I felt like I got no real story, just harem and nothing more... The only thing that still make me think between 6-8 is the fun and the laugh that it made.[SPOILER ALERT]Bell's was the main power of Bell through the story, but is he in love with Aiz in the end? It feels like he's just running away from her, not even trying to date her or something... Even after the training she gave him, he is keeping distance. Also Hestia seems to have Bell a bit like a slave not as a familia member by not letting him to go out with no girl... well at least Lili spices it up a bit, but as long as Hestia gives him everything and keeps him the over-powered seems like Bell doesn't even care if he'll be with Aiz or not. wires left unfinished.

I was surprised that this show ended up becoming one of the more popular shows of the season, it just looked like one of those shows that would be mainly overlooked. But of course, this is anime, where fan-service, harems, and overpowered protagonists are all the fans care about. But putting aside popularity aside, let’s talk about if the show is any good.Story + CharactersThe show is very simple. There is a...dungeon filled with monsters. Adventures go into the dungeon to fight and kill the monsters with magic and sharp objects blessed by the power of gods and goddesses. And the story focuses on one such adventurer, Bell.Now, I really like Bell. He’s your typical shonen protagonist, a bit sheepish, very naïve with all the females falling in love with him, and he’s a generally nice guy, wanting to help and protect his friends while being willing to forgive those who hurt him. Despite the fact that his character really isn’t anything new or unique, he’s the type of person I really want to root for. I want to see him get stronger, to overcome his foes.I really liked seeing him become respected as the show went on, overcome difficulties that seemed impossible. Yes, he does have quite a bit of plot armor, and he’s a bit overpowered, which did hurt the show, but not as badly as it could have.We also have the goddess Hestia who is the leader of Bell’s famlia, of which Bell is the only member. At times, I really liked her. Bell and Hestia really do care about each other, will to whatever it takes to help one another, and this makes their interactions really cute. Unfortunately, Hestia is in love with Bell, and she gets jealous easily, which leads to some really cringe worthy moments. They really should have either left romance out completely, or just developed the romance between Hestia and Bell without hinting at the feelings the other girls had for him; as it was the harem elements really hurt the show.All the other characters had something that made them interesting. From the elf who works at the local restaurant, to Lili, a girl who joins Bell as a supporter, they all have a little bit of back story that gives them depth. My favorite character is the god Hermies, but he doesn’t really play a role until the end of the show.Looking at the plot here, it really feels very generic. Pretty much all the story elements here have been done before, so if you’re looking for some revolutionary anime, you’re not going to find it here. The genericness is something that holds the show back, but it also helps the show in a way. A lot of anime, especially of the adventure genre, try to tell some grand story, aiming for the peak of anime greatness only to fail to handle their story right and become a mess. Instead, this anime chooses to stick with something generic, but executes it in a way that’s a lot of fun.Despite the fact that Bell is an overpowered protagonist, it never feels like he’s the strongest. His power may grow faster than anyone else, but there are a lot of people who are still way more powerful than him. Bell does get a number of moments to shine on his own, but there are also times where despite his strength, he’s not able to overcome his obstacles without the help of others.Despite its generic nature, I found the story interesting. There were enough different conflicts to keep me engaged. Sometimes it was a monster in the dungeon that Bell had to defeat, and other times it were other people he had to overcome. Another thing I liked about the show is how it was able to contrast Bell’s naïve view of the world with the dark pasts and actions of some of the characters. The themes of what it means to be a hero are strong here, as this is Bell’s motivation for wanting to get stronger. Again, this is something that’s been seen elsewhere numerous times, but I still like what it added to the show.Of course, despite the fact that I did enjoy this show, I can’t look past its problems. Due to the nature of the show, you know that Bell is going to be the hero and save the day. So any battle he’s in with at least something at stake, you know he’s going to win.The fan-service and harem elements really hurt the show as well. They were oftentimes very uninteresting, and just seemed to be taking up time until something more serious happened. Some could say that they added comedy, but I didn’t find it funny at all. And really, the romance didn’t go anywhere by the end of the show. Sure, some friendships were developed, but the romance could have been taken out completely and nothing would have been lost. As for the fan-service, did having Bell fall into a lake filled with about 5 naked girls really help the show? I get that they were trying to have some lighter scenes before the end of the show, but they could have done this in better ways.And speaking of the end of the show, it’s really not over. The final episode worked as a good enough season finale. The battle was epic and all, and it resolved that arc nicely, but it also tells the viewer there is much more story to tell. Now, will the rest of the story be animated? Possibly, with the popularity the show has gotten a second season wouldn’t surprise me. But I have to hold the fact that the story is incomplete against the show.Overall, the best word to describe this show is generic. It does well to keep the viewer entertained most of the time, and it doesn’t take itself so seriously that it falls apart, so those are both plusses, but there isn’t anything great about the story. It’s good at being okay, which is more than I can say for a lot of other shows that came out this year.Animation + SoundThe animation here is okay. The show looks pretty good for the most part, there weren’t any times where it was so bad it hurt the show, or if there were, I didn’t notice them. The action scenes were where the show could have really shined, but these were too short lived for the most part to really have any impact. The most interesting thing visually about the show was the final battle where everything had a red tint to it. This really added to the intensity of the scene and the danger the character’s faced, but at times it made it hard to tell who was who, and since a lot of minor characters were involved in this battle, it made it hard to follow.Music wise, this is another case where the show is pretty good. The battle scenes had intense music that helped. The actual sound effects felt off at times, especially with the explosions from fire magic.The opening here is cute, does a good job of introducing the show, and even foreshadows some of the big moments later on in the show, which is all I ask for from an opening. Skippable if you want to get right to the episode, but not a bad opening at all.Final ThoughtsThis show is one of those shows that was good to watch on a weekly basis as it comes out. It’s one that you’d watch just to watch anime. It’s a generic, but fun show, and if that sounds like what you’re looking for, then this anime is for you. I really can’t see this show’s fame lasting much beyond the time it was airing, but it was fun while it lasted.Scoring:Story: 5.5Characters: 5.7Animation: 6.5Sound: 7Other (Excessive Fan-Service): -0.1Total: 5.76 (note that categories are not weighed equally)Rating: Worth Checking OutOther Suggestions: Attack on Titan, Show by Rock dungeon filled with monsters.

Then I read a review in the OtakuUSA that convinced me to give a shot. And it was worth it. The character designs are a little ecchi but the plot and action make up for any shortcomings. I liked that our hero, Bell, plays an an average guy as opposed to a hero who’s simply more powerful than everyone else. And that he cannot escape danger by simply getting/being more powerful than his enemies. I like the depth and backstory provided to each character. It makes...the characters seem real and personable. The action was tense and gripping with an actual sense of danger. They live in a world where journeys into the dungeon aren’t safe; survival is not guaranteed. It also lacks my two least favorite anime clichés: a high school setting and characters making bad decisions because the writers need to create conflict. As much as I enjoyed this series, I do have one complaint, and that’s the character of Hestia. Her feelings for Bell seem purposely undeclared by the writers because she’s designed to be cute and buxom; ergo no straight man would reject her if she confessed to them. And since Bell is straight, he’d say yes if she did, so she doesn’t. So she overly protective of him when he’s around other women which reminds me of brother complex (my third least favorite anime cliché). It just seems like there was half a dozen better ways to handle this unrequited love part of the story but they followed the curved line to circumvent the issue.In conclusion I loved it and would recommend it to everyone! the characters seem real and personable.

This was another very popular anime that only had 13 episodes, and the show suffers greatly for it. There was a second season announced in Feb of 2018 which could see the light of day by the end of 2019 but thats 3 years after the airing of the first season and I cannot judge whether or not its existence will add to the end of this animes story since it isnt out yet. My review is also excluding the movie and the single ova that were released after the end of the 13th episode since the ova is...mostly fan service.This series lacks solid pacing or character development due to its rushed nature of 12 episodes which is a shame since there are real possibilities with the realization of the main characters lineage at the very end of the season. Also there are entire plots that are hinted at but never fleshed out at all since as flashes to future antagonists and the realization that whole characters motivations rest on plans of characters that we are never introduced to.Character wise if you love the idea of characters in a classic rpg dungeon crawler setting similar to Sword art Online then you have some things to enjoy here. The show also incorporates the idea of Greek and Roman Gods as guild leaders for the human characters which sounds awesome in theory but isnt really used in a fun way. These god characters usually just stand around and talk/plot their own agendas/look cool and barely resemble the gods they are based upon. The main character is a basic flat shounen character who is oblivious to the physical advances of literally every female character in the show simply because he is a shy, innocent main character boy. He also receives powerups as needed for the plot and features abilities far beyond every other character except his silent and reserved crush who we barely get to see fight throughout the series and are merely told of her exceptional battle prowess. In fact I would argue that the lack of creativity witht he plot and characters is probably this shows greatest shortcoming. This show loves classic anime tropes which by itself is fine if you use them in an interesting way which this shows slow pace and lack of character development really struggles to accomplish.On the flip side the big redeeming points of this series are when we get to see a few devastating, blood splatter inducing attacks on labyrinth monsters and.....Hestia. Hestia is the goddess figure of the main character and is actually in the show a considerable amount which is great because her design is very cute and I personally found her to be hilarious in most of her dialogue but I could easily see other people finding her annoying. Hestia is one of the best waifus in my book though which probably skewed my score up from a 6 to a 7 to be honest.So in summary we have here an underdeveloped plot with underdeveloped characters in a fantasy rpg world with greek/roman god characters sprinkled in. we also have solid production values and sound design mixed with some decent action pieces when they get going plus one of the best waifus in all of anime right now which skates this season 1 by as a 7. mostly fan service.This series lacks solid pacing or character development due to its rushed nature of 12 episodes which is a shame since there are real possibilities with the realization of the main characters lineage at the very end of the season.

I loved this anime, a perfect little story that is very cute and funny.Plot score: 7A lot of people are talking about how this show is awful, but I think the story is actually pretty good. There is clearly a lot going on that isn\'t fully explained, but it is pretty nice to have that mystery. The story clearly goes deeper than any of the characters really know themselves, which is likely why...the viewer is also kept in the dark about certain things. It is basically set up like a video game-style story, and something about that is just fantastic really.Art Score: 10!I\'m a big BIG fan of this art style, the monsters and characters are all really well done, the scenery and complex dungeon are done beautifully and I can\'t find a single fault with this art style, in my opinion.Sound: 10Just listen to it, really really listen to it and you will see that it is very well done.Character: 10The main characters and their relationships are very well explained and the development of each character\'s personality and connection with others is quite well done. Background and secondary characters even have a depth you don\'t get elsewhere. Some make the claim that the women in this story inexplicably fall in love with the main character, but once you really look at what the main character is and what he stands for you will see that he is charming in his own way.Enjoyment: 10The combination of so many amazing things, a unique story, amazing art, perfect sound effects, and great characters, is truly a recipe for enjoyment. I almost never review anime, but this anime is easily in my top 10. It is very memorable, yet you can still rewatch it and gain new insight into the plot, characters, or their relationships.Overall: 9The only reason I give this a 9, is because I put the ""Story"" at 7. It really doesn\'t deserve a 7, in my opinion, but I can see why many people wouldn\'t like this video game-esque style of story telling. Since there isn\'t really a second season yet, (hope it happens) we are missing quite an important part of this story, yet another reason why I\'ve decided to reduce it down to 7. If you\'re a fan of game plots, you will likely love the story as much as I did. While there are large breasted women, I feel that simply adds to the story and the development of the main character\'s personality more than it detracts from the story in favor of fanservice.I highly suggest you watch this movie if you\'re a fan of video games, action/romance, and underdog stories.So, in short: 10/10 personally, 9/10 for most, and 1/10 for people who fail to read into the anime enough to fully understand and appreciate what has been done here.Keep your ears perked for the ending, the reveal there is very understated and almost an aside, but it truly shows why the main character is what he is and is essential to understanding what is going on. the viewer is also kept in the dark about certain things.

I\'m not quite sure what people expected with a title like ""Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"" And just look at the main female character. Let\'s not fool ourselves. You know what this is; I know what this is. It is a perfectly passable series that plays to certain fantasy tropes. It is a dumb series to turn off your brain and teases a kind of wish fulfillment (because we all want to pick up girls in a dungeon).The characters have one-note personalities; there is little to no plot; and nothing\'s meaningfully advanced by...the story\'s end. The main male character is a Gary Stu with no discernable flaws or personality, and the female MC loves him for no real reason. And so what? Be honest with yourself: did you even want this to be some insightful series that changed your view of this incredibly dumb genre?No, I think your set up looked like mine--you sat down and wanted to get some work done and turned this on to occasionally watch. This is a great series for background noise and for when you don\'t feel like investing in something significant. At least, that is is what I wanted, and that\'s what I got.

As evidenced by other reviews, your mileage may vary.', ""Warning possible SpoilersThis show was a pure example of why adventuring can be really fun, but it can also be very dangerous if you don't watch yourself so make sure to bring your busty loli goddess for a little help.Danmachi is set in the city of Orario and the young adventurer called Bell Cranel along with his goddess Hestia are having trouble getting by with the kills Bell makes in the Dungeons until suddenly an encounter with the Swordsmen called Ais Wallenstein gave him new hope on being an adventurer.Now despite this show not having a very heavy story it was still very enjoyable to...watch, it was fun and interesting seeing Bell get stronger and more experienced in the dungeons plus experiencing the dangers of being an adventurer since it isn't all fun and games there are dark aspects to being an adventurer and it was interesting seeing Bell overcome these problems.It was also fun seeing the relationship between Bell and Hestia since he is part of her familia, but she wants Bell to be more than just her familia member plus it was hilarious seeing the antics these two get into.Even though this is a comedy most of the time there are a lot of serious moments which were pretty epic to watch like when Bell was fighting a possessed Minotaur, when Bell and his group were trapped in the dungeons and had to reach a safe zone by evading a huge boss or even the final battle itself were all epic moments in the series that were very entertaining and thrilling to watch.Now the characters were funny and pretty interesting since some characters had some pretty dark backstories.Bell Cranel the male MC is a likeable character because despite being weak when it comes to fighting early on he does slowly develop his powers and unlike most protagonists his powers aren't OP and there are plenty of moments where was in danger and needed others to help making him a teamplayer, he is also a kind and protective person especially when it comes to Hestia and his other teammates, however he gets easily intimidated by stronger foes which makes him do so rash decisions at times, but these moments are very few.Hestia the female MC is a Goddess and the head of her familia, she is a really funny, but caring character since Bell is the only member of her familia and that she has a crush on him she is very protective of him since she worries that whenever bell goes into the Dungeons she thinks he might die if he isn't careful, however she does get jealous of other girls flirting with Bell since she flirts with him herself hence why she dislikes Ais since she has caught Bell's eyes, but other than her jealousy she is a very funny character to have around.There is also the other members who join Hestia's familia like Lili who is a catgirl that has been under the command of other familias, but she has an extreme hatred for adventurers which is understandable since she is heavily abused by her adventurer teammates until she meet Bell which changed her insight on adventurers which inevitably made her form a crush on him which made Hestia jealous of her, she is a useful person collecting the items and crystals from dead monsters that the others kill.The other familia member is Welf who is a blacksmith that was originally part of the Hephaistos familia until he swapped familias he used to create magical weapons until he realised that people mainly used them to show off so he quit until Bell came along and showed him how useful an adventurers weapon is which gave him new insight, he is also a bit of a joker and becomes good friends with Bell very quickly.There are a few other characters like other familia members like Hephaistos who is a friend of hestia and it was fun watching these two argue from time to time.Ais Wallenstein is the weak link in the character section mainly because she isn't really given much character develop other than she is a badass which isn't enough for me to like her or have interest hell her other party members seemed more interesting which is why I hope they improve her character in the Sword Oratoria spinoff.The Artstyle was pretty good I liked how the floors in the dungeons changed the more you go down and the place where Bell was lured into a trap by Lili looked pretty creepy and looked unnerving too, but there were areas like the safe zone which had crystals to light up the area that did look pretty amazing plus some of the magic effects like Bells firebolt attack or when all the adventurers worked together when fighting the giant monster at the end looked epic as hell. I liked the look of the world too even though it seems like what most fantasies would look like I thought it was a pretty interesting world and had a lot of different and colourful characters within it.The comedy was well done and had me laughing most of the time like when Hestia and Loki were having a tantrum and started picking on their breast sizes or when Bell had an awkward situation with Ais and curved into a ball and ran away was pretty funny too. There are also a lot of moments where there is fanservice and we all know why Hestia fits this area too well, but that didn't put me off since i liked her personality (and figure), there was a few other moments too like the scene where Bell without much of a choice and Hermes spy on the girls taking a bath which ended up being a pretty hilarious moment.The action was also pretty good too a lot of the battles that Bell and the others were in looked very life-threatening and I was on edge most of the time since the foes they fought looked very powerful and they mostly won on the very edge of death so the show nicely splits the action and comedy very well.Overall I thought this was a very fun show to watch true there isn't really much of a story here, but it really does shine in all it's other areas like the comedy, action, it's fantasy setting and the characters were fun too so if you're someone who does like a good fantasy anime then this is something to check out. watch, it was fun and interesting seeing Bell get stronger and more experienced in the dungeons plus experiencing the dangers of being an adventurer since it isn't all fun and games there are dark aspects to being an adventurer and it was interesting seeing Bell overcome these problems.It was also fun seeing the relationship between Bell and Hestia since he is part of her familia, but she wants Bell to be more than just her familia member plus it was hilarious seeing the antics these two get into.Even though this is a comedy most of the time there are a lot of serious moments which were pretty epic to watch like when Bell was fighting a possessed Minotaur, when Bell and his group were trapped in the dungeons and had to reach a safe zone by evading a huge boss or even the final battle itself were all epic moments in the series that were very entertaining and thrilling to watch.Now the characters were funny and pretty interesting since some characters had some pretty dark backstories.Bell Cranel the male MC is a likeable character because despite being weak when it comes to fighting early on he does slowly develop his powers and unlike most protagonists his powers aren't OP and there are plenty of moments where was in danger and needed others to help making him a teamplayer, he is also a kind and protective person especially when it comes to Hestia and his other teammates, however he gets easily intimidated by stronger foes which makes him do so rash decisions at times, but these moments are very few.Hestia the female MC is a Goddess and the head of her familia, she is a really funny, but caring character since Bell is the only member of her familia and that she has a crush on him she is very protective of him since she worries that whenever bell goes into the Dungeons she thinks he might die if he isn't careful, however she does get jealous of other girls flirting with Bell since she flirts with him herself hence why she dislikes Ais since she has caught Bell's eyes, but other than her jealousy she is a very funny character to have around.There is also the other members who join Hestia's familia like Lili who is a catgirl that has been under the command of other familias, but she has an extreme hatred for adventurers which is understandable since she is heavily abused by her adventurer teammates until she meet Bell which changed her insight on adventurers which inevitably made her form a crush on him which made Hestia jealous of her, she is a useful person collecting the items and crystals from dead monsters that the others kill.The other familia member is Welf who is a blacksmith that was originally part of the Hephaistos familia until he swapped familias he used to create magical weapons until he realised that people mainly used them to show off so he quit until Bell came along and showed him how useful an adventurers weapon is which gave him new insight, he is also a bit of a joker and becomes good friends with Bell very quickly.There are a few other characters like other familia members like Hephaistos who is a friend of hestia and it was fun watching these two argue from time to time.Ais Wallenstein is the weak link in the character section mainly because she isn't really given much character develop other than she is a badass which isn't enough for me to like her or have interest hell her other party members seemed more interesting which is why I hope they improve her character in the Sword Oratoria spinoff.The Artstyle was pretty good I liked how the floors in the dungeons changed the more you go down and the place where Bell was lured into a trap by Lili looked pretty creepy and looked unnerving too, but there were areas like the safe zone which had crystals to light up the area that did look pretty amazing plus some of the magic effects like Bells firebolt attack or when all the adventurers worked together when fighting the giant monster at the end looked epic as hell.

I saw a standard looking Sshounen protag and a loli large ""plot"". But I decided to watch it anyway. It turned out pretty average. Average everything, except girls, and that is what makes the show bare able.Story: 5/10It is strung up a lot like an ""stuck in an MMO game"",  only they are not stuck in an RPG. The world they live in, Osario, is a lot more like Monster Hunter than an MMO, but it is still very much like a...game world. They level up, gain new skills, and form parties. The only new thing that this show adds to this formula is that gods exist in this world, and they form guilds of Hunters to try and become the best guild. Early versions of this show, like Log Horizon and SAO, and Konosuba from this season did this well. You can add this to that list. Though it is very average,  the changing of mechanics in  this show is fun. I like the actual monster hunter game and seeing a similar game is fun. The gods was also an interesting and new concept.Art: 7/10Like a lot of J.C.  staff works, this show has decent art with  very good effects. The characters and backgrounds are nothing special, but all the effects are quite good. The monsters as well all look quite cool, especially the large monkey in ep.3.Sound: 7/10Besides the protag, all the voice acting is quite good. Inori Minase was very good as Hestia, Yoshimasa Hosoya always does well, and Haruka Tomatsu was one of my favorite performances in  the show even if she had a small role. In general however, I do not like Yoshitsugu  Matsouka. Kirito was already a boring character and he just made it worse. Here as well he just makes a shounen protag worse. He\'s okay when he just plays a high schooler( EX. Natsuki from Nijiiro days), but in any role where screaming is very prominent than he is never good. The background music here was one of the few times I actually payed attention to. Though I can not name any of the tracks, the very calm attitude of most of them was good. The OP/ED on the other hand were very forgettable.Characters: 8/10Besides our standard, dense shounen protag, everyone else in the cast is quite good. Hestia was funny, Aiz did not care, Lily was adorable, Welf reminded me of a chuunibyo, Ryu was a funny yandere, and Eina was a great older sister. As usual,  the best part of this Harem was the girls.Enjoyment: 6/10Ecchi is not one of my favorite genres, but when it is done well it is at the very least bare able. Though a lot of this show is just average, there are some parts, like the acting and characters that were quite good. Though the main character was a standard one, the others made it bare able. I usually do not like Loli\'s  but Hestia  is indeed the ""Bestia"".Overall: 7/10Better than most ecchi\'s and ""Stuck in a video game"" shows, Danmachi as most people call it is a show I can recommend if  you like either of those genres.

Watch it if you want, but there is no need.', 'Adapting Fantasy Light Novels into anime seems to be a current trend nowadays, and is a trend that has produced some extremely divisive anime in recent years. A lot of them mostly seem to involve either overpowered protagonists or an RPG like world. And a lot of them seem to be shameless cash grabs that act as an effective way to advertise the light novel. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, or DanMachi which I’ll be referring to it as for the review, doesn’t follow these trends, to a certain extent. The biggest difference between DanMachi and some of...the other shows that have come out during the post SAO boom is that it knows how to write a decent protagonist.Unlike most protagonists in this genre that are almost always overpowered teens (they’re that way because of the impact a certain black swordsman had on the industry), DanMachi’s protagonist, Bell Cranel has the audacity to be something that these other protagonists aren’t, an actual character. Bell starts off as just another adventurer in the bustling city of Orario who also lives in his guild (alone) with his goddess Hestia in their run-down church. He seems content with his daily life until he meets a swordswoman that saves him from a Minotaur in the dungeon. He learns that she is one of the strongest warriors in the world and is a part of one of the strongest guilds. He then strives to get stronger so he can eventually be on the same level as the swordswoman (Aiz Wallenstein), who he has also fallen in love with. Even though it’s simple, the story doesn’t set out to be anything more than it is. It’s a story about someone who wants to get stronger and do better so he can impress someone who is on a higher level than he is. Through his journey to become stronger, he begins to impact the people around him and gains new allies all with the goal to get on the same level as Aiz and her guild. You see him succeed and gain new abilities all through the act of training and never giving up. One of the best aspects of the show is how the only way he can get badass skills is by facing off against tough opponents and monsters. He actually has to TRY to get more powerful, unlike our favorite black swordsman whose progress we see off screen.One of the best parts of the show happens in Episode 8 where Bell fights against an enemy that would have been a challenge for even the strongest of adventurers and succeeds. From his struggle, he attains his own personal skill that helps with his overall growth as a warrior. This fight scene shows how much Bell wants to get stronger so that Aiz can see him as an equal. His determination is relatable and admirable, especially since we see how far he will go just so that he will achieve his goal.The importance of goals for any protagonist in any form of media is something that I feel is overlooked. A goal is essential in making good characters and a good story. A good example of this is comparing Big 3: Naruto, Bleach and One Piece. Naruto and Once Piece both have a goal that the main character wants to achieve throughout the whole series. Naruto wants to be the Hokage and Luffy is searching for the One Piece. These are both goals for the characters to achieve that also make room for how the story progresses. Naruto grows a lot throughout the series before he becomes Hokage and Luffy is still searching for the One Piece, which involves traveling the world and going on an abundance of adventures. Then we have Bleach, where the series protagonist, Ichigo doesn’t have a goal that spans across the whole series other than protecting his friends, which is more situational rather than a plot point. After the first big arc of Bleach, the story keeps recycling old ideas and keeps the same main villain, all because that is the only way for Ichigo to grow, just by fighting stronger opponents and getting new powers. Because Naruto and One Piece have goals for the characters to achieve we see physical and mental growth as the story progresses. This point is more a part of Naruto since it’s a better example of this compared to One Piece. While this may have nothing to do with DanMachi, I made this point to stress how important goals are to any type of fiction, and how much of a good thing it is that DanMachi has a good goal opposed to shows like SAO, Grimgar and The Asterisk War. They’re not needed in everything of course, but they certainly help with shows like DanMachi, especially with creating a likable and relatable character.One of the main reasons that DanMachi was ignored or written off by a lot of anime fans was not the fault of the story but the bland characters. While I do like his growth and effectiveness as a protagonist, Bell is also an extremely bland protagonist, personality wise. He’s the generic nice guy that attracts all the ladies, and there’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just that it can be a problem since that archetype has been done to death in every single type of entertainment. It’s the same personality trait that every protagonist of these kinds of shows have and it can get annoying after you’ve seen a bunch of them. He does get a bit more confident near the end of the series and really shows his worth during the final few episodes of the series where he saves his unconscious party members from the dungeon, while still injured. It’s times when shit hits the fan that Bell really shines and they also happen to be my favorite moments from the show.The other main character in the show is Hestia, the goddess of Bell’s guild. While she is the typical fan service character that is attracted to the protagonist, she never really comes off as annoying and her affection for Bell seems more genuine since they share a heart-warming bond with each other. Her jiggling tits can be distracting in most scenes and the fact that Bell seems completely unaware of her affection can get annoying, but that’s more of a problem with the story rather than the character. The other sort-of main character is Aiz Wallenstein who acts as Bell’s love interest and goal of the series. Going with the main theme of lack of originality, Aiz is the typical emotionless but curious badass swords woman character. While don’t personally have a problem with these types of characters, they appear so much in these types of shows that it feels like they’re all carbon copies of one another. For what this show is, she’s fine and fulfills her role nicely, but her generic archetype seems like wasted potential especially if a little more effort was put into writing her as an actual character rather than a blank slate that’s good at fighting.My main problem with shows like this, and DanMachi especially is that if a little more effort was put into writing good characters, the shows wouldn’t be hated by so many people. If Bell was more entertaining and Aiz was interesting, I wouldn’t be here complaining, but the sad truth is while the story is simplistic but effective, little to no effort was put into writing good characters which brings the show down a lot in my opinion. It’s the wasted potentional that bothers me the most, but that’s more of the author’s fault rather than the anime itself.One of best parts about the characters is that they are all portrayed nicely by their respective voice actors. While I’m more familiar with Dub actors rather than most Japanese seiyuu (I only really recognized Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who voices Bell), I can still say that every voice actor does an excellent job in their role. As for which version you should watch, since I watched this show subbed I would recommend that version, and I only say this because the dub is handled by Sentai Filmworks who don’t have the best dubs. The soundtrack was decent if a bit forgettable, which isn’t as much a problem since it worked well within the show and was far from terrible.Any show done by J.C. Staff (which is one of my favorite studios) always has great animation, and DanMachi is no exception. Every fight scene in the show is fast, fluid and enjoyable to watch and was one of the main reasons that the fight in Episode 8 was such a memorable moment. The character designs were also nice to look at including the main character, Bell whose signature white hair and red eyes are a nice addition so that he can be easily recognizable unlike every other black-haired teenager that is in almost every show now. The city of Orario is also designed nicely. It’s a good sign for any show if the viewers would like to live in the world that they’re watching, even if Orario is like every other fantasy city, but there’s nothing wrong with that, especially with a show like this.DanMachi is the kind of show you’d watch either to kill some time or if you’re looking for a fun, enjoyable adventure show. It’s let down by blandly written characters which can ruin decent story. Despite its flaws, it’s still worth watching and is one of the better fantasy Light Novel anime to come out in recent years. If you want a light story with a little bit of fanservice, well animated action and a lot of heart, DanMachi should not be overlooked.Final Rating: 7/10 the other shows that have come out during the post SAO boom is that it knows how to write a decent protagonist.Unlike most protagonists in this genre that are almost always overpowered teens (they’re that way because of the impact a certain black swordsman had on the industry), DanMachi’s protagonist, Bell Cranel has the audacity to be something that these other protagonists aren’t, an actual character.

Let's get right into the anime basics.Story; Young man Bell Cranel has just job the Hestia Familia as an adventurer. Trying to push his limits, he went into a level two dungeon and somehow got attacked by a high level minotaur. Thinking his life would be over, a beautiful swords-woman by the name of Ais Wallenstein save him. Although the experience was traumatic, it's also given...him a new goal and skill(that his wonderful goddess hides from him). You get to watch Bell grow, fight tons of bosses and some-how get in but always out of messy situations. Art; JC.Staff can never (usually) go wrong. Beautiful fight scenes, boobs psyches and hilarious expressions from the main cast of characters. A perfect combination. Sound; I thought the OST was cheesy at first, but I ended up liking it at the end. Not the type of music I would add to my everyday playlist though. Characters; Starting with the concept gods/goddesses become normal people on earth, bringing together familia to get blessings from heaven, millions of interesting races to learn about and all the beats/monsters to fight in the dungeons. That sure brings a lot of character if I do say so myself.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the anime. I put off for so long because I thought it would become another Fantasy anime that's revolved around big knocker girls that need to get saved or into(literal most of the time) sticky situations. I loved how normal of a fantasy this was, which made me enjoy it even more. Nothing was difficult about this anime (except maybe the explanation at the very beginning), you have a boy who wants to strong hero, get the girl (although he has a million choices around him) and make friends along the way.I can't wait to start the second season. Hopefully it doesn't blow, and keeps a nice flow from the first season. him a new goal and skill(that his wonderful goddess hides from him). You get to watch Bell grow, fight tons of bosses and some-how get in but always out of messy situations. Art; JC.Staff can never (usually) go wrong. Beautiful fight scenes, boobs psyches and hilarious expressions from the main cast of characters. A perfect combination. Sound; I thought the OST was cheesy at first, but I ended up liking it at the end. Not the type of music I would add to my everyday playlist though. Characters; Starting with the concept gods/goddesses become normal people on earth, bringing together familia to get blessings from heaven, millions of interesting races to learn about and all the beats/monsters to fight in the dungeons. That sure brings a lot of character if I do say so myself.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the anime.

Personally, I don\'t care about those at all. I am a healthy young man but I never did think about those stuffs as a trivial matter that may affect my experience from watching and enjoying this anime. Probably those guys that had problems with it are the ones that have a problem of their own.Another negative reviews about this anime is how the f**k is our...mc getting the girls to ""love"" him for no reason at all? Hehe, as for someone that watched and read most of the sources of this anime, I ascertain you that there are only 4 girls in this anime that likes him.*The four*Hestia- The goddess of Bell. She liked him from the very start of the show without any explanation. Even I don\'t know why she liked him though. She is a goddess that went to the world of humans and monsters in search for fun like any other gods and goddesses. Maybe she gets to like him because he is cute, kind and hopelessness as another factor.Liliruca- Who else won\'t like a guy that saved you from the harsh darkness?Syr- She is the pub waitress that Bell met due to some accident? She is a mystery for me too. Though there are some sources from the novel that might tell the truth about her love for Bell.Freya- Another Goddess that took interest on Bell, not sure why but she is a goddess that came down for fun.*other girls that you may have though that ""loves"" Bell*Aiz- She is the girl that Bell has a crush on. I don\'t think that she likes or loves Bell. I believe that she only has an interest of Bell as of why he gets so strong so fast.Tiona- She first saw Bell fighting a mighty evil that reminded her the stories of the Hero in the books that she read before. For now, I do think that she is interested of Bell out of how he conquered that great evil which is far from ""love"".Tione- I think she is only interested or a fan of Bell of how he managed to beat the mighty evil too.Ryu- She helps Bell because her savior likes this man. You can say that she is also a friend or a good acquaintance of Bell so why not?Eina- Bell\'s dungeon advisor. Not sure if he doesn\'t like Bell at all since I feel like they are quite close. You can say that maybe she is just worrying about Bell as she experience a lot of adventurers already that never came back after going in the dungeon. Also, you can\'t blame her liking Bell. She is at the right age of finding a partner, much more if that guys is cute, hard working and kind. mc getting the girls to ""love"" him for no reason at all?

Yes I did enjoy Overlord and like Gun Gal Online.This show is nothing amazing or original, the show is simple and sometimes seems like there wasn\'t much development and people just stick on. I binged this show in 2 or 3 days and I enjoyed it honestly.This show falls into the its not that good but you can enjoy it in a binge. The environment is not all that unique except its not an other world its their world.You know now a days not many anime\'s are...good and the best ones are just above okay.  I have struggled to find good animes the past few years and most of them have just been cont. of other shows that are already good. This show is about average and is not one of those good animes this was just kinda fun to watch.People criticizing animes and I really think it is great and alot of the time authors wont improve unless you tell them what they made sucks. The show has much to improve on and for character development of some key players you needed a whole other season on the Female Knight Ais, who saved Bell.The way of the show is a quickly built harem around a 14 year old with a pery granpa who raised him and died. He is innocent, nice, and well liked and cared for by everyone. The jokes are not necessarily fresh common boob jokes and pervy jokes. This show needs a lot of work and the only reason I gave it a seven was because I enjoyed the show enough to watch it through usaully i leave anime that really annoying and dumb after the first few minutes.I will say this to end as this show doesn\'t need a through review about loli, neko, or opai,but i dropped this show the first time it came out. I was annoyed by the early and direct boobs in face early start to the show. I am no fan of that genre ""Boob in Face"" but i watched it this time not being surprised or amazed i mussed out but only watched it because i was in the mood for some magic anime and crunchyroll is having a give away so i was like why not. So don\'t watch this show if you can\'t enjoy it its not the best and very generic but its a show you watch while waiting for new ep of steins gate 0 or Legend of galactic heroes good and the best ones are just above okay.

Evidently not, because our MC sure picks up a lot of them there and everyone thinks he’s a total saint.I can’t really blame them though; it’s hard not to love Bell despite his denseness. He’s a pure and real kind MC done well, and his struggles in the Labyrinth feel real. He isn’t immediately OP and fails a lot initially. He acts consistently kindly and it feels natural.Hestia is an awesome character, and just plain adorable. She does become a lot more yandere-like later in the series, but always puts her family first regardless....And it’s not the idea of Bell she likes, she actually knows and likes him as a person and a friend. You can tell he cares for her deeply too. Their Familia relationship is sweet and at the beginning brings a warm fuzzy feeling to your stomach just watching it.Out of the supporting characters: Lili has some decent development in just a short couple of episodes. A sweet kid on the whole, but toughened up by a hard life. She just wants someone to show her a bit of kindness, and really Bell’s the perfect character for that. Aiz doesn’t seem to have much to her besides her power, although she does get a bit more screen-time after a while. Quite a monotone and boring character nonetheless. Stalker Freya is just plain cringey and totally unnecessary for the plot – a lousy character who adds absolutely nothing to the anime. Syr also seems unnecessary – I can’t really find anything to say about her one way or the other. Eina is quite a nice character but there’s not much to her either. Hephaestus is good, but not in much. Welf is fine but still pretty generic.Let’s face it, we’re only here for Hestia and Bell, although Welf, Lili, and Aiz are all necessary as plot devices. There’s a fair amount of fan-service but it fits with this type of anime.World building: not much seen besides the dungeon, in fact not much is even explained. We’re just thrown into Bell’s life, and at this point we don’t actually need much exposition to understand the story. Less is more.Op is typical, not great and not terrible. The brushing the teeth scene is fantastic – such strong family vibes. Makes me grin every time I see it. Rest of music and ed are fine too.The ending felt a bit rushed – all of a sudden everyone’s using these phenomenal powers? It just felt like they were trying to show off how cool everyone is, but wait! They couldn’t be as cool as Bell! So let’s make them all op and then make him even more op. That will show everyone.Well, Hermes’ speech at the ending is a good set up for a season 2. It will be interesting to see how the backstory impacts the future. It is a bit unoriginal and the story would have been fine without it, but I still didn’t expect it.It’s a fun watch, but nothing beyond that. If you liked Magi but wish it had a less focussed plot and added a harem, then you’ll probably like this too. Another classic adventure series.

XD', ""A lot of people can't avoid comparing DanMachi to Sword Art Online. I can see where people recognize the similarity on these two. But the character progression better suit me, it always find a way to entertain you. Admittedly the fan service is jarring, but it does it most of the time to deliver a comedic scene which is fine by me.I come into this series expected to be entertain, not mesmerized. And I was entertained no doubt. DanMachi gets to the meat of the story all the time and didn't bother with filler, which is great for me. The story is cliched I agree,...but it does it without trying to be something it isn't.DanMachi doesn't need to have amazing animation, yet on certain occasion it delivers on ridiculous amount of detail. Yes, on most scene it is just powerpoint slide level of animation, but when the scene requires it, the animation can be memorable. That being said, the background art is disappointing. Filled with dull colors and quite frankly if you put the characters on different background used it doesn't make a difference.Look this is an alternative to SAO which I find to be more enjoyable. If you find it important to always have story that leaves you pondering, characters that you can relate to, or any intellectual art you crave.. Go back. If you are looking for an entertainment while the next FMA is being made. This should be on your list. but it does it without trying to be something it isn't.DanMachi doesn't need to have amazing animation, yet on certain occasion it delivers on ridiculous amount of detail.

Vi a mi novio con ella, y no dudé en sumergirme. Y no me arrepiento en absoluto. Es cómica, llena de acción y monstruos de distinta naturaleza. La trama en sí se desarrolla en ""el calabozo""; que no es más que distintos pisos, como si fueran distintas cuevas, donde los que son bendecidos por algún Dios, van allí a luchar contra esos monstruos para conseguir las gemas que esconden, y con ello, ganar dinero. En concreto, la historia se desarrolla desde el punto de vista de Bell Cranel, el único bendecido por la Diosa Hestia.Existe el manga, y...la novela corta, que es de dónde ha salido la historia inicialmente. Para todos los gustos y colores. Es una historia que no tiene pérdida. El elemento cómico es la Diosa Hestia, con sus intentos de conseguir a Bell para ella sola. Sin embargo, Bell está centrado en Aiz, la mejor aventurera del calabozo. Desea llegar a ser como ella, y por ello se esfuerza como el que más para llegar a conseguirlo. La verdad, es que si analizamos la historia, transmite unos perfectos valores. Bell tiene un objetivo fijado: Llegar a ser tan bueno como lo es Aiz, y lucha por ello. No se queda parado esperando a que la Diosa Hestia se lo consiga. Sin embargo, recibe su ayuda. Le proporciona lo que necesita, para hacerse cada vez más fuerte; le dice sus estadísticas, en que ha mejorado desde la última revisión, y que tiene que subir. El chico sube rápido. Y por el camino va a haciendo distintos amigos que le acompañan en su aventura.La verdad es que recomiendo bastante esta historia, tanto si es la novela ligera, como el anime.

The moment she shows up everything gets significantly worse. Who in the right mind would love such a character, even though she's a god, is beyond me. She is bratty and screaming non-effing-stop. So annoying. As episodes moved on I started skipping scenes with her in them. They don't serve any purpose anymore other than to fill time and get on my nerves.Main character is embodiment of stupidity but he kind of wears it with pride which explains his acceptance of blueballing queen who forbids him to even look at attractive women...but never makes a move on him.

Amid all the ""fan service"" stuff, which really isn\'t that much to be honest, DanMachi is quite a good show that delivers even with subject matter and plot that has been well traversed.The appeal for DanMachi, and it\'s real charm doesn\'t come to fruition until about the middle of the season. The first few episodes are some what goofy, a little cringe. We are introduced to the world of families, guilds, parties, dungeons, gods and goddesses, monsters, and the characters that are...trying to live in this world. The set up is simple, yet all over the place. There is no large exposition, no be explanation of everything that exists in this world, and frankly, it doesn\'t need any of that. The story focuses on the ascent of Bell Cranel from zero to hero and it was a great journey.At first Bell and his goddess are sad to watch and kind of annoying, this only lasts for a few episodes however. As we get to see how weak Bell really is, this is the moment it all begins to turn around. We get to see Bell get stronger and stronger and it really is amazing. His growth isn\'t just reserved for him however. As he gets stronger, the story gets better, more people decide to join him, he is no longer a sorry boy for us to look down on, but a hero we can stand behind.The story does progress quite rapidly, so I can understand why it is a bit absurd to see such a jump in Bell\'s abilities, but it doesn\'t make it any less fun to watch. The animation is quite amazing really. The fighting is immersive, it almost made want to throw a punch or two as I was watching.The music is really complimentary and fitting as well. It feels like fantasy music and really amps up the moments as well. The series was really adept at making the big moments as large as possible while also making the slower quieter moments enjoyable.The laughs come every now and again to fill the gaps  with enough action to keep you going from week to week. I had originally dropped this anime because I thought it would be a harem, funny, fan service oriented anime, but it transitioned beautifully to an anime full of action about a kid who just wants to be the coolest hero around. trying to live in this world.

The protagonists is a great guy but too good a person to do so well, I know he is the protagonist but how can you be like that, that is not very real and I would like him to be more perverted, take more advantage of his opportunities. But the character is still very well built because the anime works because if it had a different personality, it could not connect with the...other characters.

First off, the story isn\'t very strong and is more focused around separate adventures than a main plot. The art is above average with well animated action sequences. The soundtrack fits the fantasy world setting well. And the characters aren\'t anything special.. BUT! Even though the story isn\'t anything special, as a fan of the fantasy genre, I freaking love this anime. It has an excellent and entertaining RPG setting which reminds me of Dungeons...and Dragons. This similarity is shown best through the stat sheet tattoo embedded in the back of the main character Bell Cranel who\'s main goal is to level up and become a stronger adventurer. While watching this series, I found myself being sucked into the fantasy world due to my love of the RPG elements included in the series. Each battle sequence is done extremely well and at points even feel emotional due to Bell constantly being pushed to new limits. An excellent representation of this would be Bell vs. the Ninth Floor Minotaur. Each fight is adrenaline pumping and unforgettable. I even found myself re-watching episodes just to some fights again.So overall, is the anime worth watching and who is it for? This is a must watch for those who enjoy the fantasy/RPG genre. It doesn\'t do anything too special, but what it does is done right. Also.. I didn\'t really mention this in the main review, but if you enjoy fan service.. this anime has plenty. and Dragons.

I'd only gotten a little peek of the anime before watching it so I expected the main character to be the typical perv that all the girls reject. However, I was pleasantly surprised!I didn't find anything to really pop out, the story was relatively normal. But I don't mean that in a bad way! It was a nice story and there were some parts I wasn't expecting (that could also be because I'm not the most experienced weeb as well).The art was also a normal...manga style so once again nothing new. The voice actors weren't bad but weren't the best. I normally pay attention to expression however none of the voice actor's voices stood out.The characters were very nice though! Their personalities were refreshing, especially since I was expecting something different from the main character. I'm a sucker for soft-boiis so I won't even try to deny I really liked Bell getting flustered by all the girls. If soft-boiis aren't your thing though, I also thought the other characters were pretty attachable.It was a nice anime overall though, I always get medical vibes from these kinds of anime for some reason and I really wanted to watch one so this was perfect. I would definitely recommend it! manga style so once again nothing new. The voice actors weren't bad but weren't the best.

On a serious note, this show really is enjoyable to watch. Bell is a really good mc, as he is neither really weak nor really strong, he isn't literal god on earth (like Kirito), which is a good thing. You're able to see him both win and also fail miserably, allowing him to learn from his mistakes and gradually improve. He also has a kinda harem thing going on where it seems like every girl likes him, however I find it funny as...he is too oblivious to it that he only focuses on wanting to get with Aiz, the strongest girl on the planet, who is totally out of his league and he also gets extremely embarrassed around. With these girls loving him, there's also bound to be some fan-service around. Luckily, it's not too in your face that it makes the show insufferable, it is a decent amount without going too overboard.Comedy in a show like this is a bit of a double-edged sword as it could either go poorly or extremely well. Luckily, this show does comedy well. It strikes a fine balance between comedy and drama, able to be both funny and serious on a dime.

I just thought I'd chime in and make a review for this anime, as seeing some of the highlighted reviews I think they're highly unjusitified and I'll be explaining to you why.First of all, I'll give my personal experience with this anime. (I'll try and keep this review as spoilers free as I can.)Quick note: For the people calling this anime a lewd fest and saying it's all about big boobs and heavily sexualized you couldn't be anymore wrong. I hope if you're looking to start this anime you read this review because it might convince you to block...out the petty reviews that are so harsh on the anime for all the wrong reasons.Story: So the story for me never actually became stale nor boring. There was only two episodes for me that had irritating pacing, but thankfully they're towards the start of the series and they aren't really that drastic a.k.a it's nothing worth getting upset about in my honest opinion. Honestly the plot was consistantly on point. I'm extremely picky with the plot with an anime as I like to know if I'm just wasting my time or not, but the plot kept getting better and better. The story is very solid and introduces more and more each episode, it's never repetitive and gives you a breath of fresh air every episode you watch. I don't want to throw salt into SAO watchers, but this is honestly what SAO should of been like. This is the plot SAO should of stuck with; you die, thats it. I'm glad to see another anime carry the legacy of an 100-floor level styled anime and really make it work.Art: I'll keep this short and sweet, but I'm a HUGE sucker for this type of art-style. It's so smooth and clear I honestly throughout the entire series had no issues with the animation quality. Animation quality never decreased it stayed consistant throughout the entire seires in my personal opinion if not got better in some of the future episodes which is quite rare for anime I must admit.Sound: Oh boy the sound. The soundtrack for this anime is honestly a gem. I felt so immersed by the soundtrack and I didn't get bored of it at all. For me sound is one of the most important aspects of an anime as I want to feel the impact of certain scenes and I honeslty can't grasp any sort of emotion in specific scenes if the soundtrack isn't on point and for me personally this anime delivers.Characters: Alright so this is where it gets a bit intresting. The characters that get introduced are intresting and always have something unique about them. The main protaganist Bell Cranel is very likeable and he's honestly grown on me so much. His character development isn't over-rushed nor super-slow. I feel like they convey a lot of thought into these characters in this anime and you'll come to like them all. The reason this gets an 8 in my honest opinion is because I feel like they're taking an exteremely harem route in this anime. I don't have an issue with harem in anime; but (SPOILER ALERT: they shouldnt make the protagnist fall in love with the femlae main character and then push it aside.) I could be wrong seeing as Season Two has been anounced and it could take away the harem vibe, but we'll have to wait and see.Enjoyment: There was never a dull moment in this anime. There was no 'barable' episode, every single episode was different and stood out to me. I binge watched this within a single day thats pretty much how much I enjoyed this anime. It's not complicating and It's not too simple. If you're looking for an anime you feel like you could binge watch, this one is for you.Overall: This anime is basically a improved, more intresting version of SAO Season 1 and manages to not over-rush things like SAO did and actually gives the characters the character development they needed. It honestly has beautiful scenary and amazing character design choices and if you just honestly look past the parts with the sexual tension/teasing it's so great cause it isnt even a huge apsect within the anime and people find an excuse to dig at it. This anime and SAO have a simular plot like as in you die in the dungeon you die thats it. Also theres a tower to climb which has 100 floors in both animes. Only issue is that this anime actually paces it well and SAO goes overboard and rushes through tower levels, which to me is so messy.Overall, YES WATCH IT! I promise you, you wont regret it! out the petty reviews that are so harsh on the anime for all the wrong reasons.Story: So the story for me never actually became stale nor boring.

I promise you, you wont regret it!"", ""Is it Wrong to Try and Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, or shortened to DanMachi, which I'll be using to refer to it, is yet another entry in the long list of 'game world' shows that have popped up in the time after Sword Art Online really popularized the genre. DanMachi certainly doesn't do much to separate itself from the pack, but it does have a charm to it that makes it extremely enjoyable. Perhaps its the relief that it's not a isekai that makes it so easy to watch, or maybe it's the simple wholesomeness of Bell and his dream of chasing after...Aiz. In any case, DanMachi just seems to exude charm.God, intros are hard to write, anyway, on to the technical side of DanMachi. Nothing in DanMachi is going to blow you away visually, there are some nice effects and CGI uses, but nothing awe-inspiring. The character designs are interesting and cute, but definitely don't land in my top-tier design ranks. If DanMachi excels anywhere, its in its color palette. The bright color design really plays into the show's cute lightheartedness, which gives it a comfortable feel visually. Audially, DanMachi is really generic too. I can't name a single song or sound effect that I really loved, but I can't say that I hated it either, which kind of encapsulates my entire thoughts on DanMachi. I did get really annoyed at the Goliath's roar sound like the 20th time it played, but that's a somewhat strange complaint.Favorite Character: Aiz WallensteinIt's kind of strange, Aiz being my favorite character. Usually, I'm not the biggest fan of the kuudere trope, but for some reason, it worked for Aiz. Maybe it was more because of Bell's relationship and fascination with her than Aiz herself, but I'm thinking that's not the case. I think I just liked her growth as she interacted with Bell. You could see her emotionless front fade with every encounter she had with Bell and, to be honest, it was kind of cute. She probably also benefited from me just not liking Hestia or Lilli very much, since they were just the jealous harem tropes, honestly. Shout out to Ryu and Syr though, they were pretty great characters too.So what holds DanMachi back? Well, I think just followed the generic route way too hard. There was like three total episodes of actual dungeon crawling and RPG-like character progression total. Approximately three episodes where it actually played to its strength and followed a somewhat unique line of thought. In fact, I'm sort of waiting for an anime to follow that kind of path period. Other shows, like Sword Art Online didn't really focus on its RPG side, No Game No Life isn't really that kind of show, maybe Log Horizon is a little different, but I haven't seen that yet. Oddly enough, the one show that I can think of that focused the most on its progression in the game is Konosuba, which definitely wouldn't be the first thing that springs to mind for a lot of people.I mentioned already that I didn't really like Hestia that much and that may have been the only strong feeling that I really felt about this show. DanMachi is just so average that it didn't even elicit any real joy or disappointment. I definitely enjoyed watching it and laughed on occasion, but I can see myself forgetting that I watched it in a few months, honestly. I'll tune into season two whenever it's supposed to air, but I just can't help but feel as if DanMachi missed quite a few opportunities to really make a name for itself in the vast sea of isekai game world shows out there.

I enjoyed this series due to it\'s simplicity as well as the fact that it was pretty new to me. From then on I watched the spin-off which was airing at the time. The series held a place in my heart as an enjoyable watch. But fast forward to this year when the sequel was announced I decided to re-watch the series and critique it per the ""taste"" I\'ve developed in the mean-time, Reading many shitty isekai manga and the roller-coaster of SAO as...well as watching other popular fantasy series being my experience in series like this.THE ACTUAL REVIEW: With minor spoilersStory : 6/10. While I like the premise of this fantasy series, there is a reason why people mistake it as an isekai series. The feeling of something new is lacking in this story, yeah I know all anime are not original but good stories can be separated easily from each other despite having many shared aspects which DanMachi does not have. And lastly WTF is with the title? Bell is the wimpy-est person in this entire story and he picks up on chicks, When did/does this happen ???Art : 7/10. Nothing much, Character models like nearly all light novel adaptations of past 5 years, mediocre art but not bad enugh to be distracting.Sound : 7/10. Nothing bad but nothing great or memorable. OP is good.Characters : 7/10. Bell is copy paste Kirito but the wimpy-est version, he\'s pretty enjoyable to watch and his growth is not problematic except for final battle. Do I have to explain?? The loli supporter is annoying at her introduction arc but becomes tolerable after that. The red-hair bro is a bro character. Other characters have very less screen-time or are shown as mysterious. Ais Wallenstein was my favorite character cause she is cute and not annoying unlike everyone\'s favorite Hestia whom I\'d like to call ""THIRSTY LOLI OPPAI WITH USELESS SYNDROME"". I\'m sure that Aqua from konosuba was the parody character for character like this Boob-laced annoying loli. The best example of this is in episode 2-3 when Bell and Boob-lace were chased by monsters,while Bell was getting thrashed she does nothing( she holds the f**cking Hephastus Sword and never thinks of giving it to Bell when his dagger snaps) and when Bell sends her off to safety she realizes that, runs back like she\'s returning a dollar change to him and only gives the sword 10 minutes after that moment. Hestia SUCKS!!!!.Enjoyment : 8/10.I enjoyed this series in the first watch but the recent watch was boring and painful at sometimes due to a particular popular character.FINAL VERDICT : This series is a mediocre one but definitely enjoyable and appealing to newer anime fans. Two years ago this series would\'ve been rated 9/10 but that\'s pretty high considering my review in various aspects.So I\'ll rate it 7.1/10. well as watching other popular fantasy series being my experience in series like this.THE ACTUAL REVIEW: With minor spoilersStory : 6/10.

If someone were to criticize this show for things such as blatant fan service (like everything else from Sentai Filmworks), lacking originality/borrowing heavily from other anime in the genre or being absolutely loaded with tropes and conveniences I wouldn\'t disagree one bit. It absolutely is all of those things. And yet, despite fully agreeing with all of that, I quite liked watching this all the same.I thought the pacing of the show was really solid. I felt there was always forward momentum,...zero boring or filler or ultra slow episodes, a great mix of talking scenes/character development, action scenes and explanation and it never once felt like a chore or a slog to watch.I thought the characters, while admittedly falling into overused tropes in many cases, were all charming and likeable. The anime as a whole doesn\'t take itself too seriously and generally neither do the characters and as such I\'d think it\'s hard to be too offended by any of them. There\'s definitely some cute, not meant to be taken overly seriously interactions between them throughout the show.The weakest point of the show for me personally was probably the soundtrack, which never stood out whatsoever and was instantly forgettable upon completion. Nothing felt blatantly low quality or out of place, but the composer here did the bare minimum in that they just made background music and called it a day. I\'d also point out that on the North American blu-ray release I could frequently see lines/less than smooth blending in a number of shots, but I\'m not sure how much of this is the fault of the creators of the anime itself.So, objectively, this is just another ""it\'s an MMO"" anime, probably worse than the big boys, Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, but just as I quite liked those shows I quite liked this one too. I definitely have a bias toward this genre and I\'d think other fans of the genre would enjoy this just as much as I did.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8 zero boring or filler or ultra slow episodes, a great mix of talking scenes/character development, action scenes and explanation and it never once felt like a chore or a slog to watch.I thought the characters, while admittedly falling into overused tropes in many cases, were all charming and likeable.

As the main character Bell is this adventurer who ventures off into caves and Goes deeper and deeper into the cave whenever he becomes stronger within his stats, but The story isn\'t at all that interesting. How can I say this while also keeping it short and sweet.... This anime is literally Sword Art Online, but With Huge Tits and Goddesses! To be fair I would rather watch SAO since imo SAO is at least somewhat a good anime, but IIWTTTPUGIAD is seriously boring. Instead of wanting to find treasure and Becoming a better adventurer, Bell wants...to find and Rescue females within the cave from monsters. My assumption is that Bell wants to find a girlfriend within the caves and It has to be some kind of "" Damsel in Distress "" type of female. Which makes the plot seem generic and Just downright boring.Art: The art style is really nice, but That isn\'t going to save this anime at all. It\'s like dressing up a pig in a dress and Putting make up on it.... It may look nice, but It\'s still a pig. Basically the anime can look nice as hell, but At the end of the day it\'s still a crap anime.Sound: The sound isn\'t memorable at all, sadly The OVA had better tracks and Music within it. And That\'s me being 110% honest.Character Development: Character Development might as well as be non existent since there isn\'t much development at all.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it for a bit, but I would fall asleep from how dry the anime was. It\'s literally style over substance and Anime constructed around that notation usually ends up being whack, but Some how this anime is going to have a season two and It already has a movie and OVA, both being better than the actual anime. Which makes sense. Think about how good A Silent Voice was and Imagine it getting a series just cause the people asked for it? It would go wrong due to the fact that it only had the potential to make an amazing movie and Not a whole series.Overall: This anime is decent and Isn\'t at all for everyone.

Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon is literally that, a Dollar Value Sword Art Online. Legit just a carbon copy, but With more boobs and Less potential for a good story. If you like garbage with no potential for a good story at all and Are only watching an anime for the female figure?  Then this anime is for you!

My assumption is that Bell wants to find a girlfriend within the caves and It has to be some kind of "" Damsel in Distress "" type of female. Which makes the plot seem generic and Just downright boring.Art: The art style is really nice, but That isn\'t going to save this anime at all. It\'s like dressing up a pig in a dress and Putting make up on it.... It may look nice, but It\'s still a pig. Basically the anime can look nice as hell, but At the end of the day it\'s still a crap anime.Sound: The sound isn\'t memorable at all, sadly The OVA had better tracks and Music within it. And That\'s me being 110% honest.Character Development: Character Development might as well as be non existent since there isn\'t much development at all.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it for a bit, but I would fall asleep from how dry the anime was. It\'s literally style over substance and Anime constructed around that notation usually ends up being whack, but Some how this anime is going to have a season two and It already has a movie and OVA, both being better than the actual anime. Which makes sense. Think about how good A Silent Voice was and Imagine it getting a series just cause the people asked for it? It would go wrong due to the fact that it only had the potential to make an amazing movie and Not a whole series.Overall: This anime is decent and Isn\'t at all for everyone.

Personally, I think this anime is pretty boring. The story is plain, lack of actions and a bit too slow for me. The characters are just so-so, just like any fantasy anime where the main character is underestimated guy, but super kind, super hard-working, loyal, naive, attracts many girls and at the end he\'s the one who\'ll be the hero. And the support character (Hestia) is a very CLINGY goddess, who is actually a nice girl, but meh...she\'s too annoying. I kept watching this anime, kinda hoped that there will be an event that...would surprised me and made me think ""ahh, so this is what\'s it all about"" because it seemed there are many people who liked it. But, it disappointed me because even until the end of this season, the story was just like...well, if you\'re a gamer, this is just like the normal days that you spent in dungeons; meet another gamers, joined a party and grinding all day long. would surprised me and made me think ""ahh, so this is what\'s it all about"" because it seemed there are many people who liked it.

I like isekai as a genre, and I like its tropes, but there's just too much shit here.Ignoring fanservice, which isn't a plus or minus inherently, the core flaw of this series is pacing.  Everyone has seen the same tropes before, in series following very similar story arcs to this.  But each episode drags out these tropes to an agonizing degree.  At some point, everyone knows exactly...what's going to happen, but before they do the show should already have gotten the entire event over with.  It doesn't.  It drags and drags and drags.Inter-character interaction could have been deep, even in the limited plot.

Not a ton, but more than any other character in the series, and many other characters in many other series.

Everything about the first season is average (with the exception of the character designs). The anime fails to fully explore its intriguing premise, instead indulging in unnecessary fanservice. The characters are all over the place; some of them are genuinely interesting and likable, while others are extremely dull and annoying. The action is well animated, but the background characters and monsters appear somewhat off. In terms of pacing, the anime's consistency wavers, starting off well but gradually unraveling towards the end, feeling rushed. The redeeming factor lies in the outstanding character designs, which...are visually appealing.

In this make believe land there is a dungeon that goes down many floors (Atleast past 60) and in each level of the dungeon there are monsters that anyone can go in and fight. The only reason to fight them is to get them gems they drop and...exchange them for gold and maybe curiosity as well.

Apparently, I was wrong~Basically, this anime is like an MMO except turned into real life! It’s cool! I also really like Bell’s design~! Normally, in an anime like this, the protagonist is a dark-haired kid who’s rather boring-looking and starts out as ordinary Gary-Stue but ends up becoming the best of the best. The hairstyle is commonly the same, too! Neat and slightly messy. Bell has white hair, red eyes, and a hairstyle that’s more unique! Still...has a slight cliché touch to it, though - yk, that messy part of his hair. He also does have the same ordinary-becomes-extraordinary and Gary-Stue kind of character, but for once, it feels like that ordinary-becomes-extraordinary part actually has enough reason! Maybe it’s cause I haven’t watched enough anime like this, but it’s a nice change~! Really, for once, the reason wasn’t sheer extreme determination. Partially, yes, but it’s like this anime acknowledges that even determination has its limits! Also, Bell IS a Gary-Stue with the common traits (excessively kind, pessimistic, humble, has a harem, relatively shy, etc) but I definitely like him~! Oh! And not to mention, he seems to be deemed as an ordinary and/or cute kid! It’s a lot more understandable for the girls to like him, haha, since he’s that cool and kind and seems like the kind of character that would look cute to others.Ok, enough about Bell’s character. I also personally dislike/hate the title. It makes Bell seem like a hoe! And makes the anime sound like a bad harem anime! At least make the girls part of it singular! A much better title would be Familia Myth, sheesh.I also don’t like how off-track the anime tends to seem in terms of Bell’s determination to get to Aiz’s level. Sure, the anime’s about his adventures, but his main motive is literally to get to Aiz’s level the entire time. Yet, there are times where he doesn’t seem like he’s caring for it at the moment. How comfortable Bell seemed to get with Aiz during training, too... that was pretty uncomfortable to watch. How can someone go from “intense and uncontrollable fanboying at the mere sight of his crush” to “i have a huge crush i can easily act normal around” in just a matter of an hour or two?

Some good scenes of fights that excite and fuel the expectation of what else can happen in this world. Also, the comedy scenes are not bad, which helps to amuse.

It's too long to type out the title every single time.DanMachi is an anime that suffers mostly from its length. The anime series only covers the first three novels, which barely even mentions the beginning of its overarching story. As a result, the story more or less just ends on a cliffhanger after the first story arc's climatic battle. It is more or less just about Bell Cranel wanting to become stronger. His early desire to rescue a beautiful woman and be loved by her is sidetracked immediately at the beginning. The result is that the...overall story suffers and we do not get to see a larger picture of events.The art is one of the things I like about the series. They are fairly simplistic, but it works. There is quite a large cast of characters and best of all, they do not feel like copy paste, which tends to be a problem when there are tons and tons of characters. The backgrounds are quite beautiful at times and even though the characters spend most of the time in the Dungeon, there is enough variation to make it feel like they are not trekking through a cave all the time.The biggest problem though is the length of the series. At 13 episodes, it is incredibly short and as a result, we do not see character development nor progress in the overall story. This is unfortunately all things that happen in the novels that take place AFTER where the anime ends. In the end, this is basically an anime that had to suffer because of its length. Had it been 26 episodes when we essentially start seeing the true conflicts between the Gods and the Labyrinth grow, the series would have been a lot better. Sadly, this is only available in the Light Novels and that is where you are going to have to go to continue the story. overall story suffers and we do not get to see a larger picture of events.The art is one of the things I like about the series.

However, it manages to use those elements in a way that makes the anime feel pretty different. The core of that comes from the protagonist, Bell. Though he may have special unique skills, they don’t automatically make him overpowered, but rather the anime seems to be the journey of him putting...in effort into learning to use those skills in order to become overpowered. That combined with how his personality is very childish, the complete opposite of overtly cool or edgy as most overpowered protagonist are, while still being incredibly kind and humble make him an interesting and amusing character that’s easy to get invested in.Also, while the world is pretty standard affair, it does have some interesting elements. So far geographically it’s limited to a town surrounding a dungeon that adventurers are slowly journeying through. However it’s unique due to the presence of Gods, who came down to the mortal plane because they were bored essentially, but in the process lost their divine powers, though the specifics of this haven’t been elaborated on yet. Instead, what they do is essentially serve as the head of Familias, which are essentially guilds. Each of these Familias has an objective and culture centered around whatever their head was originally the God of, such as Hephaestus’s Familia being dedicated to smithing. These aspects too haven’t been elaborated on too much yet, but the foundational lore laid out so far does seem like it has potential, and the usage of real Gods I think also makes things a lot more fun.Lastly, the anime has a surprisingly large cast that all get a good amount of time. The focus is always on Bell, but beyond that I would consider everyone else a side character, including the heroine seemingly more well known than the anime itself, Hestia. The plot of each arc is always centered around Bell growing in various ways, but the circumstances of each arc always focus on a new set of characters. Only a couple of them get properly fleshed out, but a lot get at least some development, and the overall cast I’d say is pretty strong. Sometimes these characters are completely new, but often they’re characters that had minor roles before hand in previous arcs. That’s not to say that the focused on characters from previous arcs drop out completely, rather it just seems to be building up the cast further and further, which results in things being somewhat chaotic and messy, but also make things pretty interesting with a lot of amusing dynamics and good comedy between characters so overall the anime feels like it flows well. With all that said, it did feel like it was moving pretty slowly in the final arc in that there were a lot of hints about a lot of different things being dropped, but actual development relating to them was pretty much non-existent.The art and animation are pretty solid though overall not particularly noteworthy in a good or bad way. The character designs are pretty great overall, though the enemy and dungeon designs are pretty weak. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable. The OP is decent in terms of song and visuals. The ED has a decent enough song, but I felt the visuals were pretty weak. in effort into learning to use those skills in order to become overpowered. That combined with how his personality is very childish, the complete opposite of overtly cool or edgy as most overpowered protagonist are, while still being incredibly kind and humble make him an interesting and amusing character that’s easy to get invested in.Also, while the world is pretty standard affair, it does have some interesting elements. So far geographically it’s limited to a town surrounding a dungeon that adventurers are slowly journeying through. However it’s unique due to the presence of Gods, who came down to the mortal plane because they were bored essentially, but in the process lost their divine powers, though the specifics of this haven’t been elaborated on yet. Instead, what they do is essentially serve as the head of Familias, which are essentially guilds. Each of these Familias has an objective and culture centered around whatever their head was originally the God of, such as Hephaestus’s Familia being dedicated to smithing. These aspects too haven’t been elaborated on too much yet, but the foundational lore laid out so far does seem like it has potential, and the usage of real Gods I think also makes things a lot more fun.Lastly, the anime has a surprisingly large cast that all get a good amount of time. The focus is always on Bell, but beyond that I would consider everyone else a side character, including the heroine seemingly more well known than the anime itself, Hestia. The plot of each arc is always centered around Bell growing in various ways, but the circumstances of each arc always focus on a new set of characters. Only a couple of them get properly fleshed out, but a lot get at least some development, and the overall cast I’d say is pretty strong. Sometimes these characters are completely new, but often they’re characters that had minor roles before hand in previous arcs. That’s not to say that the focused on characters from previous arcs drop out completely, rather it just seems to be building up the cast further and further, which results in things being somewhat chaotic and messy, but also make things pretty interesting with a lot of amusing dynamics and good comedy between characters so overall the anime feels like it flows well. With all that said, it did feel like it was moving pretty slowly in the final arc in that there were a lot of hints about a lot of different things being dropped, but actual development relating to them was pretty much non-existent.The art and animation are pretty solid though overall not particularly noteworthy in a good or bad way.

The main character is a baka, like every shounen.But it's just one thing that makes me hate the whole anime: Inconsistency in the number of episodes and the content. We only watch one arc a whole season. There are always long stares in the episodes. Some scenes are just like a slide show. If you want to tell everything, increase the number of episodes to 50. If you're going to make 12 episode seasons, summarize instead of telling everything, idiots. I am really angry. It's like I'm watching One Piece, which has 12...episodes. Bruh. I enjoyed the first season, but the following seasons are a complete disappointment. If they made the last 4 seasons as a single season, I wouldn't complain. episodes. Bruh.

The main character is annoying, most of the other characters are too. He immediately get's overpowered abilities for no real reason. His whole driving force for trying harder and the catalyst for getting overpowered abilities is falling in love with a woman he met for five seconds. Yet he also has no interest in a literal goddess he's following and living with throwing herself at him. It's just the same attempt at fanservice and comedy you've seen over and over again but done worse.The world is basically an RPG,...they get stats, kill mobs in dungeons and get drops to sell. They just don't use a status window, instead your stats and abilities are listed on a tattoo on your back that magically changes. Ultimately it's the same though. In the first episode, when he just started doing dungeons two weeks ago, he gets an ability that just massively increases his growth.It goes with the work hard to improve yourself thing while contradicting that by letting him just shoot past everyone who's been working harder for years right away. He gets it, as I said, because of his feelings for a woman he met. It's incredibly rare and the goddess has never seen it before. So either no one's ever loved someone as much as he loves that woman he just met, or they're probably going to say he's special because of some lineage or something.Outside of the RPG thing, it's also a harem. I watched Tenchi Muyo when I was a kid, I don't hate harems by default, but this one doesn't really have any likeable characters or enjoyable interactions. It seems like it's just a mindless self insert fantasy for the viewer to put themselves into. Attractive women show interest right away for seemingly no reason, despite how annoying he is.He gets overpowered cheat abilities. He's the first and currently only follower of a goddess, who is also into him, and another goddess becomes fuck crazy for him when she sees him run by her once. If he ever adds more member's to his group, it'll probably be mostly or entirely women with little to no personality. Not that he really needs other members with how overpowered he is.This dude can't even use his overpowered shit to at least make some good money and buy his own shit, they just immediately have his goddess ask another goddess to make him a special weapon. The weapon is alive and will grow along with him, wouldn't want to ever need new gear right? He just has to have everything dumped on his lap immediately, what's the point of having an RPG setting if everything just gets given to you right away.Everything gets dragged out too long in an attempt to create tension. His goddess had the sword, she was with him, they get attacked by a big monkey, his normal weapons break when he hits the monkey, yet his goddess doesn't just give him the magic weapon. We know she's going to, but the show drags on for a while before deciding the character can have a brain. This really goes on until halfway through the next episode. It's painfully idiotic. On top of that nothing matters, so it's all just boring.If this doesn't sound like enough, don't worry, he also gets special magic after reading a special one time use book that was given to him by the lady at the tavern. Yet more power dropped onto his lap, exactly what he wanted, no effort, nothing to work toward, he just gets it handed to him, while the show keeps going on about working hard and getting stronger.They'll even have one of the side characters investigate someone and then just have a group walk by at a convenient time and explicitly state what's going to happen within earshot. Everything is pointless. Special powers, weapons, even information, will just be given to him or his group.The main character also has no real personality, other than being shy and nice. He mostly just says he can't accept things and thanks because he's constantly having shit given to him. Other than that he mostly just makes noises.

It has some aspects that are surpisingly done well and others that are frustratingly poor.It was an anime that got better the further into the season that it went, with the first 6 episodes being so bad that I dropped it for a while. However, once I started watching it again, by the time I got towards the end I actually found myself somewhat enjoying the anime (keyword being “somewhat”).This increased enjoyment is due to the focus of the show shifting away from the characters and more toward the action, which is undoubtedly the best aspect of the show. The...movement looks pretty clean and it’s clear that a good amount of effort was put into making it stand out among its power fantasy contemporaries.Speaking of the characters, they are also undoubtedly the worst aspect of the show. All of the main characters recieve very basic depth and development so the anime can trick you into thinking that the characters are well-written and not just conventional power fantasy characters.The MC wants to get stronger to catch up to a girl he likes. Ok, different from the usual MC, what else makes him stand out? Absolutley nothing. Aside from that one gimmick, he is the standard: respect women, overpowered, heart of gold MC that you have seen a million times before.And given that you’ve seen MCs with these traits a million times before, you best believe that he also gets a harem the size of a small village to boot. It seems like almost every women he gets into contact with throws themself at him. And because he’s such a “unique” MC, he is completely oblivious to their intentions.That’s all I can say about the characters before I go on a 5 page rant about how poorly written they all are. So let’s talk about the world, another initially unique aspect of anime. The Greek gods give up their powers and come to live with the humans and form guilds in a fantasy world.Alright that sounds like it could be interesting. What else can you offer that is unique? Nothing. That’s it. Beside that one gimmick, it’s the same as every other power fantasy anime (noticing a trend?). It has the same architecture, the same monsters, the same leveling system as all the other Isekai trash out there.Oh, you didn’t misread that last part by the way. In a fantasy world that is completely separate from modern technology like video games, the power system is still based off something you’d see in an RPG. Why is this necessary?It’s necessary in games because you aren’t actually in them, so the game needs to simulate how much stronger you would be getting if you were actually fighting and gaining that experience. This is a redundant system to write into a non-isekai fantasy world were the characters would be improving through the actual experience.What this tells me is that the creator wanted to use the character and world gimmicks as a way to mask the fact that they are feeding their audience the same creatively bankrupt content that has made money in the past.If not for the action and voice acting (the MC’s voice actor gave a pretty good performance), a 4 would be a farcry from what it would have deserved.It’s a solid 4 movement looks pretty clean and it’s clear that a good amount of effort was put into making it stand out among its power fantasy contemporaries.Speaking of the characters, they are also undoubtedly the worst aspect of the show.

Not only is there monsters, goblins ogres but there are gods in the mix. Did I mention there are elves as well? Yup, it is a complete ingredient classic fantasy and as a fan of that, there is no way I'm going to let that series by, though I'm kind of late to start.But above all else, I like the tournament like challenges that every adventurer has to take, by level, as...they go up, monster's ferociousness goes with it. It becomes super duper difficult, and only the strong and tested go there, and it's shown that many die as they try this.I also liked the music, open theme and close theme, and sound effects, and the animation is clearly better than average. I'm not that a professor in sounds and animation but there is that much difference in which the ordinary could tell.As for the characters, well.... What could I say, the hero's character lack imagination. It is similar to the many characters that's been done over and over. And it is one of those annoying type. The one that stammers when explaining, allllll the time. I get that you have to show and it's one of his character, but it doesn't need to span minutes, I should guess he'd calm down from that point when he stammered. He is a coward. He knows this and the girl he likes knows this. But he faces them when friends and himself are endanger or are in the corner, or when he wants to prove himself. Though I kind of debate the reason for him wanting to be strong landing in the romance's field, I think that could happen. He is a kid, young and immature, so it may be normal.since as per plot, adventurers must be under a god/goddess to gain power.

Why would she not give this to fight that? And after a realization/decision/outcome that we so obviously know would happen, there is a high tendency that some would be bored. I did so I just fast forward at some part, and that is the fail of the series. At the later part, last quarter of the series, there was no movement, it was all the same, fighting, fighting, witnesses, narrator. Perhaps that's just normal since it's a part of the adaptation, not the whole story, and so they stick at the climax part that would fit on a 13 episode series.But all that is not the worst, it's those part where characters just so happens to be there, that part where it's just an accident that he/she 's there. And every time that happens, automatically, I'd think what are the odds?? huh...Still, I'm a fan for worlds that revolve around the classic fantasy, with elves and magic, and that kind of tipped the scale for me in finishing the series.

Overall if you're looking for something simple to watch with a good bit of light fan service this is fine.The story is fairly confusing in a meta way because it blends elements of a more traditional fantasy (gods, heros) with the RPG style story (hunting monsters for crystals which are valuable).  From the actual story itself this is quite simple and seems to be mainly a way to provide the bland characters something to do.It's a typical story of some newbie who is destined to be the best of the best, and the girls who worship him.  The...harem aspect is middling strong, and our MC is the typical bonehead who can't seem to tell that he has a dozen or so women panting after him, although at least we don't get entire episodes devoted to just the harem fighting each other. harem aspect is middling strong, and our MC is the typical bonehead who can't seem to tell that he has a dozen or so women panting after him, although at least we don't get entire episodes devoted to just the harem fighting each other."", 'Slade’s Quick ReviewIt’s the classic love story of boy meets girl, boy nearly dies all the time and girl saves him.

Its all about the main character fighting for his life to be not garbage and having to fight for his life.

People expecting a well written review, please go on.There are many animes where you could say you\'re not really sure how to rate the show, in a good or in a bad way, but I think DanMachi is special at this.To start with the basics:On the one hand we have too much ecchi in this show, in terms of boobs and some fan service scenes like the typical bath thing, or struggling who\'s getting the main char and ""pressing"" his arms over this (they should\'ve added harem as tag). The...background story of many side characters is left aside even though it would\'ve made sense to show why they\'re acting the way they\'re doing and not only showing a short retrospect at best, leaving some very potential characters who could\'ve told a nice story in the dark.We also, beside this described fanservice have ""goddes"" Hestia, which will, I guarantee it, get on your nerves as soon as you\'ve passed half of the story.On the other side we have very nice couple, consisting of Aiz and Bell. Bell, the main protagonist is drawn out okay, and believable as the person he\'s shown to be. Aiz\'s background is never shown during the whole 13 EPs, but I really started to love her as a person, though you never get to know what\'s really going on in her mind. Aiz seems to be an airhead at least for romances, because every time things like dates are mentioned she\'s asking what\'s meant. I think she would\'ve been a good main char.. (you see the problem ?)The problem with the love story here is that this annoying little brat Hestia, always interferes, when there would be a chance to progress like visiting a god damn town together. Though Hestia itself is presented as a 14 year old brat which is supposed to be a god, with cup size D. So besides them congratulating each other about their progress, there\'s no real thing that, thanks to Hestia, could happen or really develop.So the love story never really settles down, what\'s left then ?Only the progress in getting better in skills and strength, and a never really explained god, level and dungeon system.Even those gods, sticking to the facts, *shouldn\'t* use their powers on earth, and you\'re never getting to know why their even existing or for what they or their powers are good.In the end I\'ve to ask JC Staff what they wanted to present here.A love story ? Well it never really develops any further. A story of progress ? Or the kind of plot that pops up during the last 2-3 EPs and some new characters, besides a grand ""villain"" who\'s never explained or shown doing more then laughing.At this point I\'ve to compare DanMachi with SAO, I\'m sorry for people of both sides, but this has to be done.SAO and this show are delivering a rank up and skill system in a fictional world, though DanMachi\'s world is real for the chars. Both are having a fighting couple and both are rushing in terms of their story.DanMachi also shows very good fight scenes and does it even better then SAO, because pain is existing in this world and shown as such, making it easier to feel for the characters. The main couple in DanMachi is also older then in SAO, at least I would guess so according to their way of acting and things said in the show, while SAO shows 16 and 17 years old teenagers, I can\'t really feel with that good.So there are some things DanMachi really does better then SAO. Even more the fact that the main hero isn\'t better or getting better by interfering with the fights of the heroine, leaving her in the dust, but by letting him trying to catch up.BUT SAO has A: a finishing love story, B: a finishing storyline besides and C: throws more light on the side characters (I\'m judging based on SAO I, I\'ve dropped II halfway.)(24 EPs SAO vs 13 EPs DanMachi, I\'m sorry JC Staff that you got only granted that much for the show!)Conclusion:Some very well drawn fights, a growing up story, too much ecchi and some annoying characters. Mixed with some poorly drawn out side chars and an unknown point of what the show really wanted to deliver.For one part I would watch a second season, hoping for more Aiz and Bell, but being honest and honest to myself this show kinda f*cked up midway. I would still recommend it, but don\'t expect too much.Probably, if you\'re reading up the information on MAL (there seems to be more information about the world, origins etc), the show simply would\'ve been better with more EPs, not trying to stuff all of this into 13 episodes.I really would\'ve wished for that, the idea, setting and especially the couple has some potential, which *could* be kinda fixed with a second season. background story of many side characters is left aside even though it would\'ve made sense to show why they\'re acting the way they\'re doing and not only showing a short retrospect at best, leaving some very potential characters who could\'ve told a nice story in the dark.We also, beside this described fanservice have ""goddes"" Hestia, which will, I guarantee it, get on your nerves as soon as you\'ve passed half of the story.On the other side we have very nice couple, consisting of Aiz and Bell. Bell, the main protagonist is drawn out okay, and believable as the person he\'s shown to be. Aiz\'s background is never shown during the whole 13 EPs, but I really started to love her as a person, though you never get to know what\'s really going on in her mind.

It was as if it was it was created via machine learning. All the tropes of shounen and harem anime are there, but none of them are a novel or interesting rendition of these tropes. They're properly executed, but that's about it. The art is good, but nothing is particularly breathtaking. The characters are one-dimensional and have little to no motivation for the most part. The anime's weakest point, though, is the story. There is absolutely no reason for dungeon delving, the very crux of the anime, to exist. The people do it... just...because. So, if you've ever seen a shounen or harem anime, you've already seen this one and you can move along. because.

All i can say without spoiling anything is this was pretty fun for me to watch. Its not going to amazing you with its story or anything but if you want to relax and not have to think, this would be a good anime for that. It feels like SAO mixed in with some Highschool DxD with alittle sprinkle of the old greek gods mixed in. While there are valid reasons people wont rate this high, i feel like it gets a lot more hate than it should...since it came out after SAO. since it came out after SAO.', 'DanMachi is an adventurous type of anime,.

As he embarks on his journey, he encounters various challenges, monsters, and fellow adventurers, all while uncovering the secrets of the Dungeon and his own latent abilities. The series blends elements of fantasy, adventure, and romance, offering a captivating tale of growth, friendship, and the pursuit of dreams in a fantastical world filled with danger and wonder./Review is based only on the anime and not the manga/novels!/Danmachi is one of those animes that either...you want and don’t want you should watch.

The pace is stable and will not bore you with 24 episodes surrounding one and the same thing and there is quite a lot of the dungeon involved in this part. The anime has quite good ideas, especially of Bell’s past and upbringing, which regrettably aren’t that touched through the anime and the events are pretty much controlled by Freya.Characters 5/10The characters themselves however aren’t something much, all representing pretty basic characteristics. From the typical white-haired boy with OP powers, through the silly and kind goddess, the manipulative non-villain villain, the older guys with big sword acting as a big brother and the loud chibi. All in all the characters aren’t that impressive and don’t go through massive character development except Lilli.Bell as main seems to grow however the overall feeling he gives is just being stuck and one point in time and place and while his powers grow, his character isn’t much of something.Hestia remains Hestia all the way. Given she is based on the Greek goddess of home, part of the Twelve Olympians (Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, Aphrodite, Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes, and either Hestia or Dionysus) her character is a bit disappointing. Animes like to adopt other cultures and use already existing names and concepts however most times they adapt only the shallowest emotions and chrematistics.As Hestia the other Gods also are a bit confusing as far as their reference goes.Sound 6/10The music in this anime is pretty on the standard level, nothing worth mentioning and the opening/ending songs are memorable however they are stable and just in unison with the whole anime vibe which is good.Art and Character Design 8/10The art is solid for the 2015 and is not in no way an eyesore, most characters are truly beautifully drawn, my greatest disappointment is again the MC – way too plain, if it wasn’t the good contrast between his hair and eyes (making him look like an albino rabbit) he would be the most unmemorable character ever.Enjoyment 7/10Personally, I was neither bored nor extremely impressed, fan service scenes were off putting as they are too much in your face and were trying to be funny which just – meh.

The development of Bell Cranell is done very well, and...the supporting characters are developed sufficiently to aid his growth. The first season is a good 7/10.Season 2: Season 2 was similar to season 1, but it got weaker. I didn’t really notice it until I watched the next season, but this season kinda just adds to the overload of characters that Bell Cranel deals with and has some fun parts and some parts that drag. It's important for the story but feels kinda flat.Season 3: This season was by far the best season in Danmachi. The show went from a more light-hearted “oh haha pick up girls in the dungeon” to “is it really wrong to pick up girls in the dungeon?” It does a very good job of questioning morals while having good fight scenes and good character development. The divisions between the sides and the character relationships are super complex and well done, making for an entertaining and genuinely good season of anime.Season 4 pt 1: This season has two arcs. Both are in a similar vein to the first season but gradually have more stakes. The tension makes it more entertaining than the first season, but after the third season, it feels a bit weakOverall, I think this anime is pretty good. It's constantly entertaining, and despite being over-bloated with character, quite a few of them are likable (and a few are not and a few are just there). The journey of  Bell Cranel is still entertaining and fun to watch, even if its quality changes in quality a lot over time.Score: 7.4/10 the supporting characters are developed sufficiently to aid his growth.

I try to write this without spoilers, or at least minimal ones.Story and world: Gods living with mortals, where they cant use their godly powers, but they still have powers that could seriously destroy the world by some means (how? I dont know either). We have no clue as to what and how happened, other than the town the anime takes place in there is zero worldbuilding or anything resembling it, so dont expect something like that.As another review said it, an 8 year old could write...a story like this, I would like to add to that, with that an 8 year old probably wrote this story, because other than that explanation, I have no clue why would someone write this garbage.Characters: Shitty stories and settings like this usually are saved by the characters, but not here.All characters are painfully 1 dimensional, they have one personality trait and thats it, including our mc, he is just there, to be there. He is the generic good guy mc, whoch wouldnt be bad, if he had an at least okay motivation, but his only motivation is that he fell in love with a strong women, someone said to him that women like strong men who protect them, and now he wants to be strong to confess to his crush so he can protect her. Noice.The side characters are just as bleak, they either rely on the story to have some personality (like most of the gods in this god forsaken world they wrote) or they have one trait (which is usually liking the mc) and they operate with that. Noice again. Zero character progressiom, minimal and stupidly or at least lazily written backstories with no explanation and usually no ties to the actual story (to be fair there is no story to begin with, so you cant tie nothing to nothing).Animation/art: I enjoyed the art, even tough it was nothing spectacular (it was average), at the beginning it fit the show well, but somewhere trough they started using cheap cgi for the monsters and it really took away anything they had going on in this field.Music: Painfully average, nothing bad, but nothing good or unique eitherAll in all this anime is just flat out average in every department, or even just bad, it still had some moments, and the very few moments of chemistry between the fmc and mc were at least cute and had a semblance of good romance, but nothing extraordinary.Someone said this anime is a hidden gem (thats why I started watching it) and I have to say, they were 50% right.This anime is hidden, but nowhere near a gem. Luckily it was hidden.Also, while there are other seasons and side stories out there (because why not make an 8 year old's literary homework as complicated of a cash grab as you can) the first season's ending is a harder cliffhanger than the Stallone movie from the 90's. This is blatant cash grab and advertisement for the source material (with a story, setting and characters this bad I could not imagine the source material being better, but this is just my opinion, I never read it, so dont take me up on that and see for yourself).So in my opiniom, if you like BDSM, you are a diagnosed psychopatch, you have some mental illnesses on the more serious side or you just have the ability to not think (like literally not think) then you will probably enjoy this anime. If you dont have at least 2 of the above requirements then you will just waste your time on this pile of nothing. a story like this, I would like to add to that, with that an 8 year old probably wrote this story, because other than that explanation, I have no clue why would someone write this garbage.Characters: Shitty stories and settings like this usually are saved by the characters, but not here.All characters are painfully 1 dimensional, they have one personality trait and thats it, including our mc, he is just there, to be there.

There are also romance and comedy genres, but they are very, very rare.The main character doesn't have any other kind of main weapon other than a knife.

Most of the characters have no growth to them, especially Bell. Bell is such a shallow character in terms of his characteristics. He's infuriatingly nice to the point it's a huge fault. He's just a nice guy who gets strong. That's it. The backstory he has is also nonexistent.Getting through the last episode was such a struggle, it fell flat due to a very predictable ending. There are also plot holes that had me scratching my head at the end and a lot of unanswered questions that could have been answered by the end of the season. Also,...all the boob bits were just so unnecessary and a waste of screen time.I'm giving this show a 4/10 overall, it wasn't that great, to be honest.

Spolier free review.Danmachi isn\'t for me. The promising setting of the story amazed me but it ended when they introduced our MC, Bell Cranel-san. His personality just doesn\'t seem right for the story. Anyways, season 1 is a kick-off to a long series. So you\'ll get what you expect, introduction to the world and some advertising for you to get hooked on the series. It\'s good enough for pass-time but not enough to satisfy your hunger for a moving, awesome, reasonably timed(doesn\'t waste your time)  story. Oh and the fight scenes are noice.Here...is a somewhat detailed overview---Story - 6Minor arcs, reasonably paced, kinda boring if your not new to fantasy since they use the same tropes and cliché logic. Makes use of the world\'s quirks. Again, don\'t expect an ending in season 2, this is like the starting of Fairy Tail or Sword Art Online.Art - 8Oh yeah man, if you\'re not the type who appreciates big oppai for fanservice then you gon\' have a bad time. Though they don\'t push it excessively (maybe I\'m just used to it), it\'s still appealing and not unreasonably big. The character designs are good, has variety, and it\'s pretty neat. Use of CGI is okay, not that noticeable.Sound - 7Good, able to effectively use in certain situations to trigger appropriate emotions from the audience. You won\'t notice the same sound if you don\'t consciously notice it yourself and just feel it in the scenes. What I don\'t like is the drama, the voices that scratch my ear, particularly our MC. Ruins the mood, kills the interest of an already epic scene.Character - 5Ehhhh, well it really is mediocre. Backstories are understandable, somewhat heart-wrenching too but it all depends on you. Harem existence confirmed, typical type. Sadly the characters aren\'t that interesting. You\'re like, ""Oh wow really he\'s been through that? What\'s his goal then? What is he planning? Nothing? Oh"".  Antagonists, not much to know YET bout the big ones but they\'re seemingly motivated by childish reasons. The numerous characters that pop up out of nowhere are like pokémon, you gotta pick one to like. So don\'t expect too much depth and complexity.I would\'ve made a pass on this issue if it weren\'t for our MC. A child-like personality that is debatable to have, but I would totally be against it. He underwent hardship, loss, and from this a desire to become strong. But he still makes immature decisions with no justifications, give me some logic and not ""because he\'s nice"" bullshit. If you\'re gonna make a perfect character. then make him cool and not annoying like Meliodas. Oh and his goal is VAGUE, at least Naruto concretely wanted to become Hokage, but Bell-san? You could tell me his goal is concrete but I would tell you that\'s boring as fuck(his goal). Though I appreciate his character development, his personality and goal still needs some fixer-upper to make him acceptable.Enjoyment - 7Got this from the art, and background music, the fight scenes are cool, bet you\'ll appreciate them. Comedy? meh, barely \'hahaha\' and more like \'ha\', the episode I genuinely smiled and was the funniest was the last episode.Overall - 7Feast your eyes on the visuals and stunning fight scenes of Danmachi, venture through it\'s simple yet amazing world. Together with your not-so-likeable MC, his party with somewhat depth, and his army of fans. Fighting through monsters outside and inside the dungeon, growing and becoming stronger with every minor arc because AGAIN, this anime is made with an intent of creating a long series. And this is just the start.My final words/ Short Summary:Danmachi could\'ve been great with a better MC. is a somewhat detailed overview---Story - 6Minor arcs, reasonably paced, kinda boring if your not new to fantasy since they use the same tropes and cliché logic.

If you\'re gonna make a perfect character. then make him cool and not annoying like Meliodas. Oh and his goal is VAGUE, at least Naruto concretely wanted to become Hokage, but Bell-san? You could tell me his goal is concrete but I would tell you that\'s boring as fuck(his goal). Though I appreciate his character development, his personality and goal still needs some fixer-upper to make him acceptable.Enjoyment - 7Got this from the art, and background music, the fight scenes are cool, bet you\'ll appreciate them. Comedy? meh, barely \'hahaha\' and more like \'ha\', the episode I genuinely smiled and was the funniest was the last episode.Overall - 7Feast your eyes on the visuals and stunning fight scenes of Danmachi, venture through it\'s simple yet amazing world. Together with your not-so-likeable MC, his party with somewhat depth, and his army of fans. Fighting through monsters outside and inside the dungeon, growing and becoming stronger with every minor arc because AGAIN, this anime is made with an intent of creating a long series. And this is just the start.My final words/ Short Summary:Danmachi could\'ve been great with a better MC.', 'This show starts off really strong and it continues on with a few calculated ""ass-pulls"". It has many good moments, but it is far from perfect.Plot: The plot starts off with an interesting premise and a pretty well thought out world. The main character kicks off very weak but with a supremely strong ability, and from there you know the drill. Its nothing outstanding but the general flesh out of the world makes it above average experience. The world starts to fumble a bit when the writer obviously put the character in an impossible situation and then had to create a new way for...him to get out. So I would say the show with its worldbuilding and its interesting premises starts off with a 7/10, it then drops dramatically to a 5/10. And thus the score.Score: 6Soundtrack: The soundtrack is amazing. Not every single one of them. But when battle kicks off, you are sure in for a treat. When you are in a bar? you wont be disappointed. Opening theme is mid. Nothing spectacular but it gets the job done.Score: 8Art: The art sometimes is eye candy with great choreography and battle movement and other times its more of a miss and less of a hit. It really looks like some episodes were either rushed, or they only wanted to give emphasis on the two Bs, battles and b**bs. Lots of the second, most of them unnecessary.Score: 6Characters: The beginning of the show shows great character development and good character backstory. After this is all set and done, every character becomes a tool for the main character to jump on in case of trouble. Of course when you have 12 episodes and 30+ different characters, some of them will get minimal time, and this looks really bad in the long run. The worst offender of all was the last battle where it looked more like a power rangers unite moment rather than a hardship episode. Again starts off with a 7 and then drops to 5 or 4.Score: 6Personal Enjoyment: I liked the beginning but not so much the continuation of it. I am a sucker for robust plots and beautiful visual don\'t do it for anymore. I need the plot to make sense and be well thought out. So the show lost me after some time.Score:6Overall Score: 6.4 him to get out.

Most of it can be an eyesore at times although can be funny. If anything the main character is your typical dou*** who can't do much of anything right. The characters in this story are not developed well enough and the enjoyment only comes from laughter. The repetitive themes you hear will leave you either annoyed or excited that something might actually happen. The way this story is, you really don't go anywhere other than see corruption and complaining.Watch this if you want a few...laughs, otherwise be ready for the repetitive (spoiler)Explosion theme of nuisance played more than 50 times an episode.... laughs, otherwise be ready for the repetitive (spoiler)Explosion theme of nuisance played more than 50 times an episode...."", ""Dear Fellow Otaku and Anime lovers,I have seen a lot of harem animes but this one was just a little plain, the last episode was so boring I basically skipped through the whole episode. For me, it usually doesn't take me long to fall in love with an anime but this anime was just not exciting, it would good for anyone who likes fantasy video games, like sword art online, (I'm not talking shit about that anime) but it had the same theme, I felt like I never really got to know the characters. I'm not saying it was bad, I just prefer a...grow character development. With this anime, I don't feel that. Would I watch this if I just wanted a good action anime sure but, nothing more. grow character development. With this anime, I don't feel that. Would I watch this if I just wanted a good action anime sure but, nothing more."", 'This happened to be the show I have my thoughts decently collected on, so I decided to write a review. Why did I decide to watch Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?? Well, the title was interesting. (Question titles are so alluring) . Secondly, I am fairly obsessed with this kind of fantasy genre(Not enough to watch SAO all the way through, but that is a different story.)  Danmachi has a voice actress I have come to like recently Inori Minase(for Rem of course) who voices Hestia in the show. Oddly enough she has a romance with...""Bell Kun"" Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who voices Betelgeuse in Re:Zero(let that sink in). Now, on to the review of DanMachi . (I decided to start with the good parts this time)Art(7/10)DanMachi has varying degrees of art quality. CGI is a pet peeve of mine because often it makes anime painful to look at. Danmachi has CGI good and CGI bad moments due to somewhat rushed work. Aside from CGI, DanMachi boasts some great fight scenes backgrounds and character design. Hestia even has her own Wikipedia page for her iconic ribbon.Sound(8/10)I can\'t really complain here. The soundtrack is pretty good during key moments, but the OP and ED are pretty forgettable. Danmachi stars the protagonist man himself, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who doesn\'t do a bad job voicing Bell Kranel. Inori Minase voices goddess Hestia and is pretty good for the role.Story(3/10)Why does Danmachi insist on making itself a harem? At first, Bell was only interested in Aiz Wallenstein with Hestia occasionally dropping hints of her attraction. Later in Danmachi, Hestia is full on obsessed with ""Bell kun"" and every girl(except Aiz) with more than 5 mins of screentime develops some kind of crush on him. I guess it\'s all in the name of the show though .Besides amassing a harem army, Danmachi has no other direction. When given characters like Lilliluka Erde and Welf Crozzo with interesting backstories, Danmachi kind of tosses their screentime to the side. As a result, arcs seem underdeveloped and unfocused.Character(3/10)The main character Bell Cranel is bland, overpowered, and underdeveloped. His lines are the sound equivalent of sawdust. As for the overpowered part, I will try to keep as few spoilers as possible but most of his powers are handed to him on a golden platter. Bell is motivated by wanting to become a hero, but I just can\'t see any motivation for it. As for Hestia, she was pretty well developed but the writers decided to screw her up. She was a caring guardian figure at the beginning, but eventually became the obsessive girlfriend type who couldn\'t stand when any girl even breathed on her Bell Kun. Aiz Wallenstein was Bell\'s main focus and kind of mysterious. The fact that most things about her were a mystery seemed like a feature until it became an obvious crutch for the fact that the writers hadn\'t come up with anything for her character. She is a very powerful heroine, that is all. There was a lot of characters with good potential for writing stories with i.e Lilliluka Erde,Welf Crozzo,Ryū Lion etc... all potentially great characters forgotten, marginalized, turned into harem food, or some irritating combination of the three. When a show insists on focussing on its weak link (in this case ""Bell Kun""), it breeds malice within me.Enjoyment(6/10)In the end, I would have given Danmachi a much worse rating if  there were not some parts I enjoyed about it. Danmachi had some great potential. Potential wasted. I enjoy the music, scenes, and some parts about the characters but I don\'t have high hopes for the second season if a second season is released.

Yes, we\'ve seen hundreds of anime like this, so what makes this one different? Well, I don\'t know, as I haven\'t seen much of this genre yet, but in DanMachi the world already is in existance, nobody is thrown into it from the ""real"" world. I think this works better for anime like these, but that may just be me. Otherwise we have our standard shonen harem setting: A boy who wants to be a hero surrounded by hot girls who want to mate with him. Okay,...that desciption is a little unfair, as the world is built well in my eyes, but that\'s basically the premse of this show.6/10Art:I admit, the character design isn\'t the best around. It\'s not like they look boring or anything, but the faces aren\'t very imaginative. The good guys have the smooth faces, the bad guys are more angular. The fight scenes on the other hand look really amazing. This is one of the cases where I do not mind the use of CGI (which I am not a fan of). The battles are flashy and the movements are smooth. I think that outweighs the more mediocre parts.8/10Sound:The opening song has to be one of the dullest J-Pop songs I\'ve ever heard used in an anime. Sorry, but that didn\'t get me in the mood to watch this show at all. The ending was a lot better, maybe that\'s because I\'m a sucker for well placed wind instruments. The background music was fine. The voice acting could have been better in my eyes. There wasn\'t a voice that made me think ""I wanna strangle you until you stop talking"" but nothing memorable came out of it either.5/10Characters:After decades of harem anime, we should all be used to bland, ignorant male leads at this point. Bell is no exception (but at least he\'s a pretty boy so it\'s somewhat understandable the girls like him). Hestia apparently is a love or hate character, depending on wether you support her ship or not. I actually saw her more of a mother figure for Bell (or is that just a surpressed fetish?). The rest of the cast was hit or miss. I liked Loki, Hephaestus and Welf for example, but Lili, Freiya or Aiz never really connected with me. The bad guys were incredibly bland, basically being assholes because they are...assholes.5/10Enjoyment:Despite all the criticism I expressed up to now, I felt well entertained by DanMachi. Maybe it really was the influence of KonoSuba and the comedic aspects of this anime that helped me not to take this anime too seriously. If you\'re looking for a dramatic take on this genre, you are looking at the wrong series. DanMachi is enjoyable on a popcorn cinema level. You are not supposed to think too deep into it, you just have to sit back and watch and hopefully enjoy.8/10Overall:6.4/10 that desciption is a little unfair, as the world is built well in my eyes, but that\'s basically the premse of this show.6/10Art:I admit, the character design isn\'t the best around.

Genuinely, it makes me realize how we select tits over substance because that's the only thing this show had going for it. Almost every character in this show is either forgettable or so frustratingly blindly stupid that it's just pitiful to watch. Like it feels like this had the makings for possibly a good show, but for some reason, they needed to fill a few extra scenes so they just dragged on things that should've taken a second. Case in point (SPOILER ALERT): the main character's weapon broke....The girl he was with had a specialized weapon she had gotten for him that would've raised his stats by a LOT. They were being chased by a monster. It takes her half an episode to JUST GIVE the weapon to him, and they just get chased by this monster together, and he gets beat up senselessly. Like, I understand extending the time to make the manga / show seem longer, but you can't just have these characters mindlessly running around while one of them is hugging a situation-changing weapon, and all she does is keep screaming his name. And every other female character in the show is shamelessly dumb to the point where it's exasperating to watch, but luckily they're cute! So no wonder this POS anime is ranked so f*cking high! The one redeeming quality is the one female character Ryuu who seems to actually realize that they are in a life threatening situation and keeps a head on her shoulders. Every other female can piss off. The girl he was with had a specialized weapon she had gotten for him that would've raised his stats by a LOT. They were being chased by a monster.

want to give it a high rating, I just can’t.Much things, are good but a lot bad. Bell is super generic, in short he’s just like your average isekai mc, I don’t think I see anything special about him. Compared to kirito, they are both completely same. They get all the girls, they are batsh1t overpowered and they have no flaws... I mean it’s crazy he gets to level 2 in a month. Where it took Ainz like a year. Don’t get me wrong she’s OP.The plot is basic, I don’t think i can say much...about it. It’s plainly “generic”.In conclusion the anime is basic and generic. don’t get me wrong, in a way I enjoyed it but from a critics standpoint. I’m afraid 6 is the highest score I can giveTwo things worth praising1.) I think the art is pretty good2.) I really like the sound effects. about it.

Until the third season came out and people started talking about it again. I thought, well, the genres are not mine, but I\'ll give it a chance.Did i regret it? Basically not.Dnamachi\'s storyline is simple and doesn\'t evolve over the course of the seasons. It\'s mostly just about smaller events and rescue operations. The real events are only minimally in the background. In other words,...thanks to the 100 different story blockers, nothing progresses.Strangely, the fan service has been reduced by half from season to season, until the latest season it has almost died out. I prefer it that way anyway.-What bothered me less about the work are actually the characters. Most of them are personable and not annoying, even the stupid personalities.The main family and its members struck me as particularly positive. They have a pleasant attitude and have quite a bit of personality, self-conflict, and depth of character. This is particularly evident with some of the supporting characters here and with the protagonist in the course of the next few seasons.StoryThe plot offers a concept that has been pretty worn out so far, only for once it is not an Isekai. The concept of the Lvl-SKill system is nothing new either. But there is at least a new approach here, because there are no questionable things like ""EXP"" in the world, but the status values \u200b\u200band Lvl show the actual values \u200b\u200bof humans and the Lvl Up gives a divine boost.This makes until now still not much sense, since we get no real explanation why this system was needed in this world.Apart from that, the plot has no direction so far and goes in circles.Animation / picturesMostly above average, except for the Minotaur, which offered a very dynamic and well-animated fight that will certainly be remembered.CharactersAs mentioned above, the characters are quite personable and, to my surprise, have a lot more personality and character depth than I would have expected in such an anime. It\'s always interesting to see some characters confront their self-conflicts.MusicMostly average. The outro and intro are very monotonous and weak. Only the Osts can keep the atmosphere right.ConclusionThe anime is not what I imagined it to be and is getting better from season to season. For a prologue this was pretty average in entertainment. Its not bad but not enough to be considered average. Still, it is worth to watch this show. thanks to the 100 different story blockers, nothing progresses.Strangely, the fan service has been reduced by half from season to season, until the latest season it has almost died out. I prefer it that way anyway.-What bothered me less about the work are actually the characters. Most of them are personable and not annoying, even the stupid personalities.The main family and its members struck me as particularly positive. They have a pleasant attitude and have quite a bit of personality, self-conflict, and depth of character. This is particularly evident with some of the supporting characters here and with the protagonist in the course of the next few seasons.StoryThe plot offers a concept that has been pretty worn out so far, only for once it is not an Isekai. The concept of the Lvl-SKill system is nothing new either. But there is at least a new approach here, because there are no questionable things like ""EXP"" in the world, but the status values \u200b\u200band Lvl show the actual values \u200b\u200bof humans and the Lvl Up gives a divine boost.This makes until now still not much sense, since we get no real explanation why this system was needed in this world.Apart from that, the plot has no direction so far and goes in circles.Animation / picturesMostly above average, except for the Minotaur, which offered a very dynamic and well-animated fight that will certainly be remembered.CharactersAs mentioned above, the characters are quite personable and, to my surprise, have a lot more personality and character depth than I would have expected in such an anime. It\'s always interesting to see some characters confront their self-conflicts.MusicMostly average. The outro and intro are very monotonous and weak. Only the Osts can keep the atmosphere right.ConclusionThe anime is not what I imagined it to be and is getting better from season to season. For a prologue this was pretty average in entertainment. Its not bad but not enough to be considered average. Still, it is worth to watch this show.', ""Sorry, this is one of those animes that's mostly popular not because of the storyline.If you're looking for fanservice well, you get your typical noticeable oppai, scantily dressed sidekick here.I watched this thinking it's gotta be gamer-related &  there's gotta be more to this story than boobs being pushed up by a blue ribbon.Sadly, that's mostly all that's going on here.Basically, a nobody forms a bond with a nobody goddess & together they become powerful eccentric nobodies.Witness the shrieks from the oppai, loli goddess as she chastises & praises the main protagonist. If you're not into that (which I'm not) it's mildly amusing...& gets boring quickly.It's similar to SAO, but less plot, less harems & more boobs.You're not missing much. & gets boring quickly.It's similar to SAO, but less plot, less harems & more boobs.You're not missing much."", ""Alright, here it is. If we were judging based on the title of a series alone, this would be it. The competition is over. Peak degeneracy. And even in theme, this series is pretty degenerate. But that doesn't stop it from being a pretty decent show. It is a show with pretty bland characters and an average story that is really just dragged across the finish line by its presentation, and particularly its sound design. And that isn't a bad thing.It turns out being a reasonably good watch, but it is lacking an identity. I still have trouble placing what this show tried to achieve....For instance, it could be an action show, but the monster art sucks and the action direction isn't good either. It could be a character development show, but most of the characters are just harem members. It could be a plot show, but nothing really gets explained. It is just easier to talk about this in segments. So let's dive in.[Rating]Story: 4Art: 7Sound: 9Character: 3Enjoyment: 5Overall: 6[Story: 4]The premise is that this guy, Bell, wants to be with this girl and get recognized as a hero. And stuff happens. It is very simple, which is fine. Probably good, even. A lot of the time, that's just how life is. There is no need to begin with something that is only confusing, so this series starts off with a simple premise with the intention of ramping it up later. Really, the story does a decent job hitting beats and setting up important climaxes that resonate with the audience. Of course, it has its fair share of issues.One major issue lies with Bell's character. More on that later, but his design in terms of the world is broken from episode 1, and it makes it hard for the audience to get on his side.Another major issue is the constant promise of depth in the story, without it having come to fruition. There are many characters and world mechanics that are just big question marks. What is the connection between the gods and the adventurers? Why are they sent down from heaven? Why does the dungeon exist? Why is Bell significant to this? None of these questions get answered or even explored in the run of the series. Yes, it is the first season, but this is not how you build an engaging plot.[Art: 7]I have a difficult time evaluating the art. Most of the time, the character art looks pretty good! The design could use some work, but the character animation is livelier than most. The background work ranges from good to average. The direction is mostly standard but it looks good.However, a big hurdle for the series is the action. The monster art sucks, and pretty consistently. This is a big pain for the show. Sure it isn't Log Horizon bad... but it is pretty bad. Sometimes the monsters are CGI, and they look awful, and sometimes the monsters are just drawn poorly and not well-realized. The prime example is the silverback. Beyond this, the directing seems to have a hard time actually showing the action and instead relies on quick cuts and effects to engage the viewer. This drags the action down. Sometimes the action can get by on its level of spectacle alone, but this generally is not well-animated and cannot even hope to reach the level of something like Gurren Lagann, the ultimate spectacle action piece.[Sound: 9]The sound design is the shining star of this series, and its not close. It feels like most of the series is scored moment-by-moment, which, while I do not expect is the case, is a magnificent feat. The is music playing very often, and it always seems to fit with the mood of the series and drastically improve the watch quality. The sound has interesting effects for objects and movements that are usually forgotten, which adds an extra layer of immersion to the production. Small pitfalls are the voice acting, which is only fine, and maybe the bass on some of the boomy sound effects. Still on the fence about that.But, really. Without the sound, I think this series goes nowhere. Just having the proper sound actually improves the narrative itself. The saving grace --and really the spiritual essence -- of the series itself.[Character: 3]Most of the characters are throwaways, are unexplained, or just disappoint. Let's just get into it.Bell. A hero/leader character. That's all fine. I've seen plenty of these types of characters that I like. But Bell is average at best. Let's see how it all stacks up. Bell's tragic backstory is that his family died and he is too weak to join a familia and be with the girl he has a crush on. I'm fine with backgrounds like this. Look at someone like Deku from HeroAca. While not really one of my favorite characters, his backstory is pretty similar and he is at least a character I can resonate with. Where does it all go wrong for Bell? He is sad because nobody wants him and nobody is there for him, because he is weak. But at the same time, literally EVERY WOMAN IN THE ENTIRE SERIES, THE ENTIRE WORLD, WANTS TO HAVE HIS BABIES. Right from the start, too. Before he even unlocks his true chick magnet potential. Sorry, but this is such a strong inconsistency. It creates the huge divide in what the backstory tells us Bell is and what Bell actually is. And do to this arrangement, we have a hard time connecting with Bell as he improves or slays big baddies, because it doesn't mean as much.Then there are the role players. Most of these characters are throwaways. Some of them get decent development and are sort of interesting... but mostly not.Then there are the mobs. This happens often in anime, where the mobs have a drastically over-the-top sense of morality. For instance, the mean enemy adventurers in this series. Their portrayal is so simple, brutish, and unfeeling that is completely pushes the audience away from trying to understand this group as characters. That just isn't how people are in the world. Same with the droves of women trying to get with Bell. That just isn't how people are, and to misunderstand that is big blunder.[Enjoyment: 5]This is a very, very easy watch. Sure, there is a lot of stuff going on that isn't too memorable or interesting. But there are plenty of exciting, triumphant moments, too. The slow points are bearable. Most of this, maybe all of this, is due to the sound design and OST work. It can't be understated. Realistically, the action sequences are rarely strong enough to support an action series, the characters and rarely strong enough to support a drama series, and the plot is too undiscovered to support an adventure/thriller series. But good sound work can do so much to subvert these issues.[Overall: 6] For instance, it could be an action show, but the monster art sucks and the action direction isn't good either.

With a mediocre-at-best MMORPG-esque dungeon-grind setting and a dreadful cast of one-dimensional characters, my expectations were already low a few episodes in. However, the banal story development and a looming sense of purposelessness managed to drag my opinion even lower as it went on.We start off with our run-of-the-mill action protag Bell-kun, whose only discernable flaw is the fact that he's novice adventurer and thus isn't very capable at making a living for himself or his patron 'goddess' Hestia. Aside from this, though - he doesn't...seem to have very many problems. Every woman he comes into contact with falls inexplicably in love with him (despite his obliviousness), he is generally respected by everyone, and manages to hold a naively wholesome outlook on life as his problems are always either solved by someone else or just resolve themselves thanks to luck.In terms of his 'development', once he's saved in the dungeon by a beautiful swordswoman, his infatuation with her gives him the ability to progress at ridiculous speeds as an adventurer. A few episodes later and he's already OP, gaining an incredibly powerful weapon and unbeatable magic abilities with little to no effort on his own part. Thus, the takeaway we get from Bell-kun is that he's incredibly powerful, loved by everyone, and doesn't really suffer from any internal struggles: i.e., the tension and conflict throughout the show are nowhere to be found.Writers need to understand that a main character who lacks any meaningful flaws (barring physical weakness, which is basically a given for the beginning of any action-adventure anime...) can easily sour a story with an otherwise interesting cast of characters. Unfortunately, since the side characters in this show aren't particularly interesting either, there's nothing to save this piss-poor cast. They're all just about as vapid as Bell, and either exist to fill a spot in his harem or serve as a temporary plot device.If all you expect out of this anime is some turn-off-your-brain action and a harem of big tiddy anime girls, go for it. If you're looking for something deeper, you're out of luck, because this show contains about as much meaningful content as the back of the shampoo bottle you read while you take a shit. seem to have very many problems.

Though that can be easily interpreted as naïve as he makes a lot of stupid decisions and doesn't seem to pick up on a lot). There was nothing truly special about Bell that made him stand out from the crowd, and though I was initially intrigued by the world because of the role the way mythology is intertwined in it, with different gods/goddesses from various cultures holding positions of power...and having their own familia, unfortunately this isn't really explored much, at least in this season.Honestly, this really didn't do much for me and I didn't find any of the characters particularly compelling, but it was entertaining enough for me to want to continue. It's the sort of mindless isekai you can just absorb without having to think too deeply about, and sometimes that's just what you need. and having their own familia, unfortunately this isn't really explored much, at least in this season.Honestly, this really didn't do much for me and I didn't find any of the characters particularly compelling, but it was entertaining enough for me to want to continue.

Not even the...main character changes at all other than leveling up. I\'m not saying that the women aren\'t allowed to be attracted to the main character but at least have a better reason other than ""hes strong"", or ""hes nice"".

We get a brief glimpse of adventurers going into the tower so is it below the tower? Why is it there? Are there other dungeons in the world? Who created the Dungeon? Why do monsters respawn like a video game? These basic rules to the world are missing and it shows that not much thought is really put into the story.

And honestly that is about it..The series doesn\'t give him any other motivation then ""I want to be a hero"" and I guess you could say he also wants to be as good as Aiz but that\'s basically the same as ""I want to be a hero""The characters are all pretty much generic, Even if Heistia is adorable she\'s still your ""Loli with big boobs"" character and Lilly is your ""Furry Loli with little boobs""No characters actually matter to the story...besides a few moments, The blonde elf from the tavern does more to advance the plot than most on screen characters. She tells him to get stronger he needs to go on his own ""Adventure"" telling him to find himself basically, Which gives him the motivation to push forward and defeat the Minotaur.The show can be funny and have a great laugh but it fails horribly at romance.Aiz the blonde girl that saves Bell is incredibly emotionless and honestly dumb. Every other female in the series has more character than her.. I\'m not sure why she is so emotionless, I would say they were trying to make her ATLEAST likable to anyone and everyone.The romance in this show is completely thrown aside every time is comes up. Every time there is a romantic moment they completely stomp on it by shoving humor in there so it doesn\'t become too heart touching for the children.. because it has its ""Harem"" of girls that love Bell it can\'t be too romantic with one otherwise the audience wont have anything to fight over.The one thing that saves the show is its fight scenes. Ever fight is fun and entertaining to look at while also seems to have some sort of actual flow to it. The boss fights are the main reason I watch the show.. Every boss fight hypes it up from beginning to end and pays off extremely well, The sound track really backs up these fights and does great to really pump you up.

Nope, it’s actually a somewhat dramatic and serious story at times.The story stars Bell Credel (somebody really thought that was a brilliant name) a teen simp. He’s a white haired knight white-knighting the white knight, a lady known as Ais. His entire goal in the show is motivated by what a pure simp he is.....or at least, that’s what it starts off being about. At around maybe halfway through, the show stops really focusing on that,...which you think would be nice, but no, it just makes Bell into a rather flat and dull character who’s blander than starched carbohydrates. Really his ability to simp Ais might be the only time he’s ever showing a personality beyond generic “heroic justice”. Not exactly helping are his “powers”, which include the ability to have infinite double XP outside of weekends and mtn dew bottles, and an ability that might as well have been named “Deus ex machina” since it’s basically that.Really the main star of the show here is Hestia, she’s probably got the most personality out of any of the main cast, and that isn’t just a dumb joke about her massive chest. She’s very lively and probably the most entertaining character with her antics, even if she is kind of a generic tsundere/clingy girl trope. Regardless, hestia is the bestia part of this show.Along for the ride is Bell’s supporter, Lily, a little girl who’s past is so tragic that it borders on ludicrous just how depressing they make it, and honestly her backstory involves her getting kicked around by society so much I’m surprised she didn’t just put on clown makeup and start a gamer revolution with how much the character was getting beat by society. Like jesus, I know they want us to feel bad for her, but they tried too hard.Welf Crozzo is probably the 2nd best character behind Hestia. Despite coming into the story after more than halfway, he still has one of the best arcs in the show, plus he’s got a great personality and he’s totally Bell’s best bro.And it really sucks cause the series ends with a really good episode, but most of the episodes are honestly kind of.... meh. Then again, it might just be my fault for marathoning the whole damn thing after midnight. Either way it really deserved more than just 13 episodes, since that didn’t really befit a show that clearly wanted to worldbuild but lacked the space and time for it.The premise for this show is ludicrous beyond words, and not just because the protagonist is a SIMP. I mean for god’s sake, even before the FIRST EPISODE, the dude already has a beautiful woman, and by the end he might as well have a harem considering he has at least like 4 people crushing on him at that point. Like the dude has so many choices yet he keeps throwing his life on the line because of one blonde woman who saved him?! Yeah.... he’s a total simp.The music was..... honestly I don’t remember the music, and even the op and Ed were kinda unremarkable. The art was good, but it is a bit marred from the liberal usage of CGI as a crutch to fill in backgrounds with characters like McDonald’s filling in McNuggets with pink slime.Overall IIWTPUGIAD is not my cup of tea, but I might look at the 2nd season if it manages to be slightly better.Oh and yes, the toothpaste scene is 10/10 kino.Now if you’ll excuse me, I gotta go to bed, because it’s SIX IN THE MORNING and I think I have a problem which you think would be nice, but no, it just makes Bell into a rather flat and dull character who’s blander than starched carbohydrates.

I\'d watch it again if a friend really wanted to watch it with me, but I\'d never pull it up myself.  I\'m not sorry I watched it, but I won\'t recommend it.A lot of people have compared this show to Sword Art Online, but for my part, I watched this after KonoSuba and immediately thought ""oh, this is what that was a parody of.""  So what does ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka"" (DanMachi from...here on in the review) have to offer?It has action, harem antics, and comedy mostly centered around said harem antics.  And that doesn\'t sound so bad.  It\'s at least a decent looking show, and both action and comedy are rather nice to have, and I\'m not even opposed to harem antics.There are a couple places, though, where it falls apart.  The elements of the show don\'t mix will.  This is a world where the gods of mythology, such as Hestia and Loki, have come down from the heavens to live among mortals and grant favored champions their blessing... which takes the form of being a player character in an RPG, apparently.  Maybe coming in from the west I have a different perspective but when I see a straight-up RPG-mechanics universe it strikes me as inherently farcical, yet here that aspect is played surprisingly entirely seriously.  It\'s a slight disconnect, but it highlights the most important thing I feel that DanMachi gets wrong: I never really know whether I should take it seriously or not.There are shows where a disconnect between serious and humorous can work, but here the elements distracted from each other.  It was hard to laugh at Hestia\'s antics when the fighting takes itself deadly serious, and at times it was hard to get into the death, bloodshed, and trauma to be inflicted on some characters when coming off more lighthearted or playful elements.  If this wanted to be a serious show (well, work, I haven\'t read the light novels but I imagine at least some of this applies there), that would be fine -- drop or downplay the RPG mechanics, play the harem aspects with more emotional weight, and cut down or out the fanservice-style comedy antics.  If it wanted to be parodical, that would be fine too -- take some emphasis off the life-or-death nature of dungeon delving and the suffering certain characters go through.  As it is it\'s just muddy.The other weak point in the show is the cast.  I don\'t hate them, there aren\'t any characters whose names I\'ll be cursing, but I think that they were overall... well, the on-site rating system says it all: Mediocre.  Bell is mostly a bland nice guy who\'s not comedy-stupid but isn\'t the sharpest tack either.  Supposedly he wants to pick up girls which could have been a really funny start for a character, but you\'d think he\'d notice the girls throwing themselves at him if he actually ran with that.  Ais Wallenstein is the tight-lipped (EXTREMELY tight-lipped) seemingly emotionless girl we\'re supposed to assume has a sweet core who really hammered home to me how I\'m tired of the amount of play that sort of love interest is getting.  Hestia actually annoyed me.  She had some annoying moments but her clingy love interest act got kind of old kind of fast.  The supporting cast could be nice at times, but at times what seemed like a good bit of development could be thrown out, either by the arc being resolved too soon or the character who comes out of it not feeling like an outgrowth of the character who came before.That said, was this a bad show?

I decided to give the show a shot since I\'ve been on a fantasy/adventure binge lately, and the show is relatively well-known and has decent ratings. However, 3 episodes in, and I found myself hitting the pause button more than play. Ultimately, I made the hard choice to drop the show from my list, which is something I rarely ever do for one that\'s rated higher than 7.0 on MAL. However, I simply couldn\'t continue watching for two major reasons:1. Lack of plot and confusing...story development.I\'ve watched my fair share of shows that have clear plot lines, shows that have no central direction, and everything in between, but DanMachi struck me as the worst of both worlds. The show is confusing, to say the least, unless the series I watch was missing an entire episode. Right at the beginning of episode 1, you are thrown into a narrated action sequence that is supposed to introduce the main character. However, it does so in such a convoluted way that leaves you with more questions than answers: Who is this boy? Why is he in a dungeon? Who is narrating? What is their relation to one another?After a while, I realized that the show was just trying to do a ""show, don\'t tell"", but did so in such a mediocre way that it would have been much better for them to take the traditional approach of background exposition through narration. I spent so much time trying to understand the connection between the MC and the main heroine, and trying to place the MC in the world, that I never really digested what the entirety of the first episode was about.And it just gets worse. Three episodes in, and things are moving along, but every episode seems to bring more questions than answers. Who are these gods and goddesses? Why the hell are they living among people? What are Familias? Why is the MC a servant of his goddess, does he owe her something? How did the MC and main heroine meet in the first place? How do these characters know each other? Why does he, or rather why does everyone, keep going back into the dungeon? What are these levels?The show just keeps pulling more and more random trivia out of its backside that never ends up getting properly explained, so you\'re left trying to figure everything out while the main action is happening, and not in a good, brain-stimulating way.2. Bland charactersEven though I only watched 3 episodes, this has to be by far one of the worst character development I\'ve ever seen. You essentially get no background on any of the characters that show up, and yet they all seem to know one another. None of the characters also feel like they mature or grow throughout the course of the series, and new characters keep randomly popping up without getting properly introduced. Imagine opening up a Map Editor for a brand new RPG game and then just spawning in every character on the roster. That\'s how it feels to watch the show. Half the time, you\'re wondering who they are, where they came from, why they\'re important, and how they know one another, as the show tries to explain while failing miserably.Even the most trashy, cookie-cutter, harem fantasy/action does a better job in acclimating you to the characters than this show. I seriously wonder how it managed to get such a high rating, considering the fan service isn\'t what one would consider appealing.All in all, I\'m very surprised to say, but I would not recommend picking up DanMachi.

I was not, as it turned out. To me, it is incomprehensible that this has gotten so many seasons.Art is good, voice acting is good, world setting has potential, but as far as I got there wasn\'t much of a story, and it all felt shallow. The protagonist is an overpowered Gary Stu character, but that isn\'t my biggest issue. My biggest issue is this: I don\'t know what age the protagonist, Bell Cranel,...is supposed to be, but mentally he is a child. And if I were to describe this anime with one word it would be \'childish\'.I only got to episode 7, so maybe it gets better, but so many scenes made me think ""Am I supposed to think this is cute?"" And I didn\'t.Every time a character didn\'t tell the protagonist what they think just because the harem effect needed to be kept up, I was annoyed. Every time the protagonist made things worse through childish awkwardness, I was annoyed. Every time a female character inexplicably fell in love with him, I was annoyed. Is every woman in this world a pedophile? Harsh, perhaps, but while a childish person might make you feel affection, you certainly shouldn\'t be getting wet, so I can\'t really find another word for all these women. Basically, most of them fall in love with him just because he helps them, so I suppose this might be self insert for so-called \'nice guys\'. This is not a good thing.Characters other than the protagonist are basically divided into women and opponents, and the latter category get little screen time. The women are all pretty much one dimensional tropes. I think the first woman you encounter, Hestia, is the one you are supposed to ""root for"", or whatever, but she is absolutely horrendous, and no sane man would stay in her company. Of course, our protagonist is so sexually frustrated that only his childish ignorance keeps him from being an absolute monster, and has the patience of a saint or three, so he\'s fine with putting up with a bunch of crazy crap for the sake of tits. Not that he knows what to do with them.I could go on at length, but I have wasted enough time on this rather poor anime.

Harsh, perhaps, but while a childish person might make you feel affection, you certainly shouldn\'t be getting wet, so I can\'t really find another word for all these women. Basically, most of them fall in love with him just because he helps them, so I suppose this might be self insert for so-called \'nice guys\'. This is not a good thing.Characters other than the protagonist are basically divided into women and opponents, and the latter category get little screen time. The women are all pretty much one dimensional tropes. I think the first woman you encounter, Hestia, is the one you are supposed to ""root for"", or whatever, but she is absolutely horrendous, and no sane man would stay in her company. Of course, our protagonist is so sexually frustrated that only his childish ignorance keeps him from being an absolute monster, and has the patience of a saint or three, so he\'s fine with putting up with a bunch of crazy crap for the sake of tits. Not that he knows what to do with them.I could go on at length, but I have wasted enough time on this rather poor anime. If what I have already said is not enough to discourage you from watching it, then go ahead, but I cannot say I hope you like it, because I would not really want to think that of anyone.', ""I felt completely unmoved by this anime and I found that pretty impressive. Nothing super exciting or horrifying happens to any of the characters, it's just a very dull experience. There are boobs but that can only carry the plot so much. Some of the character designs are kinda cool.I almost got excited for the final battle but most of it was in red and for some reason that really killed it for me. I was hoping for a sick battle in full color and I definitely did not get that.If you want to throw on something passively engaging for background noise I would recommend...this anime. this anime.""]"
