Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6712/Natsu_no_Arashi_Akinaichuu,"['Short summary:Not as good as the first season, but still worth watching.Long summary:Season 1 of Natsu no Arashi!, if I had to describe it in one sentence, was a captivating mixture of drama, romance, comedy, and some action with a quirky ""retro but modern"" feel. Akinaichuu manages to retain all these things to varying degrees, but unfortunately ends up falling a bit short of matching season 1.Story: (6 - Fair)The concept of Arashi and Hajime traveling back in time to the World War II era to save people was a big part of Season 1. However, for most of the first portion of Akinaichuu, this...concept seems to have been replaced in favor of mostly pure comedic episodes, and only late in the season do we start feeling the spirit of season 1 again. The comedy episodes, while well written and definitely in line with the witty humor of the series, are essentially stand alones and thus end up feeling almost like fillers.However, within these fillers are a few indications (such as the concept of predetermined destiny) that build towards the final arc near the end of the series, which I found to be a great finisher that made me remember why I like Natsu no Arashi so much. If the whole season had been like that final arc, this season would have been that much better.Art: (8 - Very Good)Season 2 managed to keep that ""old fashioned yet modern countryside"" feel of the art in season 1, which is a good example of ""If it isn\'t broken, don\'t fix it""Sound: (7 - Good)The VAs of the series voice their characters just as fittingly as they did in season 1. The opening and ending songs were good as well, with last season\'s opening doing a better job of that ""retro yet modern"" feel, but this season\'s ending better than last\'s in achieving that feel.Character: (8 - Very Good)All the characters are back, and don\'t suffer from any (unintentionally) awkward character changes. All of them get a chance to make us laugh (which they do quite well), and various relationships, like that between Jun and Hajime, are further explored in funny yet insightful ways, without neglecting the main relationship of Arashi and Hajime.Overall: (7 - Good)Akinaichuu managed to keep a lot of what was so entertaining about season 1, but the lack of an encompassing plot made it harder for the series to be engaging until near the final arc of the season. Nevertheless, I still had a good time laughing at the antics of the characters I\'ve grown very fond of, and anyone that enjoyed season 1 would likely enjoy this season as well. concept seems to have been replaced in favor of mostly pure comedic episodes, and only late in the season do we start feeling the spirit of season 1 again.

DUH! I really loved the first season and I expected nothing less in the follow-up!~ Turns out I was more or less right! Anyways, here a little bit of my thoughts on this 2nd season!*Btw, I refuse to write a short a summary of Natsu no Arashi!Akinaichuu at the start of my review. I believe I\'d be wasting your time and it\'d be just re-summarizing the summary provided on the ""details"" tab.Story: 9As with my review for Natsu no Arashi!, I fairly liked the one-shots...per episode and I thought that\'s what kept each episode of both seasons high refreshing and new. It made me want to keep plowing through the episodes just to see what\'s the next surprise! The only reason why I think it\'s shy of perfection is the lack of a centralized plot, therefore I believe one-shots has it\'s pros and cons! I\'m sure y\'all will enjoy Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu\'s storyline if you enjoyed the first season\'s.Art: 10Also explained in my review for the first season, I\'m an extreme Kobayashi Jinn (the mangaka for both Natsu no Arashi! and School Rumble) buff, so I enjoy the artwork he draws. For me, I love the way he designs each individual so they stand out from each other and doesn\'t get too confusing!Sound: 10Somehow, I thought it was an improvement from the first season! Because I pay a lot of attention to OST, this section I marked fairly high as somehow during Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu!, there was more OST than the first one. The OST was fairly well paired with the situations in the anime, therefore no questions on that. I was fairly pleased with the opening and ending themes which I thought was very original! Just the opening theme was slight awkward...I\'ll explain below!Character: 10No doubts about the character section as being a solid 10! Each character was a pleasure to watch and the versatility of each character helps override my initial impressions about how a small character list can become a good series! I\'ve said in the first review, I really like the characters that Kobayashi Jin makes, and it is shown through each of his series that they are very unique and original! Definitely something I enjoyed about this show!Enjoyment: 10I loved Natsu no Arashi! and Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu! There was no question on the enjoyability of this series. My attention did not waver at all in any episodes, and trust me, it\'s not entirely because of Arashi or Kaya! Regardless which episode or featuring which character, Natsu no Arashi provided me a solid 5 or something hours of enjoyment that I\'d never regret spending!Overall: 10I don\'t really get this ""overall"" section...basically isn\'t it just the ""enjoyment"" section repeated? Anyways I\'ll try to make it sound a bit differnt ;D! LOL. Anyways, I thought this series was really amazing to watch and I thought it was definitely one of the best i\'ve seen in a while! Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not a crazy fanboy, but despite the low ratings you may see, I believe (and i\'m sure some others) that Natsu no Arashi! & Akinaichuu was way too underrated! It may be overshadowed by moe moe series such as Kaichou wa Maid-sama (which is actually very very good as i\'m the same age as the people in the series! Hehe), but Natsu no Arashi stands its ground on it\'s own genres, which frankly, isn\'t all too popular with the otaku group of today\'s world. Not that i\'m saying all Otakus will dislike this show, i\'m just saying they will expect too much moe moe and will be disappointed by such a down-to-earth and realistic (just the character\'s emotions, not the supernatural stuff!) show such as Natsu no Arashi! Anyways, back to Natsu no Arashi!. Was it only me who was confused by the opening?! Is that blood that Arashi is showering in? I\'d be happy to hear your thoughts on my profile page! LOL!!! Meh, in a way, I wish there\'d be a 3rd season, but due to it\'s rather low popularity, I doubt it. If you\'re wondering what happens to Arashi and Hajime and everyone else, I\'d suggest you read the manga, but it isn\'t fully scanlated into English....Being a half japanese is such a bonussss hehehe.... LOL I hope you\'ll enjoy Akinaichuu as much as i did!!! per episode and I thought that\'s what kept each episode of both seasons high refreshing and new.

There are many slap-stick quality jokes embedded in the show but most of them were original, which I appreciated. It was definitely unique and I have never seen a show quite like it (whether comparing it as a comedy or just the plot). Although the story is fairly decent, it wasn\'t the best but everything else made up for it, but then again everyone\'s opinion differs.Comedy, for this series, was definitely its strong point but...that wasn\'t the only thing that kept me watching. If it was just another high school comedy I probably wouldn\'t have watched it, and of course most of this is also based on the first series, which was better in my opinion. The thought of going back in time to change the present appealed to me and the thought that they used it for trivial matters made me grin.In any case, this show was definitely worth the watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it as a comedy series. that wasn\'t the only thing that kept me watching.

It was okay, suffering quite a bit from tonal problems, repeating an episode basically wholesale and some jokes that didn't work, but it also had quite a few good points and it was decent overall. So, does the second series improve on any of those aspects? Does it degrade? Let's take a look and see how it compares.Story:The story continues with Arashi, Hajime and everyone else working at the cafe. This series does drop the attempts at dramatic stories about their time traveling and goes completely into comedic mode. Which is what...the series should have been doing the entire time. Consequently, this one doesn't have the problem with tonal weirdness. Now we can focus entirely on the comedy. So, is it funny?Well, the series still has comedy that's hit and miss. We've still got the “jokes” that are just references to something from pop culture without anything funny being done with them. We've got a reoccurring joke about one of the cafe's regular customers wanting salt but not being able to get any. Why is that funny? The short answer is that it's not. I have no idea why someone not being able to get salt is even supposed to be funny. It's not like he does anything weird or over the top in an effort to get some. He just asks for it and then doesn't get it. Some of the jokes don't even make sense. You've got one where the joke is that a girl accidentally puts on a wedding dress without noticing until she's done. It's funny because... no one in reality would accidentally put on something as cumbersome as a wedding dress especially when you add in all the accessories? If you got the hyper masculine dude in a wedding dress then that would at least be a funny image, but a girl wearing a wedding dress isn't funny, even if she is doing it by accident. There are quite a few jokes like that too.There's also a problem with the romance. In the first series they had some romance with Kaja's backstory and they had the implied stuff between Yayoi and Kanako, but most of their attempts at romantic content were pretty downplayed or left as one-sided crushes. In this series, Kobayashi decided that it would be a good idea to develop romance between a girl who's been a ghost for sixty years and a thirteen year old boy. Even if you only count the summers when calculating her age, since that's apparently the only time the ghosts wander the Earth, she's still far too old for him. Why do works of media think it's a good idea to pair teenagers, young or otherwise, with supernatural beings who are far too old for them anyway? Inukami did that too. As did the infamous Twilight. Now, I will give this series some credit. It doesn't use such an extreme age difference and it does downplay the content as opposed to putting it front and centre, but it's still screwed up and it definitely leads to some uncomfortable moments.To its credit, the series does have some really funny moments scattered throughout. And it does have more jokes that work than jokes that don't. Even if most episodes are going to have plenty of both. The secondary romance between Yayoi and Kanako is kind of cute too and it does lead to some good moments. It's almost like romance works a lot better when there isn't a disturbing age gap.Characters:The cast remains pretty much as they were. Those characters who were pretty fleshed out are still well fleshed out, which is most of the main cast, whereas those who just followed their tropes still follow their tropes. So, it's still a pretty strong group of characters, particularly for a zany comedy work.Art:Most of the art problems from the first series are gone or at least minimised in this one. The wonky perspectives are still around, but they aren't nearly as prevalent. However, that doesn't mean that the art as a whole has improved. This series has its own major issue. It likes to incorporate ridiculous amounts of fan-service. The first series had a little bit but not so much that it was really a problem. With this one you get a lot. There are various shots animated so that the focus is on a girl's bosom or bum. There are also a bunch of cases of the girls being shown in states of undress because the series really needed to remind you that they have boobs. That was far more important than keeping things classy. Now, I will still give the series credit for having nicely done character designs, when they aren't throwing them into random fan-service outfits, and for doing expressions really well.Sound:The performances remain competent. It's still nothing special nor are there any that stand out, but the actors all do well. Now, I will give this series credit for having slightly better music. Most of it is still pretty standard, but there are some pieces that are actually good and do stand out.Ho-yay:In the last series the ho-yay came exclusively from Yayoi and Kanako. In this one, there's an episode about a manga artist trying to get Arashi to kiss one of the other girls. It's a dumb episode, overall, but it still does have near kisses between Arashi and most of the other major girls and it nearly has one between two of the male characters. Yayoi and Kanako are also featured a lot more and they are definitely being portrayed as a couple. Even if the series never comes out and explicitly states it. So, the ho-yay factor on this one is a 5/10.Final Thoughts:Natsu no Arashi Akinaichuu definitely improves in some regards. However, it also degrades in a variety of ways. Is it an improvement over the first? Slightly. My final rating for it is going to be a 6.3/10. It's a decent enough series. If you enjoyed the first series you'll probably like this one too. There's no real reason to watch it otherwise. Next week I'll look at Akuma no Riddle. the series should have been doing the entire time.

Next week I'll look at Akuma no Riddle."", ""We were young once; wishing that summer would last forever, getting worried over the most trivial matters, falling in love with the wrong people, and thinking we knew everything. And then comes that certain age when we are confronted by the ghosts of our past to remind us that it was that rose-colored youth which shaped who we are today. Caught in the crossroads of growing up, reminiscence is a therapy session we all could use every now and then. So grab the nearest ghost of the past, and jump straight into two seasons of Natsu no Arashi’s unconventional ride of history-redefining proportions.STORY - 6Hajime...Yasaka, spunky 13-year-old, moves in with his grandfather in the countryside and experiences a summer he will never forget. Taking place as a distant memory from Hajime’s youth he meets the most unlikely bunch who changed his life. Along with a tomboyish model, World War II ghosts, a ripped detective, and a foxy con artist, they run a vintage cafe with occasional time traveling during their free time. Combine that with the growing man’s search for love and we have ourselves a supernatural, slice-of-life, historical, coming-of-age romcom about a 13-year-old’s journey through time and self. As intriguing and loaded the premise is, the main hook of the series lies in its puzzling time travel mechanic.Instead of the usual objective of do-overs and clairvoyance, Natsu no Arashi bypasses the time travel paradox by treating the very act of time travel as part of the natural timeline. Time travel here is not an intervention but a phenomenon that triggers inevitable events we took for granted. Simply put, destiny factored in time traveling, making for some interesting retrospective story progression.Whether it’s for playing a prank, disposing spoiled food, saving air raid victims or uncovering past secrets, time travel is an entertaining constant in Natsu no Arashi.But how does the plot actually fare? The first season was an origins story for the people Hajime encounters while the second attempted to develop character relationships. Though the first had more impact and direction due to the second being too distracted by gags, both suffer the same problem of lacking plot movement. It could’ve used more episodes since some of the development seemed erratic. But for how everything's been presented, the gaps and irregular flow gives it the feel of a scrapbook. You get a peek of the fun and memorable bits adding to the show’s episodic nature, in exchange for some plot investment. This doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi fails to grip its viewers. It has its share of powerful moments to the effect of historical dramas, unrequited love, and themes of fleeting youth. At its most relaxed, it plays around with time travel and the cafe setting; often employing slapstick to reference and trope humor. The School Rumble cameos for Jin Kobayashi writing both mangas were also an awesome touch.Bottom line is, while Natsu no Arashi can flaunt a fun and creative premise with unpredictable execution, it falls short with aimless pacing and sluggish plot development come the second season.ART - 9Shaft? I’m in. That being said, I expected the usual sleek designs, exaggerated movements, barrages of text, and random color filters spilled on every scene. Upon finishing the first season, I had one question in mind. “What year was this made?”2009.From the slightly dated color palette and wishy-washy ambient lighting down to the clunky character designs bearing yesterday’s eye style, I could’ve sworn I was watching a show from the early 2000’s. To put things into perspective, Natsu no Arashi was aired in the same year as Bakemonogatari. I guess we know where most of the animation budget went. Second season was up just four months after the first, with more refined production values as shown by increased clarity and smoother movements. Despite that, it still stuck to the classic feel of the first. Setting technicalities aside, did Shaft just deliberately retrograde their own show? Even for them, that’s reaching a whole new level of creativity.That doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi lacks any visual highlights.Animation is deceivingly smooth. Further aided by Shaft’s frequent scene cuts, this produces the illusion of a continuous flow of actions which gives the impression of something always happening on-screen.Character designs are also a plus; pronounced in gender, personality and social class. General appearances are bold and brash for men while slender and meticulous for women. Personality is captured by each character’s unique face while the eyes have it for social standing. Take Arashi’s and Kaya’s features vs. Kanako’s and Yayoi’s features for instance. As a whole, Arashi and Kaya, being the elites, have more elegant designs with vivid eyes. Arashi, having the more cheery and liberal disposition, has the livelier face of the two. Kaya, her polar opposite, sports blue reserved eyes, and delicate white skin and hair; suggesting a more conservative and ladylike attitude. On the other hand, Kanako and Yayoi of the working class have more basic features with duller eyes. Kanako’s freckles and braids with small eyes resembles her uptight and unrefined nature while Yayoi’s wide, pupilless eyes and hair let down make her come off as loyal yet frail.And of course, don’t forget all the other details that have Shaft written all over it: artstyle shifts, random camera angles. DIY live-action takes, cryptic segments about summaries of popular manga, a surprising amount of belly button shots for the lack of head tilts, and even accentuated magazine-cover poses with awkward dancing mid-conversation.Though watered down than their other more dynamic works, Natsu no Arashi still stylistically succeeds. It’s amazing how the art perfectly blends with the historical atmosphere to visualize what the good old days felt like. Technical resourcefulness and proper theming had me giving near-perfect marks for the art; overall quality being the only hindrance to a 10.SOUND - 9Natsu no Arashi’s art isn’t the only thing that decided to backtrack.For one thing, the BGM is divided into the cafe jukebox tracks and the instrumentals. Actual tracks were used as ambient music in the cafe which mostly consist of yesterday’s hits of pop and rock. The jukebox plays a different song almost every episode in the background, it’s ridiculous. As for the instrumentals, occasional action scenes get the upbeat, brass- and synth-filled sentai showdown songs. Meanwhile, touching moments are graced with serene tracks of gentle piano, evocative strings, hushed chimes, and solemn woodwinds.Don’t even get me started on the openings and endings that just scream retro. For the first opening, what seems like the cheesiest opening ever with the groovy vocals and brass melody comes out as an ingenious shout-out to 70’s Japanese cover girls and album sleeves. Live-action time lapse shots of walkways against old-fashioned espionage-esque pop music with suave guitars and showtune horns make up the first ending. The second season starts with black and white storyboard-themed fanservice shown along catwalk-worthy synthpop. And lastly, the second ending uses chiptune and 8-bit art against trippy live-action takes.Voices are also surprisingly good for a low-key anime adaptation. Hajime goes all-out as a hot-blooded roughneck with the shounen heart. Jun’s pre-pubescent voice still enters androgynous territory with her seldom squeals sounding absolutely adorable. The detective gets all the gruff while the con artist attempts seductive but comes out as mischievous control freak. Arashi bears the girl-next-door voice contrary to Kaya’s pure and well-mannered shrinking violet while Kanako gets a sharp tongue with Yayoi pulling off the innocent ditz very well. All of them have their key moments and man, do they deliver; especially Arashi, Kaya, Jun, and Hajime.Even in this department, Natsu no Arashi doesn’t fall short in style and subtle quality. Very good seiyuu performances and the most fitting soundtrack selection seal the deal for the hidden genius at work here.CHARACTERS - 6Let me just say it right now. Character development is stunted and interactions get formulaic. The redeeming factors are their striking personalities and the clash of ideals resulting from the generation gap between the characters. We have the youngsters (Hajime and Jun), the old-fashioned adolescents (Arashi, Kaya, Kanako and Yayoi), and the modern adults (the detective and the con artist).Hajime is the little rascal. Part-skeptic and all-bro, the dude’s the epitome of the uncouth hero who fights his own battles and saves the weak and downtrodden; all while keeping his eyes out for the ladies. Carefree genki girl, Arashi, is noble but more outgoing than Hajime. Kaya nails her role as the traditional damsel who would perish the thought of showing skin and wasting true love’s kiss. Kanako lives by the sweat of her own brow; representing the bitter working class who envy all the privileged few. And Yayoi remains the vulnerable sweetheart.The budding romance centered on Hajime, the historical immersion from subtle hints in characters and setting, and the “what ifs” that never happened with the ghosts’ lives are definitely the show’s high points. The ghosts have it rough; saving bombing victims who would never predict their demise, making sense of the social divide and strict policies during the ongoing war, and going back in time only to constantly replay a love confession that will never happen. Natsu no Arashi gets pretty serious and it’s compelling moments like these that make the best out of the distinct characters; enough to pardon the amount of faffing they do most of the time.ENJOYMENT - 7The story felt inadequate, relationships were unresolved, the characters could have done so much more and the WWII setting was just asking for more explanations. But for what it is, I have no regrets watching it. Comedy can get stale. The drama creeps up on you. And the romance is a fresh take between modern and traditional views. The weak development was never really the reason to get into this show.Natsu no Arashi is a humble effort at making a love letter to the past by conveying how much we’re still connected to it. It’s a nostalgia trip that stands as a testament to the zeitgeist of the 70’s; clever on all fronts of production but a casual watch at best that hits home on seldom occasions. It proves that the past was once real. And that we’re fools for living like it never happened.So love the past. It’s the only illusion we know that existed. Because by the time we forget, we start growing up.“No matter how special it is, unrealistic experiences like this are going to be overwhelmed by real ones later. And you’ll stop believing in them.” - Arashiyama SayokoOVERALL - 7 Yasaka, spunky 13-year-old, moves in with his grandfather in the countryside and experiences a summer he will never forget. Taking place as a distant memory from Hajime’s youth he meets the most unlikely bunch who changed his life. Along with a tomboyish model, World War II ghosts, a ripped detective, and a foxy con artist, they run a vintage cafe with occasional time traveling during their free time. Combine that with the growing man’s search for love and we have ourselves a supernatural, slice-of-life, historical, coming-of-age romcom about a 13-year-old’s journey through time and self. As intriguing and loaded the premise is, the main hook of the series lies in its puzzling time travel mechanic.Instead of the usual objective of do-overs and clairvoyance, Natsu no Arashi bypasses the time travel paradox by treating the very act of time travel as part of the natural timeline. Time travel here is not an intervention but a phenomenon that triggers inevitable events we took for granted. Simply put, destiny factored in time traveling, making for some interesting retrospective story progression.Whether it’s for playing a prank, disposing spoiled food, saving air raid victims or uncovering past secrets, time travel is an entertaining constant in Natsu no Arashi.But how does the plot actually fare? The first season was an origins story for the people Hajime encounters while the second attempted to develop character relationships. Though the first had more impact and direction due to the second being too distracted by gags, both suffer the same problem of lacking plot movement. It could’ve used more episodes since some of the development seemed erratic. But for how everything's been presented, the gaps and irregular flow gives it the feel of a scrapbook. You get a peek of the fun and memorable bits adding to the show’s episodic nature, in exchange for some plot investment. This doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi fails to grip its viewers. It has its share of powerful moments to the effect of historical dramas, unrequited love, and themes of fleeting youth. At its most relaxed, it plays around with time travel and the cafe setting; often employing slapstick to reference and trope humor. The School Rumble cameos for Jin Kobayashi writing both mangas were also an awesome touch.Bottom line is, while Natsu no Arashi can flaunt a fun and creative premise with unpredictable execution, it falls short with aimless pacing and sluggish plot development come the second season.ART - 9Shaft? I’m in. That being said, I expected the usual sleek designs, exaggerated movements, barrages of text, and random color filters spilled on every scene. Upon finishing the first season, I had one question in mind. “What year was this made?”2009.From the slightly dated color palette and wishy-washy ambient lighting down to the clunky character designs bearing yesterday’s eye style, I could’ve sworn I was watching a show from the early 2000’s. To put things into perspective, Natsu no Arashi was aired in the same year as Bakemonogatari. I guess we know where most of the animation budget went. Second season was up just four months after the first, with more refined production values as shown by increased clarity and smoother movements. Despite that, it still stuck to the classic feel of the first. Setting technicalities aside, did Shaft just deliberately retrograde their own show? Even for them, that’s reaching a whole new level of creativity.That doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi lacks any visual highlights.Animation is deceivingly smooth. Further aided by Shaft’s frequent scene cuts, this produces the illusion of a continuous flow of actions which gives the impression of something always happening on-screen.Character designs are also a plus; pronounced in gender, personality and social class. General appearances are bold and brash for men while slender and meticulous for women. Personality is captured by each character’s unique face while the eyes have it for social standing. Take Arashi’s and Kaya’s features vs. Kanako’s and Yayoi’s features for instance. As a whole, Arashi and Kaya, being the elites, have more elegant designs with vivid eyes. Arashi, having the more cheery and liberal disposition, has the livelier face of the two. Kaya, her polar opposite, sports blue reserved eyes, and delicate white skin and hair; suggesting a more conservative and ladylike attitude. On the other hand, Kanako and Yayoi of the working class have more basic features with duller eyes. Kanako’s freckles and braids with small eyes resembles her uptight and unrefined nature while Yayoi’s wide, pupilless eyes and hair let down make her come off as loyal yet frail.And of course, don’t forget all the other details that have Shaft written all over it: artstyle shifts, random camera angles. DIY live-action takes, cryptic segments about summaries of popular manga, a surprising amount of belly button shots for the lack of head tilts, and even accentuated magazine-cover poses with awkward dancing mid-conversation.Though watered down than their other more dynamic works, Natsu no Arashi still stylistically succeeds. It’s amazing how the art perfectly blends with the historical atmosphere to visualize what the good old days felt like. Technical resourcefulness and proper theming had me giving near-perfect marks for the art; overall quality being the only hindrance to a 10.SOUND - 9Natsu no Arashi’s art isn’t the only thing that decided to backtrack.For one thing, the BGM is divided into the cafe jukebox tracks and the instrumentals. Actual tracks were used as ambient music in the cafe which mostly consist of yesterday’s hits of pop and rock. The jukebox plays a different song almost every episode in the background, it’s ridiculous. As for the instrumentals, occasional action scenes get the upbeat, brass- and synth-filled sentai showdown songs. Meanwhile, touching moments are graced with serene tracks of gentle piano, evocative strings, hushed chimes, and solemn woodwinds.Don’t even get me started on the openings and endings that just scream retro. For the first opening, what seems like the cheesiest opening ever with the groovy vocals and brass melody comes out as an ingenious shout-out to 70’s Japanese cover girls and album sleeves. Live-action time lapse shots of walkways against old-fashioned espionage-esque pop music with suave guitars and showtune horns make up the first ending. The second season starts with black and white storyboard-themed fanservice shown along catwalk-worthy synthpop. And lastly, the second ending uses chiptune and 8-bit art against trippy live-action takes.Voices are also surprisingly good for a low-key anime adaptation. Hajime goes all-out as a hot-blooded roughneck with the shounen heart. Jun’s pre-pubescent voice still enters androgynous territory with her seldom squeals sounding absolutely adorable. The detective gets all the gruff while the con artist attempts seductive but comes out as mischievous control freak. Arashi bears the girl-next-door voice contrary to Kaya’s pure and well-mannered shrinking violet while Kanako gets a sharp tongue with Yayoi pulling off the innocent ditz very well. All of them have their key moments and man, do they deliver; especially Arashi, Kaya, Jun, and Hajime.Even in this department, Natsu no Arashi doesn’t fall short in style and subtle quality. Very good seiyuu performances and the most fitting soundtrack selection seal the deal for the hidden genius at work here.CHARACTERS - 6Let me just say it right now. Character development is stunted and interactions get formulaic. The redeeming factors are their striking personalities and the clash of ideals resulting from the generation gap between the characters. We have the youngsters (Hajime and Jun), the old-fashioned adolescents (Arashi, Kaya, Kanako and Yayoi), and the modern adults (the detective and the con artist).Hajime is the little rascal. Part-skeptic and all-bro, the dude’s the epitome of the uncouth hero who fights his own battles and saves the weak and downtrodden; all while keeping his eyes out for the ladies. Carefree genki girl, Arashi, is noble but more outgoing than Hajime. Kaya nails her role as the traditional damsel who would perish the thought of showing skin and wasting true love’s kiss. Kanako lives by the sweat of her own brow; representing the bitter working class who envy all the privileged few. And Yayoi remains the vulnerable sweetheart.The budding romance centered on Hajime, the historical immersion from subtle hints in characters and setting, and the “what ifs” that never happened with the ghosts’ lives are definitely the show’s high points. The ghosts have it rough; saving bombing victims who would never predict their demise, making sense of the social divide and strict policies during the ongoing war, and going back in time only to constantly replay a love confession that will never happen. Natsu no Arashi gets pretty serious and it’s compelling moments like these that make the best out of the distinct characters; enough to pardon the amount of faffing they do most of the time.ENJOYMENT - 7The story felt inadequate, relationships were unresolved, the characters could have done so much more and the WWII setting was just asking for more explanations.

I've never really understood the original author's perception of a cute anime girl too, because well, they were kind of a turn-off... But it wasn't so bad when they're animated.Luckily (or maybe purposefully) Shinbo (director) tried to give Natsu no Arashi a different style, where he try to cram as many cells into a scene as possible... To the point where sometimes the characters strike a pose for no reason while the conversation goes on normally. Though it's SHAFT's style to use as little...frames as possible, I enjoyed the artistic intent.The story didn't amount to much though. I was hoping for greatly improved quality and more creative story lines, but it turn out to be almost exactly like season one... Random jokes with relation to the time paradoxes, and their adventures through time travel. There's a lot more character development this time round but I feel that the characters are not the strong point of this series. And the OP, I think it's trying too hard to sell by making everyone naked.Otherwise, I didn't think much about the songs and stuff because they didn't really leave an impression.

It s only light comedy sketches and the episodes are completely independant.In addition, the gags are not funny and overused in this second season, and a lot of them were already used in the first season, so it didn t make me laugh anymore. When you hear 20 times the same joke, you become as exasperated as the guy asking for salt since episode 1. For exemple, there is an episode where one of the characters transform in a funny fantasy character,...and the whole episode runs the same gag numerous times (transformation) throughout the WHOLE EPISODE...Even the animation is a let down, is not as fluid and colorful as in the first season, and the characters are often motionless.

Potemayo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2744/Potemayo,"['Honi Honi Honi!In all honesty I was tempted to leave this review as just those words, but for those of us who don\'t speak the language, here\'s a more normal version (that is, if the word normal can be ascribed to this series).What is Potemayo? When you watch the show this will be the question that you\'ll find yourself asking over and over.You could say it\'s an anime series based on the manga of the same name by Ogataya Haruka. You could also say that it\'s the result of drug induced euphoria like Hunter S Thompson\'s ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (only funnier)....It\'s very possible that Potemayo is the product of genius and madness joining together to create a story that encapsulates the surrealness of Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, the anarchy of Seto no Hanayome, the wrongness of Inukami, and choice morsels from a number of other shows.You could say a lot about the anime and manga known as Potemayo, and maybe they\'re all correct. We don\'t know.What we do know is that Moriyama Sunao wakes up one morning to find his fridge has given birth to a strange creature who absolutely reeks of kawaii. So he does what any half awake boy would do. He leaves it in the fridge, closes the door, and considers his options.1. Leave it in the fridge until it stops moving.2. Let it out, name it after a snack, and adopt it.Potemayo is basically a story about Sunao\'s life with his newfound companion, with much in the way of odd, wierd, strange, cute, and downright hilarious along the way.While it may, at first, seem like there\'s no rhyme or reason to the series, there is actually a plot buried somewhere under the mirth and cuteness. The problem is, you probably won\'t bother to look for it (I didn\'t until the third time watching the show), as your sides may hurt from time to time.There\'s not much else one can say about the ""plot"" though (I assure you there is definitely a plot, it\'s just well hidden is all), however the aim of Potemayo is to make you laugh, and this it does - in spades. Things only get stranger once the ultimate tsundere, Guchuko, is introduced.Given the main aim of the series, one can expect some fairly standard artwork and animation, and this is actually the case for the most part. The characters are fairly plain, however, the show does feature some strange and wonderful character designs (Potemayo and Guchuko), and some gloriously animated and choregraphed bits of visual comedy (usually involving Potemayo and Guchuko).The sound and music are, like the visuals, decent but nothing groundbreaking. That said, Hanazawa Kana and Tsuji Ayumi are simply brilliant as Potemayo and Guchuko, and Kitamura Eri (Sunao), is hilarious with his deadpan delivery. The show also features one of the most well suited and dangerously catchy OPs in anime. The OP gives a very good idea of what to expect from the series, however viewers should take care as you may find yourself humming the chorus for months on end.So, what can I say about characters? I could talk a lot about how cute Potemayo and Guchuko are, or I could talk about Sunao being the personification of the comedy ""straight man"", or I could even talk about Natsu Mikan and her rivalry with Potemayo for Sunao\'s affections. I could talk about several of the characters, but I\'ll only mention the word development in terms of Sunao. Aside from him, the other characters get virtually no development, but then again, this show isn\'t really about developing characters.That said, both Potemayo and Guchuko do ""mature"", it\'s just that their development is physical rather than mental and, like the rest of the show, very strange indeed.Now I will admit that I have a soft spot for comedies, especially those that are imaginative and original, and Potemayo definitely fits the bill. The show uses almost every comedy trick in the book, and uses them well, with slapstick right alongside crossdressing, innuendo mixed with anarchy, and some of the best visual gags I\'ve seen in anime outside of Gintama. Granted there\'s a certain cuteness to the show\'s design, but that only makes the laser beams and dead animals funnier.If you like your comedy to have a healthy dose of chaos, a heaping helping of slapstick, a serving of deadpan, together with a side order of Chii\'s Sweet Home, then this is the show for you. If you want something serious, then this is definitely not what you\'re looking for.Potemayo is cute, hilarious, wrong, anarchic, wierd, and lots of other things besides, and it puts many other shows to shame with it\'s simple approach to making the audience laugh.And now that\'s done, I\'m off to check the fridge...

It is still currently running, and two collected volumes are out in Japan.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.The manga adaptation was done by JC Staff (well-known for its work on Excel Saga and Revolutionary Girl Utena) and directed by Takeshi Ikehata (well-known for directing Genkishen).  It ran on Japanese TV from July 6th to September 21st of 2007, and has yet to be licensed Stateside.Story:...Ah, how to attempt to describe Potemayo?Well, one morning, a middle school boy Sunao Moriyama is getting breakfast, and opens his refrigerator door to find a chibi girl with pink and yellow hair, cat ears, and a rabbit tail, who can't say anything other than &quot;Honi!&quot;, and is cuteness personified.  He decides to adopt it, and names her Potemayo.  Later in the day, while he's at school, his refrigerator spawns another chibi girl, this one with purple hair, a scythe, and hair clips that shoot laser beams.  She has a tendency to slice things apart with her scythe, and then put them back together with duct tape.  She ends up getting adopted by one of Moriyama's classmates, Kyou, who gives her treats and dubs her Guchuko, and she shows her thanks by leaving dead carcasses of animals on the girl's desk.The series more or less follows the daily life of Sunao and Potemayo, and Guchuko and Kyou, along with their classmates.This series can best be summed up as CUTE and CRACK.  The episodes are fifteen minutes each and, for the most part, standalones, with no real continuing plot elements (except towards the end for a few episodes).It's really hard to describe Potemayo's humor, except that it's hilarious, and made of WIN.  It's something you have to see for yourself to understand, really.  This was a great pick-me-up during finals week, and had me laughing out loud quite a lot, which caused my roommate to look at me funny.  Definitely watch this if you're looking for a good laugh, or for simple, pure randomness.Art: Potemayo's art is really neat.  JC Staff uses the gradient shading that we saw in Red Garden to great effect, and the backgrounds are done in watercolor, and actually look quite nice.  And it goes without saying that the character designs are excellent.  I dare you to look at Potemayo or Guchuko and not go, &quot;D'AWW!&quot;.Music: The background music for this is fairly standard for a comedy series, and doesn't stand out all that much.  It's not miserable, though.  Same goes for the ED.  The OP is absolutely adorable and singable, though, and is quickly climbing the play count list on my iPod.Seiyuu: I applaud Potemayo and Guchuko's seiyuu (Kana Hanazawa and Ayumi Tsuji); they managed to get the full range of emotions and convey their characters' feelings when the range of their lines is, at most, two or three words.  And the other seiyuu do an excellent job as well.Length: Potemayo clocks in at twelve episodes (which, with two fifteen-minute episodes per full half-hour episode, comes out to twenty-four episodes).  This ends up being perfect, as if they had pushed this any farther, it probably would've started to get stale.Specials: To date, Potemayo has three special episodes, which are the normal length.  They succeed in situations that are even crackier than they were in the series, though they probably could've fit these episodes in at some point in the series if they really wanted to.  Ah, well, though.Overall: A cute and cracky pick-me-up with a neat art style.  Watch this.

A big cast with some really memorable characters.Enjoyment:Hell of a lot of enjoyment.Conclusion:If you took the time to read this review or even skim it, you have plenty of time to at least try the first episode. This anime will win you over with just the first episode. The best opinion is your own so dont hesitate yo try it out."", ""Potemayo was a comedic manga strip by Ogataya Haruka. In 2007, J.C. Staff. The studio behind Shakugan no Shana, Honey and Clover and Nodame Cantabile just to name the ones I've reviewed.) Now, they have done some really good comedies so it's entirely possible that this could be highly amusing. Of course, it's also possible that this is a major blemish on their production history. Let's take a look and see which is more accurate.Story:The titular Potemayo is a strange creature that emerged from the refrigerator of our protagonist, Moriyama Sunao, for no apparent reason. She starts following him to school and getting into...shenanigans. Things are further complicated when a second creature, Guchuko, cuts her way out of his fridge with a scythe. This isn't one of those comedic series that even attempts to have any kind of narrative. Rather, it's an absurdest comedy about Potemayo and Guchiko being around a group of strange people and engaging in hijinks. So, how does the comedy hold up?There are quite a few funny moments, especially the Guchiko scenes. The series has a lot of energy put into it as well. The problem is that they're outnumbered by scenes that aren't funny. The series uses a lot of puerile humour involving bodily fluids and excrement because mucus and poop are gross and, therefore, must be hilarious. The humour involving romance is also a huge problem, being more unpleasant than actually amusing. We've got gay jokes and jokes about brothers who have more than just a familial interest in their sisters. You may commence eye-rolling.Characters:The characters are mostly adequate for a comedic work. Most of the major characters do interact well for comedic purposes even if they aren't particularly well developed or fleshed out. The issue is that some of the characters are used primarily or entirely in a very narrow way for jokes that are terrible. Nene's brothers, Yasumi, Kaouru and Mudou all fall into this category.Art:The art is pretty bad and I'm not just saying that because it's in the hyper chibified style that I'm not a fan of in general. The backgrounds are really blank. The character expressions are minimal, and I would love to know how characters with glasses manage to keep them on when no one has a nose, and actions are frequently animated sloppily.Sound:They did get some really good actors for this series. Unfortunately, most of them don't give their best performances. Kitamura Eri, who played Sayaka in Madoka and Saya in Blood+, puts virtually no emotion in her role. Tsuji Ayumi and Hanazawa Kana deliver their lines primarily in grunts. Which does make sense given that they're playing abnormal creatures who aren't human, but it still isn't conducive to strong showings. Kugimiya Rie plays two roles, much like she did in Bleach as Nemu and Karin. One of those roles is fine. The other, Nene, is really painfully high-pitched and hurts your ears. The music is pretty decent overall.Ho-yay:There's certainly a bit. Kaouru has a romantic interest in Mudou, which is played for laughs as a running joke because... gay people exist. Yeah, that's his character's entire “joke.” There are also a few scenes where things get homo-erotic between Kyou and Nene, but they're relegated to a single episode and played as a joke. So, the ho-yay factor is going to be a 5/10.Final Thoughts:Potemayo has some things going for it. The scenario is creative with plenty of comedic potential and it does give a few laughs. Unfortunately, those funny moments are over-shadowed by the decidedly unfunny puerile and unpleasant moments. The art is pretty awful and the voice acting is below average.  All in all, I would only really recommend it for people who find human excretions funny or who can tolerate the problematic scenes in order to reach those moments that are legitimately funny. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. I've got quite the queue of requests going into August with some of them being really long. We've got Dragonball, Gintama, Claymore, Welcome to the NHK, Mawaru Penguindrum & Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Next week won't be any of them since they're all too long for me to finish in a week, but I'll have the Dragonball review up as soon as I can.

Based on the attitude or feel of the show, I can't point out any factors that I necessarily disliked. It's more like I can only point out what was left to be desired.  Then again, I never watched the specials, so maybe those could fill in the holes left in my heart when I finished watching the 12th episode.Potemayo is basically about a dude who wakes up to find an adorable yet odd creature in his refrigerator, and with this creature he...decides to continue living his everyday life. Comedy and Cuteness ensue.This show isn't moving in any general direction, mind you. As in, there isn't really much of a story to base a discussion on. It's simply a slice of life.

Total waste of time.The visuals are pretty, with smooth and life-like animation as well as pleasing character designs. It also showcases some cool-looking futuristic archival technology. However, while better than average, the visuals are not groundbreaking -- easily surpassed by 5cm Per Second and its ilk. They are also repetitive.Plot is thin, derivative and not particularly well presented. The characters are unengaging and underdeveloped. Dialogue and soundtrack are forgettable. Moreover, the pacing is self-indulgently, navel-gazingly slow, making this piece boring despite its short duration. ', '=====Story=====“In the sky, there is no distinction of east and west; people create distinctions out of their own minds and then believe them to be true.”-BuddahThe audience opens their eyes to a set of wrought iron stairs, coiling about a brilliant pillar of golden light. It illuminates the dreary recesses of this world, the rusting iron,  the sluggish gait of the excavators leaving their cubicles. This is the fate of mankind, stuffed into the interiors of the planet because the surface has rotted away from overpopulation. At least it’s not global warming that dooms us, Pale Cacoon predicts it’s a lack of protection....My fascination was pulled into the dank crypt of Ura and Riko, the two leads, as Pale Cocoon toys with many concepts. Environmentalism and population pollution are obvious themes but only scratch the surface. More interestingly, the narrative asks whether the past is on any use when there is no escape from your present? The theme is expanded as the characters are asked to question their reality and prove to themselves the sky of once-upon-a-time is truly gone. It’s ambitious, aiming for annals of philosophical abstraction even with its twenty-three minute scope. It’s grand but it has a humble foundation; Most of the story is driven by the interaction of Ura and Riko and their diverging opinions on the archaeology of history. Their friendship is both unnatural and snug, a love-hate push and pull that’s intriguing and advances the plot. It’s the small nuances of this relationship that make Pale Cocoon a moving experience, and the revelations of the final minutes that make it phenomenal.=====Art=====Dilapidated never looked so pretty. Seamlessly integrated CGI and artwork come together to form a visual masterpiece. Lines are clear and crisp, serving as frames for the cell shaded images. These set pieces are filled in with an appropriately post-apocalyptic palette. Soiled  browns and  sooty grays swathed in the pale light of computer screens. Swashes of neon green burn dimly in the underground bunkers as the workers return with their zombie-like strut. It’s a mechanical world that inspires both sadness from its poor condition and awe from the technical beauty the artist took effort in creating.=====Sound=====Both grand and haunting, the soundtrack for Pale Cocoon is exceptional. It draws from different genres, a classical back bone of pianos and violins, layered by electronic horns. It even delves into Pop, a guest appearance by Little Moa, who solos a powerful ballad. The voice acting is just as impressive; Ura’s delivery devoid of most emotion while Kiko’s inflections delivers insight into her sorrow. Like the rest of the film the sound is handled spectacularly.=====Characters=====From such a short film you can’t expect much development, but the two leads Ura and Kiko have surprising depth. Ura is an excavator, swimming through seas of binary code day by day to figure out the world that was. He’s passionate, teetering on the edge of obsession when it comes to the past, tirelessly trudging through the 0s and 1s, saving what he finds interesting. But he is curiously detached from Riko, the analyzer, a friend of his. Riko has stopped showing up to work favoring the bleak company of emptied stairs. She sprawls herself across the grate looking up into the dark retreat, pondering.  The anagnorisis of both characters not only speaks volumes about each of them but the world they are living in. In the brief time we see their conceptions of the world change, Ura finally maturing and Kiko gaining a bit of optimism.=====Overall.=====Pale Cocoon brings together excellent storytelling and production to create a miniature gem. Its easy to get lost and not realize that the program is over. It deserves a watch by any fan that believes anime should be more than entertainment but art.  Pale Cocoon does what most animation doesn’t: provoke my imagination. Just as Riko gazed up into shadows I was left contemplating my dimmed screen.

Just as Riko gazed up into shadows I was left contemplating my dimmed screen.', '[This review contains a few minor spoilers]The OVA has a fairly straightforward message: that Earth and its beauty is irreplaceable, even by the most advanced of technologies. In the dark, gray world the characters live in, the only faint resemblance to earth among all the steel is a color -- green. The characters keep going down the levels of their own world to live closer to a fake green - the ""ocean"" -, yet all they ever do is lose themselves even more amid all the machinery. In the end, when one of the characters finally gets to see something natural he realizes just how...little he knows about what the world used to be. His very own definition of natural is changed, the last word of the OVA echoing that thought.Theme-wise it is an interesting OVA, but a good theme alone does not make a great anime. Taking care of our planet and home being irreplaceable are things that have been talked about for decades and using a grim tone to approach the subject seems self-contradictory. Instead of celebrating the life of the celestial body we inhabit, the OVA decides to persist on the idea of human stupidity and irresponsibility. It paints humans as undeserving of the perfect Earth, turning the relationship between them and the environment something almost divine-like in its depiction. The case can be also made that showing human failure and sorrow makes the point more memorable, so how much someone likes or dislikes the OVAs take on the issue it presents will be up to personal preference.All that being said, whether I agree or not with what the anime presented does not make the way it presented it any less good. Pale Cocoon is very dull and claustrophobic, but that was its purpose all along. The animation does a good job of creating those feelings when the music does just as good of a job undermining the entire work. On the flip side, the same thing which makes it good also makes it bad when we are presented with CG that often times feels to be in all the wrong places (for example, when the screen pans over CG wires laid over a CG desk). Yet, once again, despite the shortcomings of the animation, the music is the only truly awful aspect of it, with a song towards the end of Pale Cocoon serving as the lowest point of a mediocre score that makes itself far too noticeable.Pale Cocoon is a good watch for the people who don\'t mind meaning over enjoyment, but unfortunately I\'m not one of those people. Although it does feel like almost everything in it serves a purpose, it is one of the least enjoyable things I\'ve watched in a long time, and therefore not worthy of a rewatch, regardless of how well it may explore a theme or how many hidden meanings it may have. little he knows about what the world used to be.

Our main protagonist Ura is an excavator who recovers lost archives containing facts including: images, audio and video footage from the beautiful world where humanity once existed. He is the last excavator as the rest of them (including our female lead Riko) had been disgusted by how their ancestors came to destroy that beautiful world and decided against digging up more facts as it would only sadden them further. Ura...one day uncovers an archive that could change his perception of the world forever.Pale cocoon is a good example of where humanity could be heading in the near-distant future with the continuation of war, high levels of pollution and over population. Ura one of the last excavators to remain recovering the lost archives and most likely the last human in this colony to still be enthusiastic about uncovering those lost facts. Ura goes through the daily motion of uncovering new archives containing things such as photos of animals and green land, his friend Riko who gives her thoughts that recovering lost information was a stupid thing for them to do. The two have conflicted opinions as Ura believes there is still hope that the world will be restored to what it once was. Whilst Riko has excepted mankind’s fate of being destructive leading their generation to the life of the underground colony.Ura and Riko are the only two main characters and get good development in such a short time as the movie comes to a climax they both have their thoughts and feelings about the world and state that mankind has gotten themselves into changed drastically. As Ura has learned that the world is not what he had hoped it to be “its blue” (Ura had hoped that there would still be parts of earth with green land, such as fields with cattle). Riko had given up on mankind and believed that they would never redeem themselves, but she later discovers that in the midst of the destruction that there is always a glimmer of hope. Their personalities are very conflicting and it’s surprising that they can be friends despite their differences on the state of humanity.The style of pale cocoon can be comparable to the work of Makoto Shinkai. As the character designs were very plain and simple but the background looks stunning. As I said previously it’s very much like the works of Makoto Shinkai.  The sound is very futuristic and sweet throughout, its not the greatest OST but is good nevertheless.The downside of this short anime film is that there isn't enough time to elaborate on the story, such as how this generation managed to get forced into an underground facility. Was it pollution that caused it? Was it war? I would like to have known the specific reason for them all living underground. I didn't fully understand what Ura was thinking after he saw the video, did he conform with the rest and have hatred for the current generations new life underground? and was he going to stop digging up archives and acknowledge that the world may never be what it once was?  A few things I would have liked to know for certain, but it doesn't take away much from how good this movie was.This anime short was very good telling of humanity’s downfall and the state that the next generation were left in, the story is very straightforward with two contrasting opinions on the earth and the future of humanity, followed by their eyes being opened to knew information found in archives. The animation is very good but character designs could have been majorly improved. This work is very similar to the likes of Makoto Shinkai and maybe that’s what the creator attempted to mirror the anime around. He did a great job of this anime short and I would give this a definite recommendation to the fans of post-apocalyptic and science fiction genres.Thanks for reading, have a good day/night. one day uncovers an archive that could change his perception of the world forever.Pale cocoon is a good example of where humanity could be heading in the near-distant future with the continuation of war, high levels of pollution and over population.

Their personalities are very conflicting and it’s surprising that they can be friends despite their differences on the state of humanity.The style of pale cocoon can be comparable to the work of Makoto Shinkai. As the character designs were very plain and simple but the background looks stunning. As I said previously it’s very much like the works of Makoto Shinkai.  The sound is very futuristic and sweet throughout, its not the greatest OST but is good nevertheless.The downside of this short anime film is that there isn't enough time to elaborate on the story, such as how this generation managed to get forced into an underground facility. Was it pollution that caused it? Was it war? I would like to have known the specific reason for them all living underground. I didn't fully understand what Ura was thinking after he saw the video, did he conform with the rest and have hatred for the current generations new life underground? and was he going to stop digging up archives and acknowledge that the world may never be what it once was?  A few things I would have liked to know for certain, but it doesn't take away much from how good this movie was.This anime short was very good telling of humanity’s downfall and the state that the next generation were left in, the story is very straightforward with two contrasting opinions on the earth and the future of humanity, followed by their eyes being opened to knew information found in archives. The animation is very good but character designs could have been majorly improved. This work is very similar to the likes of Makoto Shinkai and maybe that’s what the creator attempted to mirror the anime around. He did a great job of this anime short and I would give this a definite recommendation to the fans of post-apocalyptic and science fiction genres.Thanks for reading, have a good day/night."", 'Spoilers, read only afterwards.Theme:Pale Cocoon is less about environmentalism and more about the preservation of our history and truth. The humans stuck on the terraformed moon gave up the on excavating the ruins of Earth because they thought they could never return to their mother planet. Faced with the past of knowing and understanding that their ancestors ruined themselves and the future, the excavators rather resign themselves to ignorance and forget, only burrowing themselves further downwards rather then accepting the bitter truth and seeking the origins.The main character refuses to give in to this nihilistic ignorance, he clings desperately to the fading truth as...the rest have abandoned it. He is the embodiment of the historian spirit, who uncovers no matter how dire and bleak.  Even though in the end he dies without being able to reveal the new world, Pale Cocoon ends in an awe inspiring scene that offers a hope to those unwilling to compromise the truth.Perspective:Pale Cocoon\'s message of uncovering the truth is heavily dependent on the motif of perspective. The sham view that they are still living on Earth gets slowly dismantled by subtle acts of digital camera work. The video is flipped, backwards and pictures of nature in the background are in awkward, misleading angles, suggesting that the way that we are viewing the situation is incorrect. Both the main character and viewer reach an epiphany that where we are can control what we think. The use of equivocation in the usage of ""Sea"" also shows how easily our understanding can be faulty. Pale Cocoon tries to show how we be so easily tricked by presuppositions of our vantage point instead of looking at things critically.  One great piece of  camera usage is when the view backs out until we look at the characters through the monitor; hinting at the reverse nature of it. ""What was she looking at?""Other Thoughts:Yasuhiro Yoshiura is oftentimes put as a Shinkai wannabe. That is lazy and demeaning to both directors and mostly to the one who said it. The motifs, stylistic elements and story message of the two are vastly different and focus on different emotions. Yasuhiro, from his three works focuses on society and its evolution through the ignorance while Shinkai does his work on mono no aware theme of drifting personal relationships.

I understand that it has a compelling narrative that asks us to ponder slightly more philosophical questions than usual, like what the value of the past is, for example, and what makes it worth revisiting. Our protagonist doesn't know why he enjoys researching the past, but at one point he suspects that it helps him to avoid reality. One fellow archaeologist thinks it's too painful to see what humankind had lost, and to witness the course of human stupidity, thus ends up quitting.Hmm, our new and talented director is yet another pessimist...come from university? Surprise, surprise. I think my synopsis says it all, she can't bear to watch the course of “human stupidity.” It is another smug liberal, bent on thinking that humankind is doomed to failure and that the environment will strike back on our weak and pathetic species. If only mankind had paid attention to what these college-bred liberals were saying, if only we'd changed our arrogant ways and accepted the obvious truth, then we might have been saved. You might think you are picking up a bit of resentment here, damn right you are!I am sick of all this doom and gloom crap, and enviro-fatalism is just one other strain of academic sickness that the world has thankfully proven itself immune to. As long as books have been sold and positions hired on fatalism, so has the human legacy proven resistant to any foretold demolition. Surprise, we don't live underground yet. In 15 years, the cocksure college-bred cynics will be once again shown up by the tenacity of the human spirit, we will still live where we please (though probably still on earth), and a new generation of doom will replace the enviro-fatalists, who replaced the nuclear-fatalists, who replaced the totalitarian-fatalists, and so on.Besides the oh so deep setting though, stands a well crafted story that effectively makes use of the 25 minutes given to it. It skims a philosophical issue in the midst of feeling sorry for mankind and propagating a dingy atmosphere, effectively using music and art to make this atmosphere.What this OVA reminded me a lot of is Voices of a Distant Star. Suffice to say our director and writer Yoshiura Yasuhiro has followed in Shinkai Makoto's footsteps in taking on the majority of the duties himself, throwing himself heart and soul into a low-budget melancholic vignette lacking true depth but desperately clinging onto a veneer of profundity. Thanks to very good music and artwork, this approach is surprisingly effective, and I personally would rate it above Voices.The 2D and 3D animation is not quite as good as some of the reviewers think. The best blend of 2D and 3D I've ever seen is the new evangelion, and this doesn't compare at all. It is quite an erratic camera, not really helping the atmosphere, just zooming around like a toy in the hands of a kindergartner. The 2D vs the 3D is a bit unintentionally jarring, and the 3D really does come across like playing with software, not like serious filmwork. Maybe it just needed more budget, just like most OVAs that dabble in this third dimension.Summary: Typical enviro-fatalist plot gives veneer of depth to a piece consisting of great art and music, yet amateurish camerawork and jarring mixtures of 2D and 3D. come from university?

Before we knew it, humans were living in this world.”‘Pale Cocoon’ is a poignant account of a distant future when the beautiful earth inhabited by the living has been ruined due to the stupidity of the mankind itself, leading the planet to be barren and uninhabitable, and humans to migrate to a supposedly ‘artificial colony’. The blue sky, the vast tracts of greenery and the flora are nothing more than bitter memories of homeland. On the colony, there is the Excavation Department whose sole purpose of existence is to retrieve digitally...recorded information of the planet. Ura, a young man, is a member of the Department who is quite enthused to restore the lost data. On the contrary, Riko is a young woman who has lost all her hopes and doesn’t show much enthusiasm in the restoration as she is driven by the feeling that reminiscing about something that has been lost and possibly won’t come back will only be a reminder of the stupidity of humans and bring forth sorrow.This OVA had a profound effect on me and it is certainly going to stay in the back of my mind for a long time. It is brilliantly presented without it resorting to too much complexity as most of the works with the sci-fic tag tend to be. It is indeed remarkable how it has accomplished to be this impressive in its short duration of 23 minutes. Everything is incredible in my opinion, be it the plot, the art or the soundtracks. Yoshiura Yasuhiro, the writer and the director, has done a brilliant job with both the scripting and the direction. He doesn’t bluntly give away details of what’s going on to the viewers; rather he expects the viewers to understand themselves through the actions of the characters and the surroundings. Viewers in the beginning are made to have a vague idea of something and as everything gradually unfolds, they are made to realize that they were wrong in the first place and it’s actually some other way round. If you have watched the OVA, you probably know what I mean.I’d like to conclude this review by saying that ‘Pale Cocoon’ is something that you should definitely watch if you haven’t yet. Some of you may have difficulty understanding what is going on in the beginning but don’t let that be a reason for you to turn it down. It gets better after some time. It stirs bitter sweet feelings in you and makes you nostalgic. It comes forth as yet another reminder of destruction and misery awaiting the mankind. I was trying to be critical and rate it 9 but I just couldn’t bring myself to do that. So, a perfect 10/10 score for this beautiful piece of work. recorded information of the planet.

The visuals are impressive but there's not much else here folks.The plot is simple – the world got polluted, so they moved everyone to a giant web-like series of structures in order to survive. Ura and Riko work in the archive recovery and analysis departments, and are basically the only two left – their jobs are to go through records of what the surface was like and then analyze them. That’s it – they don’t do anything...else other than sit around and talk about society and how pointless they do, or don’t, think their jobs are. Of course, there’s a ‘spark’, something that triggers a real conflict of sorts, but it’s resolved in two montages divided by boredom, and it never really resolves anything. The implications of the final reveal are never explained, nor is it stated that they have any impact whatsoever. So, basically the entire struggle was pointless. Why did I decide to watch this again? 4/10The art style is good and purposefully done completely in shades of grey – it feels less like the characters are wearing grey clothing and more like the light’s been filtered to give everything a desaturated look. You can still see hints of color in clothing and hair when they’re in different lighting. It’s a delightfully eerie effect, and the visuals would be far more impressive without two glaring flaws – the transitions where it seem slike you’re reading a book, and the mysterious white snow-like material that’s perpetually falling down in the open sections of the compound. It looks pretty, but even a single line commenting on it to give it some context would be most appreciated.The layout of the office blocks makes them into gigantic cube-shapes, with individual cubicles mirroring the format. There’s a simultaneous sense of vertigo and claustrophobia, which by itself is pretty impressive. 8/10.The sound design is awful, at 3:10 the music picks up and it’s the auditory equivalent to being stabbed in the ears with needles. I turned the volume WAY down to go back and confirm the time, and blissfully the screeching subsides after a minute but it bounces right back again for a while. The art style favors silence, which makes the scenes even more disconcerting. I was going to write it off completely until 16:42, at which point the music becomes extraordinarily good. Unfortunately, it’s too little, too late, and the first five minutes of the film will put you in a bad mood for the next ten. 5/10.The short film’s duals themes of ignorance and ennui meld together to ask a singular question – is there any point in knowing the past if you have no future? It’s this issue that Ura and Riko passive-agressively fight over, Ura believing that the past world is worth remembering, while Riko finds the pursuit meaningless. This serves as basically their entire personality, and I found myself extremely bored of the characters after a few minutes. The complete lack of dynamic traits made it feel like I was watching two robots talk at each other – and while this might have been the intention, a complete lack of emotion does not a character make. So for characterization, it gets a 4/10.Did I enjoy Pale Cocoon? Not really. Without bringing any other media into context for comparison, it still doesn't stand up on its own. The challenges presented are rendered meaningless because they're resolved seemingly effortlessly, and are merely time consuming. The art style starts to seriously get to you after a while, and the blank faces of the characters make them very difficult to empathize with. Overall it's just a mess - a beautiful mess, but a mess none the less. 4/10Watching Pale Cocoon is a lot like Ura's work - it's easy, boring, occasionally annoying, but ultimately your worst obstacle is just getting bored and giving up. I really wanted to like this short - sci-fi with a tinge of mystery is basically my favorite thing ever - but try as I might, only the lighting and architectural design of the complex gave it any redeeming value. Bottom line - it's not worth your time, and that's a pity. else other than sit around and talk about society and how pointless they do, or don’t, think their jobs are.

The premise is strong, the synopsis is enticing, but right from the outset the OVA is a huge disappointment. It may even be best to just not watch it at all, and save the idea being dragged down by this result.In the interest of parity, there are some positives to mention. The OVA has a type of confined brutalist architecture that goes a long way towards setting the tone, and some of the visuals are actually rather memorable, particularly...by the end. That being said, and more crucially that being all, its not enough to claw the quality back up.----Pale Cocoon has a very vague story, in that the actual instigating element doesn't really get dealt with. It is literally shelved until later, leading to a lot of plotless, aimless time over the first half of the OVA. Right by the end, though, there is something in the realm of a twist, without revealing too much of course. It's not the sort to redefine everything that came before, but it's at least a tiny bit interesting.The characters do not get the same sort of boost in the final act. Neither or the leads have any sort of personality, and I wouldn't even call either one-note since there isn't a single defining feature between them. The presence of side characters is arguable, being as there is only a voice on the phone and another who never directly interacts with the main duo. Following suit, neither is developed either.----And now the directing and animation, which are an utter travesty. It appears the staff have taken every opportunity to animate as little of the OVA as possible, then attempted to fill in the gaps with inexpert panning shots over 3D set pieces. The result is equal parts laughable and nauseating. The most actually drawn movement that can be spotted is the occasional moving of an arm, but even these are sparse, scattered around what are essentially just still images of characters sitting or standing around. With all other technical elements, there is nothing to say. There's a mediocre song that plays diegetically, the designs are garbage and the art is poor.----Pale Cocoon, then, is just a failure on every front, but it especially damns itself on that of production. It may not completely deserve to be forgotten, but it could only help its image, frankly.I can't think of some way to improve it as I normally try to, since this just isn't enough to bother with. by the end.

The story is tremendously intresting. The Earth, in a undefined future, is protected from man, now they live under the ground, so the planet can survive. A man and a woman are the main protagonists. They both work on a department designed to research about how the surface was. This department is almost dead, there are only two working there. The empty offices indicate that once, there were many doing this job. Now, our protagonist is...the only one that still have any intrest in what the past holds. His friend intends to quit.I realy liked how the protagonist looked so obssed about descovering the past(wich is our time). It realy seemd like a possible future, humans living underground to mantain the planet safe.The art in Pale Cocoon is wonderful. A great mix between the regular 2D characters and the sometimes 3D backgrond. The character design is simplistic, not contaning the strange look that is so present in Shonen. The realism imprinted in the look of the characters just reminds us that the OVA is serious and is not directed to the general anime public.I dont have much to say about the sound. Nothing realy remarcable. In the middle of the episode, there is a music video, but i did not love it. Its just not bad.The characters are intresting. They have their own convictions, wich is nice, makes them a lot more likeble. They have names, i just can remeber right now. The male protagonist is a mad guy. Mad by discovery and obssed by the old Earth. The female protagonist is hard to define. She seems friendly, but without hope. A serious woman. They are both well developt as far as the 23 minutes allow.I really liked Pale Cocoon, its a remarcable piece of diamond, that few will have the pleasure to find it. Its such an unknown work. And at the end, you might want to take a time and think a little. You will have to collect all the clues to solve the case, as the man did. If you did, at the end, youll have a pleasent surprise.Overall, those 23 minutes were well spent, at least for me. If you are not really into more filosophical series, you might prefer to watch an action anime, otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the beuty that this OVA provides. the only one that still have any intrest in what the past holds.

They are both well developt as far as the 23 minutes allow.I really liked Pale Cocoon, its a remarcable piece of diamond, that few will have the pleasure to find it. Its such an unknown work. And at the end, you might want to take a time and think a little. You will have to collect all the clues to solve the case, as the man did. If you did, at the end, youll have a pleasent surprise.Overall, those 23 minutes were well spent, at least for me. If you are not really into more filosophical series, you might prefer to watch an action anime, otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the beuty that this OVA provides.', 'As I am finishing this anime, I can only feel the sickening sensation of disgust invading my body as I frown upon our future.  This near prophetic anime is a true work of art, its beauty is incomparable in its art and its message. a 23 minutes you absolutely want to see, even if you do not agree that it is almost the fate that awaits us.the story 9/10: pale cocoon offers a deep and complex story that is an absolute must see, it pictures the dilemma of a man having a complex choice to make, satisfy his quest for knowledge of the...old world or let the matter rest, since everyone has realized the massacre the humans caused, and move on. It is definitively one of the best spent 23 minutes of my life as it pushed its audience to reflect on the matters at hand.Plus it offers a wonderful plot twist in the end. you have no reason to miss this, go watch it now.the art (10/10): it is astonishing, the simplicity and wonder of this art can only be described as breathtaking, especially since the anime had a very small budget. if only all the anime would take pale cocoon as an example, the world would be a better place.sound: (9/10): the voice acting was actually pretty neat considering again the very low budget of the anime. the music and the sounds were very satisfying and always well placed, i was surprised by the repetitive use of silence and how well it complemented the anime.characters (9/10): even if the characters are pretty much irrelevant, we get more content about them in 23 mins than a lot of other anime in a whole season. they gave us some nice background and helped to unfold the plot so perfectly.enjoyment: 9/10: I have enjoyed this anime so much, even in its restricted length, it procured a very appreciable thrill and forced me to think about many problems to come and some already existing. it was definitively a magnificent OVA, and I suggest this anime for everyone.overall : 9/10: in the end, Pale cocoon exceeded my expectations and will remain one of my favorite OVAs forever, it was intelligent, satisfying and as I have said, almost prophetic. go watch it now, its 23 mins of your life you will not regret. old world or let the matter rest, since everyone has realized the massacre the humans caused, and move on.

Honestly, it\'s a single twenty two minute long episode, that\'s it, there is absolutely no reason to not just go and watch it. But I can\'t write a review where I tell you to just go watch it yourself without giving you any information (court ordered, it\'s a long story) so without further ado here\'s my review of Pale Cocoon:Story 10/10: The plot of Pale Cocoon is set in a post-apocalyptic world where it is concluded that earth is now a dead world, brown and completely lifeless....Humans all live in an artificially created earth, which at this point is also pretty close to being dead. The main plot revolves around two characters in this near dead facility, they work as archivists working on restoring any information on the old world they can find in order to store it (any information they can find, ranging from historical records all the way to pictures of green fields,) and one day they come across a strange broken record they try to restore. The further it gets into the plot however several of the characters begin to question, what\'s the point of it all, why find and store information about things that no longer and never again will exist for no apparent reasons. The whole bleakness of the world is presented so wonderfully though the story that you will get completely sucked into it, you may even be a bit depressed, but at the same time you will be so moved by it all. Without no doubt, the plot is an absolute masterpiece.Art 10/10: When it comes to anime there is one thing that is almost set in stone for me, ""3D bad! 2D good!"" Well I used to believe that (and for the most part I doubt anything else will make me change my view) but Pale Cocoon has shown me that if you use it right, 3D in anime can be used well, hell in this case it\'s beautiful. Pale cocoon uses 3D backgrounds and 2D characters, and the backgrounds are used wonderfully, they help you get a better understanding for just how dreary this world really is, which is incredibly important to the plot itself, trust me when I say your eyes will be drinking this like it\'s a glass of some of the finest wine ever created.Sound 10/10: I hate sounding like a broken record, but this anime is forcing my hand. Nothing bad can be said about the sound, it\'s presented exactly at the right times, it always fits the scene perfect. By the time the song near the end begins to play you\'ll be so deep into the story that hearing a song in this depressing world will be just so damned moving you\'ll be fighting back tears.Characters 10/10: Damn you Pale Cocoon! Give me one thing, just one thing to hate or even mildly dislike about you so I can write something that seems more like an actual review rather then just a ""I love this"" rant! Pale Cocoon has one interesting thing about it, it has almost no characters at all. Generally a show will have somewhere between 1-3 main focus characters and then a whole slew of around 20 secondary characters. Pale Cocoon has, in total, only 3 characters (4 if you count the girl in the recording,) one central protagonist who works in the archives, his female co-worker, and the man on the intercom who also seems to work in the archives (and he\'s only an extremely minor background character.) The characters aren\'t even given names! So you\'re probably assuming ""only three characters and they aren\'t even named? Well I guess this aspect of the OVA sucks"" and you are wrong. The characters (well the two main ones at least) and fleshed out incredibly well considering this show is only one episode. We can actually understand their points of views, their feelings and idea\'s, I dare say the characters were done better in 22 minutes then many characters are done in series that last for 3 seasons.Enjoyment 10/10: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-!!!!!! Another 10 out of god damn 10! Would you give me a break! Give me find some flaw to criticize! Just one, that\'s all I ask for! As I\'ve stated above, you will get completely sucked into the story, the sound and art are simply beautiful, and there characters are wonderfully developed. Trust me when I say you will enjoy every second of Pale Cocoon.Overall 10/10: I have never to this day, and will almost with absolute certainty never again give any review I ever make a perfect score. However, I have to give this one, perhaps it\'s because Pale Cocoon is so short I can give it this. With a long several episode series you can always find things to dislike about it, but this OVA doesn\'t give you the opportunity. All in all, Pale Cocoon is  the most beautiful anime I have ever watched. It\'s only a single episode long, 22 minutes, if you have time to read this review you have time to watch it, so do just that, you will not regret it.

In just 23 minutes, Yasuhiro Yoshiura does what most fail to do in 23 hours: makes a fascinating and original point, and does it while telling a great story. Many will inevitably compare this to Voices of a Distant Star, another ambitious 20 minute sci-fi film, but unlike its well-known peer Pale Cocoon is far more than flashy production values. This is short storytelling at its finest, and its only fault is leaving you wishing there were more.At first glance, the film could be interpreted as just another environmental tale of woe. And in...part, it is, several times emphasizing that humanity’s deplorable condition is its own doing, the product of run-away population growth and, presumably, global warming. But this environmental point is only secondary, and Yoshiura’s primary claim is far more universal. This is a film about the importance of pursuing historical knowledge, even when our past is demoralizing and seems irrelevant to our present condition.With just two characters and minimal interaction, Yoshiura shows us the two outlooks on history one might take, and the way our choice defines us. Ura is determined to continue his work in the archives, driven as much by a desire to know the past as a need to escape the present. Riko skips work to lounge in the stairs, resigned to humanity’s grim fate and tired of dwelling on its mistakes. Their strained relationship demonstrates how far their opposing perspectives have driven them apart. Ura is mesmerized as he reads a record of the past, dreaming of another world, while Riko looks on longingly, unable to reach him. The characters are, contrary to common criticism, remarkably well-developed and central to the story’s message. They are representations of how we as humans can understand our past, and how that in turn influences our present and future.Yoshiura’s other talent lies in making us assume what the characters assume based on their understanding of the past. By imbuing us with their point of view, he is able to deliver a twist that is not only mindblowing, but also drives home the story’s theme. Few will see the ending coming, and only those who take the time to piece together the puzzle will understand its brilliance and significance.The film’s commendable storyline is complemented by exceptional production values. The animation is bleak yet beautiful, a world of mechanical blacks and grays, where the only color comes from the photos of Earth Ura saves on his computer, or the Matrix-like green energy of the artificial colony. The soundtrack is small but surprisingly good and substantive for a short film. The opening theme is especially effective at creating a sci-fi atmosphere, and several of the other tracks, including the J-Pop ballad by Little Moa, are worth keeping. The voice acting is also quite good.There really is little that can be said against Pale Cocoon. Some may find it too slow or quiet, but that seems more a criticism of the genre than the particular work. Others have claimed the characters are too static and emotionless, but understood in light of the story’s message, I thought they were impressive creations. I will grant that the story would have benefitted from more time, particularly in terms of character development and explanation of the historical backdrop and present circumstances. The character designs were also a bit bland, and the ending was somewhat jumbled and rushed, which made it harder to follow. But as a short film, Pale Cocoon is exceptional, and it’s refreshing to see so much accomplished in so little time.

The art is very flat and simplistic, and the movement gets really choppy a few times, especially when panning over the computer screens. The sound isn’t bad overall, but it’s nothing special.To me, Pale Cocoon is at its best near the middle, when it shows you pictures of our new home and just builds the atmosphere.

Clocking in at around twenty three minutes, Pale Cocoon resembles a classic scifi short story: Short, sweet, with a nice punch. The setting is a post-apocalyptic future where people are excavating archives about the past world and their decaying life support equipment has forced them to retreat deeper into the massive amount of construction covering the surface of the planet. Since it\'s so short, it\'s difficult to say much more without major spoilers. The art style is engaging, the character development is solid, and the pacing is spot on.Also, the user...interfaces of the computer systems used by the researchers are fascinating to watch. A lot of thought went into their design and implementation. And I don\'t just mean their visual ""wow"" factor. They are very well conceived. A lot of modern software designers could stand to look at them for ideas. They are almost like little mini proof of concept and use case research projects.You can see a bit more of some of these interface concepts peeking around the edges of the studio\'s other major work, Time of Eve, which is an equally good science fiction series that takes a look at some of Asimov\'s robot concepts and gives them a distinctly Japanese/Anime spin.. interfaces of the computer systems used by the researchers are fascinating to watch.

Normally It's painful just to sit through the first episode of an anime, but this manages to hold what is up to 5 animes worth of goings ons.

Humanity has retreated to the moon to await earths revival which is to be solely aided by the sun and...lack of humans.For someone looking to sit and think about existence and irreversible faults, this is perfect.

Motto To LOVE-Ru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9181/Motto_To_LOVE-Ru,"[""I personally love ''To LOVE-Ru'' and the new Motto To LOVE-Ru. In the first season it's a story about the girl called Lala, which apparently met Yuuki Rito in the washroom. Lala wants to get married to Yuuki due to his kindness from saving her multiple times. However, Motto To LOVE-Ru gets more interesting. They add numerous random scenes per episode. It really isn't a story that relates to each episode, but it's a different way of telling the story. I'm reading the manga on a daily basic. So far it kind of matches up, but not a lot. I recommend this type of anime...to people that like ecchi, romance, and comedy.Story (8/10)Each story has a new problem towards nearly all the characters in the story. The story is getting more into the comedy section, such as when Yuuki is turned into a dog, because Lala inventions. He also had to lick every part of Haruna's body, because Haruna's dog said so! (cough even a dog is perverted). Yuuki in season two is more developed and more mature then he was in season one. Yuuki quoted, ''The most important thing is not the outside, but the inside''. (Cough that's what she said xD), sounds wrong at first but he is more kind, and generous towards the girls now in season two. I also like how Golden Darkness or (aka) Yami! is developing feelings toward Yuuki. Even though she has a mission to kill him, she is seeing how good of a person Yuuki is. Overall the story is made for comedy, so far not a lot of intense or serious episodes/scenes. So far I'm more interested how the relationship between Yuuki and Lala develops.-Yami Forever!-Art (9/10)The art was a lot better then the first season when i compared both. The color and the design was nearly perfect, except for the white blocking. The white blocking or white flash is used for blocking the parts of the story where its too Ecchi or perverted. If they could take out that white flash, then i would of gave the art 10/10, and it would make a lot of people happy. Overall i though art was well done.Character (10/10)Most characters in season one changed either physically or mentally. Lala is getting more out of hands, using her inventions and making them. Yami is now not that aggressive as she was in season one. She is more kind and is trying new things, also Yami is maybe.. Liking Yuuki to a certain degree. I think Yami has a crush on Yuuki Rito, because she usually blushes when shes near him or when his helping her. Haruna and Yui is developing feeling for Yuuki. Such as, when Yui was sick, Yuuki came to deliver some paperwork, but there stay was longer then expected. Haruna is showing more that she likes Yuuki, but she really hasn't confess to him yet in season two. Overall i like how the characters are much different from season one, but not too different. They added some changes that i personally love.Enjoyment (10/10)I enjoyed season one, but season two is where the action and comedy steps in. It makes me laugh much more then usually, also there is more ecchi scenes in season two which adds some kick! I'm also enjoying how each character is starting to develop a feeling towards Yuuki Rito. I personally enjoyed the first eight episodes so far and hope it gets better forward. Why i watch Motto To LOVE-Ru is because of Golden Darkness/Yami, because shes so CUTE! and starting to have feelings toward Yuuki!.My Dislikes and ConsMy dislikes for Motto to LOVE-Ru is waiting for the new episodes.I hope you enjoy this review :) to people that like ecchi, romance, and comedy.Story (8/10)Each story has a new problem towards nearly all the characters in the story.

Such as, when Yui was sick, Yuuki came to deliver some paperwork, but there stay was longer then expected. Haruna is showing more that she likes Yuuki, but she really hasn't confess to him yet in season two. Overall i like how the characters are much different from season one, but not too different. They added some changes that i personally love.Enjoyment (10/10)I enjoyed season one, but season two is where the action and comedy steps in. It makes me laugh much more then usually, also there is more ecchi scenes in season two which adds some kick! I'm also enjoying how each character is starting to develop a feeling towards Yuuki Rito. I personally enjoyed the first eight episodes so far and hope it gets better forward. Why i watch Motto To LOVE-Ru is because of Golden Darkness/Yami, because shes so CUTE! and starting to have feelings toward Yuuki!.My Dislikes and ConsMy dislikes for Motto to LOVE-Ru is waiting for the new episodes.I hope you enjoy this review :)"", 'As a fan of To LOVE-Ru, I didn\'t enjoy the first season at all.  I know it wasn\'t very faithful to the manga, but the way it was executed left a bad taste in my mouth.  However, Motto changed that by following the manga more closely, and the result?  An adaption that was enjoyable from start to finish.If you\'re familiar with To LOVE-Ru, then you probably know that there\'s not really a driven plot.  Those that are new to TLR (which I\'ll refer to this series as for the rest of the review), you\'re not gonna expect much of a story...here.  Since Motto follows the manga more closely, we\'re given about three 6-8 minute long (give or take) segments of various chapters of mainly Rito in weird, ecchi, and sometimes comedic situations, accompanied with the various side characters of TLR, with some having a segment dedicated to them.  Because of that, almost none of the episodes follow up to the next one, thereby making my point that TLR doesn\'t have a driven plot.  I, however, liked how each episode had different segments since it compliments the manga well.  They\'re both fast and easy to dive into.The art has slightly improved from the first season (ooooh shiny), but the animation has really improved as well, at least from my standpoint.  You may also notice that in the censored broadcast, in some ecchi situations, there\'s a ""white light out of nowhere"" covering a certain part considered ecchi.  While in some cases it\'s acceptable, others it just doesn\'t seem needed at all.  Luckily for me (and hopefully for you), I was able to watch the uncensored broadcast, which to me, is what makes TLR enjoyable in the first place. *wink wink*Though I feel that sound wasn\'t a big factor in Motto, the music did, however, compliment some of the scenes pretty well in order to fit the mood.  The opening theme is catchy and lively and the ending theme is easy-listening.Because Motto follows the manga more closely, we\'re not always given an episode that focuses solely on either the two main heroines, Lala and Haruna.  Like I said earlier, some side characters get a segment of their own as well.  As for character development, almost everyone is their usual self, but with some of the girls beginning to develop feelings for Rito.  Rito himself is also coming to realize that he\'s developing feelings for Lala as well.Comparing the first and second season of TLR, I honestly think that the 2nd was just simply better than the 1st season because...you guessed it...it follows the manga more closely.  Seeing some of my favorite chapters animated and having some of my favorite characters get their own segment definitely beats than having to watch something entirely stupid and pointless (ex. most of the episodes and Lala\'s transformation sequence in the first season).  The fanservice, in my opinion, is definitely where it needs to be since it is of course, TLR, which is known for that, and the 2nd season definitely did that a lot more than the 1st.It may seem I\'m giving Motto a little more credit than it deserves, but it does have its flaws.  For those that, somehow, enjoyed the 1st season, the 2nd doesn\'t pick up at all where it left off, so expect that if you\'re going into the 2nd season.  *Spoiler Alert* You may also question to yourself as to who is that character and how *insert character* is like that since it wasn\'t portrayed in the anime at all, such as Celine originally being a plant, who is now in the form of a baby, or Oshizu now having a prosthetic body when she was originally a ghost.With all that said, Motto TLR is a good watch...IF you happen to be a fan of the series.  They removed, in my opinion, everything that was just terrible from the first season and just made the second season better by just following the manga, which pretty much what made me enjoy Motto from start to end. here.

If you’re interested in watching the To LOVE-Ru series, skip the first season and start with Motto To LOVE-Ru instead. I know I know, why in the world would I say this when I thought that To LOVE-Ru was a pretty good first season? Well the answer is mega simple; To LOVE-Ru ends in a way that lets Motto start off in a very much “let’s start all over” again sort of way. It’s ecchier/lewder, the art style is changed/upgraded to match the To LOVE-Ru ecchi aspects and it’s a huge over haul. Sure, it may take a while to...get used to the characters, since there is a ton of girls to remember, but honestly, starting with Motto is far far far better. It’s not just art that changed too; the way the episodes are shown has changed as well. Instead of being forced to watch a 23 minute episode of sometimes archaic and rather ridiculous scenarios, Motto To LOVE-Ru employs a new tactic, each episode (except for the last one) is cut into 5-9 minute chunks; what this means is that in a 23 minute episode, we the viewers, are able to watch 3 different plots/stories/scenes/thing…. It works so unbelievably well; since the biggest issue I had with To LOVE-Ru (even if I didn’t mention it) was how dragged out some episodes were, especially since To LOVE-Ru was 2-cour.Motto To LOVE-Ru takes what To LOVE-Ru did really well in and makes it a whole ton better, it also fixes all the issues I had with the first season. If you really like the older art style (I know I liked it a ton), you can give To LOVE-Ru a watch, but aside from knowing who’s who, you’re not missing much by skipping the first season, that’s my honest opinion.Motto starts off a little later in time after To LOVE-Ru ended and the first episode, the first 10 seconds, really sets off with a “Hey you, yeah…you, you’re watching this for lewd ecchi goodness, don’t forget that”. Momo, Lala’s younger sister is in Yuuki’s bed and her head is near his crotch, so uhm, yeah it’s the perfect way to introduce everyone back into the To LOVE-Ru universe. Because of the episodic changes, Motto actually has 36 “episodes” and each episode is executed perfectly. To LOVE-Ru did a poor job giving meaning to the girls, Motto fixes this big time. Each girl gets at least one “episode” of exposition, I’d honestly say most get around 2 and then some. This makes it a lot easier to understand why they like Yuuki to begin with and that’s huge, giving characters a reason is something all anime should strive for, even if it’s a shameless ecchi anime. Yami, Mikan, Saki, Kotegawa, Oshizu, Lala, Haruna, Momo, Nana, Run, Celine, they all have episodes dedicated to them and their feelings, their likes and it’s incredible. Of that entire list, Celine, Momo and Nana are new to To LOVE-Ru; Celine is a super cute sunflower child that Lala gave to Yuuki on his birthday (from the OVA if you paid attention), every time she’s involved in an episode, hilarity ensues and she’s just too adorable!, Nana and Momo are Lala’s imouto, running away from the planet Deviluke, they live with Lala, Mikan and Yuuki. Momo has some of the best episodes in this entire anime and Nana eventually grows to like Yuuki, as additions to the cast, they’re fantastic and entirely lovable get used to the characters, since there is a ton of girls to remember, but honestly, starting with Motto is far far far better.

They really are a world on their own. A few maintain the success from the first series and are able to carry it onwards. Others attempt the same, but cannot compare, yet still provide an enjoyable ride. And then there are cases like Motto To Love-Ru, where you watch the same thing yet it feels like something completely different.Before anything else, I have watched the first season and really enjoyed it. Then came the OVA, also enjoyable. Then came the sequel. And for some reason, within a few episodes the feeling the first series gave me completely left me. Now I find myself recognizing...the characters and seiyuu but nothing else from the first season. Where has it gone? Let's take a bite at figuring that out.To Love-Ru is known as a romantic comedy. Our harem lead is Mr.Nice guy, caught up in a love triangle between A) a cute and shy girl he's had a crush on for a while and B) a busty / childish alien that fell from space and makes him go through alot of adventures. The first season portrayed this well; between the laughs was also room for plot development and romance. A nice mix along with a good production value that made for an enjoyable ride.In the second season however, I can only see a ton of fanservice and a story that is (at the moment I write this) not progressing anywhere. The charm of season I is a relic of the past, replacing it is a display of how magical the sun rays are once again, conveniently censoring everything that comes into the screen. And in a series that is mainly about fanservice..it tends to beat the point.In a nutshell, Motto To Love-Ru supports the notion a recent article on Sankaku made about the anime industry becoming a porn industry. You want fanservice? Watch it. You want anything else? Do not watch it. A simple logic that should save both you and me quite some time. the characters and seiyuu but nothing else from the first season. Where has it gone?

Oh, when the OVA came out, that was not enough. The cries of the people rang in the ears of the producers, who then had to oblige. At last: a sequel that’s a sequel. They’ve kept us waiting long enough, right? But wait…is THIS what I’ve been waiting for?Story:What story? So far, all it is is a continuation of the first season. Not a sequel. Just an OVA that they named all fancy and stuff. There’re really no plot (at least none seen yet ). At the...very least, the first season had a story that it tried to follow, and I say tried because there were so many arcs and so many sub plots that you kind of lost sight of what the point was – it started to look like just a slice of life genre, and you forgot that she was a big important person on Deviluke and that he was her chosen mate and that they were supposed to rule the galaxy. But, it did end on a good note. At least, that’s what I think. I’ve really been looking forward to this second season but so far I am thoroughly disappointed.Art:The artistic value went up slightly. I can’t say that it was a big change, but it was enough for you to notice. The only thing that’s slightly bothering me is the lighting issue. I’ve been watching this on animeseason, and every time there’s a panty shot, it’s either covered by light of dark. AND THIS IS PISSING ME OFF. Sure, coincidence that hair is directly over the nipple, fine. But these supposed “glares” on your view come out of freaking nowhere. It’s probably not the producers or directors fault or anything, but this is a dent in the art. Those shots are supposed to be there so that you can see what the character is seeing (sometimes).Sound:I’ll update this later, because I have a feeling they’re going to change the ending theme.Characters:Lala has become even more bubbly then before. She’s also become sweeter, and the faces she makes are often priceless. All the ladies of the show are back and you can count on the fact that they’re proportions are just as big if not bigger than it was in the first season. You also meet Momo and Nana.If you read the manga (before all the manga sites got scared of posting it), then you know these characters and you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised by what you’re going to get.Enjoyment:So far, through all the fan service and nonsense that they’re throwing at the viewer, I can’t say that I’m not enjoying it. I’m not particularly ecstatic either, and I probably won’t be if I don’t see a plot or focus point soon. Though I like it, all it is so far is fan service. And the update will change the entire outcome of the review depending on whether or not I see a plot or definitive point to the show.Faults:You’re probably tired of hearing me say this, but I cannot get over the fact that the show has NO POINT. I’m watching it because I figured it would jump right back to where it left off: what happens with the earth, and what’s going on with Rito and how he’s coping with everything. But, this second series acts almost as if the ending events of the first didn’t matter. Sure, Rito remembers everything, but he doesn’t seem at all affected by it. I’d imagine that he would still be having a hard time accepting the fact that the earth was almost obliterated thanks to him and the fact that he will probably still end up ruling the universe someday if lala stays with him any longer. It just doesn’t follow the personalities that the characters had in the first season.Overall:Overall, I just can’t wait for the season to finish. That’s about it. From here on is what will make or break this anime.

Being the first ecchi ever watched, and one of the first 10 anime in general, it held a certain place in my heart as i was exposed to the world of this genre. Captivated by that new experience I remembered it when i saw that a second season was airing. So i tested the waters of the sequel to something that had remained untouchable for so long.Expectation: 7Episode Scores: -,-,-,-, 7, 6, 7, 8, 7, 7, 9, 7Actual: 7 (Good)Half as long as the first season, and having a heck lot more material...to work for it is obvious which was superior. I had read the manga, mindlessly mind you, and they picked only the best chapters; or rather they picked the top 36. Divided into 3 parts per episode it stays true to its wacky random antics and everyone gets their fair share of trouble. I mean literally everyone, because they put effort into spliting the air time evenly with all the characters. The majority of the comedy is still dependant on ecchi humor and slapstick.However due to the true comedy format of short segments, there was not that much character development at all. Despite some good scenes, the relationships stayed relatively unchanged and it left me sort of disappointed. It might of been my foolishness in expecting a couple to form when i watched the first season, but i regained that hope only to be shattered yet again.Motto to love-ru gives just that, more to love-ru. It is slightly better than the first season due to it being condensed into only the best parts, but that can only improve it so much. to work for it is obvious which was superior.

If you were disappointed by the first one, have some hope for this one is much improved.Story: 6/10Motto To Love-Ru adapts the same kind of storytelling that the first one used: a bunch of random filler episodes that don\'t have that much plot movement. The difference this time is the producers distinctly tell you that each episode is stand-alone (one 24 min ep is actually three mini-eps that are unrelated, but all have their own titles), which gives the audience a sense...that they are about to witness a casual 8 minute mini-episode that serves only comedic purposes. This small detail of simply naming each mini-episode seems trivial, but it really sets up the relaxed feel which the first one did not have. That being said, again there is not much plot movement with each episode, and you could watch the episodes in random order and not miss much. But because you start each episode with the knowledge that it\'s not going to be serious and is going to be more like a comedy sketch, it\'s a vastly different feel when you watch it.But while it was an improvement from the first show, it still wasn\'t a ""good"" story if we\'re speaking in terms of all anime out there because it still follows the format of having random filler episodes rather than telling a longer and more well-developed story.Art: 10/10The first thing you\'ll probably notice is the huge improvement in art, so congrats to the studio for being able to provide better animation! No complaints here.Sound: 10/10I liked the opening for the first one and I liked it for this one too. No complaints for any of the sounds during the show either.Character: 7/10I think that Motto To Love-Ru really tried to focus on character development in this second installment, and while they do a pretty good job of it, it sacrifices the development of Rito and Lala, a relationship that I enjoyed watching in the first series. Instead, all the other characters in his harem are further developed, but if you\'re a fan of Rito x ______(someone other than Lala), then Motto To Love-Ru will be pretty enjoyable for you since minor characters like Kotegawa, Yami, and Nana reveal what they truly think about Rito. Like I said, this means Rito and Lala don\'t really have much improvement in their relationship until the very last few episodes, so this is more of a personal opinion I have about character development. Overall, their goal was to evenly develop all of the other characters since the first show focused so much on Rito and Lala, and they definitely achieved it here.Enjoyment: 8/10I actually did enjoy this one a lot more than the first one since I could start each episode knowing that it was a comedy and actually laugh at some of the scenes. It\'s a comedy, which is meant to be relaxing and humorous, and that\'s what this show did.Overall: 7/10A clear improvement from the first show, but still not a very strong anime. It didn\'t have any glaringly bad aspects, but also not much creative and new content either that you haven\'t seen in other shows. For To Love-Ru fans, however,  who have seen the first one, it should be a relief to watch a sequel that is much better. that they are about to witness a casual 8 minute mini-episode that serves only comedic purposes. This small detail of simply naming each mini-episode seems trivial, but it really sets up the relaxed feel which the first one did not have. That being said, again there is not much plot movement with each episode, and you could watch the episodes in random order and not miss much. But because you start each episode with the knowledge that it\'s not going to be serious and is going to be more like a comedy sketch, it\'s a vastly different feel when you watch it.But while it was an improvement from the first show, it still wasn\'t a ""good"" story if we\'re speaking in terms of all anime out there because it still follows the format of having random filler episodes rather than telling a longer and more well-developed story.Art: 10/10The first thing you\'ll probably notice is the huge improvement in art, so congrats to the studio for being able to provide better animation! No complaints here.Sound: 10/10I liked the opening for the first one and I liked it for this one too. No complaints for any of the sounds during the show either.Character: 7/10I think that Motto To Love-Ru really tried to focus on character development in this second installment, and while they do a pretty good job of it, it sacrifices the development of Rito and Lala, a relationship that I enjoyed watching in the first series. Instead, all the other characters in his harem are further developed, but if you\'re a fan of Rito x ______(someone other than Lala), then Motto To Love-Ru will be pretty enjoyable for you since minor characters like Kotegawa, Yami, and Nana reveal what they truly think about Rito. Like I said, this means Rito and Lala don\'t really have much improvement in their relationship until the very last few episodes, so this is more of a personal opinion I have about character development. Overall, their goal was to evenly develop all of the other characters since the first show focused so much on Rito and Lala, and they definitely achieved it here.Enjoyment: 8/10I actually did enjoy this one a lot more than the first one since I could start each episode knowing that it was a comedy and actually laugh at some of the scenes. It\'s a comedy, which is meant to be relaxing and humorous, and that\'s what this show did.Overall: 7/10A clear improvement from the first show, but still not a very strong anime. It didn\'t have any glaringly bad aspects, but also not much creative and new content either that you haven\'t seen in other shows. For To Love-Ru fans, however,  who have seen the first one, it should be a relief to watch a sequel that is much better.', 'Motto to love ru, i think is a really good well made anime.

Girls just keeps piling up on the main protagonists(luck Ba**tard). Hope the harem kees going. ', ""What can I say about this season that I didn't with the first one, now this one apparently is the first season to follow the manga. But to people who haven't read the manga, this new season didn't feel any different from the first. Motto was just as fun as the first season (only shorter) but some of the plot holes, like how Celina came into the show in the first place aren't really explained. Overall, this is a fun watch and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good romantic comedy. "", 'I really enjoyed the first TL-R series, this one was better for a number of reasons. First was that, unlike the first series, Motto TL-R followed closely to the manga, without putting additional plot points. Each episode is split into 3 sub-episodes, with each of those covering a particular chapter from the manga; for the most part the sub-episodes are actually named after the chapters on which they\'re based with a few notable exceptions--more about this at a later time.The major liberty taken from the...manga was the use of the entire cast from the start. This wasn\'t necessarily an issue; however; it took some 162 chapters of the manga to get Yuuki\'s entire harem assembled. Most character explanations and backgrounds are taken care of in the first sub-episode but done briefly (From the Beginning) through exposition. It is assumed that most viewers of the anime are already familiar with the basics of the TL-R universe, and the series serves to fill in gaps that have been left out by the first series. Also notable is that the chapter order bears no real relation with the order of the episodes; characters are sometimes added as needed, but seamlessly.The reason this works is that the chapters used for the anime were more the side-stories and not in the major plot arc; for example, no appearance of King Deviluke and Zastin only shows up briefly once or twice of the manga. The only real arc in the series as a whole is the developing friendship/crush/romance between Mikan and Yami, dealt with in several episodes. Yui\'s feelings for Rito are given some multi-episode treatment as well; the Haruna/Lala/Rito triangle is taken as obvious (to the viewer) from the start.I enjoyed the art style and the animation was good as well. It had great scenes of humor which I really enjoyed. I was a fan of the original series like I mentioned.The final episode is the final four chapters of the manga, encompassing the ""I Love You"" story arc, and ends with the same hilarious nonsense as the manga. And this leaves space for more series in the future. Hopefully... manga was the use of the entire cast from the start.

If your boner is as hard as titanium as you watch this, then this anime may very well be a ten for you. Unfortunately, while I was watching mine was only as hard as concrete.To Love-Ru is a great epitome of all the fan service animes out there. It is the anime to go to if all you want to see is boobs, butts, and a faceless boring male lead who all the girls wanna be with. You could easily put yourself in his shoes and imagine...yourself doing all the perverted things.To Love-Ru has no shame at all. While the first season actually had something that resembled a plot (introduce a new girl, have the new girl fall in love with Rito. Not to mention the plot regarding the king of the universe), Motto has nothing like that. The anime consists of several short segments, one episode usually housing two or three of them. Within these segments, something unique occurs. For instance, in one segment Lala invents a gender swapping machine. Anyways, these plot devices exist for the sole purpose of getting Rito, our male lead, into as many perverted situations as humanly possible. And oh boy does Rito deliver. Throughout this short 12 episode anime, Rito will get his hands on every pair of breasts and every butt, get his face between every pair of legs, undo every bra, pull down every pair of underwear, you name it. He'll see every female naked at some point, and every female will see him naked at some point.To Love-Ru's perversions are almost all 'accidental perversion'. What I mean by this is Rito is a goody two shoes that never has perverted thoughts on his mind. The only way he gets into perverted situations is by tripping, getting catapulted into, being mind controlled, or whatever into them. What this means is almost every segment consists of the following formula: Rito or a girl gets attacked, Rito falls over the girl, Rito and the girl realize his hand is on her boob, the girl gets pissed. Rinse and repeat. Especially in the first 7-8 episodes, this was the entirety of Motto To Love-Ru. You should be able to guess how repetitive it gets.But hey, it's hot, right? Yeh, it's hot. There's a looooooot of girls, so chances are high at least one of them tickles your fancies. Unfortunately, there's only one Rito, and all the girls have to take turns getting into perverted situations with him. As such, in order to enjoy everything that is Motto, you need to already be really really aroused, such that every situation will just turn you on more, despite the poor plot and annoying Rito.However, we reach a problem which is in all fan service anime: it never actually goes all the way into hentai. Nobody will ever kiss nor do anything above that ever in Motto. This means that no matter how aroused you get from watching it, the show will never be anything more than a cock tease. After watching Motto To Love-Ru, you're most definitely going to need some supplemental doujins or hentai games to truly be satisfied. You might be better off watching some hentai right from the start.There is one good thing about watching this show, and that is that it has a LOT of doujins. Those Japanese fans have drawn a doujin for every girl in the show (except for Run for some reason), so even if you're unsatisfied after watching a few episodes of Motto, all you need is the internet and you're bound to find a doujin to take you all the way. yourself doing all the perverted things.To Love-Ru has no shame at all.

If you have not figured that out then you just fell down a cliff.Since this is the second season which was dearly needed to help the first one, I was caught a bit off guard because the first season had much intail with the story while this season was more along the lines of random adventures that you could see in Hayate no Gotoku.  But even though this season was more of a circle jerk of different stories with each episode containing 3 different stories, I was fairly...entertained.

""Motto To Love-Ru"" served as a perfect restart button for the series, they upped the animation, improved the story, fleshed out the characters (Momo for life), and concentrated a lot more on the ecchi aspect. I also liked the fact that during this season there was a lot more focus on the story, and it progressed constantly during the season; on the first season of ""To Love-Ru"" the show took a more ""episodic""...aspect, while the story did progress, each episode felt like it\'s own thing.

With new characters and perspective on previous ones, there is a guarantee for enjoyment to blossom at each episode.Previously on To LOVE-Ru. Episodes came in like a filler trainwreck and the cargoes that toppled out were too heavy to really be enjoyable to carry. I mean, the contents inside were too similar, so there really was no point in carrying them anyways! That's my quite peculiar analogy on what I...felt during the first season, but it gets the point across. And now, the curtains unveiled in this season and oh boy was that a welcomed surprise. How and why was it better? First thing would be the structure of the episodes. Rather than dragging the length out with one episodic story, they decided to put in three mini stories in each episode. The new structure helped in giving the diversity which was lacking in the first season. It paved way to much-needed focus on the cast of girls, particularly with the beloved golden assasin and the disciplinary tsundere. What comes out of that was progression on the romance life of many girls, along with the development of their personality showcasing the sides they never truly shown before. The culmination of each girl's differing personalities added up into many fun and silly situations that made them so likable and made me laugh. Though all that said, this season still came with issues. Some comedy were not funny and even though it's an ecchi, the dragged on fanservice may get excessive at times. But while there was a bit of boredom here and there mostly due to lesser-than-previous-season repetition, their entertaining pureness overweighed most of these issues. Main boy Rito went through so much ever since he became unlucky that I got to hand it to him for dealing with everything. Keep up the good work!And with that out of the way, we do a hop and a skip to the visuals of the anime! At first glance, the difference was definitely there if we compare it to To LOVE-Ru. Just like how Lala can transform her clothes with the help of Peke, the anime also did a transformation in its art style. The biggest difference was that the brightness of the colors were whitewashed so some slight color were lost there. It took a bit of time to get used but in the end, I really liked how it looked. In a way it's an upgrade, especially when the lines still felt refined and the animation was quite normal and consistent. There was a couple of noticeable ones where the art was amplified, especially in the more significant scenes that appeared throughout the show. As for the character designs, no change in there and they all looked youthfully cute (except the principal). Ecchi scenes were still as exaggerated as ever with more gloss to define the curves, so nothing really new there. When the characters goes through all sorts of havoc, they came in with a bunch of expressions and of course the white-eyed one that's really common in comedic anime was no exception. From happiness to clumsiness, whatever face they decided to put on, it placed a smile on my face. Especially with that Celine. Her non-stop smiles were too contagious. Most scenes were blasted with loudness and energy radiating out of the girls. Definitely can't see Rito taking a break with that going on in his life. Cheerful soundtracks complemented with the tone and the character's voice acting were done well, capturing the charmingness of each character.Motto To LOVE-Ru is simply a step up to the previous season. It's an improvement on pretty much all aspect, and that's a good thing because better enjoyment comes out of better quality.

Though for me it stands between safe for work and not safe for work. I tend to dislike the ones inbetween, where semi nudity is bigger. This cause I like to focus on either my taste for normal romance or the ecchi side of harem.For me, what devides the Harem genre and is keen to it's enjoyment or not, is two golden rules with different headtopic whether you are a boy or a girl watching the show.1) Fall in love with the girls (boys)or...like the girls (Girl).The more girls the audience falls in love with, the better the harem series.2) Make the watcher fall in love with the boy (girl)or understand why the guy gets girls to fall in love with him (boy)So is Motto to Love-ru Darkness, or well the whole series worth watching?Why certainly yes.Because of the depth of the cast, the almost perfect voice cast you tend to fall in love with the characters.

This usually is broken up by the lead having to take the choice of whether to go for the harem ending or choose one.

Anyway, enjoyment takes a nine, with a nice mix of comedy and ecchi, with a bit of romance tossed in for an interesting mix. Overall, I give this an eight, so it\'s one to definitely check out.', ""A solid sequel season that focuses on its strengths, random comedy and pleasing art.This is the second season of To-Love-Ru, but its a lot more like the OVA series than the first season. Rather than each episode having a single story, each episode is composed of three smaller faster paced stories. This, as it did with the OVA, works out well because the actual plots were never that deep in the first place and barely had any significance, so even if they're rushed through it isn't an issue.\xa0 The benefit of doing so is that it allows them to put in a lot more comedy...and craziness, which is what actually makes the series enjoyable. I will also note though that in addition to the stories being better told due to better pacing, it also felt like the quality was better overall. The improved pacing also makes the slow and steady character development which like the first series is slow to the point of feeling nonexistant in each individual episode, feel much faster overall, though still slow but to a degree it didn't feel like much of an issue. Another thing to note, is that this is a sequel to the OVAs, which skipped over portions of the story. Hence, there are still a bunch of things that weren't explained or don't make sense, but for the most part the story isn't that important so it doesn't matter that much. The last ending was the only episode that had a drawn out story, but as a one off it worked pretty well and was a solid way to end things, even if it was kind of halfhearted with it.The art and animation are excellent and a major step up above the first season. The art style was also more consistently solid and didn't have a bunch of random bad looking out of place designs. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable.

Sure, we get more of the ecchi aspect, but I feel like the writers got lazy with the humor. It's just the same awkward moments over and over. And while the first season at least had somewhat of a continuing story, this season is purely episodic until the last few episodes, even going so far as to split each episode into essentially three episodes. I will point out, however, that the main point of this season seems to be character development, and in that, they succeeded wonderfully....The variety of stories is also nice, but there just simply weren't any moments in this season that kept me laughing and laughing as in the first.I did feel it was absolutely worth the watch; however, prepare to be disappointed if you expect the same quality of writing as in the first season.

But what you didn\'t know is that this anime, aside from other ones just like this, actually has good, enjoyable characters with a good backstory.This is basically a continuation from where we left off in the OVAs\'. Rito is still being accused of being the ""accidental pervert"" that he is. And the funny gags that are in just about every episode are even more so, but the question is. WHY does this anime deserve the score I gave.Like I said before, this...series has a good backstory and a ton of characters that make up for it. But is it at all justified? Let me elaborate a bit deeper. What you will get about 60% of the time will be accidental perverted moments including Rito and an enraged girl who beats the hell out of him for his ""accidental"" accident. The other 40% of the time you will get serious moments that sort-of tie in with the plot for the moment. Most episodes are filled with filler, and while that\'s not a bad thing, if you like a serious story with extremely intricate characters and a evolving backstory, then this anime is NOT for you. Let me repeat, this anime does NOT contain any extreme intricate characters or plot that will make your eye balls pop out from being dazzled. This anime is purely for the ""fun"" of being a good anime with a lot of laughs.The sound and art of this one are, meh. They\'re good enough to enjoy in the moment, but there are no visuals that captured my eyes and made me say wow. And I\'m not completely sure, this may just be me, but the characters look slightly different in this series than in their older predecessors. The OP is alright, not too catchy, but does stick in your head for a bit.Like I said before, the characters are definitely a good reason to keep watching this. Most of them are sort-of one-dimensional, but they all add to the funny moments to keep the show as interesting as it is. I must admit, the most interesting character in this anime is Yui Kotegawa. She may be the most uptight character in the show, but she has some dynamic. I would state the rest of the characters, but there are so many so I\'ll just say this. They are all good in their own ways. However, the lot of the main characters are definitely the most interesting.So like I\'ve said before, if you come to this anime expecting outstanding characters and a dynamic story, well you\'re dreaming. You will, for the most part, be laughing and maybe feeling a bit uncomfortable as you\'re put in the shoes of Mr. Rito a LOT when he get\'s himself into trouble. But for the most part, this anime is very entertaining but has a bit of filler that may take you away from what we\'re ultimately trying to get at.

To be fair, To Love-Ru was the first season of the anime, and with that series' success, I suppose it's only natural for the next season to have much higher quality all around!Story: MTLR has a lot of different little scenes packed into each episode, but the good thing is, at least there's some continuation between them. At times, it feels like some scenes should have gone longer but it doesn't really matter. It was a great show.Art: A very significant improvement, the art in MTLR compared to TLR...is definitely quite noticeable. Character faces have more detail, hair has more detail, the environment is much more detailed. I had to pause several times just to be able to enjoy the hilarious character expressions!Sound: I think the sound is a lot calmer in this series? I found that TLR's sound, such as music, was often much too fast-paced. It's still pretty fast paced in MTLR but I feel the sound's a bit better this season.Characters: Another major improvement was the characters. Somehow, in just twelve episodes, a lot of the series' characters actually had quite a bit of development and interesting scenes. Save for a few though. I like how much deeper we get to understand characters like Yumi, Katagawa, Momo, Nana, and Run. It goes without saying there's a lot of focus on Haruna, Yuuki, and Lala!Enjoyment: At times I felt teary eyed due to the romance, which is a good thing.

Does that hinder the story in any way? No, but it doesn't really help the fact that there isn't really an overarching storyline.Art (7/10) - Another notable difference is the art in Motto. It has a more modern feel (2010) than the prequel series.Sound (6/10) - I'd say the biggest improvement would be the music.

Nijiiro Days,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31414/Nijiiro_Days,"['This is one of those series that finish so fast once you start watching, because it is just so relaxing and nothing too serious happens, which also makes it so relatable and reminiscent of our high school days (well, for those that have graduated at least!) or how it could be. If you are looking for an easy-going series filled with the power of youth, this is a good example.Story-wise, there is nothing specific as it is their everyday life, but the overall feel is focused on the romance part; 4 friends who tease each other and their romantic interests. We see everyone’s view (not...just the main quartet) and how they interact and the silly problems they have that seem huge at the time and the silly adventures they take part in and various small parts of their personality. Is it that great? No, it is not, but that does not mean it is not enjoyable. It provides sufficient pleasure and comfort when watching, since it is doing a good job at keeping it simple and not overdoing it most of the time. It is a slice of life work through and through and it does not have enough time to get tiring, thankfully. Comedy is of course also present, but it blends in with romance pretty well, without trying too hard as everything seem realistic enough for an ideal high school life!Everyone has pretty distinct personalities and most of them are so adorable, but most of all at least half of them are relatable to a good degree if we just minimize their dominant trait a bit. There is the sadistic friend (but who does not have one, really?), the naïve and so transparent friend, the playboy and the silent, aloof guy whose traits do not stop him from having a great time. The girls have their own distinct traits too, but one specific girl, the violent one, sticks out for being the worst. While everyone seems to have their own pretty much normal circumstances, she is just very obsessed and screaming all the time without any sufficient character background or development, unlike the rest who may not be developing all that much either, but they do not really need to as they fit in the story just fine.The art is nothing too complicated; very simple drawings, but with many many colors and although generally it can be considered generic, the characters were easily recognizable. The hair aspect is the one true point that makes this so unrealistic, considering one could have purple or fuchsia hair, but there is nothing too extreme on hairstyles to put off someone. Animation is pretty decent, since there are not many scenes demanding of special attention. The sound is also good enough with catchy soundtracks and the voice actors did a decent enough job (that good that I wanted to hit the violent girl with so much screaming), but nothing memorable. It is just one of these series you will watch and like for their art and sound, but forget the next day.All in all, if you are looking for an easy watch, this is a great choice and although there is no definite ending which can make you want more right then, it still manages to fulfill its goal.

It\'s one of those rare romance anime where the main characters are the same gender, but the romance is heterosexual. When I first saw this anime, I thought probably the same thing as anyone else who was unfamiliar with this anime before it aired, ""This is going to be another borderline-yaoi anime, is it?"" Then, I read the description, and my curiosity was piqued. For that reason, I ended up watching it when it premiered, and I must say that it was a fun anime...to watch.Ladies and gentlemen, here is my review of ""Nijiiro Days"".Nijiiro Days follows four high school boys, Natsuki Hashiba, Tomoya Matsunaga, Keiichi Katakura, and Tsuyoshi Naoe, as they go through their high school lives. One Christmas Eve, Natsuki gets dumped by his girlfriend, and as he is crying about it, he is handed some tissues by a girl wearing a Santa outfit; at that moment, he falls for that girl. He later runs into the girl, Anna Kobayakawa, at school, and he tries to get closer to her while his friends try to meddle in their relationship. Every once in a while, the focus shifts from Natsuki to one of the other three boys as they deal with their own love-related problems; Mari Tsutsui is Anna\'s man-hating best friend who Tomoya ends up liking, Nozomi Matsunaga is Tomoya\'s younger sister who has feelings for Keiichi (while Tomoya does not approve), and Yukiko Asai is Tsuyoshi\'s cosplaying girlfriend.It\'s a rather easygoing story with comedic moments sprinkled in here and there. It\'s really a breath of fresh air, though; after all, all of the main characters are male, but since all of their love interests are female, there is no way one can consider this a ""borderline-yaoi"" anime at all. Luckily, these heterosexual relationships are, for the most part, believable. The one exception may be the one between Tomoya and Mari; I honestly felt more ""hate"" than ""love"" in their relationship, but at the very least, it was given a bit of development. I really liked Natsuki and Anna\'s relationship, though; it was fun to watch as their relationship grew. However, I really would have liked some more development on the relationships between Keiichi and Nozomi and Tsuyoshi and Yukirin; however, I guess what we get is what we have. (Hopefully, there is more development to those two relationships in the manga....)The animation, done by Production Reed, wasn\'t anything too ground-breaking, but for an anime as simple as this one, it\'s more than acceptable. It definitely had bright colors, and with a title that translates to ""Rainbow Days"", I think that fits quite well. As for the voice acting, the voice actors did a great job with their respective characters. The music was also great, too; I liked every single one of the opening and ending themes. The best one, however, was the third ending theme, ""\'I Wanna Be Your Knight"" by Takuya Eguchi, Tomoya\'s voice actor; it just sounds so cool with an amazing singer to boot!Overall, Nijiiro Days was a good anime. If you\'re in the mood for an easygoing slice-of-life anime with romance sprinkled in, this is the anime for you.

As such LA is very thankful that this anime short has this kind of screentime let alone episode count as it would have been rushed to all hell, nonetheless due to this the majority of the relationships go in depth to.Though LA says this, the majority of the focus goes to Natsuki ""Na-chan"" Hashiba voiced by...Yoshitsugu Matsuoka and Anna Kobayakawa voiced by Minami Tsuda\'s relationship from friends to a couple. The other closest relationship with this kind of focus goes to the incredibly shaky relationship of Tomoya ""Mat-tsun"" Matsunaga voiced by Takuya Eguchi and Anna\'s best friend Mari Tsutsui voiced by Yumi Uchiyama. Unfortunately the other two relationships of Yukiko Asai voiced by Shizuka Ishigami and Tsuyoshi ""Tsuyo-pon"" Naoe voiced by Kouki Uchiyama as well as Keiichi ""Kei-chan"" Katakura voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki and Tomoya\'s little sister, Nozomi Matsunaga voiced by Ai Kayano gets *ahem* pushed aside for the other two more focused relationships and are more or less B plot relationships with Tsuyoshi and Yukiko\'s relationship was already formed before the anime thus didn\'t have enough meat and Keiichi and Nozomi\'s relationship started rather late to get a proper focus respectively. LA\'s favourite relationship oddly enough however goes to Tomoya and Mari\'s relationship, yes LA could say that Mari\'s constant bickering to Tomoya got annoying rather quickly but their development helped a bit more especially with Mari\'s defrosting and deredere moments.The animation by Production Reed at best is above average for an anime short and LA had really no problem with the animation at all.Voice acting wise, there was an annoying voice acting mainly from Yumi Uchiyama who voiced Mari but she got better over time (away from her bitchy vocals anyways), however LA\'s favourite voice actor in Nijiro Days would actually be Shizuka Ishigami who voiced Yukiko and really LA wanted to see more of Yukiko but again for her character\' circumstances, LA could see why she couldn\'t.The ending for Nijro Days gave us something of an ""ok"" ending as the entire focus for the final few episodes went to Anna Kobayakawa\'s revelation about her relationship to Hashiba and really it\'s the typical ""can\'t spit it out"" by the end of the anime, ohh Anna finally gets her revelation about her growth to her relationship to Hashiba but she just doesn\'t take the move to grow it even further, nonetheless, the sentiment was nice, the ending also the narrow focus, all the other relationships are put in limbo to give the focus to the main couple of Hashiba and Anna, it\'s a bit of compensation at least but LA wished the focus was split a bit more to the rest of cast and their relationship. The ending is really a double-edged sword but LA overall was slightly satisfied with this ending.Nijiro Days is a great romance anime short to the anime short medium that looks at many stages of a relationship with lots of growth to the multiple relational developments, sure the focus tends to go to Mari and Tomoya and especially Anna and Hashiba while the other two relationships turned into a pseudo-growth/supporting characters to the above relationships. Nonetheless Nijiro Days is a soft-fluffy puppy-love anime short with some good payoff of relationship growth here and there.

Sure, if ordinary is carrying around a kinky whip … for recreational purposes, or confessing your love to your bros for practice? Packed into 13-minutes bursts, each episode revolves around the lives of eccentric high school students and their completely ordinary buffooneries.It’s true: the main characters in Nijiiro Days are without a care in the world. Despite having talents in sports and academia, they choose to waste time together to completely goof off. Thankfully, their attitude towards life are largely why the show works. The spontaneity of the main characters adds diversity to the comedic timing within each...episode. Its episodic structure feeds a curious audience that wants to find out more about Natsuki and how he manages to get a negative score on a test…There’s something strangely engrossing in the way the main characters interact with one other. From the first episode, Natsuki sees threatening foreigners approaching a girl he has a crush on, Anna. His friends egg him on to protect her, and as Natsuki clumsily flails his arms in an attempt to intimidate, he realizes the foreigners were simply asking for directions. The next day, Natsuki’s friends reenact the scene in front of him, completely embarrassing him in the process. Scenes like this one vividly portray relatable pranks one would pull on their friends: the familiar feeling of lightly caricaturing and laughing at their blunders. And as the audience is reminded of the times something similar happened, they sing along to the tunes of Nijiiro Days’ comedy with a smile or, perhaps, a chuckle.Not only balanced in its comedic delivery, Nijiiro Days also provides satisfying character development for its side characters. In particular, Mari is known to have quite a notorious personality. Indeed, she not only sports dangerous cat woman claws, but also earns the nickname “Spit Woman” from having spat on someone. While this embodiment highlights her comedic importance to the show, there are vulnerable moments that give a glimpse to how she developed such a crude personality. In addition, Anna is a kind and generous girl who usually keeps to herself. In the latter parts of the show, bits and pieces of her own echoing questions convey her mental journey: one of confronting a new feeling in her adolescence. And for the most part, this is done with pace and elegance. Comedy remains the primary focus, while individual characters confront their growing pains.Occasionally, Nijiiro Days’ characters do lose their glamour. Whenever Mari or Natsuki shout at the top of their lungs, they make my eardrums spasm. To their antithesis, Anna is at times quite bland in her actions and response. These inherent character traits, in spite of character developments, remain a large part of who these individuals are. And it can be quite valid to say “one of these personalities do not click with me.”Accordingly, a flaw for Nijiiro Days stems from where the show ends. Because each episode is essentially an adaptation of each chapter of the source material, Nijiiro Days really should have aired 57 episodes. Unfortunately, this wasn’t possible logistically because the manga hadn’t finished as Nijiiro Days was airing. Where Nijiiro Days ends, then, becomes a bit awkward: as episode/chapter 24 is where we are teased of a main romantic pairing coming to fruition, but not quite, the ending leaves much of the audience in suspense.On the other hand, the animation in the show appears fluid, polished, and well-done. The character designs are colorful, with details in their facial expressions adding to the comedic value. Moreover, the voice acting accurately portrays each character and the music befits the lighthearted mood of the show.Nijiiro Days goes by fast.

It's taunting you with something amazing, something that you could have. But ultimately you're let down.This anime had so many problems. I can't help but get angry because of it. On the surface, it's a quick, fluffy romance anime with male leads instead of female ones. This is a unique twist on the shoujo romance genre, but this twist is wasted on Nijiro Days. This is no better than a boring shoujo with female leads.My major problem with the series is the characters. They are a lackluster, meaningless cast, and I felt no...attachment to any of them, even though I've gone through the hardships of crushes and unrequited love before.Let's go down the list of couples, analyzing each.The Main Couple is Bland Anna Kobayakawa and Typical Shoujo Girl Natsuki Hashiba.Anna is a typical Mary Sue. She doesn't figure out her feelings for Natsuki until the last moment. She has little to no emotions; one of the four main characters even mentions her emotionless face. I rarely got to see her smile. I can deal with detached characters, but she really was empty. Her character had no depth. She was nice but in the way that everyone is nice. She works at a karaoke place. Other than that, I can't tell you a single one of her likes or traits. She was a boring character; that's it.And Natsuki...sigh. He had real potential, you know? He could have been a heart-on-your-sleeve, comedic relief, lovable guy. What we got was less than average. He was more like the typical shoujo manga girl. As if the creators wanted to make him relatable to the females in the audience. I've met guys who have unrequited crushes on girls. They don't act like that. They're defensive at times and make jokes. Natsuki ended up being more of a squealing typical shoujo character. I liked that the main characters were guys crushing on girls; I thought that had real promise, but Natsuki ended up way too stereotypical for me to care about him.And the romance between the two is innocent and kinda cute, but Anna takes way too many hints and throws them out of the window. It took way too long for the main romance to even become a thing in her eyes.

The penultimate genre of romance where everything is sappy and the journey to love is a slow, arduous, and sometimes painful one.  So, what better way to give us everything that Shoujo romance has to offer in one series?  That my friends, is Niijiro days.Story: Our story begins on Christmas Eve with Nat-chan, who is sitting under the town\'s giant christmas tree in disappointment.  After breaking up with his girlfriend due to her being a gold digger (This was never a part of the anime, but it\'s the context that gave way to the rest of the...series), Nat-chan is given a tissue by a passerby Santa girl with whom he falls smitten to.  This girl\'s name is Kobayakawa Anna, a girl of the same grade in the same school as Nat-chan, thus starting another season of romance.Niijiro Days is a very...complete kind of shoujo Romance.  (And yes, I am aware that doesn\'t make much sense, but keep reading.)  The main draw of the series is the fact that the show has not one, not two, not three, but FOUR different ships/romances that are going on at the same time with each of them pertaining to a different kind of romance that you would normally have with shoujo romances.  The show doesn\'t really have much beyond just focusing on these relationships, as the majority of the screentime is just the characters hanging out and/or attempting to get their love-saturated plotline moving at a snail\'s pace.With this setup, there\'re a few problems that come into play.  For starters, because the show focuses on so many couples at once that the show only inches its way towards the inevitable conclusions without actually getting there.  (Not like we were actually going to get any endings, but my point still stands)  Second of all, the imbalance of screentime makes it so that some couples, particularly the main couple, gets more screentime than any other couple and as such we don\'t get to see everyone get as much attention as they should get.  These are really minor problems in the grand scheme of things, but they\'re still inherent issues that the series has.Overall, Niijiro Days is more or less every single shoujo trope smacked together into one show.  Its execution is inherently flawed due to the show being only technically a full-length one cour series due to each of its 24 episodes only being 13-15 minutes long and because the manga is still on-going and as of today, has not reached much of a conclusion either. Still, there\'s nothing particularly bad about this series despite it being somewhat generic in terms of what they\'re presenting for their story.Overview:+ Four distinct stories/couples to follow+/-  Stories contain mainly shoujo tropes-  Typical with many shoujo, no clear conclusionCharacters:  As mentioned before, the characters in Niijiro Days are split into four distinct couples, with each character more or less having a defined trait that makes up their character, usually opposite to their opposite sex counterpart.  As such, I\'ll be going over each relationship rather than each character.  (I will also be using the nicknames for the male characters rather than their ACTUAL names because hell, if the show does it, I will too.)First there\'s Nat-chan and Anna, the main couple of the series.  Nat-chan can be easily described as the \'shoujo heroine\' type of character.  He acts very often like your typical shoujo heroine as he is this bright, energetic, and extremely easy to read character that doesn\'t have an evil bone in his body.  Anna on the other hand is a softspoken, mostly quiet individual who starts to open up as the series goes along.  This couple in particular soaks up most of the series\'s screentime and is the one relationship that the series tries to put together the most.  Despite that, the show doesn\'t really...do much to actually put them together.  Anna is a very oblivious character and is easily influenced to the point it\'s actually quite dangerous to leave her alone due to how easily she could be picked up, and Nat-chan is very shy and flustered about his own feelings to the point that he can\'t confess and most of his attempts crash and burn.  They\'re pretty typical in terms of generic shoujo romances, so as a relationship, they\'re not really all that progressive or unique.Then there\'s Mat-tsun and Mari, the secondary couple of the series.  Mat-tsun is a playboy type character while Mari is Tsun.  No dere, just tsun.  (Her last name is Tsutsui, but I think it should be Tsuntsun instead).  These two...are somewhat aggravating if I\'ll be completely honest.  Particularly Mari.  The majority of their \'relationship\' is more or less a game of cat and mouse, where Mat-tsun tries to chase down the annoying and shrill tsun child without really getting any results.  They have a few episodes that are devoted to them and their relationship, but similar to most of the other couples, the end result doesn\'t really prove to be in any way progressional.  In fact, Mari exists more as an obstacle to the series if anything.  Her characteristics are of being this man hating girl who solely just wants Anna to stay by her side and no one else, constantly complaining if someone \'takes her away\' and for the majority of the series, despising the idea of the male characters even coming into the picuture.Then there\'s Kei-kun and Nozomi.  Kei-kun is a sadist who carries a whip around with him because hey why not?  While Nozomi is Mat-tsun\'s younger sister who is quite literally the definition of lovesick.  This couple probably gets the least amount of attention out of everyone.  Hell, they get the least amount of screentime compared to everyone else.  The brunt of their relationship is the girl chasing the guy while also playing the waiting game due to Nozomi\'s dedication despite getting rejected.  There\'s not really much to say about them and this just shows how unbalanced the show is in the way of exploring these individual romantic relationships.And finally we have the one OTP that actually exists in the series, Tsuyoponnu and Yukirin.  As the gaming/otaku couple of the group, these are the only two characters that actually are dating.  (Ya gotta cover all bases)  Their screentime is mostly devoted to starting some plotlines as well as giving advice to some of the other couples because well, they\'re the successful ones.  Aside from that, they have their fair share of lovey dovey moments and that\'s pretty much their purpose in the series.  They\'re a cute couple but since they\'ve already \'succeeded\', there\'s not really much else the series could do for them.Side characters are practically non-existent.  The few that are in the series fade away very quickly and only show up for 1 episode, maybe 2 max.  As such, there\'s nothing to really say for the side characters good or bad, so we\'re moving on.Overview:+ Some unique couples+ Couples showcase different forms of romance (Or stages)-  Some generic couples-  Side characters are worthlessArt: Made by Production Reed, the animation for Niijiro days is a rather standard form of animation that doesn\'t particularly stand out.  The quality is good, the colors are bright and colorful, but there\'s nothing particularly unique about it.The show\'s comedic stylings are more geared towards the comedic face changes to show exaggeration or any other emotion, which is mainly used just to show us the kinds of feelings or tension that are going on at the moment.  They\'re not overused so that\'s a good thing.Overview:+ Good quality art+ No overuse of its comedic artworkSound: The tracks for Niijiro...they\'re not really all that special.  The tracks for the 2 OPs and EDs of the series are songs sung by the four main male characters that actually don\'t have much merit to them.  They sound so bland and uninspiring that it wasn\'t really worth listening to.In addition...Uchiyama Yumi, Tsutsui Mari\'s seiyuu, did a very...annoyingly good job at playing her character.  I have to point this out specifically because her performance is so annoyingly good that my distaste towards this character only elevated.  Just this shrill, ear-piercing voice shouting ""Anna!"" is a performance I have to commend despite my negativity towards this character.Overview:+/- That annoyingly good tsundere performance-  Soundtrack was rather genericPersonal Enjoyment: Niijiro was a shoujo romance that peaked my interest.  I mostly thought when I first saw it that it was gonna revolve around only one guy trying to get his romance going while his friends poked him and laughed at him for his attempts.  Bit mean, I admit, but that\'s what I thought before I read the manga and started to watch this show.  Niijiro is a series that I don\'t particularly hate, but at the same time, there\'s nothing about it that remotely screams originality or interesting.Did I like this series?It was fine.  Nothing really stood out about it and I don\'t really hate much of what they did.  I went into this expecting to have no progress, and as expected, nothing except maybe the spark actually occurred.  I also find Nozomi to be a very...interesting character.What didn\'t I like about this series?Mari.  Mari is by far the most irritating character in this entire show and I will not stand to have her shout Anna in my ears anymore.  There\'s nothing even cute about her because she always seems uncomfortable with the current situation and that there\'s always a stick up her ass.Would I recommend this series?Niijiro Days isn\'t really all that special in comparison to other shoujo romances.  Its only draw comes from the fact that the show has 4 couples so you don\'t have to just root for one.  Aside from that, there\'s nothing unique or special about it.  So if you\'re looking for a shoujo romance, then this is worth a pick up.  If not, then I would suggest to not watch this. series), Nat-chan is given a tissue by a passerby Santa girl with whom he falls smitten to.

This couple in particular soaks up most of the series\'s screentime and is the one relationship that the series tries to put together the most.  Despite that, the show doesn\'t really...do much to actually put them together.  Anna is a very oblivious character and is easily influenced to the point it\'s actually quite dangerous to leave her alone due to how easily she could be picked up, and Nat-chan is very shy and flustered about his own feelings to the point that he can\'t confess and most of his attempts crash and burn.  They\'re pretty typical in terms of generic shoujo romances, so as a relationship, they\'re not really all that progressive or unique.Then there\'s Mat-tsun and Mari, the secondary couple of the series.  Mat-tsun is a playboy type character while Mari is Tsun.  No dere, just tsun.  (Her last name is Tsutsui, but I think it should be Tsuntsun instead).  These two...are somewhat aggravating if I\'ll be completely honest.  Particularly Mari.  The majority of their \'relationship\' is more or less a game of cat and mouse, where Mat-tsun tries to chase down the annoying and shrill tsun child without really getting any results.  They have a few episodes that are devoted to them and their relationship, but similar to most of the other couples, the end result doesn\'t really prove to be in any way progressional.  In fact, Mari exists more as an obstacle to the series if anything.  Her characteristics are of being this man hating girl who solely just wants Anna to stay by her side and no one else, constantly complaining if someone \'takes her away\' and for the majority of the series, despising the idea of the male characters even coming into the picuture.Then there\'s Kei-kun and Nozomi.  Kei-kun is a sadist who carries a whip around with him because hey why not?  While Nozomi is Mat-tsun\'s younger sister who is quite literally the definition of lovesick.  This couple probably gets the least amount of attention out of everyone.  Hell, they get the least amount of screentime compared to everyone else.  The brunt of their relationship is the girl chasing the guy while also playing the waiting game due to Nozomi\'s dedication despite getting rejected.  There\'s not really much to say about them and this just shows how unbalanced the show is in the way of exploring these individual romantic relationships.And finally we have the one OTP that actually exists in the series, Tsuyoponnu and Yukirin.  As the gaming/otaku couple of the group, these are the only two characters that actually are dating.  (Ya gotta cover all bases)  Their screentime is mostly devoted to starting some plotlines as well as giving advice to some of the other couples because well, they\'re the successful ones.  Aside from that, they have their fair share of lovey dovey moments and that\'s pretty much their purpose in the series.  They\'re a cute couple but since they\'ve already \'succeeded\', there\'s not really much else the series could do for them.Side characters are practically non-existent.  The few that are in the series fade away very quickly and only show up for 1 episode, maybe 2 max.  As such, there\'s nothing to really say for the side characters good or bad, so we\'re moving on.Overview:+ Some unique couples+ Couples showcase different forms of romance (Or stages)-  Some generic couples-  Side characters are worthlessArt: Made by Production Reed, the animation for Niijiro days is a rather standard form of animation that doesn\'t particularly stand out.  The quality is good, the colors are bright and colorful, but there\'s nothing particularly unique about it.The show\'s comedic stylings are more geared towards the comedic face changes to show exaggeration or any other emotion, which is mainly used just to show us the kinds of feelings or tension that are going on at the moment.  They\'re not overused so that\'s a good thing.Overview:+ Good quality art+ No overuse of its comedic artworkSound: The tracks for Niijiro...they\'re not really all that special.  The tracks for the 2 OPs and EDs of the series are songs sung by the four main male characters that actually don\'t have much merit to them.  They sound so bland and uninspiring that it wasn\'t really worth listening to.In addition...Uchiyama Yumi, Tsutsui Mari\'s seiyuu, did a very...annoyingly good job at playing her character.  I have to point this out specifically because her performance is so annoyingly good that my distaste towards this character only elevated.  Just this shrill, ear-piercing voice shouting ""Anna!"" is a performance I have to commend despite my negativity towards this character.Overview:+/- That annoyingly good tsundere performance-  Soundtrack was rather genericPersonal Enjoyment: Niijiro was a shoujo romance that peaked my interest.  I mostly thought when I first saw it that it was gonna revolve around only one guy trying to get his romance going while his friends poked him and laughed at him for his attempts.  Bit mean, I admit, but that\'s what I thought before I read the manga and started to watch this show.  Niijiro is a series that I don\'t particularly hate, but at the same time, there\'s nothing about it that remotely screams originality or interesting.Did I like this series?It was fine.  Nothing really stood out about it and I don\'t really hate much of what they did.  I went into this expecting to have no progress, and as expected, nothing except maybe the spark actually occurred.  I also find Nozomi to be a very...interesting character.What didn\'t I like about this series?Mari.  Mari is by far the most irritating character in this entire show and I will not stand to have her shout Anna in my ears anymore.  There\'s nothing even cute about her because she always seems uncomfortable with the current situation and that there\'s always a stick up her ass.Would I recommend this series?Niijiro Days isn\'t really all that special in comparison to other shoujo romances.  Its only draw comes from the fact that the show has 4 couples so you don\'t have to just root for one.  Aside from that, there\'s nothing unique or special about it.  So if you\'re looking for a shoujo romance, then this is worth a pick up.  If not, then I would suggest to not watch this.', ""True definition of a rom-com, that portrays amazingly what friendship between guys is.Story 8 I Art 8 I Sound 8 I Character 9 I Enjoyment 8 I Overall: 8Whats good about this anime?+Amazing chemistry among characters, this aspect of the show is just amazing how even though the main characters are really different from each other they feel so close, just amazing.+Good Art style, not kyoto animation kind of art but beautiful when it...has to be.+A rom-com thats actually funny+Voice Actors are just perfect in this anime, really good castWhats bad?-Dont expect to much story from it, it started really good with the first episodes, then it turns okay- Heroine was just meh, I mean it was just right but it could ve been betterSo I reccommend this series if you are looking for a heartwarming love and comedy experience, don't expect it to be intelectually challanging or difficult plots, its just what it is, a lighthearted rom-com,Best aspect of this show are the characters, they carried all the kind of cliche story and make it actually really good has to be.+A rom-com thats actually funny+Voice Actors are just perfect in this anime, really good castWhats bad?-Dont expect to much story from it, it started really good with the first episodes, then it turns okay- Heroine was just meh, I mean it was just right but it could ve been betterSo I reccommend this series if you are looking for a heartwarming love and comedy experience, don't expect it to be intelectually challanging or difficult plots, its just what it is, a lighthearted rom-com,Best aspect of this show are the characters, they carried all the kind of cliche story and make it actually really good"", ""The story revolved around a group of four students; the hopeless romantic guy Natsuki Hashiba (Natcchan), Tomoya Matsunaga (Mattsun) who is the playboy type, the cheerful and sadistic guy, Keiichi Katakura (Kei-chan) and Tsuyoshi Naoe (Tsuyopon), the one  with the least words and also the smartest in the group. This anime begins with the encounter of Natcchan with a girl named Anna Kobayakawa on Christmas eve. He fell in love at first sight and since then he tried to get closer to her. Together with the main plot, it also tells the love story of the other three and how they support each other...as a group of friends.

However, at some point it is too plain and predictable until it becomes a bit boring. The comedy seems natural, appropriate and not overly done.Art and animation:The arts are okay and acceptable. One thing that is worth mentioning here is the characters' hair color that are very stand out. This is to enhance the characters' personality. For example, mattsun's hair is red and it suits his personalities, a boy who is confident and popular while tsuyopon's hair is blue showing his reserve and calm character. All the ridiculous colorful hair serve as the mood lifter and strengthen the characters.sounds:The opening and the ending theme songs are not the 'ear-bugging' type but still enjoyable and reflecting the theme of the anime.Characters:The strongest point of the anime is the characters. They are well defined and well developed from the very start of the series except for Anna. Anna seems emotionless rather than being shy and kind girl. A part from that, I love how different the characters are make from each other. They are all unique. To be honest, the most out-standing couple is mattsun and mari-chan.Enjoyment:In terms of enjoyment, the highest score that can be given is 7. As said previously, the story is too simple. The outcome of each of the conflict in the anime can also be predicted thus limiting the adrenaline rush. The love story however, is as sweet as a cherry pie and become the saviour of the series.Overall:The series is considered as fun if you are in relaxed mode.

That's what the quite controversial sudden ending of Nijiiro Days brought upon us. I won't spoil it, but to some it was disappointing since it didn't give proper closure but to manga readers like me, it was perfectly fine and understandable, especially since the show was a low budget manga sales booster in the first place.Youthful and cute, Nijiiro Days is all about exploring and reminding people of how beautiful youth is and what better way to show it than...through the eyes of a high school group of friends and throw in some lovely romance in between as well? It's result? A super cute and fun to watch slice of life that just can't stop giving me these sweet moments. Since it's a slice of life the story was given less priority so it was quite understandable to see that little to no plot progression was seen as that's definitely not the focus of a slice of life. Apart from that it's plot scenarios were already seen before by many but were made even cuter by the amazing and cute characters. Since I'm repeating this a lot, I'll say it now itself and continue, Nijiiro Days is an anime that isn't the type which is serious and thick-headed. Nijiiro Days is an anime that you watch to relax and reminisce your youth if you're an adult or regret the fact that you didn't do anything in high school because you're too busy watching anime (ouch, that went personal). Nonetheless, Nijiiro Days is a cute and funny intake on the beauty of youth and is definitely worth the watch if you're looking for a nice slice of life to watch and enjoy and leave the show with a smile.With that out of the way let's move on to the best the show has to offer: adorable characters. I've said this a lot before and I'll say it again: characters aren't just personalities, they give the show itself a personality and it's important that they are done well, which I'm happy to say was captured by Nijiiro Days perfectly. It had a Flustery non-dense MC for once which I felt was a breeze since romance anime nowadays are filled with dense MCs who don't know anything. This time the roles got pretty much reversed. Then we had a masochist (Matsunaga) and a Tsundere (Tsutsui?) who were adorable and hilarious to watch. Keichi got less focus on romance but he was a joy to watch, not to mention Nozomi who just so happens to be one of my favorite cutest characters from the show. She was adorbs! Everyone was!!! And did I forget to mention the best couple? Naoe and Yukirin were goals! I rarely use such Instagram-my language but I've got to say Nijiiro Days just brings it all out of you.It wasn't just how amazing these characters were alone, what made them so awesome was that they all were intertwined so well in their interactions and the way they interacted was just so fun and at many times relatable to watch. I won't be surprised if my final score leads up to be my highest rated slice of life. It's just that good (said that twice now). Frankly I was surprised that Nijiiro Days had such amazing art with a low budget and so it felt doubly impressive. All the characters looked beautiful as well as vibrant. The color palette used was excellent since it was bright and fit in with the theme of youth perfectly and I'm sure the palette also fit in with your 4k monitor to you PC fans out there. Meanwhile Sonar Pocket did so well with both the OPs that its hard to imagine I still haven't downloaded their songs yet. I will definitely search for more of their songs now since their current selection for Nijiiro was so youthful and nostalgic.After seeing all this positivity and seeing no negativity you might guess I enjoyed this show to the max and yes you're absolutely right. Such slice of life anime are hard to come by so I was glad I came across the manga which ultimately led to me watching this beauty as well so it was all good. Yet questions remain. Why wasn't this full length? Why isn't the show getting a second season? Why did we get a non-closure ending? The reason for all three might lie in the fact that the show's budget was pretty less. Lesser than usual. Why? The purpose of the anime wasn't anything like other anime, the purpose of this anime in particular was to raise awareness and boost dropping manga sales for the manga and frankly the show helped the manga set it back on track and to be honest I couldn't be happier since this meant the show achieved it's target. Yes I do feel a slight regret we didn't get to see more but since I already read the manga there's no use fretting over it. Another possible reason why they didn't give the show an anime exclusive ending might as well be for the second season itself, since if they don't give closure that would mean they'd be able to do a season 2 soon but that seems unlikely since sequel seasons are hard to come by for slice of life anime simply because they don't need them to raise sales. Which is why I'm satisfied with what I have (still, I won't be forgiving them so easily in the story section).In the end Nijiiro Days is an excellent testament to the slice of life genre and the spirit of friendship, youth and love itself. Its only downfall being the sudden ending Nijiiro Days checks a lot of the boxes which make it great and overall it's definitely worth a watch especially if you love slice of life like I do. So? Will you give the show a try? I don't see much loss since if you're watching for the cuteness and the laughs you won't be disappointed. And you could always read the manga if you wanted ;) through the eyes of a high school group of friends and throw in some lovely romance in between as well? It's result?

And you could always read the manga if you wanted ;)"", 'Nijiiro Days was basically any romance anime you\'ve ever seen, except the episodes literally last 10 minutes - which is kind of annoying to have to constantly switch episodes if you\'re binging it like I did (at least it\'s not Sweet Love Patisserie with five minute content), but on the better side, there\'s 24 episodes, making it last just as long as any other 20 minute series with 12 episodes.Moving aside from the episode length, we should begin with the story. Like any other synopsis will give, the series begins with high school student Natsuki Hashiba heartbroken from a harsh parting from his ex...on Christmas night, along with his love interest Anna Kobayakawa coming to his aid. Soon after, Natsuki discovers she goes to her school and a romance ""blossoms"". I don\'t have too much to say about this beginning aside from it\'s clicheness being kind of tacky but not the worst I\'ve seen.Later on in the series, each of Natsuki\'s three best friends end up getting paired with other girls, and the eight of them end up becoming good friends. It was pretty coincidental it ended up like that, though - four guys, and four girls to match. (One of the pairs was already a couple before this happened though.)Each character was unique and I enjoyed seeing the variety in the friend group; there was everything from a frantic cosplayer, to an accused sister complex. It was interesting, to say the least.(slight spoilers)One character I will comment on would definitely be Anna.I get that she\'s supposed to be really quiet and shy, but aside from this, she has 0 personality, which made me upset because Natsuki was such a great character who fell in love with such a mundane girl, which lead to me not caring an ounce about their relationship. They managed to get Tsuyoshi (another shy character) to be really intriguing because of his feelings toward Yukirin (his girlfriend), so why didn\'t they just add more emotion in her dialogue? I get she\'s to ""discover her feelings"" or whatever, but she became boring. I didn\'t even focus on the main couple because of this. What the fuck?It really got my hopes up to see the four pairs get put together, but because of Anna eating up all the screentime with ""whY Do I feEl tHIs WaY?"" none of the relationships actually went anywhere.Speaking of, the art and sound were all generic. Nothing jumped out to me, and it was the same as any other anime. I only kept going because of how adorable and good the characters were; they were what saved the show.This series could\'ve been really enjoyable, but instead was boringly average. Overall, Nijiiro Days is not a bad show - yet, it is far from good.

It's an adaptation of the ongoing manga with the same name. Episodes are about 12 minutes long, meaning that the 24 episodes basically comprise a single kur.The story initially focuses on the four boy gang, but as time progresses (thankfully for the boys) an equal number of girls are added to the mix, creating the familiar “mina-oriented”  storyline. As a result, the focus is not on a single protagonist, but to the whole group of friends. The characters are distinct and...their development visible, although some platitudes exist on their characterization.Expanding on that, the show has a formulaic feeling to it; If I had a list with all the genre's trites, I would be able to cross each item off. Having said that, none of the banalities reach that particular level of annoyance that anime are known for; the main (wannabe) couple is dense, but not that dense; the man-hating girl does not become exasperating; hey, we even have an actual couple and a couple of kisses!All and all, the group works great, producing comedy and that warm, peaceful, and fuzzy feeling that the fans of this cliché-ridden genre (like yours truly) seek. Another elements that adds to the peaceful setting, is that the anime is down to earth; no Ouran Koukou or Special A grandiose displays of wealth, intellect, or general over-the-top-ness. Instead, the boys interact in a natural way between them, trading jabs, talking about girls, and being typical boys. Because of that, I was surprised when I found out that the mangaka is a girl. Each of the girls is unique, finding a way to be both charming, interesting, and (of course) cute. On a final note, the art is OK; nothing special, but it does not drag the anime down.Nijiiro days delivers what the name (rainbow days) promises; a nice group of friends, a bit of comedy, and  a bigger bit of romance. While it is not the most original nor the best,  it is a solid addition to the genre. I  hope for a second season. 7/10. their development visible, although some platitudes exist on their characterization.Expanding on that, the show has a formulaic feeling to it; If I had a list with all the genre's trites, I would be able to cross each item off.

This anime was the first that made me not think that way, and I think thats a good thing. If your looking for a comedy/romance anime just to pass the time I suggest to watch it cause why not.The characters are not your typical romance characters,...if you know what I mean.

Which brings out funny and cute moments so I think its a good thing.My overall rating is 7 which might seem quite low but the only reason is cause this anime is just to past the time its not something that really got me hooked on although I do read the manga and enjoy it twice as much, the anime is still good. if you know what I mean.

It's not a slice of life but more to romance and friendship, and I like it especially the bond between the boys. The art is simple and okay. But, I love the soundtrack the most, well I don't expect less from Sonar Pocket, I like their song as always :)Characters are great, they've got simple personalities with not too much complicated going on within themselves. I like how they are honest with others and themselves. Just for that one character, if this anime/manga doesn't have that annoying-disturbing girl (why author...loves to put this kind of personality?), I would give 8/9 for character wise.I like this anime a lot, because it's easy to watch, and relaxing to get a rest from many intense-themed anime. I recommend this anime because this anime is simple and comforting. Though the ending could be better, but I hope that's just because they'll give another season?

As seems to be the trend with shoujos, the main characters are boys, in this case four close friends who avoid club activities. All of them are in varying stages of dating (or trying to date) their respective girlfriend, and they help (or tease) each other as they go through their trials and tribulations. That\'s pretty much the entire anime, some people will obviously not want anything to do with it, but it does...have a certain appeal to many of us.It will not win any originality award, but at the same time it is not just one cliche after the other, the main characters all have distinct personalities and some are a bit fresh. They go through many of the relationship anime standard plot devices but don\'t really dwell too much on generic drama like the cocky rival love interest who appears just as things were starting to go okay for the main couple. Mostly each episode is a little romp at the usual places - karaoke bar, the beach, the hot springs hotel, etc.It actually works pretty well with the short format, although I found myself getting behind on purpose and enjoying it a lot more to watch several of these in one session. Since it\'s such a breezy show it\'s hard to maintain your concern over the romantic cliffhangers for an entire week sometimes.The characters are not hyper-realistic but they\'re not cartoon version of high schoolers that you can\'t relate to at all. When the guys learn their buddy\'s girlfriend\'s pet name for him and tease him for the rest of the series about it, or when the thorny Mari-chan makes her many appearances to disrupt the easy-going flow of the other characters, this is all stuff that can fondly remind me of my own ""rainbow days"".Shorts always get under-rated on MAL for some reason, I really think if you like fun (but not silly) relationship drama animes, this is a must watch even despite the rating and it being shorts. have a certain appeal to many of us.It will not win any originality award, but at the same time it is not just one cliche after the other, the main characters all have distinct personalities and some are a bit fresh.

I\'m really surprised I ended up liking it this much, actually.So, as far as the art and sound go, I\'d say it was pretty average. Honestly, there could\'ve been some really awesome sound design done with this anime that wasn\'t 100% there, but I really don\'t get too picky about that sort of stuff, so it doesn\'t matter.The story itself was decent. It was a little bit cliche, but I think that it was done well. I like that the story followed four romances (or beginnings of a few romances) without it being segmented....It wasn\'t like each character got their own set of episodes; it was all connected together like a normal story would be. I do think that the story was maybe a little too eager with the romance aspects because it felt like the characters fell in love a bit too quickly. I don\'t necessarily think it\'s a bad thing for characters to realize it quickly, but it still would\'ve been nice to have a bit of lead-up for a couple of them.Okay, so characters. My motto is: give me a crappy story all you want, but you better give me dynamite characters. This anime pretty much delivered. Again, there are cliched character relationships and character personalities, but this anime presented them so well so that they seemed funny and interesting. Part of that is probably because every seiyuu is awesome, but I think a lot of it is also because you get to watch these characters be authentic. Also, the main girl isn\'t an idiot like a lot of main female characters are in romance anime. Not as in stupid, but as in someone who doesn\'t even know that romantic love is a thing that exists and they probably just blush when they\'re around a certain person because they have a cold. So, I\'m happy that she isn\'t one of those because I would\'ve been turned off right away.All in all, it isn\'t a perfect story, but the characters especially made it comforting and peaceful to watch. I\'d definitely recommend it, and now I\'m gonna read the manga, because something tells me it\'s gonna be even better.

That's how boring she was. I still don't get why Natsuki was so into her.2.) I didn't like the ending. I mean seriously IT WAS SO BAD. It just made no sense.

It seems to have the same formula that most typical shojou manga and anime have. I\'m not going to jump into every detail about what makes a shoujo a shoujo. We all know darn well at this point! My disappointment in this series is more about the execution of the storyline(s) and the utter boringness that seems to hover over the entire show. Natsuki and Anna are your stereotypical protagonists, and all of Natsuki\'s friends fall...under the umbrella of ""stereotypical shoujo friends"". The only thing that sets them apart I suppose, would be that each person has some focus on them at some point in the story. The attempts to flesh out the characters were quite weak. We don\'t KNOW these people on a very deep level.For example:Mattsun is your run of the mill ""player/handsome"" character.Kei-chan is a cute faced sadist towards anyone who will allow it.Tsuyopon is the quiet, expressionless otaku friend (also the only one in an established relationship).(the females who join the friend group):Yukirin is Tsuyopon\'s hardcore otaku girlfriend who loves to cosplayNozomi is Mattsun\'s little sister who becomes romantically obsessed with Kei-chan.Mari is Anna\'s self proclaimed ""guy hating"" best friend, and quite frankly the most annoying person to walk the earth- and yet somehow ends up dating Mattsun.None of these characters leave much of a lasting impression by the end of the series. Thus, why I think the storylines were so poorly done. There\'s nothing wrong with ""stereotypical"" characters, but if you don\'t give them an interesting story then what\'s the point?

The boys are all genuinely nice guys who care a lot about each other and I feel like in a lot of anime, there's typically some sort of drama in regards to that. This anime doesn't do that and that's a good thing. Also because there are multiple sub-couples,...we are exposed to many different perspectives which makes this anime so much worth watching.

Aside that, the 10-minutes episodes were totally relaxing to watch and I thought despite of the length of each episode the anime got no problem to deal with it.But I must say that the op‘s and ed’s were not the best and I skipped them nearly...every time (I know there are many people out there who has an opposite opinion, so assure yourself)I would recommended „nijiiro days“ to everyone who likes romance, comedy and easy-to-watch anime. every time (I know there are many people out there who has an opposite opinion, so assure yourself)I would recommended „nijiiro days“ to everyone who likes romance, comedy and easy-to-watch anime.', 'Such a super cute, quick watch!

Saber Marionette J to X,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1231/Saber_Marionette_J_to_X,"[""Well this is my first review, and since no one else has written one for this show I figured now might be a good time.First off for those that plan to watch the show, the plot synopsis is rather glaringly wrong. Faust is not an enemy in this series and the saber dolls do not fall in love with Otaru.Now the first thing one would ask when watching a sequel is whether or not it measures up to it's prequel. In my opinion it is not as good as the prequel, but there is still a lot to like. The music and sound have improved...since the start, which may appeal to some. The fight scenes aren't spectacular but get the job done, giving the sense of strength that the marionettes possess.  It's where character and story become involved that things get iffy.Shows like this aren't exactly known for their deep plots full of betrayal and woe, so where story goes you have to look at it in a certain light. The story wasn't bad, but at times felt painfully obvious. In all honesty though the show did really grip me in the key points and I really enjoyed it. The main problem I had was that it really chugged at points, making me lose all interest. When the show picked up it was good but pushing through was difficult for me at times. The show had a great ending that had originality (as far as I know, anyway) and really made me want more episodes, so even though it was slow at times it did have really good moments as well.Character development is also a rather large hurdle this show tripped on. The marionettes have mostly grown their maiden circuits to the max from the first series and did not change much from that end on. The first series had a strong plot foundation for development that tried to stretch into this show as well, but in my opinion did a lackluster job of it. That being said, while the characters did not do much developing, I still enjoyed their varied personalities a great deal and really enjoyed the show.Final Words:Nothing showstopping. Really just stretching the material for another season, but for those who enjoyed the first, a great continuation with a stellar ending that made me sad it was over and wanting more episodes, and really what more can you ask for? since the start, which may appeal to some.

It isn't groundbreaking at all, but if you don't hate predictable romance anime, it is a perfect way to cheer you up when you're feeling a little down.Onda Aka is a rookie voice actress who one day encounters the salary man Matsumaru Fumihiko, who's been stood up by his date, in front of the cinema. Long story short, Aka makes Matsumaru watch the movie together with her and the flames of love are ignited. Later the same...night, Aka's apartment catches fire and she is taken in by Matsumaru. Romantic events ensue, but when waking up the next day, neither of them regards themselves as a real couple. Incidentally, they end up working together with the marketing of Matsumaru's latest invention: a leaf-shaped crisp. Aka is - of course - voicing the product's mascot, Neko-ki - a tree with a cat's head.The focal point of the story is, not surprisingly, the development of the two main characters' relationship and how it is affected by Aka's rise in popularity; is it right for her to prioritize her career even though it leads to her not being able to spend time with Matsumaru? Though the story is far from original, I still really cared about Aka and Matsumaru. Because REC is, unlike most other anime belonging in this genre, not full of unnecessary melodrama or supernatural elements - it is realistic, and that makes it so much more engaging.Animation studio SHAFT, of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and ef - a tale of memories fame, is responsible for the animation. REC's visuals don't impress at all, but they suffice; Aka is heart-wrenchingly cute and Matsumaru is... well... ordinary. Backgrounds and the like are good as well.The seiyuu (voice actors) did a great job with all the characters, including the minor ones, enhancing the warm atmosphere of the anime greatly. Music was always fitting though far from memorable. The opening wasn't my cup of tea, but, then again, I couldn't care less.To summarize, REC isn't the most innovative romance anime around, but it's realistic approach to the genre makes it refreshing and the chemistry between the characters (who are the series' greatest strength) is wonderful and Aka and Matsumaru's feelings toward each other feel genuine. I would not have complained had it been longer, but it's shortness may also be a strength; it never got even close to boring, even though I watched it all in one sitting.A highly recommended anime to all romance fans. night, Aka's apartment catches fire and she is taken in by Matsumaru.

Sometimes those are are hard to find, yet here we are with Rec. It is the story about a guy and girl living under the same roof. Seems kind of cliche, until it actually gives a legit reason: her house burned down (sorry I saw the title and the burning house and immediately thought of mix tapes, I'm so ashamed). I know the length of the episodes seems intimidating, but it was not bad at all. I applaud the series for actually giving us something to enjoy while putting it in half the...time frame of most other series. Now, lets dig into this...Story-7Short, yet effective, those are the best words to summarize this. We have our guy, Matsumaru, waiting outside a movie theater. Why, you may ask? He got dumped. By a woman whom most viewers will probably dislike. He then meets a 20 year old girl named Ako, and will precede to find solace in getting plastered with her. They will then walk home and everything will be over. Or so they thought. Sucks when your house burns down. So that's how we come to them living together. He works for a candy company and comes up with ideas for them to use. She is a novice voice actress. Throughout this series they have to deal with success while also balancing the feelings they start to have for each other. That's it. It's a nice, simple story to unwind to after a stressful day. It is not a bad story riddled by plot holes, nor is it an absolute masterpiece. It is just a refreshing look into the real world of business.Art- 7The art is average. It is along the same lines as the story, refreshing, yet not stunning. It uses mildly dull colors so it's not going to vomit rainbows in your face. The leading girl looks quite cute, and this series emphasized that. The guy was pretty standard for an anime protagonist. Overall I gave the art a decent score because I thought the art was fitting to what the series was aiming for.Sound- 6The weakest aspect. Not much to say here. There was no op or ed. You have background music and sound effects when the title roles on screen. Although those could be humorous at times. Really there was nothing bad about any of it as far as I could tell. It did what it had to do and didn't leap over mountains to give us auditory pleasure.Character- 9This I thought was great. For such a short series they really managed to capture the people we really care about. The male protagonist is just a man trying to rise up in the business world. The leading heroine is just a female voice actress trying to accomplish her dream. Throughout this series we get to see them both succeed and fail, and what it does to them afterward. We have all had times where we failed at something and took it out on others, that's where our male protagonist has trouble. We have all had moments where we had to do things we didn't want to do for our benefit, and that's where our heroine had trouble. It was pleasing to see such relatable problems on anime characters, and the series did a great job at portraying them. The rest of the characters are there to act as foils for the relationship of the two. We have Ako's manager who is strict, yet understanding. We have  Matsumaru's co-worker who tries to cheer him up and let us know he is not a complete loner at work. And we have the woman who stood him up, who acts as an inciter of jealousy in Ako. In the end, she helps us realize the depth to which Ako cares for Matsumaru. Only problem I have is that Ako is all touchy-feely with Matsumaru in the beginning but then flat out denies they're together for most of the series. We know better, right?Enjoyment-9A fantastic little series I thought. I happen to love romance anime and this is one that would be a disappointment to miss. I enjoyed the down to earth setting, story, and characters. They were a good break from witches, warlocks, super power lolies, and everything else anime sometimes throws at us.Overall-8A cute little series.

Audrey Hepburn was a huge inspiration for the show’s aspiring voice actress Aka, and the show embraced her movie titles and movie quotes in each episode.I warn you that you may not like this show if you’re expecting a steamy hot romance. It's more about the development of a romance. Some people who watched Rec, including me, rated it with a very low score, because it’s incredibly boring at first viewing. However, Rec is different from most other romance anime and not as cliché. It reflects on...reality by displaying the disappointment and challenges of balancing a professional life with a private life. Rec revolves around an aspiring voice actress (Aka) and a marketer (Matsu) dealing with the struggles and pressure of work. One problem I had was that their relationship happened quite fast with Aka moving into Matsu’s place the same day they met, because her place burned down without any given reason. On a positive note, Rec goes behind the scenes of the media industry and excitingly shows the transition of a popular seiyuu, including the advertisement and work inside the studio.There are a few problems I had with the characters. If it were not for the revelation of Aka’s age (20 years) and scenes of her drinking beer, this show would seriously appear as a lolicon. She literally looks and sounds like a little girl, while Matsu looks like an old man despite being 26. Matsu can honestly get pretty annoying. He is a loner who is desperate for a girlfriend and relieved when Aka walks into his life. This causes him to act perverted at times, and it may be entertaining and funny for someone who enjoys anime where a guy constantly experiences rejection. I honestly didn’t like it. Apart from that, Aka and Matsu are strong as a pair. They show support and feelings for each other as they work together in their career. The supporting characters contribute to the pair’s relationship by revealing life’s disappointments and giving advice that has an impact on them. They also participate in each of their careers and show how the media industry works in Japan.The artwork looks old as if it’s from the 1990s instead of the 2000s. It resembles something out of a childrens’ book. The colors are bland. The backgrounds are plainly drawn, and the only activity are from the main characters. The rest of the society is still. The character design was average. The females were the only attractive characters in the show, and the males could not nearly compare. The settings, including recording studios, are drawn realistically as it suits the atmosphere of voice actors and advertisers.The OP, sung by Kanako Sanai (voice of Aka), is pretty good, but it could be unattractive to others. The truth is the lyrics of the OP describes the show perfectly: “Don’t give up/Embrace all of your worries.” Not only does it describe their relationship, but it says not to let life get you down at the worst of times.  The seiyuu expressed appropriate emotions for situations, including jealousy and excitement. The background music and sound effects fit the atmosphere well.Rec is an anime that you’ll have to rewatch with a different mindset if you did not enjoy it the first time. Honestly, the few people that scored Rec below a 7 were bored out of their minds just like I was. I planned to drop it during my first viewing, but it didn’t make sense for me to drop an anime that only has nine 12-minute episodes. I couldn’t stand the anime, and the OP was completely annoying at first. After rewatching it, I actually enjoy it more than other romance anime, and the OP is one of my favorites.

The relationship between the two main characers were perfect, as they explored the growth their personal and work lives.The female Onda, Aka played the cute, happy, but vulnerable role quite well. At times you really wanted to strangle Matsumaru, Fumihiko ; who appears to be more crass than other sensitive male leading roles.Perhaps it is truthfulness like this which mirrors real life; that adds to the beauty of this series. Now I&quot;ll have to look to see if there are any Manga out for this.(PS there is and it is...ongoing. The anime touches volume one and they are currently into Volume 5)Enjoy. ongoing. The anime touches volume one and they are currently into Volume 5)Enjoy."", ""Rec is a romantic comedy about an aspiring voice actress. The manga was written by Hanamizawa Q-Tarou in 2002 and is still ongoing. In 2006 it got a nine episode anime adaptation. I've never read the manga, but how does a long running series translate into nine twelve minute episodes? Let's take a look at Rec and find out.The plot is very simple. A guy, Matsumaru, gets stood up for a movie date. As he's about to throw the tickets away he's approached by a girl, Aka, who tells him not to waste them. They go to the movies and then drinking together. After they...part ways her apartment burns down and she doesn't have any family or friends whatsoever so she ends up moving in with Matsumaru, how very convenient. Actually, convenient is the wrong word, contrived would be more accurate. The series is about her and Matsumaru living together and trying to keep their connection a secret for no adequately explained reason. It's every bit as stupid as it sounds. Does the comedy work? No, there are no funny moments in Rec, not one. Just the contrived romance.The characters don't help matters. Aka and Matsumaru have no chemistry which makes the romance aspect just seem even more forced. They're also complete morons, as are all of the minor characters. Which makes them just annoying to watch.The art is the best part of the series. It's pretty well done with some good details. There are some moments where the sound is out of sync with the characters' mouths but that isn't a major issue.The voice acting isn't bad. It's not anything spectacular or with any stand out performances but it's decent. The actors probably could've done better if they'd had decent dialogue. The music isn't bad but it's not good either. It's pretty forgettable.The yuri factor is a 1/10. There is no yuri in this.My final rating for Rec is a 2/10. It's a terrible anime. The decent art and average voice acting can't make up for the terrible story, failed humour or moronic characters. part ways her apartment burns down and she doesn't have any family or friends whatsoever so she ends up moving in with Matsumaru, how very convenient.

There are 10 episodes in total that are about 12 mins each, I enjoyed the length of this anime because it was short and to the point, and quite heartwarming. Definitely a must watch for you Romance lovers out there.This story begins with Matsumaru waiting for his date at the movie theater, however, his date is a no-show, just when...he is about to give up on his date and throw away the tickets, Aka comes in to save the day! So they go to watch the movie together. Later on, a huge fire occurs, and her place is burned down, this is where Matsumaru comes in to save the day, he offers for her to stay at his place, and this my friends, is where the story begins.Story 8/10Even though the anime was fairly short with only 10 episodes that were 12 minutes each, it was a nice progression of the romance between the two. They were able to depict the working situation of both Aka and Matsumaru, and how they played a role in them becoming closer. The romance slowly starts to grow as they are living and working together, and of course, comes conflicts that they must overcome together. I also liked the fact I had not seen many anime with this type of story. The character following their dreams of becoming a voice actor, while also finding that special someone.Art 6/10The art was not anything special, but that is to be expected from a short anime from 2006. They did do a pretty good job on the main character designs, but the background details at times did have some lacking attributes, but as I said, it is a short anime.Sound 7/10The sounds were not really all that important in this anime, so they were alright, nothing great, nothing bad. The voice acting was done pretty well, Aka's voice actor matched perfect.Character 7/10They did not go into the past of either of the two, such as family or schools or anything, but they did a good job of portraying their feelings about situations, and also their goals in life. The supporting characters did not get much at all, but being that the anime is so short, that's understandable.Enjoyment 9/10I really enjoyed this anime. The shortness was something I actually enjoyed, it allowed me to see how they progressed romantically without wasting time on pointless side-story as in some anime. It was a really nice romance between the two, and to see it all come together was a real treat.Overall 8/10The reason for this 8 is the pure enjoyment I had seeing the romance in this anime. The story was great, I liked how they showed what the both of them went through in their work lives, and how that played a part in their romance, and vise versa.

The reason why I decided to watch it is just because it\'s from Shaft, thus I thought the artwork would be great with the unique Shaft style. My thoughts was wrong. (If you\'re not familiar with the word Shaft, it\'s an anime studio responsible for the unique artwork, gag, and cinematography of Bakemonogatari, Madoka Shoujo Madoka Magica, Nisekoi and much more)The story is about an office guy, a salary man(Japanese white collar businessman) to be precise, who is living with a girl who dreamt on becoming a voice actress. Although living together and already did...\'something\', the both of them doesn\'t consider themselves having a \'that\' sort of relationship . They also kept their living-together a secret from the others because they thought that it would affect their career.The pacing is a bit fast, well, maybe too rushed due to the fact that it\'s only 12 minutes per episode. There\'s nothing unique and complex about the story. It\'s quite predictable too. There are so many complications for both of the characters throughout the story. When the girl has a problem with her career, the guy takes care of it, and vice versa. What makes it \'not good\' is that some of it seems to be trivial but considered a big deal, and.... the other, which seems to be a really big deal, is taken lightly. Despite of that, the ending is really satisfying.Okay, so now let\'s talk about the artwork. Coming from Shaft........ It\'s horrible. It really looks like something coming out of the 90s. Compared to the other Shaft creation and anime(s) from 2006, it\'s really poor made. Seriously, it\'s not the quality of the video I have that makes it look bad, it\'s the anime itself.Characters. We have the main guy, Matsumaru Fumihiko, and the main girl, Onda Aka. Matsumaru is an average guy working as an average white-collar in a not-so average company. But hey, he\'s got himself a pretty average face. He likes to tease Onda and even \'tried\' to seduce her sometimes, and get\'s rejected \'almost\' every time. On the other hand Onda is an energetic girl who likes to imitate a certain voice actress. She really care about Matsumaru, but she doesn\'t consider themselves as partners for some reasons.Going through a lot of obstacle, their feelings seems to grow after each one. The development is really fast at the start, then it goes constant average throughout the rest. Though it\'s good overall. The side characters aren\'t that bad either.So, if you ask did I actually enjoyed this 12-minutes/ep anime? I pretty much did, despite the not-enjoyable artwork it has. But then again, the story, characters, developments are -imo- pretty decent. For a rom-com though, I don\'t really laugh that much. I actually didn\'t laugh at all. Jokes are too.... you know... how to say it... predictable i think. (i couldn\'t find an adjective for it.)Overall, \'Rec\' or レック is decent rom-com anime that didn\'t surpass the average status. It has some good points, but also some major flaws. I don\'t really recommend this anime, but if you like rom-coms and would like to watch anything of the sort, just try giving it a shot. It isn\'t a full episode anime and only has 9 episodes anyway.-Btw, after watching the first episode, I literally said ""Well, that escalated quickly."" \'something\', the both of them doesn\'t consider themselves having a \'that\' sort of relationship .

The colors of this anime is very simple if I must add they aren't really that contrast to look like the ones made in 2008 and above that are very clean and smooth and the colors shine brightly but this anime puts enough to give you the special eye shower of color.characters are all well developed other than the fact the episodes were to short to even get deeper into each of the characters back round story but that's not the main focus that they were trying to portray. they were trying to tell people how life was like between to people with to jobs that seemed kinda distant. but overall the characters were well done and easy to understand and get how they played their role with each of the their kind of personalities in the story.I really enjoyed this anime and because of the heart tugging and tear jerking feeling I had throughout the anime (that I don't feel that often in some romantic or sad stories which are horribly done) I would give this both a 10 for my enjoyment and overall. It was fun watching how both comedy and serous love and drama were balanced out and it gave a sense of reality for the characters to endure throughout living together.

In reality, what we get to see is the formation of an abusive relationship that is presented as the ideal romance. I’m at loss for words how disgusting this is. Apparently, the author is either an utterly broken victim of this in real life, or (more likely) a terrible human being that you...should stay as far away from as possible. In their sick, twisted mind, it is heartwarming to guilt-trip somebody into a relationship and take advantage of a helpless individual. This is wrong on so many levels, that I would like to erase it from my memory, or better yet, from existence. Do you think I’m joking? Take a closer look, it’s not hard to see. Aka has no reason to like Matsumaru, but she feels indebted to him, that’s why she swallows all the abuse. That’s a topic for the character sector, all I can say about the story is, there is no romance, just one guy wanting pussy and a girl in dire straits. The fact that Rec pretends to be a romance is ludicrous.1/10Art:This anime looks okay, but there is absolutely nothing special about it. Character design is okay, backgrounds are okay, animation is okay, it’s just a huge pile of okay. That’s acceptable for a ""romantic comedy"", which is supposed to score with other qualities. Yeah, that’s not much of a statement, but there really aren’t any strong or weak points to go into deeper detail about.6/10Sound:The music (including opening and ending song) are okay. Yeah, I know, but they just don’t give me anything to work with. The voice acting is a bit disappointing. I don’t doubt that Kanako Sakai is capable of a good performance, but if you voice a voice actress, aren’t you supposed to show off your abilities? Judging from her very small number of roles listed on MAL, I may not be the only one who thinks she’s rather meh in an ocean of great. The rest of the bunch does a decent job, but they don’t have any big challenges to master.5/10Characters:There is not a single likeable person in this cast. Matsumaru, the male lead is a despicable piece of shit, who keeps trying to take advantage of Aka all the time. Even worse, he somehow manages to twist the truth around to make her feel guilty about something that HE did. First he date-rapes her (I admit, this is debatable, but looking at how these two behave later on, I’d say the evidence is obvious), then he repeatedly tries to guilt her into sex by giving her shelter after her house burned down. When that fails, he terrorizes her with their work project, making her afraid of somebody finding out and being labeled as nepotist whore. After still not getting more pussy, he makes her feel responsible for his own failures at work and when he has her down to the point where she even apologizes for it, he literally tells her to fuck off. And to top it all off, after he managed to completely break her, he doesn’t ask her to be his girlfriend, no, he DEMANDS her to be his girlfriend. And don’t even get me started on when he tried to get himself another chick, that was a completely different kind of low that I don’t even want to speak about.So, does nobody help this poor girl out? How about her agent? Nope, her manager tells her to dub porn or her career is over. None of the side characters is of any help in any way, nor do they add much to the show as a whole.1/10Enjoyment:I hate this anime, it makes me sick just thinking about it. Everybody involved with this should feel ashamed. If they were trying to tell a different story, it could’ve maybe worked, but they want to sell me Rec as a romantic comedy, which it just isn’t. I’d rather accept Schindler’s List as one than this crap. Twilight is a better love story than this. But what shocks me the most is how many people apparently fell for it. My brain can’t comprehend the thinking process that goes into accepting these blatant lies. This isn\'t a personal attack if you happen to like this show, I just don\'t understand how or why. Anyway, any more words would be a waste of time, all you need to know is: Don’t watch it!1/10Overall:2.8/10 should stay as far away from as possible.

With Rec you really are not expecting anything amazing when you first notice it, but your voice of the series changes astonishingly fast. Really the series itself manages to grab you and keep you from the first episode right to the final scene.I want to talk about the Art and Animation first off. It's incredible, strictly speaking from a low budget series. The animation is fluid, it flows together very well. The art work is simple, almost...lazy in some parts. But with that said the art work itself was unique and part of what grabs you into the series. Beauty in the simplicity. Overall I'd rank the art at around an 8.2/10. Now to focus on what actually grabs and keeps an audience, The Story.With this series the story starts off quite innocent, you feel sorry for Matsumaru. You are introduced to cute main girl, Aka Onda(with an exceptional voice acting role by Kanako Sakai to mention). Then after the two enjoy a fated first meeting we are brought to the problem that brings this couple together. Now without spoiling anything, I can say it is not Deus-Ex like, but does seem kind of unluckily convenient for the story progression. With this Aka is invited to stay with Matsumaru, in which they begin a lovers relationship where they are not lovers. Now as the series progresses we have bonding moments and we having moments where the couple(who aren't actually a couple... yet?) are almost driven apart. But with turmoil comes the true feelings. And pray it is not too late. I an say the last 3 episodes have incredible pace for only being 33~ minutes of show time. The story had to be probably the best aspect for the series, personally I'd put it around 8.8/10.To close I just want to mention how the characters were handled and overall enjoyment of the series. Introduction of each character was done pretty good, based on the role said character would play. But with a short story kind of series, there was no character background. Did we need it? No. But for a development stand point, minimal. Except in the case of Matsumaru and Aka. You had them develop a very cute romance, you had the two learn about each other and you had them grow to love each other. All in all Rec was a great series, just something to put on if you want to unwind and relax with a cute little series. I personally think Shaft did a good job bringing this story out. lazy in some parts. But with that said the art work itself was unique and part of what grabs you into the series.

I researched about its plot and all, and considered it to be something I would really enjoy. After I saw the characters, I felt my hopes go down a bit, since it's a typical kind of anime style: with moe and all that crap. Although I only focused my attention on the girl and her moeness, and my negativity took over, this didn't hinder me from watching it. And I'm glad to have done that. Rec was such a great anime.It wasn't that...big of a deal, but that's what makes it great. It's such a laid-back, and something that you would watch with your best friend or your significant other.It kind of lacked something, which was the soundtrack. For me, the soundtrack always played a big role in animes. Though I liked the mini opening, it just wasn't enought to satisfy me.When I watched this anime, I felt that breezy feeling of nostalgia. Like trees are swaying, birds were chirping, and laughter from all the people can be audible: that's the feeling I got from Rec. Totally would RECommend.

REC unfortunately tends to devolve into the same ""MC is as dense as a brick, which causes misunderstandings"" comedy/drama that is horrifically common.All in all it\'s an enjoyable enough watch for it\'s length (short). The only caveat is under no circumstances should anyone ever read the original manga. It jumps off a cliff violently shortly after the anime ends, in the worst of ways. ', ""This series, while certainly cute an romantic, gets a lower score because at times it shows a totally disturbing view in the what might just be a cultural difference in relationships. The series is only 9 episodes (10 including the special) at 12 minutes each, and the relationship between Matsutaka and Aka seems somewhat  schizophrenic.Sometimes he is very kind and understanding towards Aka, and sometimes he is disturbingly sexually aggressive. Maybe in Japan that is to be expected since he is much older than her and they live together, but the lesson seems to be that Aka is wrong for not wanting to have...sex with  him. Maybe I'm being picky, and there are certainly people who like anime where the male is very assertive and dominant, but to me the way Aka is treated is somewhat abusive. He blows up at her for no reason, and even though he's very nasty to her she forgives him (even though he doesn't technically apologize). Some might say this is love, but as a person currently in a loving relationship knows it's more naiveté than anything else. This aspect of the anime is too distracting for me to enjoy it properly.If you like romantic anime, this is an OK choice. It's pretty quick and has some very cute moments. sex with  him.

At least most of them, and what I mean is that most romance animes don\'t give you the feeling of romance or a relationship, the hardships that come with a relationship, the feeling of being reunited after that setback, or the confusion that goes on in your head during that time.These are all important aspects that can be used in romance animes. But in most romance animes, they instead have either fan service, the protagonist being thick headed, or...the girl/guy not progressing their intent of letting the other person know they like them. Basically, the plot never gets developed, and if it does, it happens very slowly and by the end of the anime you might get a confession or a kiss IF you\'re lucky.Which is what I love about this show, they actually manage to delve into the hardships of relationships and bring out enough character and plot development in only 9 freakin episodes!!! (Each episode only comprising of 10 minutes). It shows a lot of realistic scenarios that can be seen in actual relationships, and manages to pick up the pace which is refreshing compared to other anime romance shows. Not to mention the fact that neither character sticks to a character troupe, but like as if they\'re actually people, like thinking ""oh, what should i do?? ><"" I just realized that sounds like a tsundere but I promise you in this scenario it\'s different.Now admittedly, it\'s tiny amount of episodes is also sort of its own downfall (when you think about it it\'s only really 4 and a half episodes), as it doesn\'t give you as much build up as other shows. But it\'s a paradox, because for that same reason, that\'s what makes the show great, as it shows us you don\'t need 24 full length freakin episodes to bring out the subtle details of romance. It manages to make a fast paced show without making it feel too rushed, just perfect in my opinion honestly.Other downfalls is that sometimes the voice acting felt a little flat, and the sound was over used a little bit (as in not having a diverse pool of music to choose from), but this could be just due to budget. Despite that, they were still able to make due, but whether it was due to budget or simple laziness, it still gets marked down from a 9 to an 8. Honestly, it\'s such a short show, if you like romances there\'s no reason not to get into this.So with all in mind: being able to show the nuances of a relationship in such a short amount of time, giving you a satisfying and fulfilled ending, actual people instead of character troupes, this anime in my opinion easily gives you an 8. the girl/guy not progressing their intent of letting the other person know they like them.

A true gem. God I feel like I'm one of the lucky bunch that is SCREENING anime not yet aired while watching this anime !!! Each episode is like 10 minutes, but packed with so MUCH GOODNESS!This is romance in a seiyuu setting, not school setting! I assure you it is a lot more interesting and tougher. The premise is a bit sexual which is EVEN BETTER !!! HELL YEAH AKA <333 Even so, Aka, our main girl who is 20 years old and so cute brought light to a failing 26 years old man (like an angel with...the Audrey Hepburn quotes) and the man, named Matsumaru, helped Aka when she lost her home and succeed her dream to be a popular seiyuu. How they manage romance and work is so cute and romantic, and so cuddly.The art is fantastic, it may look old, but that does not stop me from seeing how pretty Onda Aka is.I love both the opening and endings. And Aka's voice is so cute. I'm getting tired of those squeaky voices that try to be cute, but are not.Matsumaru is a great guy, he's a real man and a mature one, though he was once a failing one. Aka can be cute and young, but the guy cannot be a kid.

Aka can be cute and young, but the guy cannot be a kid. Aka is the best girl!Overall Outstanding I LOVE REC !!!"", ""Rec is a short series that captivates the heart despite its nine 12-minute episodes. It does this by being centered on the conflict between our two protagonists. This conflict being whether or not they can continue living together since their professions are closely tied and foul rumors may spread among employees. I won't into too much depth about their conflict since it is what kept me interested in the series and what I highly recommend you pay close attention to should you watch this.Story: 9The story can best be described as a rom-com without the com but that isn't to say that the story isn't...funny. What I hope to convey through this metaphor is that the series focuses on the two central characters and their interactions.If you are unsure about watching this show, watch the first 2 episodes first (Duration wise, it's like watching the first episode of a regular anime).The first two episodes present the complications of their relationship and why their living situation could become a dilemma. These first two episodes are what made me forget about the rating on MAL and conditioned me to really pay attention to what was happening in the show.Episodes three-eight solidly build on their relationship and how that could bring negative reception from their employers. They do a great job of building up tension and investment for the characters.The last episode is a sweet ending, nothing more to be said.Art: 7I have much less to say about this topic. It's a 2006 anime, you shouldn't expect high quality artistic talent on a project like this. Compared to other shows I've seen from this time period, it's definitely middlingly average. Most of the characters' faces or designs aren't really memorable except for Onda.Sound: 9The voice acting is nice, nothing sounds off-mood or breaks the tone of the show. Onda especially shows change with her voice as she progresses through her career and it was very heartwarming to watch. The opening is cute but the lyrics sung, oh man, those give you a vague idea of what's to come and they powerful. I won't analyze the entire opening as that would require a video and a lot of editing, but I will tell you that reading the lyrics every time you start the episode will get you the full experience of sadness and happiness that made me cry.Character: 10While not too many are present in this anime, the main ones are very well developed and carry much emotional investment by the end of the series. Onda is a young eccentric girl who is a rising voice actor. The conflict between her rise to fame and her relationship with Matsumaru make for a tear-jerking viewijng experience. Matsumaru is an older man who has largely given up on finding a better life and tries to make the best of the situation. The conflict between his relationship with Onka and what he believes she wants also make for an emotional adventure that is sure to invoke feelings inside of you as well.Enjoyment: 10Onda is adorable and and worthy of one of your 10 favorite character spots. That aside, what I really enjoyed about this show was the ending. As they are adults in the workforce, they act like adults in the workforce and there is no hiding or confusion of feelings. They speak what they believe and they answer truthfully. Nothing more can be said without spoiling the show.Overall: 9Rec is a great show for any lover of the romance genre, the emotional payoff heartwarming and it explores obstacles that are non-existent in High School anime. If you feel the need to spend time on anime, I advise you to watch this. It's short, sweet, and will make your heart cry. funny.

You have been warned!—Story/CharactersThe story begins with Fumihiko, a salaryman who works in the marketing department of a snack company, as he gets stood up by his attractive co-worker. After waiting for a while, he’s about to...toss the movie tickets, when Aka approaches him and offers to see it with him, since she loves movies and the film in question, Roman Holiday, features her favorite actress: Audrey Hepburn. When the film is over, Fumihiko sees the woman who stood him up outside the theater with another guy and decides to go with Aka to a bar, where he subsequently gets plastered and then after Aka talks about her dreams of becoming a seiyū, they go their separate ways.After Fumihiko returns to his apartment, he hears sirens and runs outside—lo and behold, Aka’s apartment building has burned down and she is sitting on a swing-set, traumatized. Fumihiko then proceeds to take her back to his place and take advantage of her sadness by… having sex with her… a person who just lost their home and all of their belongings? Okay, well, things just get weirder after they begin to live together as Aka auditions to voice in a commercial—featuring Fumihiko’s mascot character, and after she gets chosen to play the role, he becomes her boss!I felt bad for Aka, because she is almost forced into partaking in a predatory relationship, in order to strive towards her ambitions of becoming a popular seiyū. After their initial night of intimacy, Aka refuses all of the Fumihiko’s other advances, so it kind of seems like she was coerced into that situation without really wanting to have sex with him. Not to mention that Fumihiko consistently throws manipulative, hissy fits and tells her that she has to move out, (1) because they’re not really dating or (2) because he feels bitter about her becoming more successful than him.Aka is consistently objectified to boost her ratings and popularity, whether it be falling over and showing her panties on live-television or voicing in an *eroge. The only happy moment that Aka really has was when a little girl recognizes her voice from TV, which causes her to tear up. Most of the series is Aka being made to feel uncomfortable or sad, there aren’t very many portrayals of her feeling happiness or satisfaction—it’s not really a good look for Japan’s entertainment industry.*Slang for hentai visual novel.It is difficult to sympathize with Fumihiko at all because in every scene, he’s either shown to be apathetic or an unrelenting douche. It even reveals in Episode 3, that Fumihiko’s primary motivation for moving to Tokyo was that his friends told him ‘[city] girls are easy.’ At the end, even though Fumihiko grows to see Aka as more than a sexual object, he only really seems to like living with her in order to pacify his loneliness.The drama seems incredibly contrived, a good example of this is in Episode 8: Aka is scheduled to go to a business dinner the same night that she was going to go out on a date with Fumihiko to celebrate her getting a lead role in an anime, *Fumihiko then blows up on her because she had to stay at the meeting for longer than expected. This is stupid, why would someone plan two dinners in a night? It just seemed like it was manufactured drama to get Fumihiko and Aka to fight and then reconcile again in the last episode.*I get that this was supposed to exemplify Fumihiko’s character growth, since he was stood up in the first episode, but it could have been written into the script with more finesse.There are also some continuity errors, in Episode 2, Fumihiko and Aka are desperately trying to keep their relationship secret, so that it doesn’t ruin Aka’s reputation as a voice actress. But, in Episode 9, Aka not only yells that Fumihiko’s an idiot, RIGHT in front of his apartment building but then embraces him in front of ALL of her colleagues. So much for her reputation… *I guess she’s going to spend the rest of her career working in h-games? What happened to Aka’s ambition to want to make it to the top?*In Japan, seiyū are treated similarly to idols and are not supposed to outwardly be in relationships. It’s taboo for Japanese people to even be affectionate in public because reputation is really important in their culture.—TechnicalThe opening theme: *Cheer! ~Makka no Kimochi~ is really cute and feel-goodsy. I think it’s a bit misleading because, although Aka is cute, she’s not really given enough room to be her *genki self through most of the show.*The singer is Kanako Sakai, Aka’s seiyū. 元気 (genki) means ‘happy’ or ‘okay,’ and the trope ‘genki girl’ generally means a cheerful girl.This series is directed by Studio Shaft, but doesn’t have any of the artsy ‘Shaft-isms’ in it. The animation is actually very shoddy, an example of this is in Episode 3 when Fumihiko is supposedly ‘typing’ at his computer but it’s difficult to tell because his hands are blurred over each other and are moving rapidly. This is no surprise because the director of this series is credited as Ryūtarō Nakamura, the director of Serial Experiments Lain and the original Kino's Journey, both have minimal animation and rely mostly on still shots.The seiyū in the show were okay, Aka’s adorable voice is carried over to the game Chōjigen Game Neptunia as Compa! Fumihiko’s seiyū, Makoto Yasumura voiced Johnny Bepp in Aikatsu and Terumichi Nishida in Detroit Metal City, both were some of the best vocal performances in the the two respective series. And Fumihiko’s co-worker, Yoshio Hatakeda, is voiced by *Daisuke Ono.*Daisuke Ono is famous for voicing Jōtarō Kūjō in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Jūshimatsu Masuno in Osomatsu-san, Shintarō Midorima in Kuroko’s Basketball, Sebastian Michaelis in Black Butler, Battler Ushiromiya in Umineko no Naku Koro ni, and Shizuo Heiwajima in Durarara!! As well as many others!Conclusively, this series is antithetical as a seiyū aspiration story and belittles the concept of work and actual talent, in place of the ever-prevalent sex appeal and ‘sleeping your way to the top’ approach. If the series had been going for that from that start, it wouldn’t have come off as blindsiding and tonally bereft. A famous example of THAT kind of commentary on the entertainment industry is Satoshi Kon’s Perfect Blue but the film lets you know from the start that it has a darker perspective on the topic. If anything, Rec seems to PROMOTE the scandalous side of acting. There is really nothing to be gleaned from Rec’s story or presentation, therefore it gets a 3/10. toss the movie tickets, when Aka approaches him and offers to see it with him, since she loves movies and the film in question, Roman Holiday, features her favorite actress: Audrey Hepburn.

I was pulled in automatically and decided to watch the entire series right there on the spot even though it was late at night and I had to be up and 4:30 for work. Lets talk about why I liked it.Story: Okay a guy gets stood up on...a date but meets a new girl as hes about to go storming back home, and upon her apartment building burning down later that night he invites her to stay with him. Throughout the series from here on they kind of tiptoe around a relationship with each other and while other people can see it, they just don't. As such the story is pretty much just them at their jobs and everybody just waiting to see how long it takes for them to realize their feelings for one another. To be honest you know how its going to go the minute you start watching, but I don't think that that is a bad thing.Art: The show was animated very simply and I think anyone who watches anime should get what I mean by that. They don't waste time with unnecessary details and give us what we need to see so I actually prefer this animation because there's not as much to distract me.Sound: I usually never talk about sound, and if I do its usually to say it sucked, but not here. The other time I will talk about it is when I think that the voice cast was absolutely perfect for their roles and while many people probably don't pay attention to this, or even care, I really focus on this because if the voice actors don't convince me, i'm done then and there. I especially like the actor for aka onda (the girl) which I thought was humorous since she is a voice actor in the show.Characters: Never before have I felt that there was a character that I could really relate to, and that all changed with this. Matsumaru is now that anime character that I totally got and related to.He works in advertising and he gets to spend time with aka that way due to her job as a voice actress. I also have to say that they are one of the cutest anime couples I have ever seen. Aside from them we have matsumaru's friend and colleague who is funny as hell and aka's manager who is sorta trying harder to make aka and matsumaru's relationship work than they are. Like I said, I liked all of the characters which rarely happens for me.Enjoyment: ...I gave it a 10, do I really need to say anything else?Overall: I don't know that I've ever seen an anime that felt so real, and connected with me in such a way as this. I liked everything it had: the story, the humor, and of course the romance. It impresses me how much happens in such a short series, and I will definitely be watching this again, and again. While I don't usually do this, I will make an exception and say that if you are reading this, you need to watch this!

While I don't usually do this, I will make an exception and say that if you are reading this, you need to watch this! Now!"", ""Talk about one hell of a breath of fresh air! Rec is a surprisingly good romance anime between TWO ACTUAL ADULTS!Rec is a really short, but sweet adaptation of a manga by the same name. At a measly 9 half-length episodes, Rec was able to firmly stand next to the likes of Toradora by being so different then whatns typical of anime romance.Now when it comes to those differences, they are actually rather simple. Instead of teenagers in highschool whose entire lives seem to somehow revolve around their romantic relationship, we have two adults leading adult lives working two adult jobs. Did I mention they...were adults??The story of Rec is about the two characters, Aka Onda and Fumiko Matsumaru realizing their feelings for eachother as their two careers become intertwined. However the romance never suffocates you, nor does it suffocate the characters, as their lives don't center around it. They met through such a sweet twist of fate, but they come together somewhat because of their jobs, not just because they met one night.When it comes to characters, obviously the ones that matter most Aka and Fumiko, and hey get as much screentime as possible. There are supporting characters, but their purpsoe is to make the world feel larger than just two people, and show that our two leads have social lives outside of eachother as well.Aka Onda is easily the best thing about this show. She is proof that an anime girl doesn't need to be in highschool to be unbelievably cute. Rec may have 9 episodes, but it's qute dense. Not only is there the romance stuff, but also a story about an aspiring seiyuu tryin to make it big. Aka's dream is to be a successful voice actress, and for 9 episodes, she gets fleshed out pretty well.Fumiko, the dude, is a slightly down-on-his-luck salaryman just trying to get by and get an approved proposal. His story is also a compelling one, but understandably less than Aka's. Maybe for japanese salarymen, but not for me. Relatability isn't really the point though. Fumiko was still an interesting guy.Like I mentioned, Shaft made this series. And boy does it show. Rec is a pretty old Shaft series (2004), so I couldn't find it in HD. But 480p is still good enough. Rec has pretty interesting color design and has a very cozy and warm feel to it. Obviously no sakuga to be found here, but Rec keeps things simple, and that's a good thing in this show.Overall, Rec was a very refreshing series. It's not incredibly unique or anything, however the cute and cozy presentation, the notably mature characters, and the short runtime make this a VERY worthwhile romance anime. If you want more, I recommend reading the manga, it's pretty good, but not as dense as the anime.I give Rec an easy and well deserved 9 out of 10.Snuggle up and watch it on a cold night like I did, it really fits the mood. were adults??The story of Rec is about the two characters, Aka Onda and Fumiko Matsumaru realizing their feelings for eachother as their two careers become intertwined. However the romance never suffocates you, nor does it suffocate the characters, as their lives don't center around it. They met through such a sweet twist of fate, but they come together somewhat because of their jobs, not just because they met one night.When it comes to characters, obviously the ones that matter most Aka and Fumiko, and hey get as much screentime as possible. There are supporting characters, but their purpsoe is to make the world feel larger than just two people, and show that our two leads have social lives outside of eachother as well.Aka Onda is easily the best thing about this show. She is proof that an anime girl doesn't need to be in highschool to be unbelievably cute. Rec may have 9 episodes, but it's qute dense. Not only is there the romance stuff, but also a story about an aspiring seiyuu tryin to make it big. Aka's dream is to be a successful voice actress, and for 9 episodes, she gets fleshed out pretty well.Fumiko, the dude, is a slightly down-on-his-luck salaryman just trying to get by and get an approved proposal. His story is also a compelling one, but understandably less than Aka's. Maybe for japanese salarymen, but not for me. Relatability isn't really the point though. Fumiko was still an interesting guy.Like I mentioned, Shaft made this series. And boy does it show. Rec is a pretty old Shaft series (2004), so I couldn't find it in HD. But 480p is still good enough. Rec has pretty interesting color design and has a very cozy and warm feel to it.

It actually developed this simple story about how two people came to like each other and even had this tiny issues aside. I must say, I'm kinda reminded of Just my Luck by Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine as the idea of the story is quite  similar.The short episodes worked for me because it is not hassle to watch. It only takes about 15 minutes of your time. Add to that the simplicity of the story, making it easy to watch in between work.On the other hand, the story...may be too simple that it can be skipped to watch. may be too simple that it can be skipped to watch."", ""REC is, once again, a romance/ slice of life anime. Though it is very special, since it only has 9 episodes and each are about 10 minutes long.Story:The story is very short, to the point and fast paced, as you might expect, since each episode is quite short and there are only very few.The show starts of with the main character, Fumihiko Matsumaru, standing in front of a cinema and wanting to throw away his tickets, since his date obviously hadn't arrived. Suddenly this random girl, Onda Aka, starts &quot;voice acting&quot; as the tickets, persuading Matsumaru to go with her to see the movie, during...which she voice acts the whole time. At the end of the movie she reveals that she &quot;wants to be&quot; Audery Headburn, who she will quote very often during the show. Matsumaru, having seen his date go away with another man, is clearly unhappy and thinks that Aka is a very strange person, to say the least. She then takes him out for dinner, to make him happy. There she tells him how she wants to become a famous voice actress, clearing up some of the confusion from before. When both of them walk back home they realize that they were practically neighbours. Matsumaru, being a bit happier now, goes to bed, only to wake up again by the sound of fire engines. Matsumaru immediately runs out to see whats going on and sees, that Akas house is burning. After finding her alone, in the rain, on a swing, he invites her over to his house, thus laying the foundation for the actual plot. All I can say is the first episode overwhelms you once it's finished and is quite &quot;breath taking&quot;...The story then goes on to show how they live together and how there jobs evolve into a problem.Animation:The animation wasn't great. It didn't bother me, but you could clearly see that it wasn't the most well animated show. But I must say that the characters were designed very well.Sound:Though I found the voices of the characters to be great I didn't really notice the music during the show at all.Characters:The Characters are very easy to sympathize with, and you can really feel sorry for them at times. During the show both main characters mature a lot, making each episode better and better.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this show a lot, since it didn't &quot;bullshit around&quot;, but was very fast paced and to the point. The first episode was absolutely amazing, but after that the show went kind of downhill. It wasn't getting that much worse, but the first episode just set the scale really high.

Also, my opinion of how REC showed me how to be a better person, which you would find boring, sorry for that.Not everything is so serious, there is a space for comedy and absurd animation scenes. Also, the atmosphere isn\'t that grim at all. Even on the job, our male protagonist has a good friend that supports him when things aren\'t going all right. It is not like the male protagonist is not talented, on the contrary, he is a hard worker and talented marketing designer, but the series explores when even people like him are struggling.One of them develops feelings of insecurity because the career of the other is having a big push.Of course, this could mean this person won\'t be needing the other financially, this is a pretty adult thing. So this person is fearing it could be alone again at any moment.At the end of the series, we learn we have to develop a relationship based on our honest feelings and caring, not on things like the house, the money, the status.I think Rec showed me that saying ""Welcome Home"" to my wife and daughter every single time they get through the door is important, take time to have a hot meal when they come from studying or working, saying ""Good morning"" every single day, and hugging them every time they have to go out, making them feel there is someone waiting for them at home, is very important, do not hide those feelings!!PS: The scene when Matsumaru runs and hugs Aka when she said ""Let\'s Go home"" is breathtaking.He throws away his briefcase, somehow indicating what you have at home is way more important than you have out of home. I love it and I learn a lot from it.Thanks to the anime makers and the mangaka for REC, maybe not the most common format and time, but deep enough to make us meditate about our personal situations. how they ended living together is way sillier.From then, the anime turns out to be more serious than it may be intended to be, giving some space for comedy.1- What happens to a couple when one of them is becoming successful while the other is struggling?2- What happens when someone can not express his/her feelings because they feel insecure?3- What happens when you give your best in work but things are not going accordingly?4- What happens when you feel you are a boulder in the way of the person you love, you do not want him/her to go but also you want this person to fulfill his/her dreams?Spoilers!!From here I\'m going deep in my viewings of the series and I will mention stuff some of you could consider spoilers, so you were warned.

No.Rec centralizes two characters, Aka, who is an up and coming voice actress with a love for Audrey Hepburn films, and Matsumaru, an average-joe worker who works in the marketing department of a snack company. They met one night, and then Aka's house caught on fire and Matsumaru offered her to stay at his place until she can move back in. Now, these two characters have perfect chemistry, in the fact that while they still are worlds apart from each other, their interaction seems really natural and flows quite nicely. They have a variety of personality, and use all of it when dealing with their problems. While a good number of they time, they do act passive-aggressively, there are many ways they express that, even dipping into their other emotions. The anime sets its priority straight and only focuses on those two characters for most of the time, however, they each have one character to confide in, Hatakeda for Matsumaru and Yoshioka for Aka. These characters are entertaining in their own right, but they aren't all that developed, but that's what makes it better. We can focus on the main characters much more and the two other characters don't over-power that at all.For most of the series, we are focused on Aka's problems she addresses in a passive-aggressive manor, and only three episodes where Matsumaru  has problems and expresses them like so. While both of these are rather well executed, I feel like it could have been balanced more. I feel at least one more episode where Matsumaru's problems are addressed could make it a little more worth-while. That being said, Matsumaru's problem-handling portion of Rec is easily the better part. Don't get me wrong, they're both good, but after Aka's life seems to get better, his life gets a little worse and he doesn't know how to deal with it and that creates another main problem after the first main problem gets solved without it being contrived in some sense.I will admit, the music is just seemingly generic J-Pop stuff, but that's compensated with a focus on story and characters and is not meant to blow you away rather, just to set the mood, and at that, it handles it quite nicely. Still, it could have been a little more interesting. The voice acting is really good though. It flows like a Bruce Lee fight scene in a river, and Bruce is moving with it, creating a good atmosphere with the characters, and making them more enjoyable as a whole. The art of Rec is very well put together, illustrating the right level of shading  to create a good tone, which is not quite dark, but still not entirely light-hearted. Again, like the soundtrack, it's mean to play second fiddle for the story and characters, and it also does a good job at it.When comparing this to Lain or Kino's Journey, you will notice some differences. The main difference is that Rec is about two characters and Lain and Kino's Journey are about one. Lain and Kino's Journey deal with more darker tones and themes, where Rec is more light-hearted. That's not to say they don't have similarities as well. Both take place in a hostile environment, however Rec's environment is not only man-made, but also much smaller than the ones in Lain and Kino's Journey. The both deal with problems of the characters and look at them as people, rather than as characters. The soundtrack and art aren't as vital as the story and characters in all of them, and they're all expressive and free-flowing. So, while it doesn't have all of what made those two shows good, but Nakamura did manage to sneak in a taste of that, and it make the anime all the more delicious.Overall: Rec, while not as good as Serial Experiments Lain or Kino's Journey, it's still worth watching, and I would recommend it for RomCom fans, as well as fans of Lain and Kino's Journey. Hell, I'd recommend it to almost anyone looking for anything good to watch. 10/10 created for themselves and has lighter tones, and look at me, dancing around the issue. Dancy, Dancy Dancy.

As well, we see the challenges that the pair of them face in regards to their work schedules and it is understandable to juggle your double life in order to suit the other persons needs. That seems to be the hardest that the couple have to face.It\'s too bad that...this anime didn\'t expand each episodes length or make it out to be a OVA\\movie. I felt it could\'ve offered more but it didn\'t bother me that much to thoroughly enjoy it.Definitely romantic fans will like this anime a lot! this anime didn\'t expand each episodes length or make it out to be a OVA\\movie.

In my opinion, this anime starts off really well. It follows the story of an insufferable prick(my own opinion) of a person: Fumihiko Matsumaru. After being stood up by his date, he's cheered up by an aspiring voice actress Aka Onda. The story starts off fairly decently, the first few episodes show good character development, but then it starts to go down hill.Due to circumstances they start living together, this is when our protagonist starts pestering Aka for sex. Now if this...was done for comedic purposes, it's outright bad, it just doesn't work. Trinity seven would be a good example of where characters are set up for sexual humour, this anime fails at that miserably.~Spoilers~To top it off our protagonist starts becoming more of a bellend when he basically forces himself on Aka, leading to a fight and for some reason the anime wants us to believe that both parties were somehow at fault. Later on Aka starts to become succesful whereas Matsumaru seems to be struggling and he takes out all his frustration on her. If this were set up properly it couldve worked but all this does is give us an insight into the mind of a tsundere character and also shows us how pathetic our 'likeable and relatable' protagonist is.Overall it is a bang average show, it does have some sweet moments but all of those are usually ruined by our weapon of a protagonist. was done for comedic purposes, it's outright bad, it just doesn't work.

A romantic comedy where the characters actually hook up in the first episode? This is a story where the characters feel real. Its like this is a story that you could actually believe would happen in real life, and that is part of its core appeal.The setting is what really lifted this show up and above the typical rom-com/drama. This is not a high school show, and the characters are actual adults that behave like human beings. I cannot stress this enough, the characters, for the most part, act like real...people with real life struggles and responsibilities.Considering this is a show from 2006, I can say that the art isn't really my thing and the animation is pretty lacking; its average at best for a show of its time. I do have to give credit to the voice acting in this show, especially Aka. She put on a lot of different voices, and just by listening you could tell when she was do her job as a voice actor, when she was quoting a movie or just being herself. It was a nice touch.Now on to the most glaring flaw there is. The directing was extraordinarily flat. There was a strange need for the characters to tell the audience what they were feeling instead of showing it and letting us understand their emotions through their actions. There was also an over-reliance on conversations that feel unnatural because they focus dumping information on the viewer.Despite this though, I would still recommend this show to anyone interested in romance. 10 minute episodes makes this an incredibly easy watch.

From the meeting at the theatre to the next was like woah, this really fast start to this story. The way one of the characters were acting after the first night was a little unbelievable at first. Anyway this is where the story starts, and from here on it moves along smoothly staying focused on the main characters and how they\'re dealing with their lives and each other. Two people meet, become friends, fall in love(without knowing it), while following their dreams. Nothing major or dragged...on here, just a simple and very enjoyable story. on here, just a simple and very enjoyable story.', ""The entire story and relationship dynamic is peak male fantasy garbage.

It's not believable, it's not entertaining, it's so bad that it's almost offensive. The MC has next to no personality and i was nearly...pulling my hair out at the end.Trash lmao.

Fuck this show"", ""Grade: 8I'll make it short so it won't bore you.You may find the story silly from how they met and end up living together on the same roof, but it was kind of interesting and questions you what will you do in those scenarios where your dreams are getting hollow while your partner or coworker is one step closer to their goals and how will you be able to catch to other's expectations.Just so you know, this really shows how adult life and corporate life works in real life. You might receive multiple blows of rejections or luckily, your work might also be accepted. The...question is how will you be able to make up for it or improve it. It displays a great responsibility in those cases and btw, the characters did not act stupidly in love like in typical romance anime. It was like really a real-life situation.

By all means it should be at least a 7, and indeed, there is nothing about the anime itself which deserves anything less. So why have I rated it a 5? The problem lies with what is simultaneously this anime's greatest strength and most glaring weakness: the story....It is a charming little tale about random circumstances bringing together two strangers who have to navigate their feelings for each other. Despite its sheer brevity at 9 13 minute episodes plus a special, it manages to feel carefully constructed and well-developed the whole way through, and it is very easy to get invested as a result. Besides the special episode being an unspoken episode 7.5, everything makes sense and impresses down to the last detail. However, as I was reading discussion about the manga online, I discovered something which happens later in the manga which puts a bitter taste in my mouth. it made everything I experienced throughout this show feel cheap and wasted for no good reason. Does the anime deserve to bear the sins of its manga? Maybe not, but this knowledge has turned Rec into something I was going to rewatch and read the manga for, into something I'll review and put on the shelf, perhaps forever. Without the story, this anime doesn't have much else which sets it apart. The art is fun and inviting in that 2006 kind of way, with expressive characters and a lively palette which it is not afraid to play with. The sound meets the basic standards of quality, with a lighthearted intro which captures the spirit of the anime well. The characters, while strong, are not enough to save this show from its score, fulfilling their roles as colorful subjects upon which the story acts without being classic masterworks of characterization or breaking the mold in novel ways. As far as favorite characters go, the only real choice is the main duo, Aka and Fumihiko, but this is tainted by what I know of the manga. At the end of the day, this is another classic case of an Anime which is for all intents and purposes very good being held back by one glaring, inexcusable flaw.

Shounen Maid,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32175/Shounen_Maid,"[""Shounen Maid is a TERRIBLY underrated show. I can get, however, where the reluctance to touch this show might be coming from, since 8bit produced it and the summary sounds like the premise to some terrible shotacon nightmare.This is one of those (rare in this medium and industry, I am extremely sorry to express) 'don't judge a book by its cover' cases, though: Shounen Maid is basically a gen slice of life show centering around family, friendship and mourning. And it's done beautifully from beginning to end.The show achieves the perfect balance between sweet, lighthearted comedic tones, and a more serious approach towards...the emotional struggles of both MCs, both grieving and adjusting to new situations. I can honestly say I've laughed and teared up in almost every single episode.There's no what one could call an overarching plot, since it's a more episodic in nature show, but there IS a natural flow of events and developments that lead to a satisfying and cohesive narrative evolution.The side characters are all very enjoyable, and though some could use more screen time, they all still manage to be treated respectfully; at the end of the ride, there's no feeling that any one character could be disposed off and the show would remain basically the same.The art is perhaps the weakest point of the work, and even then it's just because of how simple and commonplace the character designs could be, but they're truthful to the source material. The coloring is AMAZING: the lighting and shading is great and accompanies the tone of the narrative at all times, making the emotional moments all the more poignant, and the lighthearted ones all the more so. The use of CGI is spot on; I generally cringe at the inclusion of random CGI on shows like these because they stand out and not in a good way, they just look forced and cut the natural flow of the animation, but Shounen Maid uses it sparingly and with great criteria.The sound is one of my favorite parts of this anime. First off: every voice actor does an amazing job. Fujiwara Natsumi is especially convincing in her role, bringing Chihiro to life outstandingly, being able to convey and portray a wide arrange of emotions delightfully, and making me forget I was actually listening to a grown up woman (which didn't really happen in the dub version, sadly). This is especially notable given that this is her first role! Also kudos to Makino Yui, who was just really fun and easy to listen to.The opening was DELIGHTFUL. Simply DELIGHTFUL. The song itself was really catchy and fit the mood of the show while the lyrics were attuned to it, which for some reason doesn't happen very often. The ending is really fun and helps a lot towards immersing oneself in the illusion of Shounen Maid (the idols -who aren't main characters- get songs! Plural! And they're pretty good!).The SFX and ambience sounds are all very well utilized, and the OST is absolutely enjoyable and does its job greatly.All in all, Shounen Maid is a slice of life gem, and I would very much recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the genre but might be reluctant to give it a shot. the emotional struggles of both MCs, both grieving and adjusting to new situations.

It had a more calm environment and the story was absolutely beautiful. I loved the characters and their way of style. The art actually matched the calm setting as well. Sounds actually went on with the anime since some of the background music was wonderful and matched the theme. I'd definitely recommend this because of how wonderful this anime is in Slice of Life. It is possible that even If someone whom does not like Slice of Life based Anime would love this. "", 'Shounen Maid is an anime series that really caught me off-guard. There\'s nothing too appealing about the cover and the show\'s premise sounded like it came from a female fanfiction but what caught me off-guard is this turned out to be a heartwarming slice of life show between a kid and his uncle(There\'s NO YAOI or Shotacon, I can assure you that)[Story]:I actually believe that this is one of the most underrated slice of life anime I have ever seen. I\'ve seen a lot of people who avoided this show because they think the premise is crazy (boy dressing up as a maid, I don\'t...blame them) or they think it\'s some gay show or something. Also, this is by 8bit, a studio known for creating a shit ton of harem shows. If you can get over the fact that an elementary school kid is wearing a maid outfit then you\'ll see the great things that Shounen Maid has to offer. If not then your loss, I supposeThe story of Shounen Maid is basically about a kid named Chihiro, whose mother has just died, was left homeless and now his uncle, Madoka, shows up and decides to take care of him. His uncle then forced him to wear a maid outfit..Heh, I was joking about the last part. He wasn\'t forced, more like Madoka was just joking around but Chihiro decides to take his joke seriously and he now wears that maid outfit most of the time.The show doesn\'t really have much of a story but rather, it\'s focused on the heartwarming and amazing relationship development between Chihiro and his uncle. That\'s the main reason why I love Shounen Maid. Well, there a few more reasons why I love the show. For instance, the comedic aspect of the show is really good. I really love the character dynamics between Chihiro and Madoka because most of the time, it leads to hilarious moments like Chihiro being the mature kid and having to take care of Madoka and Madoka acting like a dumb little kid. The characters are also fun to watch but I\'ll talk about it more in the ""Characters"" section.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8/10)This is my first time watching an anime from 8bit because most of their shows are harem and I\'m not a big fan of harem. The visuals looks good and the animation is a-okay. The character design felt a bit weird to me at first because of their big eyes (KEY\'s character design still takes the number 1 spot for having big-ass eyes) but I got used to it after a couple of episodes.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)I love the show\'s OST, especially when it comes to the dramatic scenes with a dramatic OST playing in the background. Those sad and dramatic soundtrack are one of the reasons the emotional scenes were effective at gripping my heart and making my eye tear up from time to time. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""innocent promise"" by TRUSTRICK. I honestly fell in love with the Opening Song the moment I heard it on the first episode. The singer\'s voice is beautiful and the song\'s melody was great. The ED theme song is ""Zutto Only You"" by Uchouten BOYS. I\'m not a big fan of boy\'s idol song. I don\'t like them, I don\'t listen to any and I don\'t think I will. I mean, I\'m a straight guy, after all. The ED theme song is my guilty pleasure. Even though I don\'t like Boy\'s Idol songs, I somehow fell in love with this song and I\'ve been listening to it for like the past 2 months........""It\'s not like I\'ll listen to more boys idol songs in the future, idiot..."" -Me______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (9/10)The characters is what pulled me into this show. They\'re one of the main reasons why I fell in love with Shounen Maid.The main protagonist of the series, Chihiro Komiyo, is a character that I really adored and if I ever decide to have kids (I doubt I will), I\'m sure I would want my son to be the same as Chihiro. Chihiro is an elementary school student who loves to clean, cook and do all the housework. Haha, Chihiro is like the first kid I\'ve ever seen who likes to do chores. When kids these days are asked if they want to do chores, they\'re going to be like ""Nope"" and they\'ll back to playing video games or whatever. This is what I love about Chihiro. He\'s a hardworking sweet young kid who\'s different from a bunch of kids I\'ve met within the past few years of volunteering. Chihiro\'s personality can be a bit of a tsundere sometimes and his personality just kills me.Then we have, Madoka Takato, Chihiro\'s uncle who decides to take care of him. Wow, I didn\'t know Madoka gave up being a God and switched genders just to go back to this world and take care of a sweet young kid? I\'m just joking, this ain\'t Madoka from the Madoka series. Anyways, he\'s a dress designer and he\'s a lazy guy who barely knows how to clean his own mess or barely knows how to cook. He always messes it up and Chihiro always comes and scowls him for it. Madoka is surprisingly a very nice guy and not once, did I see him get angry nor did he ever get on a mean streak with anyone.Then there\'s the rest of the supporting characters. We have Keiichiro Shinozaki, Madoka\'s assistant who makes sure that Madoka is on a right track in terms of his schedule and also makes sure that he makes his costume. I really love how he\'s able to put up with Madoka\'s laziness and his other shit. There\'s also Miyako Ootori, a cheerful young 16 year old girl who also works as a maid in Madoka\'s house and she works under Chihiro. She\'s a maid but she\'s surprisingly not good at both cleaning or cooking but she eventually improved after Chihiro decides to teach her how to cook and clean. Some maid she is. I really like her character and her cheerful personality.One final character I want to talk about is Chihiro\'s mother. Yes, she\'s dead but she makes an appearance (more like in Chihiro\'s flashbacks) from time to time so we, the viewers, get to know more about her and how great of a mother she is instead of just some mother who died. She is a hilarious mother and a kind mother who, despite the hard life that she had, never gave up on his son and still took care of him until her death. I honestly shed a few tears whenever she appears in one of Chihiro\'s flashbacks.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)I came in to this show with no expectations whatsoever and at the end, this show really surprised me. It made me laugh and it made me cry from time to time. I really enjoyed this show.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]""Shounen Maid"" is one of the most underrated anime I have ever seen and I already stated my reasons above as to why not a lot of people have watched this show. It\'s just a heartwarming story between Chihiro and his uncle and there\'s like no Yaoi in this series at all. I also forgot to mention the show\'s target audience is female but I\'m a straight guy who still manages to love the series so.......[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)Pros:+Heartwarming moment between Chihiro and his Uncle+Amazing Relationship Development between Chihiro and his Uncle+Comedic aspect of the show is well done+Great Emotional Scenes+Nice Soundtrack and Great OP and ED theme song+Amazing Cast of CharactersCons:-Character Design felt a bit weird at first blame them) or they think it\'s some gay show or something. Also, this is by 8bit, a studio known for creating a shit ton of harem shows. If you can get over the fact that an elementary school kid is wearing a maid outfit then you\'ll see the great things that Shounen Maid has to offer. If not then your loss, I supposeThe story of Shounen Maid is basically about a kid named Chihiro, whose mother has just died, was left homeless and now his uncle, Madoka, shows up and decides to take care of him. His uncle then forced him to wear a maid outfit..Heh, I was joking about the last part. He wasn\'t forced, more like Madoka was just joking around but Chihiro decides to take his joke seriously and he now wears that maid outfit most of the time.The show doesn\'t really have much of a story but rather, it\'s focused on the heartwarming and amazing relationship development between Chihiro and his uncle. That\'s the main reason why I love Shounen Maid. Well, there a few more reasons why I love the show. For instance, the comedic aspect of the show is really good. I really love the character dynamics between Chihiro and Madoka because most of the time, it leads to hilarious moments like Chihiro being the mature kid and having to take care of Madoka and Madoka acting like a dumb little kid. The characters are also fun to watch but I\'ll talk about it more in the ""Characters"" section.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8/10)This is my first time watching an anime from 8bit because most of their shows are harem and I\'m not a big fan of harem. The visuals looks good and the animation is a-okay. The character design felt a bit weird to me at first because of their big eyes (KEY\'s character design still takes the number 1 spot for having big-ass eyes) but I got used to it after a couple of episodes.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)I love the show\'s OST, especially when it comes to the dramatic scenes with a dramatic OST playing in the background. Those sad and dramatic soundtrack are one of the reasons the emotional scenes were effective at gripping my heart and making my eye tear up from time to time. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""innocent promise"" by TRUSTRICK. I honestly fell in love with the Opening Song the moment I heard it on the first episode. The singer\'s voice is beautiful and the song\'s melody was great. The ED theme song is ""Zutto Only You"" by Uchouten BOYS. I\'m not a big fan of boy\'s idol song. I don\'t like them, I don\'t listen to any and I don\'t think I will. I mean, I\'m a straight guy, after all. The ED theme song is my guilty pleasure.

If you like shounen ai, you'll love this a lot; if you don't but you like slice of life, it still remains enjoyable as you can look at it as a heartwarming relationship of uncle-nephew rather than them 'being gay'. Also, it does not contain anything extreme  (and by extreme you know what I mean) which makes this anime lovableThe story wasn't that new, the plot only works because one of our mc's parents died, his single mom....(Also, the mom has that hairstyle similar of dead mom hairstyle!! xD I'll stop... ) Because of that the boy is forced to be in the anime-ish that will mostly never happen in real life situation so the anime would function.The story did its minor job as the characters are the main focus.

Although when the time calls for it, he acts like an adult and he shows how really cares for Chihiro. Madoka's voice acting is great, you can see, in this case hear, how he changes his tone of voice when he has this 'shift' I've mentioned before.Some minor characters aren't just being archetypes: they have their own problems and they also learn how to deal with them with the help of other people.It isn't the best of the best but it is enjoyable, even for who doesn't like shounen ai that much for the reason I've said before. This anime doesn't have intricate story line, almost non existent, just to show the development of characters through their everyday lives but the way it is executed is delightful and pleasant to watch.

I just find myself smiling throughout every episode :]"", 'Shounen Maid.  A series that literally translates to ""Boy Maid"" on the outside seems like quite an odd show.  I mean, the show is about a boy who is a freaking maid.  (Trust me, Chihiro isn\'t hot on the idea either)  But, underneath the seemingly comical exterior, we get a show from 8bit that despite their rather mediocre track record, is a heartfelt comedy that is really more than meets the eye.Story: Komiya Chihiro is a 5th grader who has been dealt a rather bad hand.  With his mother now dead due to heart failure, Chihiro is now both homeless...and penniless due to not his mother not having any connections to any of her family members.  Left with a note from his mother telling him to move on in life with the motto ""Those who do not work shall not eat"", Chihiro one day meets a man chased by a dog, a man by the name of Madoka who is not only his uncle, but offers Chihiro a second chance by allowing him to live with him with a condition, to act as his housekeeper for his rather messy mansion home.The majority of Shounen Maid is a character-based story that focuses on the connections between family and friends.  Every episode follows the tale of Madoka and Chihiro as they live by each other\'s side and taking care of each other with a whole host of side characters that come in and out of the story to make the seemingly mundane and bland story idea more plentiful and bright, a surprise that is even greater when the show gives us steady progress that by the end is nothing but heartwarming.  In addition, the show uses the duality of comedy and gentle, caring moments in order to show us the connection that these characters have, adding more to the kind of care and respect that these characters have for each other.In addition, the show has a lot of flashback moments in order to tell a good chunk of the story.  The show uses Chihiro\'s mother quite often in the series as a link between the show\'s two main characters, as Chihiro\'s mom has a lot to do with how these two are as characters.  These flashback moments help create even more of a connection and overall adds to the heartfelt qualities that this show has to offer.However, this show has one major flaw that it does not seem to have any way of solving, and that comes with the majority of the questions in regards to the series\'s familial relations.  There\'re a lot of loose ends at the end of the series that don\'t really explain anything.  It\'s explained how Chihiro\'s mom has no relation to the rest of her family, but doesn\'t explain why.  Madoka has a lot of problems with his family too like his sister does, but there\'s no concrete reason as to why.  For this reason, the story takes a huge pitfall cause no one likes to be hung out to dry like that.  It\'s poor because we get no answers and spoiled the quality of the series\'s end regardless of how kinda tearjerking the ending is.Overview:+ Well-paced character based show+ Shows connections between the main characters+ Uses a variety of ways to show connection-  Has a few loose ends that hurt the series in a major wayCharacters: Characters more or less fall between two categories of main character and side character, which basically mean you\'re either important, or you just help add flavor to the series.First is Komiya Chihiro, the \'Shounen Maid"" of the story.  As a fifth grader who lives by the principle of ""Those who do not work shall not eat"", Chihiro is one of the most hard-working children that you will probably actually see.  Living a life of housework due to his mother working long hours in order to make ends meet for them, Chihiro not only has respectable cooking ability for a boy of his age, but has an obsession with cleaning and wants to make sure that everything is sparkling and neat.  So, in a sense, he\'s basically the perfect candidate for a house caretaker.  Chihiro\'s character is one of appreciation and humility, offering to be Madoka\'s house caretaker in return for a roof over his head, food, and school tuition.  As a character, he doesn\'t really grow very so much as as he grows into the new environment he\'s placed in.Then there\'s Takatori Madoka, Chihiro\'s new guardian who is a tailor with a very...sporadic and wonderfully childish personality.  As well as enjoying making clothes for people that he would find people to but cute in (Mostly Chihiro), Madoka\'s character takes the brunt of the character development in the series.  With Chihiro in his life, the series spends the majority of time wrapping his growth and development around this boy, bringing about a lot of love and care between these two that makes their relationship all the more sweeter.In contrast, the side characters are mostly unchanging and stagnant background characters that add more flavor to the series, ranging from characters that appear very often like Keiichiro and Miyako, to Chihiro\'s best friend Hino, to the extremely minor and seemingly unnecessary boy band group known as Uchoten Boys.  For the most part they aid in helping to breathe life to the relationship between our main characters more and make the world and their circle of characters a lot more lively and colorful.Overall, the characters of Shounen maid are a flurry of characters that are wrapped around this relationship between the two main characters.  The brunt of this series is about how well the personalities of Madoka and Chihiro work with each other with a bit of Chiyo (Chihiro\'s mother) to put them together.  The problem however is that, on their own, each character doesn\'t really have much to them and really relies on each other to bring worth to the series.Overview:+ Great relationship between the main cast+/- Side characters provide flavor to the story without much to them by themselves-  On their own, characters don\'t really have much to themArt: Produced by 8bit, the show has a surprisingly good and sharp artstyle with wonderfully detailed backgrounds that from my expereince with 8bit, is better quality than the majority of their works.  With a colorful artstyle that is slightly muted in brightness, the overall look of the series is gentle and calm in perspective to the tone that the show exudes.  In terms of character design, the show has a largely moe artstyle complete with round eyes with a lot of childish qualities that quite honestly, works for the show, especially since the majority of its cast consists of small children.In terms of comedic stylings, the show uses a lot of exaggerated facial expressions in conjunction with a lot of situational comedy in order to bounce off the interactions from character to character.  (Particularly with Madoka\'s inability to keep anywhere clean) It also meshes quite well with the series\'s standard artstyle which is a nice touch.Overview:+ Good, crisp artstyle+ Well used comedic stylings+/- Mostly moe artstyleSound: The OP for Shounen Maid is a song that really ties into the relationship with its main characters.  It\'s a kind, gentle song that despite it not really being the most memorable thing to listen to, has its merits and fits very well with the show it\'s in.  The ED is a boy band song sung by the seiyuus of the \'Uchoten Boys\' characters, and really doesn\'t have very many qualities that make it special.Personal Enjoyment:  Shounen Maid is a series that I didn\'t expect to be as good as it was.  It\'s not a diamond in the rough when it comes to anime, but it\'s a series that was definitely more than meets the eye.  The relationship between the two main characters was very sweet and heartfelt, and really drove in the idea that good things come to those who work hard.  It was very nice to see Chihiro continue to do his job despite how young he was and was never a spoiled brat, but rather a hard-working young man with a good heart and a clear mind.Did I like this anime?Yes.  This show surprised me by being so much more unique than I originally thought with the premise of a boy who is a maid.  With moments that shined through the importance of family and the value of ambition, Shounen Maid had more personal values to it than I had thought otherwise and as such, gets a thumbs up from me for being both unique and actually kinda memorable.What didn\'t I like about this anime?The show had a few cliffhangers on some of its flashback aspects that were more than just unfavorable.  They said a lot of stuff about the characters\' past, but never had the guts to put in the effort and actually give us answers.  They were teasers and loose ends that really stung, and for that I say, ""Damn you, 8bit.""Would I recommend this anime?If you want a lighthearted and heartwarming anime and don\'t mind the weird premise, then I would suggest Shounen Maid.  In all honesty, this show is one that is both wonderfully weird and memorable.  Seriously, give it a shot.  I promise you, you won\'t regret it. and penniless due to not his mother not having any connections to any of her family members.

I don\'t care about it and actually I enjoy this show, but I am surprised to read reviews which can make you feel this doesn\'t have anything to do with gay characters, when it does. I mean, this is not kuroshitsuji (which already have some ""almost gay moments""), no, this is closer to loveless or super lovers, believe me, if you don\'t like shounen...ai you would feel akward watching this anime in so many moments. ai you would feel akward watching this anime in so many moments.', ""I’ve never watched a series that so perfectly encapsulates the iyashikei genre. Everything about it is so warm and simple, I’m shocked that so few people bring up this series when discussing the slice of life genre. However, I think one of the main things that turns people away from this show is how it seems like a show made for shotacons at first glance, but trust me, it’s not that in the slightest!Shounen Maid is a slice of life series about Komiya Chihiro, an 11 year-old boy whose mother passed away. But when he happens to run into his uncle who he had never...before heard about, everything changes for him. Upon discovering how unkempt his uncle’s mansion is, he decides to become his maid in exchange for getting to live with him. Hence the title, “boy maid.”The show’s plot is easygoing, and most of it is fairly episodic, though there are plot points that are introduced in certain episodes that continue throughout the show. The show is mostly comedic, however there are still a couple of moments that did a good job at being emotional, both the comedy and the emotion are handled well. I feel like this show also avoids an issue that many slice of life anime have where they end up being boring rather than simple, this show is simple while still being sincere and heartfelt.The show’s art can also be described as simple. It’s not the most unique or memorable, but it’s cute and matches the show’s tone well. One of the things that does stand out is Madoka’s mansion, it’s very intricate and elegant, you can tell a lot of thought went into designing it. The character designs were also nice, I don’t have much to say about them, they match the characters well.The voice acting also matched the characters well. Natsumi Fujiwara did an especially good job at voicing Chihiro. The soundtrack was nice, it has a very calm and warm feeling to it. The opening and ending are both good, they’re very upbeat and fun.The characters were all very loveable, which is good since slice of life shows have to rely on having a good cast of characters in order to be enjoyable, since the plot isn’t a big focus. Madoka’s relationship with Chihiro was very sweet, watching Chihiro slowly grow closer to him was very cute as well. A lot of people seem to mistake their relationship for being romantic, though I believe Madoka is just very affectionate with Chihiro because he cares about him. Keiichirou and Miyako were nice inclusions to the cast as well, Keiichirou had moments where he was shown to care about Chihiro too, though in a less extreme way than Madoka. Chihiro’s grandmother was a character I was expecting to be far more one-dimensional than she actually was. The scenes with her really made her a more sympathetic person.Overall, I really enjoyed this series. It was very sweet and comforting, and I think if you enjoy the slice of life genre or series that focus on familial relationships, you'll enjoy this series too.

Upon discovering how unkempt his uncle’s mansion is, he decides to become his maid in exchange for getting to live with him. Hence the title, “boy maid.”The show’s plot is easygoing, and most of it is fairly episodic, though there are plot points that are introduced in certain episodes that continue throughout the show. The show is mostly comedic, however there are still a couple of moments that did a good job at being emotional, both the comedy and the emotion are handled well. I feel like this show also avoids an issue that many slice of life anime have where they end up being boring rather than simple, this show is simple while still being sincere and heartfelt.The show’s art can also be described as simple. It’s not the most unique or memorable, but it’s cute and matches the show’s tone well. One of the things that does stand out is Madoka’s mansion, it’s very intricate and elegant, you can tell a lot of thought went into designing it. The character designs were also nice, I don’t have much to say about them, they match the characters well.The voice acting also matched the characters well. Natsumi Fujiwara did an especially good job at voicing Chihiro. The soundtrack was nice, it has a very calm and warm feeling to it.

That is, however, until he saves a flamboyant man from a puppy (yes, really). This man admits to be the younger brother of Chihiro's mother, his uncle, and takes him in.At first, Chihiro is very reluctant to be a 'freeloader'. He decides to clean the house to make up for him staying there.Admitted, the story isn't really all that...special. However, with the help of fun characters, hilarious humour and good pacing, it all works.The characters (8):The characters are all multidimensional and oh so fun to watch. The two main characters, being Chihiro and his uncle (Madoka), are both very different people. Chihiro is an honest, sweet but strict young boy. He scolds his uncle all the time, but there is never any real anger behind it. It is mostly for the sake of comedy.Madoka is clumsy, gentle and easily distracted. He's terrified of dogs, loves cats (even though he's allergic to them) and is horrible at cleaning.Their different personalities cause a lot of the comedic moments. Throughout the anime you feel their bond getting stronger, and you can tell how much they care for one another.Quite some people thought that this anime was going to be a shounen ai between these two, but it definitely isn't. It's about the bond they develop as family.The supporting cast is adorable and easy to like. There are quite some supporting characters, however they are introduced in a way that doesn't make the amount overwhelming.The characters are honestly what makes this anime as good and enjoyable as it is.The music (7):The music in this animation was solid, it didn't stand out but it worked well for the scenes. The opening and ending are the songs that stand out the most. The opening is quite catchy, though I admit that I skipped it quite a few times. That's just a matter of taste though.The animation (8):The animation was honestly gorgeous. It fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the show, it's gentle, soft and soothing. The background designs were stunning. The character designs are what you expect from this type of anime: all of the characters are pretty and cute.Entertainment value (9):Great! This show isn't boring at all. It's something I can watch all day and now be bored. Even though it doesn't have real challenge or drama (except towards the end a little) it never ceases to be enjoyable.The comedy is great and I admit that I laughed out loud quite a few times, which I don't do that often.Conclusion:I give this show 8/10! If you like slice of life/comedy shows, and something that is easy to watch, then this show is perfect for you. But even if that isn't your thing; when you're having a bad day, then give this show a try too... It will lift your spirits.This is definitly the most underrated show of summer 2016. special.

Before this anime came out, I thought it was going to be absolutely terrible, just like what I thought of Steven Universe before I actually sat down and watched it. I mean, it\'s a show about a ten-year-old boy who has to live with his uncle, and said uncle makes him half-dress in a maid outfit for kicks and giggles. Tell me you didn\'t think ""Oh my God! Is this gonna be some super sexual shotacon hentai?! Is it trying...to condone pedophilia?! No way am I watching this garbage fire!!"" when you read that premise. I won\'t lie, I thought the same way. But then the show actually came out and people were suddenly praising it up the wazoo. Again, just like Steven Universe. So I sat down and watched it...and while I admit I don\'t like the art style much for reasons I\'ll explain in a bit, this show really went against my expectations and actually wound up being really nice!Based on the manga by Ototachibana, the show is about a young boy, Chihiro Fujiwara, whose mother just died from a heart attack. It had always been just the two of them, but with his mother gone, Chihiro is all alone...or so he thinks. One day, his mysterious uncle, a rich costume designer named Madoka Takatori, appears to take him in as his ward. But while Chihiro appreciates the gesture, Madoka isn\'t known for keeping his house clean, and Chihiro can\'t stand anything that\'s not clean, so he works hard to clean the house all on his own. Since Chihiro\'s not the kind of kid who just wants stuff handed to him, Madoka proposes a deal: Chihiro can stay at the Takatori house if he\'s okay with handling the chores, since Chihiro likes doing that. Chihiro accepts...though Madoka makes him wear a frilly maid outfit as a uniform for funsies. With that, Chihiro has a new home.Let me tell you something right now: This isn\'t a dumb sexual shotacon anime like most people thought. Rest assured, Shounen Maid is nothing like that, misleading title and initial premise not withstanding. It\'s actually a wholesome, low key slice of life story about a kid trying to deal with his loss and meeting new people upon going to his new home. And thank God it actually turned out to be genuinely good. Otherwise, I never would have given this show the time of day, especially after hearing people talk about it. Of course, this isn\'t a perfect show, and it does have a few problems, one of those being the animation. Well, not really the animation per se, but the character designs, particularly how large the characters\' eyes are. They\'re fine on the kids, but the adults having them just makes them look really awkward, especially with how their eyes almost take up the entire upper halves of their cheeks. The actual animation is quite good, with colorful backgrounds that are easy on the eyes and smooth movement as well, along with the occasional cutesy chibi head every now and again. The soundtrack is also nice and pleasant, with a lot of woodwinds, oboes, flutes, and violins that perfectly fit the soothing, heartwarming atmosphere the show is going for...except for the ending song, which is basically typical boy band fare straight out of the mid-2000s.Thankfully, the dynamic characters more than make up for the occasional animation slip-ups. I loved the whole ensemble, as they all had a wide array of personalities and quirks, but also didn\'t lean into typical anime archetypes. Madoka acts like a whiny, lazy uncle, but he\'s actually compassionate and does genuinely love his nephew and worries that he might be growing up too fast. Keiichiro could have just been the overworked butler, but he also has quite a bit of charm to him by being a confidant for Chihiro, having a life beyond just being Madoka\'s butler, and being the voice of reason for Madoka. Miyako could have easily been just the busty girl next door character and little more than walking fanservice and boob close-ups, but thank GOD the anime didn\'t take her in that direction. She\'s klutzy and nice, but is also proactive and a lot smarter than people give her credit for. But I think Chihiro is the best out of all of them. At first, he does seem like the kind of idealized kid who acts more grown up than he should and is really OCD about cleaning and stuff, practically raising Madoka when the latter should be the one raising him, but the anime always makes sure to remind us that, at heart, he\'s still a young boy. He likes reading fantasy novels, is scared of horror movies, likes animals, and can be kind of demanding and bossy at times. His character alone pretty much carries the whole show, and his chemistry with all the other characters is wonderful to watch.Now, this anime might not be for everyone. Since Shounen Maid is very much a slice-of-life show, its pacing is deliberately slow and languid, and much more character-driven than story-driven. This might not sit well for people who prefer faster pacing and more action-oriented stuff, and that\'s fine. I think Shounen Maid\'s slow pacing works to its benefit, and the show itself doesn\'t try to be anything more than the cute, wholesome family drama it wants to be. But there is one more bit of criticism I have in terms of its audio: Some of the characters\' voice acting tends to border on grating or really overdone, the biggest offenders being Madoka and Hino. For the former, he\'s voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki, who is normally a pretty good voice actor, but here he gives Madoka a ridiculously high pitched, whiny voice that makes him sound like a teenager than an adult, and when Madoka yells and screams, it is absolutely painful to listen to. Hino\'s voice actor, Mitsuki Saiga, is also a prolific and very talented voice actress, but the voice she gives Hino just makes him sound like a strangled duck, and I feel bad about saying that because she\'s normally really good at what she does. But I find she\'s better at doing low pitched voices for quieter, more stoic characters than upbeat, loud, and cheerful ones. It really says something when the English dub voice actors for them turn out to be way better and more listenable. Seriously, watch the English dub. It\'s really good! That\'s really all I have to say on the show.Overall, don\'t let the misleading premise and image of Chihiro in a maid outfit fool you. Shounen Maid is the perfect example of how not to judge a book by its cover, and it\'s a nice, heartwarming, wholesome anime that deserves more love and appreciation than it gets. to condone pedophilia?!

The two just have a good chemistry as the childish adult and mature kid.but my favorite is Miyako whom despite being an Ojou sama is not afraid to try new things and is not prideful for a rich lady I mean she asks help from a kid and she's okay with it.Keiichiro is pretty normal and the rest of the characters are okay but they are likable in their own waysoverall each character is a ball of positive energy in which i really like.They are different traits that produces positivty which results in a really heartwarming show.Desugn and SoundAs for the Design I don't complain much about it as I know how hard it is animating a series but yeah I like their designs though i think it's something that's not memorable maybe because the anime does not standout at first glance.As for the Sound I think it's pretty okay as well I just think they could have chosen a better ending because I don't know what the three Idols are into the series other than to greet Madoka a happy birthday.Overall I think this show is just full of positivity and is very heartwarming, and surprisingly for me it's family friendly less ecchi less violence more comedy.It does not stand out when you see the picture or characters but give it a chance you'll enjoy it. has a funny genre it actually delivers it's message which I think is really good.Characters.There are only few characters and at first glance they are so-so like I said but for some reasons I find them likable, I wanna root for Chihiro fore being mature at such a young age I wanna hug Madoka for being childish even though he's old.

Are we all super spies when we continuously scroll through our exes Instagram profile and find out who their new beau is? I'd like to think so.It was really weird how the nephew dressed up as a cat for his uncle's birthday and let him pet him for the whole day because the uncle...was allergic to cats.

Sekirei: Pure Engagement,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5277/Sekirei__Pure_Engagement,"['Fanboys rejoice as the second season of Sekirei(a.k.a Pimpamon) is now out and I must admit, the direction to which this series is headed can only get better as the ""game"" mentioned last season, is finally starting to unravel.Story - 7For those who had followed the series back in 2008, Sekirei ~Pure Engagement~ is a continuation as Sahashi Minato endeavors to \'catch\' as many girls as he can to add to his harem collection. For those that haven\'t seen the first season, I strongly suggest watching the series or else SPE will not make any sense to you(nor this review).Plot-wise; with the final Sekirei...being \'winged\' in this season, SPE now delves into the Sekirei game which is the main focus to which Minato and others like him must compete in.I must admit I\'ve started to enjoy this series as the cast who had seemed like your average clichéd characters last season now seem to have some purpose for a plot to develop as a whole. Of course that doesn\'t mean the show has lost its other harem/ecchi clichés like your accidental \'oops, I tripped and fell on your breast\' gag, but what it does mean is that this series no longer has to rely on its fan-service to keep us from seeing how good this show can be...and it is. Whilst the idea of collecting women as battle figures like you would Pokemon may not be to everyone\'s preference, it\'s a gimmick that\'s aimed at a certain crowd and being part of that crowd, I think it\'s just pure genius!Art - 7Art for Sekirei is always a crowd-pleaser specially in the male department. As a fan of ecchi and hentai material, the creator has made sure that all the leading ladies with D-cups and above, are captured in every angle possible for the service fans had anticipated since first season.  In term\'s of animation I believe SPE has improved, and one episode of noteworthy is a particular Sekirei\'s \'winging\', which I have to say was beautifully animated compared to the previous seasons Sekirei\'s.Sound - 7The OP ""Hakuyoku no Seiyaku PE"" sung by the leading ladies of the series gives a feeling of nostalgia of 2 years ago as it\'s in the same rhythm, as well as the ED ""Onnaji Kimochi"". Also as a guy who doesn\'t like change when it comes to sequels or spin-offs, I was pleased to find that Seven Arcs studio had kept the original seiyuus to lend their voices for the cast of its sequel(especially since I\'m a big fan of Yukana).Character - 5Unfortunately not much has changed in regards to character development as Minato(uninspiring as he is), is still clueless to his actual surroundings. Whilst there are moments when you think he might actually shine when he stands up for one of his cast, it just doesn\'t outweigh how indecisive a male lead he can be.Minato aside, the supporting cast is what saves the show as we\'re shown Minato\'s harem increased, who have likable personalities that correspond with the original girls, and which one of them pretty much provides the comedy and humor for the series.One thing I did like about the sequel so far was the opening of episode one where we are shown a flashback of Miya(caretaker of Izumo Inn to which Minato boards) when she was part of the first Sekirei strike team. The two and a half minutes of pure demolition from her and her team, makes any Sekirei fan realize again just how ""bad ass"" she was. I can only assume that we will be seeing more of these flashbacks in future series as we discover how the Sekirei came to be.Enjoyment - 7As a guy who\'s not usually into harems(especially if it\'s an action where the male lead is useless), Sekirei is an anime I didn\'t mind watching and have found to be amusing since last season. Whilst it\'s not an FMA: Brotherhood or (insert your No.1 anime here), what it does deliver is pure fan-service with comedy and action. If anything, I believe this season may have raised my amusement up a notch opposed to the 6 I had given it back in 2008 and hopefully it get\'s better in future.(fingers crossed)OverAll - 7As I mentioned Sekirei ~Pure Engagement~ is not everyone\'s cup of tea, and for those looking for twists and/or a riveting story, this anime will not provide it.

Alot of the mistakes that were in Season one were Rectified. Good work! Still, obviously not the best, so only 8 points.Sound - 7The OP/ED themes are somewhat lacking, although cute.If you\'re looking for an anime that will inspire you with breathtaking sound effects and soundtracks, this is not the anime for you. The soundtracks in Season 2 DO fit with the story and theme, but there could have been better choices in my opinion. (Although this could be me, as I am a musician who writes his own music...and plays 7 instruments...but back to the anime..)Character - 9Character development is EXCELLENT. By the end of this season, there is little chance for one not to have selected a favorite character...I do dislike the fact that the animators seemed to favor Musubi (for example, in the main plot Tsukiumi had her own share of ""kills,"" but in the second season Tsukiumi doesn\'t have kills, she gets ""assists."") and thus it seems like Musubi and Minato become a ""Predetermined"" couple.Which is annoying. I personally love Tsundere characters (my own view at any rate) and Tsukiumi was really well developed into that role.At first sight, Kazehana appears as a typical drunk, but the animators did her a good turn by utilizing an episode entirely on her to better display the theme of love.Pretty much all of Minato\'s Sekirei change by the end of the second season.Maybe not Kusano and Matsu, but all of them tend to change and develop nicely.Enjoyment - 9Personally I enjoyed this season more than I enjoyed the first.Again, personal preference so this should really not matter.I did like that this had a little less boobies and more story. (Although there was still plenty of boobies!)Overall - 9What can I say? The animators did the OG Author a good favor by doing it their own way.If you are looking for some ecchi anime, and haven\'t watched the first season, watch the first season.For those of you who prefer story, I would advise Shakugan no Shana instead, although this is not to bad overall. the manga, and of the sekirei).Art - 8The art actually improved from Season 1 and began to look more like the OG Author\'s actual drawings.

It was a vile, misogynistic series without a single interesting character to be found and a crap story. Pure Engagement will probably be more of the same. Really, the only way this could potentially be fixed would be if they a) replaced the entire cast or b)forgot about the stupid fighting and fan-service scenes and used the time to develop the characters and actually elevate them beyond a single dimension. Let\'s see if that happens.I briefly considered just copying and pasting the first series review and making some minor changes, but I decided against it because it would be inexcusably lazy. Plus,...there are some differences. Pure Engagement picks up where the first series left off. The characters are twits, they\'re in a super-powered battle to be the last Sekirei standing. Pure Engagement lives up to its name, assuming you\'re using engagement in the ""battle"" sense. Any other usage of engagement would not be suitable. The first series mostly focused on the harem elements. This one focuses more on action sequences, although the harem elements are still there and they\'re still patently obnoxious and horribly misogynistic. The comedic elements mostly fail in this one, just as they did in the first series. It has two funny scenes and a lot that try but fail to be funny. This series does do better with the story aspects, however. And there\'s one reason for that. It has some scenes that border on decent. It doesn\'t have a lot, but there is some real effort put into the scenes with Chiho and Uzume. It\'s almost like taking time to explore the bonds between characters with some level of depth, small as it is in this series, leads to better scenes than cardboard stereotypes fighting over a typical protagonist to give the sexist twits in the audience some wish fulfillment. Still, these scenes make up a very small percentage of the series. The ending is a bit better, but it\'s still largely a pandering, typical happy ending. The treatment of the female characters remains largely abhorrent with them being heavily objectified. the plot remains replete with stupidity. Including the first season\'s ""this is a secret, but we\'ll just do it in the open where anyone could easily see it"" nonsense.The characters remain one-dimensional stereotypes, most of which act nothing like real people since they\'re designed to pander to fetishes (or to fill a cliche role in the case of the male characters) rather than to actually be, well, characters. The closest you get to developed characters are Chiho and Uzume in those bordering on decent scenes and even then they\'re closer to the archetypal ""hot lesbian couple"" you see in some media, the type that uses sexuality as a fetish, than developed characters.The artwork is a bit better than it was in the first series. Mainly because they do cut back on the absurd fan-service a bit. As a result you get more fight sequences that are actually decent and less that are thinly veiled excuses to strip the female characters. The fan-service is still at a ridiculously high level, however.Like the first, this one doesn\'t have good voice acting. the closest you get are Nabatame Hitomi and Ishizuka Sayori in those few scenes that border on decent. Even then they\'re just average. The music is pretty sub-par.The yuri factor is a 6/10. This one has more yuri moments than the first even moving from just having some homoerotic moments to a canonical relationship.So, how was Pure Engagement? It\'s a slight improvement over the first series. Overall it has the same massive problems, but it does manage some almost decent scene and some of the problems are diminished. It\'s still largely typical harem nonsense. Just with a bit more mindless action. I really can\'t recommend sitting through the first or even just the second series for those few almost decent scenes. So, how could this have been done well? If the seven twits had just not been there, the focus had been on a small number of characters, their relationships and personalities had actually had time to develop, the fan-service had been eliminated or, at least, severely reduced and the objectifying aspect of the premise had been eliminated this might have been a good series. So, virtually everything would have to be different. Final rating, 3/10. And the next review request I have is... Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari.

So, virtually everything would have to be different. Final rating, 3/10. And the next review request I have is... Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari. So, expect that review next week.', 'Wow. Color me impressed. After the first season of Sekirei, I didn\'t really have high hopes for Pure Engagement, in fact, I nearly skipped it all together. Thankfully, I decided against that. While the core elements that were featured in the first season are still present and in full force again, the vast improvements to just about every flaw the show had bring this series up from the forgetable, campy, and cliche harem show it was after season one to a thuroughly enjoyable show. And with that, let\'s get right into things.Pure engagement basically picks up where the first season ended, and the plot remains...unchanged. Minato and his corp of buxom female warriors are still participating in the Sekirei Plan. Personally, I liked the whole idea to begin with so seeing things were unchanged was nice if you ask me. Despite that fact, Pure Engagement does a much better job with the plot by adding in three twists to it that do an unbelievably good job of keeping things fresh and interesting. The first addition is the introduction of two new Sekerei to Minato\'s posse. The new members are a bit obvious, but what is impressive about them is the amount of work was put into them as opposed to the other members of the group; I\'ll go into more detail in the characters section though.The next twist is a sudden change in the rules of the game about a quarter way into the season. Basically, Minaka declares that any Ashikabi who doesn\'t have a win under their belt will be forcibly eliminated from the game and their Sekirei will cease to function. This was a brilliant alteration to the plot for two critical reasons; first of which is it\'s enabling battles to finally be pushed to the forefront. One of the few things that I actually liked about the first season were the battles between the Sekirei. They were surprisingly well done and the unique powers each of them posessed made them pretty interesting to watch, but there simply wasnt enough in the first season. Not the case this time around. Due to this new implementation, the many Ashikabi that have been trying to avoid participating in the game are now forced to play if they want to continue living with their partnered Sekirei. Thanks to this, not only do we see more fights in general, but we also get to see quite a few new Sekirei abilities. Admittedly, we only see most briefly, but it does a more than good job of keeping things new.Secondly, the rule also brings about a little bit more of a focus on monogamous relationships as it seems the majority of other Ashikabi only have one Sekirei, and since the majority of these new players have been hiding in order to not lose their partners, it\'s obvious these newbies are in love with their Sekrei. Thankfully, the show actually embraces this fact, and it\'s stated more than a few times that this is the case. The result is Minato and the gang fighting for a much greater purpose; to protect the Ashikabi and Sekirei who have grown to love each other. In turn, fights have much more importance now that we know the sad truth to why they must battle. Thanks to all this, we also are given a reason to truly hate Minaka and finally see him as the villain he is meant to be. It\'s all done extremely well and gets quite emotional a few times; it\'s really some decently powerful stuff.The third event I\'m not going to go too far into since it\'s essentially the ending. Suffice to say, like the change in the games rules, this final event is extremely well done as well. My issue with the first seasons ending was that it really didnt feel like an ending event for the most part, it was more like a mid-season plot arc than anything else, and didn\'t even really have a whole lot to do with Minato and company. Not the case this season. This time, not only is it about the main group, their actually sort of turned into targets. Once again, it enables a greater focus on fighting, and some of the best battles of the entire series occur during this time.Now let\'s talk about characters. Once again, this area has also been improved upon, though not as greatly as the story was. The problem is that the original members we met in season one aren\'t really touched up on enough, and generally remain about as generic as they were in the beginning. That\'s not to say there weren\'t any improvements on them at all. In fact, I\'ll even go so far as to say that ""nerdy boobs"" and ""the loli"" that I mentioned in my review of the first season will get promoted to finally being decent characters and grace them the privelage of being called their names, Matsu and Kusano, respectively. Where Matsu was little more than a creepy computer geek who bafflingly wanted to grope every other female in her proximity, this season she becomes a rather powerful, quite brilliant tech wiz. To get who she is in this season, think Oracle from Batman. We also learn a lot about her past in this season as well as her number in the Sekirei ""ladder"" which, I won\'t lie, actually took me by surprise.As for Kusano, she has changed quite a bit more. First season she rarely talked at all, instead communicating with an anoying set of squeeks and chirps in tandem with equally annoying generic anime facial expressions. Now, all I can say is she\'s freaking adorable. That\'s largely due to her spot on vo work...well at least as far as the English dub\'s Tia Ballard is concerned; she seriously nailed it this time around. As per usual, I don\'t watch subs, so I have no clue how her Japanese vo is, sorry. Also, the show makes her relationship with Minato normal, making sure to point out that she sees him as a brother as opposed to a romantic interest. On top of all that, she plays a much greater role as a character towards the second half of the show, and actually turns out being instrumental during the final two major story arcs.As for the two new members of the crew, I really don\'t want to reveal too much about them, as they are extremely interesting. Most who watched the first season likely know who the two are already, but for those who don\'t I\'ll keep it a surprise. I do want to say though, the work done in terms of their backstory and character development is extremely well done. Both of them we discover are very prominent figures in regards to MBI and the game in general and both are quite powerful for very special reasons.As for the art, it\'s similar to last seasons, but I will admit that I felt it was improved upon at least a bit. Character designs are far more consistent this season with the girls looking to be somewhere between relatively normally proportioned (once again, aside from their rack) and ""Barbie Doll"" unnatural. So, yeah, they look like what you\'d expect when you hear ""hot anime girl"". As far as the environments and such go, they too seem to have received some extra TLC this time around. Overall, it\'s still a pretty well animated show.Oh. Yeah; their tits still look surprisingly good too.Sound is once again a weak link, though this time I\'d say its the weakest. For the most part music is forgettable, though once again, the op is very well done sounding even more epic than the original, which is nice as it mirrors my feelings for this season as a whole. For the most part, the vo is of the same quality as last season, with the sole exception of Kusano\'s Tia Ballard, who really stepped up her game this go around. The usual ending theme is kind of ""meh"", as are the unique ones that play after significant plot arcs conclude.Now, before I end this review I want to touch briefly on the comedy this season. Anyone who read my review of the first season may realize I never once mentioned it. That was for a good reason; it was straight up awful. So much so that it was hardly worth mentioning. Filled with far to many recurrent ecchi humor gags and feeble attempts at generic harem jokes, it was just terrible. Thankfully a lesson was learned and this season is actually quite funny with more than a few laugh-out-loud moments. It does still have a few moments where it falls back on those over used gimmicks, but this time you\'ll only see them happen once or twice and their done for good.So if you watched the first season and were trying to figure out if Pure Engagement is even worth your time, I\'ll say yes, it most certainly is. Give it a shot, and I can almost promise you you\'ll be surprised at how much better its gotten. The season ends with almost a promise that we\'ll be getting a third season (no idea if that\'s still really the case or not but...); and this time I\'m actually pretty excited to see it. Very well done. Very well done, indeed. unchanged. Minato and his corp of buxom female warriors are still participating in the Sekirei Plan. Personally, I liked the whole idea to begin with so seeing things were unchanged was nice if you ask me. Despite that fact, Pure Engagement does a much better job with the plot by adding in three twists to it that do an unbelievably good job of keeping things fresh and interesting.

Suffice to say, like the change in the games rules, this final event is extremely well done as well. My issue with the first seasons ending was that it really didnt feel like an ending event for the most part, it was more like a mid-season plot arc than anything else, and didn\'t even really have a whole lot to do with Minato and company. Not the case this season. This time, not only is it about the main group, their actually sort of turned into targets. Once again, it enables a greater focus on fighting, and some of the best battles of the entire series occur during this time.Now let\'s talk about characters. Once again, this area has also been improved upon, though not as greatly as the story was. The problem is that the original members we met in season one aren\'t really touched up on enough, and generally remain about as generic as they were in the beginning. That\'s not to say there weren\'t any improvements on them at all. In fact, I\'ll even go so far as to say that ""nerdy boobs"" and ""the loli"" that I mentioned in my review of the first season will get promoted to finally being decent characters and grace them the privelage of being called their names, Matsu and Kusano, respectively. Where Matsu was little more than a creepy computer geek who bafflingly wanted to grope every other female in her proximity, this season she becomes a rather powerful, quite brilliant tech wiz. To get who she is in this season, think Oracle from Batman. We also learn a lot about her past in this season as well as her number in the Sekirei ""ladder"" which, I won\'t lie, actually took me by surprise.As for Kusano, she has changed quite a bit more. First season she rarely talked at all, instead communicating with an anoying set of squeeks and chirps in tandem with equally annoying generic anime facial expressions. Now, all I can say is she\'s freaking adorable. That\'s largely due to her spot on vo work...well at least as far as the English dub\'s Tia Ballard is concerned; she seriously nailed it this time around. As per usual, I don\'t watch subs, so I have no clue how her Japanese vo is, sorry. Also, the show makes her relationship with Minato normal, making sure to point out that she sees him as a brother as opposed to a romantic interest. On top of all that, she plays a much greater role as a character towards the second half of the show, and actually turns out being instrumental during the final two major story arcs.As for the two new members of the crew, I really don\'t want to reveal too much about them, as they are extremely interesting. Most who watched the first season likely know who the two are already, but for those who don\'t I\'ll keep it a surprise. I do want to say though, the work done in terms of their backstory and character development is extremely well done. Both of them we discover are very prominent figures in regards to MBI and the game in general and both are quite powerful for very special reasons.As for the art, it\'s similar to last seasons, but I will admit that I felt it was improved upon at least a bit. Character designs are far more consistent this season with the girls looking to be somewhere between relatively normally proportioned (once again, aside from their rack) and ""Barbie Doll"" unnatural. So, yeah, they look like what you\'d expect when you hear ""hot anime girl"". As far as the environments and such go, they too seem to have received some extra TLC this time around. Overall, it\'s still a pretty well animated show.Oh. Yeah; their tits still look surprisingly good too.Sound is once again a weak link, though this time I\'d say its the weakest. For the most part music is forgettable, though once again, the op is very well done sounding even more epic than the original, which is nice as it mirrors my feelings for this season as a whole. For the most part, the vo is of the same quality as last season, with the sole exception of Kusano\'s Tia Ballard, who really stepped up her game this go around. The usual ending theme is kind of ""meh"", as are the unique ones that play after significant plot arcs conclude.Now, before I end this review I want to touch briefly on the comedy this season. Anyone who read my review of the first season may realize I never once mentioned it. That was for a good reason; it was straight up awful. So much so that it was hardly worth mentioning. Filled with far to many recurrent ecchi humor gags and feeble attempts at generic harem jokes, it was just terrible. Thankfully a lesson was learned and this season is actually quite funny with more than a few laugh-out-loud moments. It does still have a few moments where it falls back on those over used gimmicks, but this time you\'ll only see them happen once or twice and their done for good.So if you watched the first season and were trying to figure out if Pure Engagement is even worth your time, I\'ll say yes, it most certainly is. Give it a shot, and I can almost promise you you\'ll be surprised at how much better its gotten. The season ends with almost a promise that we\'ll be getting a third season (no idea if that\'s still really the case or not but...); and this time I\'m actually pretty excited to see it. Very well done. Very well done, indeed.', ""Sekirei, a mix of repetitive comedy, girl to girl action, and a intoxicative amount of breasts.Story-5 AverageThe story in the first season was pretty good, somewhat fresh and interesting. A boy meets a bunch of girls that will fight for him, but he doesn't really want them to fight but doesn't know what to do. What I got from the second season felt like a copy and paste from season 1. But this time, it lost it's freshness and felt very dull.Art-7 GoodThe art and animation in Sekrei isn't anything special. At times the costume can be dull, and I always feel that the eyes...of the characters are to big for the face. But when it comes to the animation in fighting scenes, I think they are pretty flashy and nicely done. Anything else like backgrounds isn't extremely detailed, but it isn't bad.Sound-8 Very GoodThe BGM in Sekirei doesn't really stand out, I sometimes think there isn't any at all. But what really stood out was the opening and ending. They really fit into the story, and it's fresh. The song and animation of the op and ed matches very well, and I thought it's a bit funny when I first saw it.Characters-7 GoodTypical? I thought that the characters were not very original. You typical guy wanna protect the girls protecting him. The main girl that is ALWAYS happy. The girl that always fights with the main girl over something etc. etc. But yet I still thought that they were very likable. They fit into the story, and they can be really funny sometimes.Enjoyment-9 GreatI really enjoyed this series. Some of the comedy it really funny, and some of the characters (even though they're unoriginal) can be put into a funny scene and be funny too! And not to mention, for all you ecchi fans out there (Including me XD), this is the right anime for you. Large amounts of exposed breasts and panties (woot for the fan-service!)Overall-7 GoodOverall, I enjoyed this anime for it's comedy, action, and ecchi (XD XD XD) If you're looking for a serious anime, then look somewhere else.

My goal is to be as unbiased as possible so i suggest reading the review rather than looking at my rating to make your choice. As this is a sequel it is also geared towards more of what to expect if you wish to continue.-Little focus on other Ashikabi.While this leaves more time for Minato, it would have been nice to see more interaction between them. There is obviously fighting between the groups, yet I don't recall more than one other ashikabi having any true impact.-I was honestly surprised by an arc...twist.Without spoiling much, i will say there is a chance a twist will actually work. It is not groundbreaking, but in the relative atmosphere of the show i didn't see it coming.-Next phase begins, and more fighting ensues.As usual there are fights between the 108 sekirei. However it seems that, while not lacking, there was less fighting than the previous season. This is also due to the fact that the fighting is distributed to the large cast of Minato's sekirei so don't expect your favorite character to fight more then a few times. It also seemed that the fights were shorter.-Matsu, Uzume, Kazehana and Homura get the focus.I found out just how truly awesome Matsu really was all this time. Actually, along with Kuu she became my favorite sekirei personality wise. The other members get some much needed development; Uzume and Homura's secret identities from the first season finally comes into play, as we can expect a bit more closer. While we learn about a few of the other older sekirei there is minimal development from other characters. twist.Without spoiling much, i will say there is a chance a twist will actually work.

Not only am I doing a review of this segment of the anime, but the anime in it\'s entirety. But a warning. There are spoilers.Story: 8Reason: This story is a very compelling one, something that drives you into watching the next episode every time, when I was watching this story unfold when the first season came out, it was just a compelling story. And when it seems like everything is going to be peaches and cream, they tell you that only one Sekirei gets to be with their Ashikabi. And that seems depressing because of the fact that he...meets so many wonderous Sekirei as the episodes come. So in the end, it has a very heartwarming story. With breasts galore, I might add. I\'m not one to say that an anime really pulled on my heart strings, but this one sure did.Art: 9Reasoning: The artwork that I saw within this series was extremely fluid, even within the battle scenes, because with some of the anime I\'ve been watching, it seems very sloppy, but Sekirei was different. This anime was very well done in terms of the art because nothing was poorly drawn, everything was put into care. The characters looked cute, and most of their body was put into proportion, but that\'s what you get when you\'re looking at a ""harem"" anime. Breasts WILL be more developed. But I digress.Sound: 9Reasoning: The soundtrack was amazing, I loved it because it really enhanced the mood of the scene whether it be sad or happy or anything inbetween. The Openings and Endings were also a joy to listen to. I have been a musician for 10 years, and the background music was invigorating. Something that I completely enjoyed, through and through.Character: 10Reasoning: The emotions that were drawn from this anime, I cannot fathom. The characters were very unique. Some of them had quirks and stereotypes, but a couple of them through me for a loop. Tsukiumi with her ""Shakespearean"" speech was quite humourous at times. And I liked that a lot. And Musubi for always being a smiling, cheerful girl. Someone, no matter what the situation, she always has a smile on her face. That\'s something I\'m not used to. And Kusano, the cute little thing. I like her as well because of the fact she believes that she is one of the women, even though she hasn\'t even developed yet, and her willingness to try as hard as the others, despite what I had mentioned before. Matsu, being the nerdy girl she is, I love how she\'s also a little perverted, because it reminds me of a certain ""Soul Eater"" character that loves to do ""experiments"". And Miya, how she is always so motherly and kind to each and every one of them. I cannot even dream of losing even one of these characters in the story. When I had seen that Usume was dying, after she had been attacked by ""No.16"" to defend Musubi, it brought me to tears, because she was such a loving character, and no matter what wrong she committed, she was doing it to help her Ashikabi live another day. I couldn\'t help myself to cry when she told Minato to take care of Chiho, as her final request. The protagonists of Sekirei seem to be a very lovable bunch, and in turn, if I were able to live with them, I totally would.The more villainous ones characters are also flawless, because they are so sinister, and so evil, that they would think it is just ""entertainment"" to see innocent lives be taken away from people. While they may be Sekirei, they still act and feel just like humans, and react just as humans would do. But to see them just be killed or ""deactivated"" is some man\'s ""entertainment"" which is just sick, in my personal opinion. And even though they are sinister, there is a bit of comedy in them, with Benitsubasa as the comedic relief of the Disciplinary Squad, which reminds me of Team Rocket a little bit because even though they may be all evil and have the mindframe to kill, they still have some comedic bits about them that you can\'t seem to get out of your head.Enjoyment: 10Reasoning: I completely loved this series, 100%. There was just something about this anime that really reeled me in after the episode had finished. There was this sense of wanting more, that I always had. I couldn\'t stop myself from wanting the next episode. I laughed, I cried, and I loved this anime. I couldn\'t veer myself away from this series because some of the characters were very heartwarming.Overall: This anime was an absolute wonder to watch. The series was riveting, and the characters were well thought out, even though a few of them had cliched roles, Tsukiumi being tsundere, Kuu being the small lolita, Kazehana being the drunkard, Matsu being the quirky perverted nerd, Homura being the distant, aloof guy and Musubi being the happy-go-lucky girl. But you gotta love \'em anyways.It may have not been one of the top series in my list, but it\'s a very solid anime that I think anyone that loves action, and harem in the same title should be able to see. I sincerely hope they make a third season, because it\'s killing me to know what happens to Musubi, Minato and the rest of the Sekirei bunch. meets so many wonderous Sekirei as the episodes come.

If you don\'t know, to sum it up it\'s about very attractive chicks beating the tar out of each other, In some cases killing one another. But that\'s not why you want to watch this show, you want to watch it because of the ""PLOT"". Plot being ASS & BREAST. Although it is harem & ecchie, after a couple episodes & if you watched the 1st season you gained somewhat of an attachment to a few characters, if not all. On to my review then shall we...=)STORY: The story is very enjoyable if you\'re very easily entertained. If you\'re looking for an Anime that takes itself very seriously, this isn\'t the show for you. Like many Harems it revolves around a 19 year old guy who happends run into a girl with remarkable power Physically. As the story presses on he gains more very attractive girls who proclaim their feelings for him & will die before they someone hurt their master.Art: The Art in this show is very good. The colors, details, & character development are on par with other Animes.SOUND: The sound is very pleasing on the ears, you shouldn\'t have a issue there.CHARACTER: The only thing I found very disappointing in the one of characters was that one of the main support characters, is a little girl that shouldn\'t  have been in this anime to begin with because of the ""PLOT"". I feel as though they could of put a more older character to compliment the show of attractive girls even more.ENJOYMENT: Based on my viewing, it was an enjoyable watch  overall.OVERALL: If you\'re looking for a harem & ecchie that has action, look no further this is the show for you.Enjoy =) =)STORY: The story is very enjoyable if you\'re very easily entertained.

Whenever's there's a fight going about to happen between the girls, there's a stiff walk from the background characters that slowly leaves or were never there in the next scene as if the before scene was never created.

Otherwise, here's my take on Sekirei ~Pure Engagement~. The story picks up right after the last episode of the first series. Minato and his Sekireis are now into the next stage of the Sekirei Plan. That and the introduction of some new additions to Minato's already 'huge' lineup. This series now opens with new information about the Sekirei Plan and how it came into fruition.The continuation of the series is a relatively easy gateway into the actual origin of the sekireis. A lot more info has been introduced and...if you already have seen the first series, the story goes deeper and takes a more serious tone. It still holds a lot of the humor that made it funny but the plot itself is now more interesting and a little more darker. It also brings in some characters that you have seen before but now have a more integral part in this series. The existing characters are still entertaining but have also developed more into their roles as Minato's sekirei.Art/Animation of the series never really changed much which is a good thing. Character design is still close to flawless. Since the story is more intense, so was the animation so it stepped it's game up a notch. If you're a fan of Sekirei, then this should be a no-brainer. Hopefully, the next series will be just as good, if not better..... if there will be any..... if you already have seen the first series, the story goes deeper and takes a more serious tone.

Hopefully, the next series will be just as good, if not better..... if there will be any....."", ""Let me start by saying I've neevr read, nor do I really plan to read the Sekirei manga, so I won't be making any comparisons to it, however I have read the comments and most people seem to agree that until the final 5 episodes or so it's fairly faithful to what's in the manga. Take that for as much, or little, as you wish.Sekirei: Pure Engagement is the sequel to Sekirei and with a largely story driven anime like this it really is important to have watched the prequel first, I'll be writing this as if you had. But if you didn't enjoy Sekirei...then you might as well stop here, the formula remains very similar and it's unlikely Pure Engagement will turn your view on the series around if you didn't enjoy the first season.With those two little disclaimers hung up let's move on to the plot; well as I hinted at above, not much has changed. We see the Sekirei Plan move forward, I'll avoid giving too many spoilers here but really most people can likely guess at how it's likely to go. With most of the Sekirei snapped up by the end of the first season Pure Engagement is more focused on relationships within the group/harem/cast than adding more people to it and we see more action in general than the first season. Sadly though there are several plot threads that are left dangling at the end and no real conclusion is ever met, even without having read the manga it's quite clear when the anime deviates as the last few episodes suddenly jump in pacing to hurry to a conclusion of some kind within the 13 episodes given. Also if you're anything like me you'll get annoyed by the consistant lack of use of Norito's despite being established as being the 'ultimate attack' of any Sekirei they are used maybe.. 3 times in this entire series.Art wise, well art is always a subjective thing so I won't comment on the style but it's pretty much the same as Sekirei, very few changes and I didn't notice any serious quality drops or flucctuations, characters seemed consistant and easily identifyable. But then I didn't watch to look for these things so it's perfectly possible they slipped me by.With the characters, well it's a sequal so there's not much to say here Uzume gets some welcome exposition but there are very few entirely new characters introduced between seasons and those that are are usually cameos at best so if you liked them in the first season, you'll like them here.Sound quality was good and I never found the voice actors ill-suited to their character or found any of them to get grating. For the OP and ED, again these are subjective, I enjoyed them at the time but neither is likely to find it's way onto my computer or ipod and I wouldn't fault anyone for skipping them over.In conclusion Sekirei: Pure Engagement is just what it says on the tin, a continuation of Sekirei, if you enjoyed the first series then you'll enjoy this but if you were expecting evolution of the sries in the sequal then you'll likely be dissapointed. then you might as well stop here, the formula remains very similar and it's unlikely Pure Engagement will turn your view on the series around if you didn't enjoy the first season.With those two little disclaimers hung up let's move on to the plot; well as I hinted at above, not much has changed.

I definintely recommend watching the first part of the story before giving this a look. It continues where the last one left off, and there are 2 OVA\'s between the seasons that are completely optional to watch. As a stand alone anime it isn\'t bad, in fact if you\'ve only seen the first season/series anime and not read the manga then this is completely worth your time. This anime has enough action and comedy to be a stand up sequel/second season. I am actually glad they added the ""Pure Engagement"" to the title, because it really...is packed with filler and a truncated version of the manga storyline. This is not adapted as closely as the first season/series is.This is a fun series to watch, even the OVA\'s are (which I will not rate separately, my score includes the OVA\'s because of how different this is from the manga) worth watching for a few giggles. If you have read the manga before watching the anime then you may have a problem with this series.Firstly, the manga is far superior to the anime as far as story and artwork goes. The part of the story they ended the first season on was changed a bit, so they recovered at the beginning of this season with filler episodes. Once they had the story back on track they truncated it so they could end this season with an original sort of finale. For those that care about accuracy with manga adaptations, you have now been warned. That being said, it\'s still worth watching, and I gave it a 6 because it\'s still not quite as good as the first season/series.All in all, not a bad watch. is packed with filler and a truncated version of the manga storyline.

This is the series that I believe sets the gold standard on everything: how to pace a 13-episode season, how to write a wide array of characters, how to write those characters interacting off of one another and, yes, how to integrate T&A fan service into a show. This is a show that I believe does everything right.The StoryFrom what I hear, this season deviates from the manga. However, since I do not read manga and believe an adaptation should be able to stand on its own, I do...not care if this is true or not. So, what's the story? Highlander. It's Highlander, albeit Highlander-by-way-of-buxom-superpowered-women: a limited number of superhuman beings, some good and some evil, fighting it out in one-on-one battles because they all seek to win a contested and immaterial prize that each one desires, for in the end, there can be only one. Yeah, if you liked the story of Highlander, then you'll like this. And since Highlander is one of my all-time favorite movies and Highlander: Endgame one of my favorite guilty pleasures, I'm very biased in favor of Sekirei, which deviates from its Highlander root just enough to stay fresh.The CharactersThe opening character scene in Maison Izumo is easily the best way to re-introduce characters that I've seen in a show. Each one is allowed to interact with each other and the voice acting and animation characterize them very strongly. Each one also has a different relationship with each other one, and no two characters talk to each other in the same way. This is a perfect portrait of Sekirei's characters: they're all unique, they're all memorable, they're all easily distinguishable from one-another, and while the archetypes they're based on feel familiar, they do have traits that set them apart from those archetypes, though these aren't made clear from the get-go. Point is, the characters, even the minor ones, are all well-conceived and each are compelling in their own right. That's not to say that EVERY character gets long interactions with one another, but this is a series with over 20 NAMED characters, not counting all the ones that appear as one-off opponents for the main characters. I expect quality, not the impossible.The SoundI rate this a ten mostly because I was never distracted by the sound quality or music, which is always a good thing, but DAT OPENING. Holy crap, that is a badass opening number: starting off calm, picking up speed as it builds intrigue and shows us our characters, before finally going full-steam-ahead to set the tone of the action and the show. Brilliant.The ArtAt first, I was taken aback by the character design, particularly the way the breasts and eyes were drawn, but it's done in a way that makes it stand out. I really love how no two characters look alike, from the hair to the eyes to the clothing. They look almost like they were designed with pastel paintings rather than anime artists, and it helps give the series identity. I didn't spot any major flaws with the animation but, again, totally biased in favor of the show because of the freakin' awesome story and characters, totally possible I missed all the lazy animation moments and that this series has terrible art. So sue me.EnjoymentI tell people that this action-heavy, character-driven show about busty women and sexy men hitting each other is my favorite anime, everyone always laughs at me. I constantly try to convince other people to check it out, and people say it's just a shallow fan service anime. To them, I say nay. Sekirei is the antithesis of your run-of-the-mill action-ecchi show: the fan service is kept on a leash, the characters are all given likable personalities (even the villain is hard to hate sometimes for how over-the-top eccentric and full of himself he is) and the pacing flows from one episode to another. This is my kind of show: the one that gets even better the more I think about it and analyze it, unveiling new layers of win as I delve deeper into it. Few other shows do this, and even fewer do this while also putting a fresh spin on a beloved hardcore '80s action movie. Really, the only way I could think of to improve this show (aside from giving it the 3rd season it deserves) is to bring Freddie Mercury back from the dead to do the soundtrack. not care if this is true or not.

The close bonds they develop live in the shadow of an end that there can only be one left standing. Another thing this series does an outstanding job with is the handle on the young female character. Many series hyper-sexualize young women. Sekirei doesn't make this mistake. Instead, Ku is one of the most adorable and tasteful characters you will ever meet in an anime. The MC is a loser. So, nothing special there. And the formal blonde is...a bit over the top. I feel like they could have expressed her personality by turning that dial to a good 7 instead of 10. It's worth mentioning that Sekirei is loaded with great fanservice. The soundtrack isn't too memorable. The art is nothing insane, but it's still great. The biggest problem with this series for me was the reason they are in this terrible position. The whole time you'll feel like their circumstances being the result of someone's entertainment is just a bit off. Just seems like they could have played that hand a bit better. All in all, Sekirei is an amazing show loaded with good fanservice and feels. a bit over the top. I feel like they could have expressed her personality by turning that dial to a good 7 instead of 10.

The story is what's interesting about the show, the whole survival game was interesting, but at the end it gets really weird and I think this is where the producers went overboard.The art and sound were good, every character had a unique appearance quality. The voice actors were great for the characters given to them.The characters are all lovable. I totally doubt anyone will dislike the main characters in this. Each of them are funny in their own way.Overall I really...did enjoy both the Sekireis. Despite the harem and fan service it was still good, the main character wasn't a pervert and he was a respectable guy.

Other reviewers have done this to death, and inspired themselves more than enough !Secondly, I will also not talk about the surface plot; it has also been done into the ground by others.There are however, matters that have not been discussed; that I think needs some words.1).  The SekireiThese people are off-world aliens, in cold-storage. Some back-story about them, in their own right; would have been nice. But there is none. Their aged vessel is...discovered by college students. Were the Sekirei sent to help the Mankind they found? Were they sent here to conquer us? Or did they just crash-land, and just never get woke up, by the onboard computer (which is shown still running)? More importantly, in the vein of the resurrecting of the Sekirei, by Minaka Hiroko and others; what would the Sekirei have been if they were never ""adjusted""? We will never know. Is there any larger lost opportunity?2). The descent into pure evil.Minaka Hiroko is not the genius he is portrayed. Anyone can back-engineer someone else\'s technology, and then become a profiteer on the backs of the superior creators of the technology, in the first place. Did Minaka create anything new? No. Did he use the gene-pool he discovered, to advance the intelligence and capabilities of Mankind (including himself)? No. When we realize that genetic modifications not only change the living, in their own time; they also change the next generation and the next. The changes tend to be permanent.But Minaka had a better idea. Let\'s use the modified Sekirei to promote a game, which ultimately ends in the death of all Sekirei. They die, for a purpose that is obviously a huge lie. The viewer should not accept Minaka\'s premise. There is no prize, he knows they\'re all going to die. No win, no way out, pain and suffering for everybody connected.WHAT A WASTE!----------------------------------------------In other words, Sekirei Pure Engagement is a snuff-anime. It\'s not about Life. It\'s all about Death. Heroic moments in the story line do not forgive the fact that ultimately, Minaka Hiroko will find a way to force the Sekirei to kill each other. That was his original aim, his process during the game, and his plan for the ultimate outcome. It\'s all about the Game, for his amusement. He might as well have been a audience member at a Roman Circus, Gladiators murdering each other and all. No other value is possible, for Minaka. He even hands out strange gifts, to the viewers and participants; like the Roman Emperor used to do when he offers Bread and Wine to the viewing throng, for their amusement and edification.The artwork is quite good. The music is mediocre at best; I would have expected other reviewers to have higher standards. The interior music, in support of plot points, is more than adequate.The acting dialog is above average. For some anime, I like sub-english, because the Japanese actors fit the characters well. But in this particular case; both the sub and dub versions are more than adequate. I happen to be a fan of several dub-actors: Colleen Clinkenbeard, Stephanie Young, Jamie Marchi, Clarine Harp, Brittany Karbowski; and many others. All are in attendance, in Sekirei Pure Engagement. And all are inspired.In the end however, Heroic deeds, and Heroic strains of Music; cannot take away from the basic component of Sekirei Pure Engagement.A sadness beyond all description.I give Sekirei Pure Engagement, and it\'s first season ""Sekirei"" a 7. discovered by college students.

The story's not as fresh as it first was. The main character has already achieved something and some trump cards can't be played again without seeming repetitive.The story hasn't changed much since the last season. Parts of the background story were revealed but that didn't change my perspective on the whole story much. I was sometimes annoyed by the action of the main character and some elements of this series got a bit old.The animation is still good.

This is actually the second time I've watched Pure Engagement, ony this time, I watched the English dub. So, does it hold up? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe adventures of Minato and his Sekirei continue as they struggle to survive in the second stage of the Sekirei plan. With the main characters' introductions complete, I do believe that Pure Engagement was the point where the show was allowed to dig deeper into the secret history of the Sekirei, the nature of their powers and their connections with their Ashikabi....Unfortunately, the balance between comedy and drama feels pretty uneven, and moments that should be taken seriously are ruined by the characters making a quick joke or some sort of fanservice moment that feels distracting in an otherwise dramatic moment. (6/10)CharactersPure Engagement does a respectable job at continuing the character development of the main cast, at least on an individual basis. As two more Sekirei join Minato's harem, they understand the necessity of working together in the middle of a huge battle royale. Kagari begins to understand that she doesn't need to take on every burden by herself and Tsukiumi (my favorite character) no longer has any problem working with Musubi if it means protecting Minato from danger. If there's one criticism I can throw at the main cast, however, is that they are too reactive for their own good. Winning the Sekirei war doesn't seem like an imperative goal for them and it's only till the endgame that the main characters become proactive and do something without being pushed by outside forces. (7/10)ArtPure Engagement is the point where the fanservice stops being titillating and becomes outright distracting. Seriously, there are enough scenes of breasts, butts and torn clothes to make even the most dedicated fans of ecchi exhausted. (6/10)SoundsWhile the opening and closing songs of Pure Engagement aren't nearly as fun as those from season 1, they're still enjoyable in their own right. Also, I don't think I can say anything about the vocal performances that hasn't been said already. Both the Japanese and the American versions boast some of the best voice actors that I've listened to in years. No matter which version of Sekirei you watch, you can expect the vocal performances to be amazing. (8/10)ConclusionTo be honest, I didn't have as much fun watching Pure Engagement a second time as I did the first time. Now that I knew what was gonna happen, and with the show's flaws more obvious to me, Pure Engagement felt longer and more tedious than it should have been.

The comedy is still here as well.Very easy to enjoy and to watch. I highly recommend buying a copy on ebay for $50-60 before the price gets too ridiculous. Season 1 & 2 together cost four times the cost of pure engagement on BD. As you\'ve probably already read, Tsukiumi is annoying in how she speaks with ""thou and dost."" If you can get over that, there isn\'t much else you...need to force yourself to get through. Uzume and Kazehana make up for it. Kusano ""Ku"" likes to say ""big brother"" when she talks to Minato. It is the cutest. Yet not in a pervy way that I can\'t help but think some other animes are. Brittney Karbowski\'s voice is actually almost pleasant when she voices Hikari.Overall, if you like Infinite Stratos or High School of the Dead, I am confident you will like this one as well.

"The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls: Anytime, Anywhere with Cinderella.",https://myanimelist.net/anime/32174/The_iDOLMSTER_Cinderella_Girls__Anytime_Anywhere_with_Cinderella,"['The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls has been a fairly bumpy ride throughout its two cours and its esoteric nature makes it an uneasy recommendation. While it looks nice with stunning sakuga cuts and it has some nice insert songs and background music, the drama becomes a slog to get through and it expects you to know who all these faces are, be it the 14 main girls with TakeP/Producer, the 3 that make a small cameo just to show off their appeal, the other 5 that are there in the background, the 4 over there that are singing that insert song, the two unvoiced ones in...the foreground there and don\'t forget that group over there, they\'re my favourites and also...While it\'s not necessary to know all of them, it really helps make the show more enjoyable if you\'re familiarised with the idols here.While this OVA features a bit of an extended cast for a skit or two, it decides to null the melodrama and solely go for an ""idol asshatting"" approach. Nothing serious, just a bunch of loose skits showing the girls interacting while on the job. As plain as that may sound, I feel that those moments from the last two seasons were the series biggest strengths, besides the stage performances that weren\'t entirely slideshows. The IM@S tradition of a fake movie trailer is finally continued here, and it\'s up to the standards of the last two in terms of wonder and awe, Kirari smacks Syuko through a wall, Nyowah~ ☆The art quality is on par with the rest of the series for the most part, things look fine but it probably gets a little iffy trying to animate 14 girls all reacting to something, so the quality tends to drop when more of them are on screen. There\'s a bunch of sakuga cuts here and there and the movie trailer also has some wicked good cuts. Seriously though that one scene where Uzuki takes down three guys is great, thank you Megumi Kouno. The only complaint is that the fight scenes are a tease, while they look so good they just aren\'t long enough, then again they\'re just a part of a movie trailer but still.As for sound, there\'s only one insert song, Absolute Nine. It\'s a bit of a serious sounding number and it\'s used fittingly for the movie trailer. The OST here is pleasant, it just kinda exists to compliment the scenes, only poking out when there\'s nothing else there on the audio front. A favourite of mine is the very mild jazzy track that starts off with a whimsical glockenspiel line, you know, that one, yeah (it starts up when Ranko and Koume are talking off set at around the 7:30 mark in this episode.)For characters there\'s mainly the Cinderella Project girls for this episode, with cameo appearances from Project Krone, the Totokira Gakuen group, Nana, Koume and Mizuki. TakeP is still the stoic shining star of this series.Everyone\'s on trope hyperdrive for this one, almost as if they\'re all trying to cram in as much of themselves as possible into this before saying goodbye for the time being.Overall it\'s a very fun and enjoyable send-off for the Cinderella Girls show, and the episode this series deserved. the foreground there and don\'t forget that group over there, they\'re my favourites and also...While it\'s not necessary to know all of them, it really helps make the show more enjoyable if you\'re familiarised with the idols here.While this OVA features a bit of an extended cast for a skit or two, it decides to null the melodrama and solely go for an ""idol asshatting"" approach.

TakeP is still the stoic shining star of this series.Everyone\'s on trope hyperdrive for this one, almost as if they\'re all trying to cram in as much of themselves as possible into this before saying goodbye for the time being.Overall it\'s a very fun and enjoyable send-off for the Cinderella Girls show, and the episode this series deserved.', 'Do you remember Episode 15 of the original idolm@ster anime?...this special is pretty much that but with a Cinderella Girls coat all over it.For those not knowing what LA is going on about, this Cinderella Girls special is 28 minutes split into various vignettes of the Cinderella Girls Master girls with two other girls as cameos (those being Nina Ichihara voiced by \'\'Misaki Kuno\'\' and Koume Shirasaka voiced by \'\'Chiyo Ousaki\'\') going about their daily lives as idols and just some one-off moments here and there.LA will get straight to it, if you wanted the more comedic moments with the Cinderella Girls away from all...the ""melodrama"" of the first and second seasons, then this special is a definite watch. The comedic moments although predictable can actually give most of the huge cast of the Cinderella Girls a bit more depth in their characters outside their stereotypical ""likes"" or ""tropes that made their character"", with the New Generation Girls getting the most screentime now that LA thinks on it.In terms of animation, the backgrounds are pretty much the best thing about the animation, the character design animation goes from being very detailed (see Anya\'s eyes) to janky (see Uzuki\'s face), it\'s overall inconsistent and can be a bit annoying as it clashes A LOT with the beautiful backgrounds.LA wished that this special would be between the first and second season (as in release date) as it fits in quite well much like the original idolm@ster anime series (having a relaxing time with the girls away from and before all the drama happens), but The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls: Anytime, Anywhere with Cinderella as a whole is a pleasant comedic bout with the Cinderella Girls where hilarity will ensue to some rather good effect. the ""melodrama"" of the first and second seasons, then this special is a definite watch.

Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki 3rd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/541/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki_3rd_Season,"['Anyone who has ever so much as scanned my anime list here on MAL knows that I have a peculiar fondness for the OVA format of anime, particularly of that era in the late 80\'s and early 90\'s when the format was at its height. In a decade of being an anime fan, I\'ve completed well over 200 series of this type, and to this day I still kind of prefer it just because of the superior quality you tend to have when animators can concentrate their time and energy on a small episode count.That being said, Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki 3 easily wins my nomination...for Most Disappointing OVA Ever.Maybe my hopes were too high. I did go into the series with certain expectations. It\'s hard not to have expectations when the first episode of the series is littered with unedited footage borrowed from its parent series. (See my MAL blog for a sample screen capture. Both images are mere minutes apart within a single episode!)Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki 1 was classic, must-watch anime, and TMRO3 ep. 1 reminds us why: The animation in the original series was juicy and detailed, the story had a natural flow from one event to the next, the characters defined one another through their interactions, and there was plenty of action and motion that held onto our attention on the screen from the beginning to the end.It wasn\'t Gone With the Wind, but it was decent entertainment. It knew what we wanted and it did the best damn job it could of staying focused and delivering the goods.Ryo-Ohki 2 was not as focused. It was more episodic like the Tenchi Muyo! TV series, with lighthearted episodes centered around babysitting and Ryo-Ohki having a crush on Tenchi too. But it was still pretty good. Some episodes were pretty funny, and there were still fight scenes and energetic activity on-screen most of the time. Well… except for that last episode. Remember that episode at the end, where Ayeka and Sasami\'s parents came to Earth, and there were a bunch of boring introductions and talking that never really lead to anything consequential? Yeah... That episode...Unbelievably, the events of TMRO3 march proudly forward in the footsteps of that boring final episode of series two. There are a lot of introductions. There is a lot of eating and tea drinking. We meet Tenchi\'s really dumb school friends, his long-lost sister, his dad\'s new (Earthling) fiancé, Tenchi\'s own Juraian fiancé, Grandpa\'s Juraian wife, Ayeka & Sasami\'s grandmother, Mihoshi\'s brother, Mihoshi\'s brother\'s fiancé. (I wish I was joking.)From episodes 2-5, while all of these characters are being introduced, nothing really happens. A lot of cooking. A lot of eating. A lot of small talk and dry chatter about relatives. No sealed demons being unleashed from ancient shrines, no crazy invaders from space to chase them, nothing reminiscent of the best parts of the original series. There are a couple of token space battles in TMRO3, but they\'re small in scale and only last a few minutes before changing direction to something less interesting.And what\'s worse, with nothing interesting going on and no real source of conflict to make them butt heads, the established cast become lifeless paper dolls forced into predictable, monotonous roles while the writers focus on the dry backstories of all the new characters. Ayeka and Ryoko only have a few mild, token arguments. Gone are the days of ""You go that way, I\'ll go this way."" ""..."" ""...That way was a dead end you idiot!"" Sasami does nothing but cook, play with Ryo-Ohki, and talk about loving Tenchi. Washu walks around and makes small talk with the Juraian folk. Mihoshi shows her tits a lot and is still stupid, but not in the funny way she used to be. It\'s literally like their souls have been sucked out and they don\'t care about living anymore. And actually, that\'s a lot like how I felt when I realized I\'d just watched two hours of people eating and drinking and chatting up their in-laws.Watching this series was a truly horrifying experience, and if I had known this series was this boring and ridiculous going in, I never would have bothered. The final episode is more mind-boggling and Evangelion-wannabe than exciting. (Giant white human monster hurr!) There\'s not a single episode I can really honestly point to and say ""This was okay"" or ""This made it worth it"". Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki 3 is a long, grinding parade of military grade boring, and it\'s only because the series invoked my admiration for the original that I feel bad about burying this sequel at the bottom of the ratings barrel. If you\'re looking for something to reignite your love of things Tenchi-related, this fan would recommend looking up some old manga scanalations or something instead of wasting your time on this snorefest. for Most Disappointing OVA Ever.Maybe my hopes were too high.

So, this review might be a bit biased.I am huge Ryoko fan. I did not enjoy the fact that the producers threw in a &quot;fiancee&quot; into the mix especially when it feels like a lot of the fans of the other girls where cheated on by this decision. Most of the first 5 episodes have to do with us getting to know Noike and an overzealous brother of Mihoshi (this is pretty much the only romance we truly get to see panned out in the OVA). There isn't much of a...point in this OVA to me. Except to shake things up and explain a little bit about the Great Goddesses.The only thing that saved this series for me was the very ending of the 5th episode and the entirety of the 6th. As as true fan of the original OVA, getting to see the Goddesses in full force was a great treat. Also, getting to know more about them was beyond belief. If I was to recommend this part of Tenchi to a new fan, I would only send them to the end of the episodes I enjoyed and explained to them what happens in the other episodes so they just get to see only the great in Tenchi.

If anything, it's actually pretty good.I know there have been gripes with the changes that have been made but guys come on. Change happens, and while not the way we want, the story is expanding. And there are great gems to be had in this OVA. (get it? Three gems?)Anywhoo:Story: Kajishima returns for a new addition to the Tenchi franchise. I, like many others, gripped at the changes back when I first saw it but coming back into them, they are good. It's a YMMV experience but I recommend it.The story has brought it's A...to B game with new characters and certain stories that fans of the first 2 OVAs have been itching to learn about.If there is to be one complaint, it's that it feels that there are not enough episodes for all the info we received. Maybe if it had been an 8 to 10 OVA fans wouldn't have been a bit left down. But isn't it great that a story had them hooked that had them wanting more.Art: Another thing that frazzled both me and other fans was the change in art direction. It was weird but recalling it, a new art style should not have been that jarring. Art changes all the time. The medium has changed from the traditional old cell style to the new.Again a YMMV but it grows on you if you let it.Sound: The soundtrack still retains that mysticism and comedic tone that it held in OVA 1 and 2. Nothing to detract or add here.Character: Whoo. I went back in and I gotta say that while things have become a bit more wacky and slapstick, the character arcs have progressed well from the preceding anime and the growth here is well established. Let's just say, the feels are going to be hit and it won't just be on the side of the heroes.Enjoyment: For new guys, Tenchi OVA 3 is a fun romp going in. There are things for the new fans to enjoy and a bit of trivia to help them with the backstories. For new fans, it will be good to see the old cast in a new situation and see them develop closer as a family. Just don't get too hung up on the nostalgia.Overall: I give OVA 3 of Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki an 9.3 out 10. It is a great continuation to the old OVA and once more fuels the need for more Tenchi.Please give it a try and be open minded.

For starters why the hell did they change the art style their whole attempt at modernizing the backdrops and certain elements just took the whole 90's charm out of tenchi...-_-.The story is rather disjointed and the introduction of new characters this late in the game was wholly necessary, as my fellow reviewers have already mentioned the only good part of this series was getting to see the 3 goddesses in action. *sight* As a tenchi fan you're going to...have to watch this so it's not like this review's going to deter you, Just don't keep your hopes up that's all.

Sankarea,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11499/Sankarea,"['So imagine this. Close your eyes and picture yourself walking to school, having a great day, realizing that you just aced a test, talked to a boy/girl you like, ate a good meal, and come home. You go to your room to relax but the first thing you see is a zombie girl lying half-naked on your bed. You try to to tell yourself if this is reality or fiction but just can\'t seem to do it.Honestly, that\'s the feeling I got when I first started watching this series. In other words, very surprising. Originally, I didn\'t have high expectation of this series. No, it...is not because the series is tagged as “ecchi” by MAL or the fact that the main character has a zombie fascination (more like a fetish to be honest). However, after watching about half the series that aired already, I have a  hope for this series as it surprised me quite a bit, for the better.The story tells the young boy named Chihiro Furuya, who has a strange hobby, or more a fascination on zombies. Now, there\'s something you don\'t see or hear everyday. However, despite being strange as it sounds, it is what our our main character loves. His obsession with zombies can be traced to the point of obsession and even a fetish. Sounds strange right? I\'m sure this would definitely be something strange even for any of us considered to be an otaku. The story continues on from there where he meets another girl, an idol, to be exact who later after unfortunate circumstances becomes what he ""loves"". As for our main heroine (or maybe anti-hero later? I mean, she\'s freaking dead already), she is an unique character. Despite being one of the most beautiful girl at school, she strives hard to gain “freedom” or to be free from her life. Most prominently, she tries to escape her circumstances at home because what goes beyond those doors are circumstances that some of us may puke or feel disgust about. It is definitely something I\'m sure most of us don\'t want to be placed in our own circumstances in real life. (unless you like living in big mansions and get free tuition)Then, we have other characters like Ranko Saōji (also known as Wanko). She is rather tomboyish judged by her attitude and appearance but there\'s some history between her and our zombie loving MC, a history that can be traced back to puppy love, zombie movies, and all that rest of good stuff. It would definitely be interesting to see what kind of rivalry or friendship she may later develop towards our school beauty, aka Rea.Anyways, my impressions of story so far is great. Even the very first episode got me hooked like a zombie. The movement of the story so far is somewhat slow but easy to follow and as the series continues, we see some of the unraveling details such as Rea\'s background. More importantly, the tone of the story becomes darker (mixed in with comedy the same time) as we see what is going on behind the scenes of Rea\'s life. We also see the history between Ranko and Chihiro as well as childhood memories are treasure that most us should keep placed in our hearts.As for the art, I\'m not too impressed. Well, let\'s just say that when I first saw that Studio Deen was the studio involved for this, my hopes were dead like a zombie. However, after watching these first few episodes, I\'m glad they proved me wrong. I like the style and art of the series so far even if it\'s a bit plain. After all, art isn\'t something that determines the overall enjoyment of a series. Don\'t believe me? Just ask Gurren Lagann. As for the sound and music, I think so far it does seem to fit. I mean, it\'s not something eerie like Shigofumi: Letters of the Departed but you\'ll notice it soon once you get into the series. There\'s also emotional music mixed in that reflects on some of the mood of the story. Then, there\'s the melody of comedic music thrown in during lighter atmospheres. Overall, I\'d say that the soundtrack isn\'t something worth an Emmy Award but also compelling to the show.Overall, I\'m enjoying this series as it is so far. It\'s not something I\'ll be obsessed about as much as the main character for zombies but definitely enjoying it at an anime fan level. The story (although somewhat easy to predict) has drama with an emotional background mixed in with comedy and possible romance. The characters are appealing and the soundtrack fits well.

I try not to look to deep and spoil something that I shouldn't. Regardless, this show is very entertaining.Spoiler Free, outside from the summary information.Quick and simple for those that want to know if this is a go or not.Story: 8This story was very enjoyable to me. It had just the right amount of comedy and ecchi without hurting the quality of the entire show. It pulls you in to see what on earth could happen next. With the whole plot around zombies, you cant usually go wrong, usually. The story will have...you wanting things to happen and wish things continue, since theres only one season.Art: 8The art was very good and on par with what I enjoy looking at. Everything fit and looked amazing the whole time I was watching it. I really enjoy eye candy.Sound: 6The soundtrack was fine. There isn't a negative thing I can really say about it.Characters: 8This is why the show is special, the characters. One crazy about zombies, one too rich to be free, best cat in the world and more await when you decide to start this anime. The chemistry between everyone is just great. The show really shines when you want to know more about the characters.Enjoyment: 9The show was, like I said before, very enjoyable. The characters, plot and art all mix together to make a decent anime worthy of anyones time.Overall/Conclusion: 8Overall, this was a pleasant journey. I begged for more in the end and that to me means that the anime did a great job. You'll love the situations they get into as well as the overall story. The art work just adds more praise to such a wonderful anime. If you like the idea of zombies and a bit of ecchi/romance then give it a try.

I did and was thoroughly surprised."", ""Falling into 6 genres, Sankarea lacked a specific direction and yet remained enjoyable.The first 3-4 episodes focused on mainly building the setting on which the rest of the show would be based on, and from there it took the direction of a typical romantic comedy SoL type anime. Being a fan of many SoL anime, I found the rest of the show to be enjoyable. Those who do not enjoy SoL shows may be disappointed after watching the well paced, plot based first 3 episodes when the majority of the show is a character based comedy.As for horror and ecchi, both were incorporated into Sankarea...in an unobtrusive manner. Whist the first 3 episodes had horror undertones, the rest featured horror in a more comedic manner. Nothing overdone or such. Ecchi was also incorporated smoothly and presented in a subtle manner. Nothing too distracting and in-your-face yet still enough to provide service to ecchi-fans.Individual score breakdownStory: 6After the first 3 or so episodes, the plot of Sankarea quickly breaks down into something similar to a SoL, with periodic arcs. Nothing really remarkable. Heck, the majority of the anime IS character/comedy based. It's still enjoyable, just don't expect some amazing plot.Art: 9The art is simply superb. Not only is the quality excellent, the character design is also well done and each character takes on their own unique art style and appearance. The background is nicely detailed, and the atmosphere and lighting done just right. Animation is smooth as well. After watching the absolutely stunning animation/art of Fate/Zero though, I really can't give Sankarea a 10/10.Sound: 9Voice acting is well done and brings out the personalities of all the characters. Background music could be a bit better, but it still integrates into the show quite well. The OP and ED are both excellent. Being an audiophile, I found everything to be recorded nice and squeaky clean.Character: 7Other than the story, the character was the second weakest part of the show. Both lead characters were well personified and likeable to some degree. Unfortunately, every character was a subcategory of a cliché, but kept me interested through the rather... unusual circumstances the lead goes through.Enjoyment: 9Much of the enjoyment stems from the comedy. Although it is no where as good as the better SoL/Romantic comedy/Comedy I've watched, Sankarea was mostly entertaining.Overall: 8I believe Sankarea deserves better than a mediocre 6 or 7. The whole quality of the show is very impressive, and even though the plot and character is slightly weak, I give Sankarea a very good 8/10. in an unobtrusive manner. Whist the first 3 episodes had horror undertones, the rest featured horror in a more comedic manner. Nothing overdone or such. Ecchi was also incorporated smoothly and presented in a subtle manner. Nothing too distracting and in-your-face yet still enough to provide service to ecchi-fans.Individual score breakdownStory: 6After the first 3 or so episodes, the plot of Sankarea quickly breaks down into something similar to a SoL, with periodic arcs. Nothing really remarkable. Heck, the majority of the anime IS character/comedy based. It's still enjoyable, just don't expect some amazing plot.Art: 9The art is simply superb. Not only is the quality excellent, the character design is also well done and each character takes on their own unique art style and appearance. The background is nicely detailed, and the atmosphere and lighting done just right. Animation is smooth as well. After watching the absolutely stunning animation/art of Fate/Zero though, I really can't give Sankarea a 10/10.Sound: 9Voice acting is well done and brings out the personalities of all the characters. Background music could be a bit better, but it still integrates into the show quite well. The OP and ED are both excellent. Being an audiophile, I found everything to be recorded nice and squeaky clean.Character: 7Other than the story, the character was the second weakest part of the show. Both lead characters were well personified and likeable to some degree. Unfortunately, every character was a subcategory of a cliché, but kept me interested through the rather... unusual circumstances the lead goes through.Enjoyment: 9Much of the enjoyment stems from the comedy. Although it is no where as good as the better SoL/Romantic comedy/Comedy I've watched, Sankarea was mostly entertaining.Overall: 8I believe Sankarea deserves better than a mediocre 6 or 7. The whole quality of the show is very impressive, and even though the plot and character is slightly weak, I give Sankarea a very good 8/10."", ""Tell me if you've heard of this before. A high school boy dreams to be with his ideal girl. Not too uncommon among romantic tales, but here's something that might run your blood cold, pun intended. He likes zombies. He really likes zombie girls, and one day, POOF! Due to plot, he gets to live with one. With a premise like this, what could possibly go wrong? Quite a bit actually, yet Sankarea stands out as quite the opposite, as something special. It, however, requires some context.Adapted from a manga of the same name by Mitsuru Hattori, Sankarea was directed by Shinichi Omata, with in-show...character designs by Kyuuta Sakai. Produced by Studio Deen, for something designated with genre labels such as “comedy” and “ecchi,” the series begins rather morbidly. Chihiro Furuya has spent the last several evenings putting his enthusiast facet to work searching for a way to revive his beloved deceased cat. During a couple of these dusks, he overhears the strained cries of a girl his age, desperate to lead a normal life with friends and outings. She's no other than Rea Sanka, the school idol of the local prestigious girl's academy and the sheltered heir to a rather wealthy and influential name. And, through one direct encounter, the zombie otaku and the school idol end up hanging out and working through the nights on what now became a joint project, neither being intimidated by the other. In the most natural of fashions, through this relationship the show breaks down the walls of the stereotypes that would have otherwise defined these two. Chihiro, outside his odd persona, and Rea, outside her perfect exterior, reveal themselves to us as characters of depth: sensible, quirky, considerate, kind. In fact, the show does very well, for the most part, in coaxing out the stuff of substance from many of the cast, even the most despicable ones.Make no mistake, comedy is a prominent fixture in this show, and a welcome one at that, characters playing off one another in funny and even clever ways that forgo heavy reliance on exaggerated visuals. In fact, such restraint promotes that underlying sentiment of unease that balances the frivolity and serves to make the show compelling in a meaningful way. It's this ever-present feeling of tragedy that makes the moments that are meant to be tragic doubly so and the instances that are sweet more bitter than before, tragedy that's driven by two factors:One is zombieism itself. Far from being just a fun, but ultimately needless accessory, the show utilizes key aspects of this condition to derive really compelling drama. The specter of mental health and physical well-being wasting away overtime looms in whatever air our two leads breathe, and while the living dead gain abilities such as super-human strength and insensitivity to pain, they also lose precious things that we, as people, take for granted. The capacity to bask in the sun, to feel warmth, to shed tears.Two is how zombieism is applied to Rea. To live under the confines of a suffocating patriarch who's, at best, neurotically obsessive and, at worst, possessively abusive to his daughter, where his affection for her is that of a blur between love and lust, and a jealous matriarch who doesn't give a damn, she's like a songbird in a cage, crooning for her freedom. And so the songbird becomes a zombie. A tragic paradox rings true: She feels more alive dead than she otherwise felt living, and here's where everything falls together. No matter how much she aches to be normal, she can't. She's cheated out of experiencing life to the fullest because her condition chains her down.While the show flirts around humorously with the premise of zombie love, it also holds no illusions to its implications: wish-fulfillment, if not precisely necrophilia. But taking care of a zombie girl is a lot more emotionally demanding than can be preconceived, Rea living with Chihiro as much a romantic nod as it is sanctuary and liberty from her folks, the chemistry of this relationship, from before the girl becomes a zombie, to after the girl becomes a zombie, feels undeniably genuine, and the question is brought up constantly, aloud and not. Is this a lust toward zombie girls, or a love toward a girl that now happens to be a zombie?Any review of this show would be remiss without at least a mention about the direction. While this is Omichi's first project as the head director, he's worked on a number of Shaft projects. He's a Shaft veteran, and, for anyone familiar with Shaft's style, that influence is apparent from the get-go: camera angles, theatrical metaphor, abstract imagery etc. But rather than being a mere copy and paste of Akiyuki Shinbo, whose application of said style can be heavy-handed and sometimes irrelevant to the narrative (to make the visuals superficially striking through its unorthodox-ness, in other words), Omichi co-opts the style as something his own, that carries meaning every time is utilized in place of the mundane (which I think is rather beautifully rendered, by the way) rather than something that is abused for novelty's sake. Something like a painting or curtains rising and falling to bring the audience in and out of flashbacks adds to sad and bad memories in not only a new way. It adds a whole new layer of melancholy by probing the emotional implications of these ruminations. Something like an arm fading away into nothing in place of a normal slap of the hand conveys far more than a one-fold rejection. In addition, the pacing goes at a slow, but natural pace that's embedded with a decent amount of subtly that allows the audience to really know about the characters rather than know of them. An example of said subtly can be found in the male protagonist's usually reserved deadpan of a snark sister, Mero, both in Episode 1 and Episode 9.Also, if it can be helped, I recommend watching Episode 9 before watching Episode 8, since Episode 9 takes place chronologically before Episode 8 anyway, and has unfortunately been perceived as a rude detour, what with it being placed in a middle of an ongoing crisis, so much so that its beauty and genius has been dismissed as mediocre filler.All of these wonderful things being said, the show suffers substantially on a few fronts. Ecchi. There are actually interesting uses for it in the show. Sparingly, it's great when it's used to convey atmospheres of the frankness of freedom and the desperation for affection. Sparingly, it's amusing in comedic moments, or at least tolerable. However, the show also goes somewhat heavy-handed on it for titillation's sake, something which mars characterization and, in general, is just in bad taste, what with how grim, but well-told the series otherwise is. And while the characterization is very good, for the most part, the show also plays up the gimmicky troppiness of some of the characters in a way that can get irritating at times.Now to end on a happy note, pun intended. Well, maybe not happy, per say, but the audio and visuals of the OP and especially the ED are impressive. The OP “Escoragoto” was done by nano.RIPE, and while I can't say I'm a fan of nano.RIPE's vocalist on her own, the melody, combined with the musical accompaniment, drum set, electric guitar, electric bass, makes for an energetic, uplifting piece that, even then, is tempered somewhat by some of its bitter visuals. Outside of introducing the cast, the OP does a great job saying a lot about each major character without saying anything, in particular, the segment involving Rea surrounded by her parents and household, this really fake, almost dead countenance of geniality pasted on her face when gripped on the shoulder by her father. Even the title “Escoragoto,” translated from Japanese, means “fabrication” or “pipe dream.”But if there's any one concise thing I could show to anyone that demonstrates the level of respect the show has for its material in a brief one minute, thirty minute music video, it would be the ED “Above Your Hand,” by Anabel. Soft, sincere, beautiful vocals accompanied by classical guitar, then electric bass, then the drama of the drums set and embellishing echoes, before revolving back to guitar, the visuals, which take place in the backdrop of the bowling alley Chihiro and Rea first met personally in, plays well with the classic dichotomy of dark and light which, when the female protagonist faces the light's source, is greeted by the male protagonist. She's much a figurative as well as literal person brought back to life.There's not a whole lot wrong with Sankarea. In fact, it does a lot of things right. It dares to something smarter, darker. More insightful, and heart-warming too. And, for the most part, it succeeds on every account.I give Sankarea an 8 out of 10. character designs by Kyuuta Sakai.

More insightful, and heart-warming too. And, for the most part, it succeeds on every account.I give Sankarea an 8 out of 10."", 'Sankarea is an adaptation of Hattori Mitsuru\'s light novel series. Mostly, the anime stayed true to the manga and as such many of my issues to do with the show stemmed from the poorly written script.*Please stop reading here if you have not seen the show and do not like spoilers*Story: 4The story is of a young sheltered girl trying to free herself from the clutches of her very strange family - namely an abnormally obsessed father and an indifferent mother. The main story itself was quite interesting but that is where the positive ends. In trying to establish a deeper story, Sankarea poorly...spends its time revealing the back-story of some of its characters.To begin, episode 7 which was dedicated to explain how Wanko developed feelings for the protagonist had issues. It begins by her crying as she runs alone in a cemetery. Viewers are left confused as to the reason she cries. Did she seriously just run into a cemetery to get scared? The point is, for a show that feeds the viewer information and does not employ undertones, this one scene is poorly explained.Moving on, the show never makes clear if Chihiro\'s family is aware of Rea\'s \'zombie\' circumstance. For most of the show, his Dad and sister seem confused as to why Rea chooses to only eat those hydrangea leaves, however in episode 9, it seems that Mero is fully aware that Rea is a zombie. On that note, did they seriously place that filler episode 9 in between the ""climax"" of the show? Talk about terrible sequencing.The end of the show signaled the possibility of a second season but I cannot stress how poorly done it was. It did not create the cliff-hanger effect intended, instead it just left the audience feeling dumbfounded. Why would the director even end the show there instead of a bit earlier when some resolution was achieved (after Rea\'s Dad left)?The scene where Chihiro fends off the dog to save Wanko was pathetic. The dog just stood there and barked without attacking for ages and was scared away by a little kid who looked like he could support the weight of the bat... unreal but effective in winning over Wanko\'s heart.Besides that there was episode 10 about Rea\'s mother. But that will discussed more in the character section.Art: 6The art did not break new grounds. The background and scenery was good but the characters sometimes looked strange from angled shots. The use of changing weathers to create an atmosphere was over-used to the point that it didn\'t create the desired effect when it really mattered (episode 11).There are also many inconsistencies in artwork that should not have been ignored. For instance, when Rea fell down and got up there were not wound marks left. Also when Chihiro was stabbed, where is the blood when Rea removes the blade from his body? Why is it that he only starts to bleed profusely once he has collapsed and finished his little ""talk""? There is no suitable excuse given how much blood was poured earlier in the show when Rea ""died"".Sound: 5The voice actors did a decent job. Although it was probably hard for them because the characters were lacking in personality. The ending song was mediocre. While liking some other works by Nano.Ripe, the opening song may have been good, but did not seem to fit the show very well. The music in the show itself was just okay as it did not really enhance the feel of the show in any way.Character: 1I don\'t know if I have ever seen such a pitiful cast before. The characters are about as uninspired as the title of the show. There is zero character development, mainly because every character is one-dimensional. It is almost as if the characters were given one stereotypical role, and that is all they do, quite horribly though. It is difficult to relate or like any character in the show, because they are ultimately just empty shells. They may think or talk about their feelings but this does not give them extra depth. Additionally, these characters talk about responsibility and things they need to do. Yet none of these things seem to be very high in their agenda. Here is an example: How does Chihiro plan to preserve Rea\'s body? He decides to stop trying to look into books and follows his grandfather\'s advice to observe. What can possibly achieved from this is only noting down the rate Rea rots away. But I guess his pervy and lazy desires are satisfied in the process and so he sticks with it.Strangely enough in episode 10, Rea\'s mother while wallowing in self pity and filled with tears she continues to watch on as her husband takes naked photos of his daughter. The servant who also knows of this does nothing to intervene. It seems that Aria does not feel enough anger nor does she have enough morality to stop the act. Also, the servant who knows of it does nothing as well... very strange that they aren\'t calling the child abuse hotline or something. Yes, the characters in Sankarea are unbelievable. Another example is when Chihiro gets stabbed, it doesn\'t seem to matter to all the maids watching. Their loyalty is truly commendable. Also, after getting up why didn\'t Chihiro just report Danichirou for assault, did he forgive that bastard after seeing how ""cute"" Rea was in a nurse outfit?As per normal, the main character in a shounen is always dense but Chihiro was surprisingly sharp in episode 6 when he told Wanko ""She\'s  (Rea) not my girlfriend or anything"" as a way to thank Wanko for donating some clothes. It\'s almost as if he knew Wanko\'s feelings in episode 6 but not in the rest of the show... Interesting.Enjoyment: 2Sankarea had potential but was poorly executed. It did not satisfy the genres listed. No horror, lack luster comedy, and little romance... If anything, this anime did not even present romance in the roundabout fashion that many shounen do.The lack of real emotions and unlikable characters really made this show a difficult watch. spends its time revealing the back-story of some of its characters.To begin, episode 7 which was dedicated to explain how Wanko developed feelings for the protagonist had issues.

Nevertheless, I expected something good till the last minute.I can't agree that the story was fascinating; zombie mania of main hero was sorta ridiculous plus the main heroine did not leave any impression at all. Oh, father's fetish was shocking too.Overall, I did not like it.Do not think this anime is worth it, unless you are bored as hell and this is the last anime left.IMHO "", '~ this review contain spoiler ~The first few episodes of this show really lead into what should have been a really decent story. The premise was there, the characters were there, but the follow through was very much less than ideal.It’s a bit of trouble to explain without throwing in a couple of spoilers, so if you plan on watching this series and don’t want spoilers, stop here. You’ll see for yourself what I’m talking about when I say the execution was terrible. For those that don’t care much about...spoilers, this will probably divert you away from this show.The show starts off quite well, setting the plot up and introducing the characters. Given the plot summary, it’s pretty obvious that this girl dies. I won’t say how, but she does. Furuya never expected his little potion to actually work, but it does. Not only on his cat, but Rea as well. She had taken it in hopes that it would have the reverse effect on the living. Her father was too possessive and allowed her virtually no freedom whatsoever, so she had a death wish.What happens from this episode forward is utterly ridiculous. You would think a zombie otaku like Furuya would be over joyed that he got his wish to date a zombie girl. The problem is, she is still very much herself and appears normal other than being a bit pale and having ungodly strength. Another issue is that rather than seeing romance come about, it actually focuses more on how Furuya can keep her body from decaying.On top of this, they throw in an entire episode and a half revolving around Furuya’s childhood friend who is obviously jealous of Rea. The whole plot point here was unnecessary and could have been left out. I was rather bored throughout the entire sub plot.All in all, I can only thank the heavens this show was only 12 episodes. Any more than that would have been unbearable. Although the show has its merits, it unfortunately doesn’t have it where it counts spoilers, this will probably divert you away from this show.The show starts off quite well, setting the plot up and introducing the characters.

Zombies are not sexualized the same way that vampires, ghosts, or even werewolves are. Zombies in fiction are generally considered gross, and having a romantic obsession considered weird. This show knows this and has fun with it whenever possible. But that is not the only way that it is hilarious. The dialogue, the characters, they all work together for great comedy. It's funny, engaging, weird, and surprisingly heartfelt. I would recommend it. "", 'It pains me a lot to give this series a 7. In fact, I really want to give it a 9 or 10 for this review.  However, a few things stop it from being higher, actually only two things really. The first thing is simple. It never keeps the amazement factor rolling, the first three episodes were fantastic, but it slow goes to great, then good, then just plain OK. The second, and in my opinion much more important thing is that it stop just when things get interesting. It force me to read the manga from which this is adapted from and actually...made me a lot more disappointed in the anime. The Manga is fantastic, easily one of the best I have ever read, in fact currently it is my second favorite of all time. If the anime had gotten enough support, or if it had gotten enough care to completely adapt the manga through and through then this could easily be a different review where I say ,""This is the best anime ever no exaggeration."" Alas, it is not, so it pains me immensely to have to give it a score of only good.Story:6It is definitely interesting. It is a blend of romantic comedy, horror, ecchi, zombie (yes, zombies are in my mind it own separate genre, sort of like how it is for gaming), and even a little bit of action. It starts off intriguing, but after episode four things start to become chaotic. It feels like a chronological mess (which to people who has read the manga, it is) and things seems to be out of place, or it feels like an event was suppose to happen but didn\'t. The ending was also felt incomplete and felt like a setup for something else. However, I will say that in the story department this anime is amazing at creating side stories and giving us background details on some of the characters.Art:7Yes, Sankarea only gets a 7 for art. Yes I know most people would give a much higher score with it beautiful environment, but to be quite honest I seen better, from the same year and from anime such as Sword Art Online and a bunch more. The character design are also pretty average outside a few exception like Rea and Chihiro and a few other.Sound:10Yeah, you saw the score correctly. No typos and accidents, the music is fantastic through and through. I don\'t know the name of the composer, but once I do I will listen to every song compose by him/her. Other then the two reasons mention in to introduction, the music is another huge reason why it pains me greatly give the anime a OK score. Each track match the tone of the event and two songs, Honto no Kimochi and Sukeru Hitomi, stands as some of my favorite songs from not only anime, but of all mediums gaming including (which is quite an amazing feat, cause I like myself some game music).Character:7Now we get to the one that was the most greatly affected by the short runtime. Don\'t get me wrong, the show stills have great character - Rea being one of my favorite character even if we only consider the anime. However, the anime is missing much need explanation and character development for the other characters which the manga provides. It provides enough for me to get interested, but stops short of me caring about any of the characters besides the above mentioned Rea.Enjoyment:10As with any review, anime or otherwise, the enjoyment is not part of the final verdict.The reason is because I may love a series, but not be able to give a good score for it because of it\'s up irrefutable flaws. This is one of those cases. I love Sankarea it have a lot of morals and ideals that are similar to mine, and Rea is one of my favorite characters and IS my favorite female protagonist. Also as stated the music is amazing which greatly factors and can even change my personal enjoyment on anything, anime or not. Also as stated above I read the Manga which allows me to make sense of the cryptic story and allows be to care for each characters even minor ones. It is extremely disappointing that this anime didn\'t adapt everything otherwise my overall score could be identical to my enjoyment one.Final Verdict:7At this point I probably sound like a broken tape recorder so I really don\'t want to repeat what I have said a million time. But I really need to stress that this anime could have been a ""This is the best thing since sliced bread!"" anime instead of a meh one if it had done a full adaptation of the manga. So here\'s me hoping for season two, really crossing my finger on it. made me a lot more disappointed in the anime. The Manga is fantastic, easily one of the best I have ever read, in fact currently it is my second favorite of all time. If the anime had gotten enough support, or if it had gotten enough care to completely adapt the manga through and through then this could easily be a different review where I say ,""This is the best anime ever no exaggeration."" Alas, it is not, so it pains me immensely to have to give it a score of only good.Story:6It is definitely interesting.

The story follows Chihiro Fuwuya a zombie fanatic who spends the majority of his time watching zombie and horror movies. One day his cat Babu is ran over by a car. A saddened Chihiro attempts to resurrect his cat with the help of a troubled girl called Rea Sanka.When I finished high school of the dead I found myself craving for more zombie-oriented anime. After searching around on the internet I saw some recommendations and the first notable one I saw was Sankarea. My expectations as from the previous anime were gore, violence and over-the-top...balls to wall action. That which I did not receive… I did however happen to get a very pleasant surprise in the form of a undead romantic comedy.Characters:Chihiro is the main protagonist for the show and he is without a doubt my favourite character in the series. He struggles to come to terms with the death of his cat and he digs him up from the grave in order to resurrect him. Now I know the concept of this seems creepy and arguably it is creepy… Ok its just plain creepy. He does have good intentions, unfortunately his fixation with the living dead prompts him to make said creepy scenario occur. His relationship with Rea is very sweet, he strives to give Rea the life of a normal girl which she couldn't achieve under the iron fist of her dad. His resolve is tested throughout the series with the effects of the resurrection potion having problematic effects.Rea Sanka has been brought up in a very wealthy home, but it is also a home of captivity. Rea is restrained by her farther as he does not allow Rea to go out with friends, permits any animals from entering the premises and fires any maid that attends to Rea in a way that obstructs his own ideals. Rea eventually reaches breaking point and sneaks out at night in order to get some freedom and vent her frustration and sadness. When she meets Chihiro he symbolises some freedom that she has craved for years and the sheltered girl takes an unusual interest into his hobbies.Art:The art was relatively good, the background was well designed and the characters designs were well varied with Chihiro's character.Sound:The soundtrack fitted in well with each of the scenes, however on its own most of the soundtrack doesn't sound all to well. I will give honourable mentions to the wacky opening and the beautiful ending for the showEnjoyment:I did enjoy this show as a fellow zombie otaku can empathize with Chihiro on his love for the genre, maybe not so much on his resurrecting habits though. I also like how the genre of zombies was made into a sweet romantic comedy, something which i thought would play out in horrible fashion.Overall:Sankarea is a delightful romantic comedy with slight horror elements for those good ol' zombie fans. I would not recommend this to those squeamish with slight blood and gore and i would not recommend this to those looking for something similar to highschool of the dead. I do recommend this to those looking for a different romantic comedy in comparison to the norm.Overall I give Sankarea a 7.7/10Thanks for reading guys, Have a nice day! balls to wall action.

Decently drawn show with rather interesting start which unfortunately loses steam as it moves forward. The concept had much potential: possessive love of deranged perfectionist father towards daughter, alcoholic mother apparently tired of living in solitary splendor, the whole make your dead gf thing etc.. but the execution of show seems very tacky, especially in the end. Its a shame that such a short show is filled with fillers which does not reveal any useful information about plot development nor they show any new interesting character...aspect. Anime is doing quite a good job at breaking zombie cliché. Once again the great story potential was wasted on fanservice. For me, just a big disappointment. Let me say that Kore Wa ""Zombie desu ka?"" was for more enjoying for me although there is definitely less effort put in the concept. Sometimes having fun with its absurd initial set is better then wasting one. aspect. Anime is doing quite a good job at breaking zombie cliché.

Let me say that Kore Wa ""Zombie desu ka?"" was for more enjoying for me although there is definitely less effort put in the concept. Sometimes having fun with its absurd initial set is better then wasting one.', ""Once you've seen a lot of anime that focuses on romance and comedy it tends to get harder to recall them individually; this is especially true for the countless number of shows which choose to sacrifice story presentation and deep characters in exchange for unspeakable amounts of fanservice. It's not necessarily a criticism of the entire genre though. I mean, there's only so much you can do with a standard plot usually involving two characters who fall in love, only to be denied by one reason or another.The successful romantic comedies (and I mean in terms of quality and not just commercially because crap anime...may also sell a lot) often overcome this by portraying endearing characters and relationships with enough realism to make you actually care what happens, in a way that's enjoyable to watch too. On the other hand, there are those which introduce elements such as aliens, deities, fantasy, gender benders or sports in order to mix things up a little. If handled in the right manner this results in a series that stands out from the majority of the pack, and one that you'll remember when thinking about romantic comedy anime in future. Sankarea is a prime example of this.Zombies. The mere mention of this term in the synopsis means that rather than trying to be realistic, Sankarea belongs in the latter group of romantic comedies and introduces, yes, zombies into the story to give it an extra dimension. So how is it incorporated? To begin, our main character Furuya Chihiro is a high school student who has a rather unhealthy obsession with the undead that in most cases would cause everyone to avoid him, let alone girls. But as luck would have it, he encounters the beautiful Sanka Rea who has her own fair share of problems, and inevitably the two hang out together; their new relationship is heart-warming and there's a sort of nice and understanding connection between them.Unfortunately, due to a sequence of events Rea dies and becomes a zombie, which brings with it a wealth of unique problems for the both of them. Although several issues are raised throughout the series, such as the exact nature of how Rea is revived and how long her body will last before it rots away, they are never really fully explored. Instead, the short twelve episode run includes: Rea adapting to her new situation with much help from Chihiro, family issues (in particularly Rea's father), the obligatory love triangle and a cat called Baabu. Praise should go to the series because there's excellent drama that provides an extra layer of development to its characters, but the final episode does end in quite an abrupt manner.Moreover, the pacing is far from perfect as the anime starts off pretty well but slows down noticeably after the opening episodes. There's a couple of filler episodes that serve to flesh out the supporting cast, but they are positioned at strange points in the story which causes the pacing to stutter even more.The overall animation in Sankarea is a variable aspect that may not be to everyone's tastes. Character designs and the attire they wear are usually on the simple side, whereas the background art can be stunning at times but less detailed and sharp at others. Fortunately, the art remains at least consistently decent throughout the length of the series, and character motions are always smooth and fluid.The background music is surprisingly good in Sankarea. Although sparingly used, there are a wide range of beautiful instrumental themes for the mysterious, sad and unsettling scenes in the anime, and also light-hearted tunes for the peaceful and comedy moments. The voice acting is adequate and none of the characters sound bad. The theme songs are pleasant to listen to, with a unique-sounding and energetic track by nano.RIPE (who also did an equally-catchy OP for Hanasaku Iroha) for the opening, and a calm/soothing song by Annabel for the ending.In terms of decent characters, Sankarea is well-covered. As mentioned before the cat-like Furuya Chihiro's standout aspect is his zombie fetish, and he has some entertaining expressions and dialogue. However, he's willing to fully embrace his fetish despite what others think, he can act serious when the need arises, and he is also quick to make important decisions; these are strengths for a main character in this type of anime, and it works to make Chihiro a better than average lead.Sanka Rea is a student from a wealthy family who's popular at school and looks cheerful on the surface, but unknown to most people she's lived a sheltered life and wants to act more like a normal girl. She's a cute and fun character, yet much of the drama also springs from her side of the story to make you feel sympathy for her, especially as she tries to adjust to her new life.Then there's Chihiro's cousin, Saouji Ranko, who is a likeable girl but sadly her role is limited to mostly comedy situations and fanservice while competing with Rea for Chihiro's affection. As opposed to Rea, Ranko is talkative, likes to beat up Chihiro, and is actually alive; this provides a good contrast in character between the two.The rest of the supporting cast includes quirky members of Chihiro's family (the relatively normal father, the senile but entertaining grandpa, the amusing and quiet younger sister Mero), as well as members of Rea's rich household who are interesting for vastly different reasons. He's a bit of a conundrum, but chances are you'll be surprised at how much of a freak Rea's father is during the full length of the series and beyond; it's easy to see why she wants to escape her family, but her freedom does come at great cost. Finally, to round things off there are a few school classmates who are used for comic relief and not much else.It's not every day that you come across a touching romantic comedy which also includes darker themes like isolation and suicide, graphically bloody scenes, more than just a hint of craziness, and a supernatural spin. And yet, Sankarea pops up as an enjoyable anime series that has done a fantastic job at establishing its setting and a likeable group of core characters with relevant backstory. It's also screaming for a second season with an improved focus on storytelling and new events that should undoubtedly build on its existing potential. may also sell a lot) often overcome this by portraying endearing characters and relationships with enough realism to make you actually care what happens, in a way that's enjoyable to watch too.

I\'m having a hard time classifying it because it didn\'t really do anything very well and didn\'t fit into any category well. I want to say that makes it unique but it just felt kind of drab to me.Story: 6/10This had the makings of a descent albeit cliche story. The only thing that makes it unique is that she is a zombie but that isn\'t handled all that well (and gets no resolution in either OVA set). This anime was betting all it had on a second season. I find this interesting because it really wasn\'t that good... I...have seen FAR better anime that didn\'t get a second season. Even if there are some interesting and creepy elements, every single one of them will be dropped and you\'ll likely end up feeling like you wasted your time.Art: 8/10This is basically the only saving grace of the anime. I liked the character designs and the use of colors. The shades of each character worked well and I did feel like they captured what a ""sexy zombie"" could look like.Sound: 6/10It got the job done. There were a few meaningful moments that were enhanced by the sound, the rest was meh.Character: 5/10I only truly liked one character and it was the little sister. She barely said anything but also had one of the only really good character moments when relating Rea to her deceased mother. I thought that scene was pretty special and is the only positive thing I really took out of the entire anime.Enjoyment: 5/10It was middle of the road for me. I watched it fairly quickly hoping it at least got a good resolution (it did not) and looking back on it I was moreso holding my nose and guzzling that truly being captivated.Overall: 5/10If you don\'t mind zombie movies and think the concept of the anime seems neat, you will be disappointed. If you want something with a good ending, you\'ll be disappointed. If you thought it would take an interesting twist and you would learn a unique perspective about zombies and the philosophy or logistics behind them, you\'ll be disappointed. Really, the only way you won\'t be disappointed is if you go in with low expectations and somehow enjoy the sad plot that drives Rea to become a zombie (the whole father angle completely missed with me).

There isn't any fooling around with the extreme anime cliches, such as the 'horror' of openly talking to...a girl or touching them, and there are many nice hints to a peaceful family life.Now, down to the good stuff.Sankarea introduces the three main characters off the bat, Saouji Ranko, Furuya Chihiro, and of course, Sanka Rea. It's obvious enough that these two will fight for Chihrio's love (with Rea being the 'true' route). I feel that the characters are developed at a well timed, gradual rate, beginning with 'Wanko' ( XD) and Chihiro's playfull nature, and Chihiro witnessing Rea's stress release at the abandoned hotel. As we learn more about these two girls and their relationship to Chihiro, his own traits are revealed. So without going into specific details, if you are sick of characters acting extremely tsundere, shy, or down-right annoying, this anime is a refreshing break that will leave you feeling concerned and engaged with its characters, instead of knitpicking at the tiny annoying things that many anime characters can get up to (I know I do when a character gets on my nerves). Overall; Character: 8.5/10.In accordance with the seeming Laws of the Anime Universe, this series sports a love triangle, with questionable outcomes for the characters, and comedic side characters that occasionally steal the spotlight for a good laugh (which are actually very funny, take note of the grandpa and Chihiro's best friend, Yasuda). However, one thing makes this anime stand out in the crowd, its plot device. I have never, never, heard of a zombie in an anime before. I feel this one one of the main reasons I started, and finished this show. I also love that they don't get absolutely side tracked on trivial matters, and instead choose to deal with practical issues (such as Rea's body rotting, instead of random beach and pool trips and losing bikinis etc). Overall, I found the plot to be quite original and witty, in the sense that addressed issues relevant to many watchers lives (such as horrible parents, lazy high school students, and chores/jobs/work). Overall; Plot: 9/10. (Another point to make is the minimal fan-service. No one looks tits shoved in their face allll the time).I believe that many anime's are based off their appearance, (and a quick synopsis read) which can immensely benefit a well drawn series compared to a crappy quick handed sketch. In my opinion, Sankarea sits a notch about the average. Its art isn't anything to rave about, however there are some beautiful scenes when the characters either go for a walk up a hill and look over the town at sunset (a scene which I rarely dislike), or a bird's eye view shot of the town at night ( I also love a good city-scape). However, the characters are quite attractive, and are definitely not an eye-sore. So if you aren't a super art fanatic and need everything is 10 million HD then there will be no problem. Overall; Art: 7/10The biggest problem I had with this series was its OST. The soundtrack annoyed me. The OP song seemed to be just a throw away that they tacked on at the end of production. It appeared to me that minimal thought had gone into its selection. The soundtrack for a change of scene was also nothing special (Even though this is an area that most animes don't attempt to explore). If the OST for this series had more effort applied to it, I feel the show would improve dramatically. Overall; Sound: 5.5/10.On the whole this series is DEFINITELY worth watching. I could even say it's one of those shows I wish I hadn't seen, so I could re-watch it and experience it again. If you haven't already, add it to your list, and start watching :3.Overall; Sankarea: 9/10.Thank you for reading my first ever review on MAL.

(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)"", '“If I became a zombie, will you take responsibility, right?” - Rea Sanka🥈 8/10How do you imagine zombies? They would surely look scary, having a rotten body, and full of scars. Well, that is what it might be until you watch Sankarea.🎬 Story - 7/10The story starts when a boy named Chihiro Furuya lost his cat Baabu by an accident, trying to revive him with despair, then he met Rea. As written in the synopsis, Rea became a zombie at some point in the story.The storytelling is slow yet enjoyable, being character-focused, not boring at all. However, the story still lacks many things, nothing surprising...has happened yet due to the anime length, as the anime only adapted 2 out of 11 volumes of the manga with some additions and alternations, but it is overall a very nice start.By looking superficially, Sankarea might seem to be a relaxing and happy anime due to the anime length and Rea being a cheerful type of character, but deep down, Sankarea is rather a sad one. So far, I have found no plot holes, as everything could be explained logically. Lastly, as suggested by the ecchi tag, this show contains only a little of ecchi, which I consider being great since I personally do not prefer ecchi and the overuse of the ecchi element can ruin the anime.🎨 Animation - 8/10Sankarea has a normal art style, not being so unique, but comes with a quality higher than standard. The most noticeable qualities are sceneries, lightings, and shadows, which are done finely. Art on the characters could also be improved further by adding more details.🔈 Sound - 8/10Sankarea consists of a nice opening and ending theme song, both giving off a unique vibe. I personally prefer the ending theme song. As for soundtracks, I consider them as well-made. Sankarea’s soundtracks are not outstanding, but they fit and create the mood and tone of the anime. As mentioned in the story section, deep down Sankarea is rather a sad story, and some of the soundtracks point out that hidden sadness.🕶 Characters - 8/10Starting with Chihiro Furuya, a zombie maniac. Different from many other shows’ male protagonist, he is not weak and whiny type, he is not plain and overly-nice either, he rather differs from standard and having some unique traits, which are what make him a fine male protagonist.Next, Rea Sanka, who later becomes a zombie. Rea’s story is told pretty detailed, revealing her sad past, which describes the reasons for all of her actions throughout the show. While Rea might look like a normal female protagonist, I somehow found her special. I wonder how could someone be able to create such a cute and charming character like her.Rea has parents which considered to be her troubles, with the story revealing backgrounds of both of her parents, it makes sense even how irritating her parents’ actions are and how her relationship with her parents has come to this point.Lastly, supporting characters like Mero and Ranko are not being left out. With the additional story on both of them, the show seems to be more complete, especially the story on how Chihiro and Ranko became friends since their childhood.🎉 Enjoyment - 8/10Sankarea is quite an easy-to-watch and enjoyable show. It is actually one of a few shows I could watch several episodes continuously without a break, cliffhangers might be one of the reasons, which exist at the end of many episodes. To be honest, what I loved about this show most is the female protagonist, Rea. Other than her cuteness and her charm, what I find interesting is how she still be able to enjoy her time despite of her cruel fate. I consider this to be a success of the show since the show is named after her after all.📌 RecommendationsSankarea is not an outstanding show but rather a unique one. If you are looking for a unique non-action anime, unique supernatural anime, or an anime with a nice female protagonist, then I recommend this anime. Despite being suggested a romance genre, I recommend not to get your expectations up for that, it is still too early since this is the first adaption of Sankarea.After the show completion, I encourage you to read the manga which has already finished publishing. Even though the anime has already adapted 2 out of 11 volumes, I recommend starting over from the beginning since there are some slight differences, I am sure you will have a great experience.

Enjoy!', ""[Spoiler Free]Pervert pumpered character who likes dead girls and keeps filming his girlfriend with his camera. It's just too annoying to watch.Plus there's that cliche of a childhood friend (girl) who takes care of him and secretly loves him. I honestly can't  remember how many times I've seen it. It's like watching the same anime over and over with different title each time.If what you actually have no problem what I've said about this anime then you might actually like it. This is just a personal opinion. "", ""I had heard of Sankarea before and reading the premise I didn't except it to be any good; I expected it to be some ecchi romantic comedy with alot of black comedy and pointlessly dark moments, much like the lukewarm Elfen Lied. However, it caught my interest after seeing it labeled as one of the best anime of 2012 and started watching it some time after. And I was completely blown away.Contrary to what others have said, this anime is NOT a romantic comedy in the least. Sure, it has some decent comedy but not a lot. What it gave me was an engaging drama...with two great leads and a lot of emotion.Let’s start off with the bad stuff though: Sankarea really doesn't have that many flaws honestly. Maybe the biggest flaw it has in my opinion is the character of Chihiro's pervert red headed friend whose name I can't recall. He was a VERY annoying character, being inconsiderate of other people, totally flat and as a comedic relief he failed miserably. In one scene, he actually makes Rea's situation WORSE giving me more reason to dislike him.Another flaw that I can't really call a flaw so much as my own opinion is Rea's father. Oh my gosh, Rea's father is one of the most obnoxious, hateful, loathsome, horrifying, selfish villains I have ever seen in any medium. Unlike other truly evil villains like Griffith from Berserk or Johann from Monster, he has absolutely no redeeming values. The only time he did do something that wasn't self centered was ruined by the fact that he still engaged in horrifying and selfish desires after it. He's by no means a badly written character because he was very well written, it's just that he really, really isn't fun to watch. But maybe that’s a good thing though.Now for the good stuff: animation (which was excellent and atmospheric) and sound aside (which was good), the characters of both Chihiro and Rea were just great. Chihiro isn't a typical romantic protagonist; he's not bland or boring, in fact he's rather quirky, can be funny and under his jerkass exterior is actually a rather swell guy. I immediately liked him and the story showed that he was a great guy by showing him being kind to Rea.Speaking of Rea, she ahs to be one of the greatest female anime characters I've ever seen. Not every female anime character has to be a badass like Rukia from Bleach nor do they have to be well adjusted people. In fact, Rea's back-story really hit me. When I found out what happened to her, I wasn't angry. I was FURIOUS. Ballistic. It was the kind of righteous fury where you want to do anything and everything to solve someone else's problem and that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to save Rea from her abusive home, I wanted to hug her and comfort her. Her personality was also really great. Beneath her suffering and the fact that she is a zombie, Rea is still a very normal girl, one who wants to do normal girly things. I like how instead of making her into a typical introverted girl who keeps to herself ala Rei Ayanami, they went into a different direction. Because of that, Rea feels like a real person and not a typical cookie cutter anime girl.Then there are Rea and Chihiro's interactions: there’s some obvious sexual tension and the anime does point that the two will end up with each other and I'm really rooting for them to do so. Chihiro is a really kind person at heart and his declaration of protecting Rea and standing up to her is really sweet. As for the other characters like Mero, Ranko, Grandpa etc... They’re all OK and memorable and interesting and with the exception of redhead pervert and Dan'Ichiro Sanka, they're all pretty likeable.Overall, I give this anime a solid 9 out of ten for excellence. I wish a second season came out soon because frankly, I want more and the 'ending' does sort of point out that the story will continue. It's not a 10/10 as it's not something like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Monster but it doesn't have to be. Is it recommended? Highly so, but don't except this anime to be some ecchi rubbish because it is not. While it does have some fanservice, it also has a lot of fan disservice and the tragic moments should not be taken as opportunity for engaging in lustful thoughts. with two great leads and a lot of emotion.Let’s start off with the bad stuff though: Sankarea really doesn't have that many flaws honestly.

Sankarea consists of a very unique plot as well as great characters,All of the family members of Chihiro are quite well created and have comedic themes which increase my enjoyment.  As for the story line not really so much progressed,  since I read the manga I just knew that Sankarea uses a fair amount of fillers which I didn't really mind.Sankarea has many romantic aspects,  like how Chihiro resurrects Rea and they both grow closer and closer.

Since I will come back later to write a longer review.The most unique thing is the story- a relationship/romance between a zombie and human.Movies that adopted this plot existed before but I don't believe any anime has done this.Equally splendid plot is that the girl Sanka actually chose to become a zombie to liberate herself from the patriarchal control of her hypocritical father. The idea that being undead as a liberation from the reality is definitely not new as...you can find examples in many zombie movies.But this vision is still fairly non-mainstream and radical in a sense. you can find examples in many zombie movies.But this vision is still fairly non-mainstream and radical in a sense."", ""Pros+Good Art Style+Well Told Story+Well Developed characters+FunnyCons-Wasn't terribly exciting-Could get boring at times...My opinionApologies for the short pro's and con's list but i watch this show a long time ago and i was pretty impressed.

So, I won't give scores for each category, but instead, I'm just gonna talk about my experience with the anime. I find that giving scores does not help people understand as to why I gave it that score as it's a personal thing. Not only that, but I feel like if I focus more on talking about my experience, then you guys will know if the anime is for you or not. So, let me what you guys think: do you like my reviews more in this format or...did you prefer the old format? Also, I apologize if I haven't posted a review in a while, college can get busy at times. So, now without further ado, let's get into it.The story Sankarea follows Chihiro Furuya, who is obsessed with zombies; so obsessed with zombies he even wants one as his girlfriend!  This hobby becomes somewhat of an obsession as he tries to revive his pet cat Babu. He meets Rea, a girl who is popular and seems to have it all, is not as happy with her life as it would seem. Her wish is to be reborn another person and she might just get her wish after crossing paths with Furuya. Chihiro then has to deal with taking care of her as a zombie.The story also explores what life is like for Rea who has been resurrected as a zombie such as what she eats, what is it like for her to go outside...The story also goes in-depth as to how all of this changes her.Going into Sankarea, I found the first episode intriguing. However, I didn't think the first two episodes really got into the core of the story. I honestly found the story to be all over the place throughout the anime. The story hooked me because it was silly, a bit scary at times, fun, and romantic. I also think it managed to juggle all of those elements well. All of those combined together made it fun to watch. There were times where the actual story, and there were times when I felt like there were filler episodes that didn’t add anything to the main story. The anime does not seem to have a clear ending, but the ending is still enjoyable overall but if you're one of those people where you want the anime to have a clear ending and you don't want to interpret the ending for yourself, then the ending may really frustrate you. Despite these issues, I found the story quite enjoyable due to the characters.What made Sankarea enjoyable is its cast of characters. When I went into the first episode, you didn't really see many characters so I thought the anime was only going to feature Chihiro, Rea (the girl), and Babu (the cat), but as you get further into the series you start to see more, and more characters appear. The other characters you see; however, (except for the villain) are side characters. At first, you see Rea's father, who is really creepy, and is obsessed with his daughter. At first, I really hated him! I thought he really was a creep! And you might get that feeling too when you watch the anime. But, that being said, when you see the last few episodes, you kind of feel sorry for him. I'm not gonna say why as I don't want to spoil too much. You had a character named Ranko that was funny and who would come and beat up Chihiro in a friendly way at times because they're pretty much childhood friends and cousins. Then, you had Chihiro's sister, Mero, who is the quiet type. Pretty much all the side characters (except one side character which I'm not gonna spoil who or why) contribute funny moments to the anime You also get some cute moments between Chihiro and Rea.The animation is very nicely done. However, an issue I had is there was an episode that had a editing issue or so, it looked like in my opinion. Episode 11, I think, where they show Rea father in the plane. I thought the editing was rushed, and the dialogue seemed to have cut off badly by it. Also in episode 3, they censored a woman’s guts, and I've always believed if you're gonna do gore, then go all out! It frustrated me to see a censor. That being said, I understand why they did it as they're trying to appeal to all viewers.I thought the voice acting and music was good.Sankarea isn't for everyone. If you're into zombies, romance, and comedy, then you'll love Sankarea. If you're looking for a spectacular anime that blows you away, Sankarea is not it. I recommend Sankarea if you're just looking for an anime to relax to and enjoy.Anyways, I want to know what you guys think. If you've watched Sankarea, did you guys enjoy it? If not, would this be a anime you'd watch? Let me know your thoughts! did you prefer the old format? Also, I apologize if I haven't posted a review in a while, college can get busy at times. So, now without further ado, let's get into it.The story Sankarea follows Chihiro Furuya, who is obsessed with zombies; so obsessed with zombies he even wants one as his girlfriend!  This hobby becomes somewhat of an obsession as he tries to revive his pet cat Babu. He meets Rea, a girl who is popular and seems to have it all, is not as happy with her life as it would seem. Her wish is to be reborn another person and she might just get her wish after crossing paths with Furuya. Chihiro then has to deal with taking care of her as a zombie.The story also explores what life is like for Rea who has been resurrected as a zombie such as what she eats, what is it like for her to go outside...The story also goes in-depth as to how all of this changes her.Going into Sankarea, I found the first episode intriguing. However, I didn't think the first two episodes really got into the core of the story. I honestly found the story to be all over the place throughout the anime. The story hooked me because it was silly, a bit scary at times, fun, and romantic. I also think it managed to juggle all of those elements well. All of those combined together made it fun to watch. There were times where the actual story, and there were times when I felt like there were filler episodes that didn’t add anything to the main story. The anime does not seem to have a clear ending, but the ending is still enjoyable overall but if you're one of those people where you want the anime to have a clear ending and you don't want to interpret the ending for yourself, then the ending may really frustrate you. Despite these issues, I found the story quite enjoyable due to the characters.What made Sankarea enjoyable is its cast of characters. When I went into the first episode, you didn't really see many characters so I thought the anime was only going to feature Chihiro, Rea (the girl), and Babu (the cat), but as you get further into the series you start to see more, and more characters appear. The other characters you see; however, (except for the villain) are side characters. At first, you see Rea's father, who is really creepy, and is obsessed with his daughter. At first, I really hated him! I thought he really was a creep! And you might get that feeling too when you watch the anime. But, that being said, when you see the last few episodes, you kind of feel sorry for him. I'm not gonna say why as I don't want to spoil too much. You had a character named Ranko that was funny and who would come and beat up Chihiro in a friendly way at times because they're pretty much childhood friends and cousins. Then, you had Chihiro's sister, Mero, who is the quiet type. Pretty much all the side characters (except one side character which I'm not gonna spoil who or why) contribute funny moments to the anime You also get some cute moments between Chihiro and Rea.The animation is very nicely done. However, an issue I had is there was an episode that had a editing issue or so, it looked like in my opinion. Episode 11, I think, where they show Rea father in the plane. I thought the editing was rushed, and the dialogue seemed to have cut off badly by it.

The ecchi theme was NOT the core problem though! You will get what I mean soon enough. Also, I have not read the manga yet and won't take it into consideration at all in this review.Okay, sorry but I won't write this traditionally as I think it will only take up space and waste your valuble time. I liked the story, art and sound with no major flaws that would hurt enjoyment or...the overall score. The thing that DID though, is mainly the character called Ranko Saouji. I don't want to start a flame-war, but this character should have been excluded from the series and I will now tell you why.She has no depth and is only seen as an obstacle more than anything else. She takes up all too much space that would have made room for the actual story to progress. And can you guess what... she is the embodiment of fan-service in this anime and shows no purpose besides flashing her tits in your (and the MP's) face. The ecchi scenes were fine. Her? No. This may sound offensive, but she wasn't even visually appealing... at all (Sorry, personal preference).So you have all these other lovable characters that you want to explore and learn more about (maybe even have fan-service of). Then there's Ranko, who has no character development, isn't funny or attractive and has an annoying (and highly clichéd) personality. THIS character gets a whole episode dedicated to show off her past! I literally moaned when I realised this and struggled to get through that particular episode (not as easy as it sounds). It was so stupid, so badly written I wanted to... nevermind.All the interesting and hilarious characters are instead put far back in the background with just very short conversations to keep them alive. Such a waste.Okay, I think I'm done bashing.Besides this, the anime was beautiful, funny and utmost enjoyable to watch. This is by far the best ecchi anime I have ever seen. I recommend it deeply. It had the potential to become much better though.Just skip the 7th episode and you might make it through. It has no relevance to the rest of the series and you will get right back on track by going from 6 to 8. I just saved some of your valuble time, you should thank me.I'm going home.

Anyway, its the plot that is so unique...remember the movie ""Warm Bodies... The appeal is somewhat simillar. I mean everyone love zombies desho? The story is basically about a guy who is a zombie freak and dreams of having a zombie girlfriend...guess what, somehow his dream comes true and a painful journey of avoiding her body from decaying starts. That was really a very very very (please mind the stress i am paying here) breif description of the plot.The presentation of the anime is good, though the background scores suck. The love...story is somewhat unique (zombies yeah ZOMBIES).There isn\'t much that i would praise about the anime. Lets get it straightforward..if u are interested after reading the plot then i suggest u watch it. Dont worry about the ecchi, its nothing over the top.So basically thats it. Got time for some zombie love? Go for it.P.S- The anime is not complete. After u are done with the anime, read the manga, just continue from where the anime left.

I saw this anime on a whim cause I had nothing else to watch.. The main characters looked cute and well cute zombies?!.. what could be better than that.. :D The first few episodes kinda creeped me out.. well what really scared the shit out of me was not the whole horror/zombie thing but actually the relationship between Rea and her father..that dude is just so fucking insane...soo yeah..overall it's good the storyline is decent and the character were funny at times.. it's good but still there are lots of things they could have done...to make it better.. to make it better.."", 'The story of sankarea really plays out well. ive actually finished this series in a day or so to say right now -_-. but anyways the story is well played out as to a guy who is obsessed with zombies meets a girl who has a family problem which causes here to go suicidal which failed and led to the father accidentally killer her and then she tries to live a normal life still having feelings for the main guy character. the story has its climax points which gives the whole anime series its major affects with executing fine points in reaching ones heart when...watching it.To add on the characters are well drawn and displayed I must give my compliments to the artist that this style of drawing is most recommended into becoming a popular anime and to combine it with a story.... well that\'s a good story.people who have seen this anime I would want to know what you thought about it on my page or profile in the comments section.there are some of us who expected this to be one of those weird romantic love school comedies and sorta annoying. such as ""Love to Ru."" which is an anime about an alien girl who meets a normal highschool boy and does a lot of weird crap...... NO! this is nothing like that its a bit more on the serious obsession side. bottom line this would be recommended to those who have a love for crazy risks and hardcore love an gore people such as me. this anime is a really serious one so I would rate it on the same level as angel beats. its serious guys give it a try if you have time -_- ^_^otegato gozaimas watching it.To add on the characters are well drawn and displayed I must give my compliments to the artist that this style of drawing is most recommended into becoming a popular anime and to combine it with a story.... well that\'s a good story.people who have seen this anime I would want to know what you thought about it on my page or profile in the comments section.there are some of us who expected this to be one of those weird romantic love school comedies and sorta annoying. such as ""Love to Ru."" which is an anime about an alien girl who meets a normal highschool boy and does a lot of weird crap......

There are very few zombie animes out there, High School of the Dead and Is This A Zombie? being the most notable.

Definitely one of my top...favorites and extremely underrated if you ask me. favorites and extremely underrated if you ask me."", 'Known for venturing to where many people dare not tread, the world of Japanese anime production has gotten crazier each year. From depictions of a post-apocalyptic world riddled with zombies to creations solely focusing on the idea of ""moe"", the range and possibilities of anime in Japan are limitless and endless. Given the aforementioned story styles are on opposite ends of the spectrum, you might think that it\'d be impossible to see the two being combined into one. Well, think again. With the production of Sankarea, the Japanese have unleashed the questionable idea of ""zombie moe"" into the anime community. So will this bold and...innovative combination be a raging success, or will it be yet another experimental failure? Let\'s take a look.Art (7/10)Although there were times where the lack of effort could be seen quite easily, the animation quality of Sankarea was for the most part decent. In terms of background details, they can be considered up to par with current standards. The depictions of hydrangea, which was a prominent symbol in the show, were on the plus side as I found them to really stand out apart from everything else. As for the character designs, I was glad that the characters didn\'t look totally generic; the designs seemed fresh and made it so it was easy to distinguish the characters from one another.Characters (8/10)In general, characters inside a zombies-based story change through struggling and persevering through the most gruelling of situations, while characters that are part of more light-hearted stories focusing on moe develop via interaction with others. In Sankarea, the characters are living a normal, everyday life for the most part, so the latter holds this time around. The development of the main character, Furuya Chihiro, focuses mostly on his gradually maturing personality. At first, Chihiro is depicted as a socially awkward teenager with a weird fetish. But soon enough, after his seemingly impossible dream came true, he began to develop a sense of responsibility, and started to act and think on a more mature level. Along the way, his interactions with various characters aid in these changes, with female protagonist Sanka Rea being an integral part of Chihiro\'s development. In exchange, Rea also develops as a character thanks to the time she spends with Chihiro.Sound (8/10)It\'s not too often I find a piece of music that sticks with me well after the anime ends, but for Sankarea, ""Sukeru Hitomi"" does just that. To me, it\'s one of the most memorable OST tracks of the year so far. The way it intensifies the emotions of the scenes in which it\'s played in really helped to increase my overall enjoyment of the show. As for the theme songs, the relationship between the OP and the ED is similar to that of the two main genres of the series—pretty much the opposite of each other. While the OP is fast-paced and upbeat, the ED slower and more mellow; both were great tracks though. And although no big-name seiyūs were involved in this project, I felt the characters\' emotions were brought out well nonetheless.Story (8/10)On the surface, Sankarea is a romantic comedy aimed slightly towards zombie enthusiasts, but more so for those who enjoy stories of romance. The idea of coupling a human and a zombie in itself is bound to create some comedic situations. Throw in a childhood friend of the male protagonist and you\'ve got your typical love triangle too. But in the end, I view Sankarea as somewhat of a tragedy (in the dramatic sense). That\'s not to say the story\'s bad; in fact, I actually like how it turned out that way. In an essence, Sankarea is a story about a pair of star-crossed lovers who try their best to avoid the inevitable—that one day, they\'ll be separated for good.Overall (8/10)So while the idea of ""zombies"" and ""moe"" sounds crazy, in the end, Sankarea is just another typical romantic comedy, but with a twist. Clearly, the show is best suited for the niche audience of people like Chihiro—those who dream of being in a relationship with a zombie—but even if you\'re not that type of person (I know I\'m not), it\'s still an enjoyable show. Having a season two would be nice as the ending was open-ended and left viewers wondering what would happen next.

The story does a lot of things right, moving the plot along at an even speed while maintaining tension common for a horror story with various plot developments. The plot deals with very real conflicts, preserving Rea’s body and dealing with her father’s obsession, and do not feel forced at any point.  However, the story does take a lot of time to provide backstory for many of the characters, and while this is good for character development, it does steal a...lot of momentum from the story that is taking place in the present. By spacing out the story via backstories, some of the tension from scenes is lost. The other biggest flaw is the cliffhanger ending, which is only further exasperated by the introduction of another conflict/unexplained phenomena very last minute in the final scenes, leaving the viewer unsatisfied.Characters: 9/10The characters for Sankarea are well developed, maybe overdeveloped in some cases (not in a bad way), and have well defined personalities. The main protagonists, Rea and Furuya, are both strong leads with clearly developed personalities. However, some characters feel a bit unoriginal save for a few characteristics. For example, Wanko is the stereotypical childhood, being both a rival and foil for Rea. She is highly aggressive, which helps offset the stereotypical feel she carries. The challenges of the characters, while the details are unique, the general gist of the problem is not surprising. Nonetheless, the character make a strong presence in the anime.Animation: 10/10The show has pretty good animation style, that is pretty clean and easy to follow. I find the depictions of the hydrangeas quite beautiful. It offers a lot of surprising visuals that help portray the mood and tension in the series, too.Soundtrack: 9/10The soundtrack is not overly impressive, though the closing is among my favorites across all anime. A fair chunk of the soundtrack is acoustic, which is pretty cool. I find the opening kind of annoying, but it is enjoyable to some people.Themes: 9/10This series is loaded with themes, both directly addressed and present in symbolic ways. The most prominent symbol is found in the hydrangea, specifically the species Hydrangea macrophylla. This species is native to Japan and is toxic due to a chemical compound in them known as a cyanogenic glycosides. In the language of flowers, this species of flower carries two meanings typically: gratitude and boastfulness. The gratitude relates directly to Rea, who is quick to thank people throughout the series, especially Furuya. The boastfulness relates to Rea’s father, the main antagonist. He is boastful of his daughter and how in the right he is. This boastfulness carries over to another theme: obsession. Both the Furuya and Rea’s father have an obsession that inhibits their character, though to vastly different degrees. Themes relating to life are also present, unsurprisingly, within the series. Sankarea also effectively combines several genres, including romance, horror, and drama to create a unique experience for the viewer. However, saying this genre combination is completely successful would be too far. The anime is plenty appealing on its own, but the inclusion of ecchi elements frequently enough detract from the mood of many scenes, as they feel rather out of place with the rest of the series.Final Score: 44/50https://rishraffreviews.wordpress.com/ lot of momentum from the story that is taking place in the present.

For a sense of its weirdness, this show includes zombie fetishism. Hold on. Before you click the back button, let me preface that this fetishism is reigned in, for not even the great Studio DEEN would be able to get away with planting the idea of having coitus with rotten shambling remains without backlash from the audience. Instead, the writers of Sankarea toyed with the technical definition of the zombie, an undead character, but kept the outward appearance of said zombie in traditional anime character style, with some gore thrown in, making the idea of zombie romance less appalling....What results, is an eccentric take on the term 'undying love', one that I cannot seem to get off my mind.Chihiro Furuya is our ordinary male protagonist who, as it is very happens in these stories, comes to befriend this mysterious, sheltered girl, Sanka Rea. Things happen, and without too many spoilers, we find ourselves in a Romeo and Juliet love story with a George Romero inspired twist to it. I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence.Having introduced our two main leads, Chihiro and Rea, I must applaud Studio DEEN for fleshing them out early on in the show, for they exhibit strong, distinguishing personalities that put a unique twist on the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the Shakespearean play. Each character starts off with emotional baggage, a hole in their hearts and lives, which some of us can relate to. Chihiro is a horror fan, one that takes this love too far, I feel, while Rea is a Yamato Nadeshiko (Google It), a girl who projects a facade of perfection, with not-so-pretty secrets behind her prestigious upper class upbringing. These two clearly set the show up well for further exploration into their personalities and further misgivings. Their feelings also subsequently mature to help each other seal these holes in their lives, giving the show strong romantic progression, a selling point of Sankarea. Sadly, side characters fall into the usual tropes: helpful, obedient sister Mero, lacking-screen-time plot device parental figure Doon, childhood friend who gets jealous Ranko etc. A slightly disappointing display, but expected at this point. The mediocre side cast aside,our leads more than make up for this shortcoming, since we watch Romeo and Juliet for Romeo and Juliet, not their extended families, so character-wise, Sankarea does alright.As per Romeo and Juliet, the idea of forbidden love works on many levels in this narrative, one being that of parental disapproval and the other being necrophilia. But necrophilia jokes aside, Sankarea is a Romeo and Juliet love story in anime, and in that regard, I feel DEEN has succeeded, where the growing love, the maturing affection between the mains is seen when our main characters become better people as their romance progresses, following my point that the two helps to fill holes in each others’ lives. Chihiro helps to fulfil the wishes of sheltered Rea, and he himself grows to be a more caring, less passive and unmotivated individual. Rea becoming less sheltered, feels less repressed, more free and happy when with Chihiro. Having their love bring out the better in them gives the romantic plot sufficient impact and weight, which is good writing on DEEN’s part, and puts Sankarea a cut above your standard anime fare. I also liked the impact in the show. Situations have been given significant gravitas, such as essential zombie maintenance and the inevitable decay of dead flesh, and they help keep the audiences on the edge of their seats. Tension occurs even on rewatching Sankarea, and this tension is also released quite adequately despite awkward pacing, even during rewatches, meaning tension still holds up well. As mentioned, pacing is a weak point in the show’s narrative, where there are slow and fast moments, inexpertly pieced together throughout twelve episodes, demonstrating inconsistency in writing. Pace should be consistent, not uniform, not varied, deviating from an established speed by some degree to emphasize important moments on occasion. However, twelve episodes also means such errors should not be too hard on the viewer on the first watch through, still, it was worth pointing out. The story has flaws, but offers significant merits, such as novelty in its zombie love premise, enjoyable, substantial romance and good, old-fashioned fun that helps it stick out of the crowd a bit more. A harsher critic may pan the problems highlighted to a greater degree, but reviews are opinion and I like to give leeway to novel ideas, especially this one which has stuck with me for too long a time to dismiss casually, so the story is good in my books.I was about to criticise the visual design of the show, being not as good in my recollection, but upon blu-ray release, everything looks crisp and excellent. Animation is great, colour composition has been balanced out very well, to mix a tone of horror and love. Everything looks nice enough to give first time viewers a treat. The character designs simply look good. Chihiro has tufts of hair on his head, making him look like a dog, with no offense being implied here as there is significance in this observation since it ties in with some Asian cultural beliefs that dogs are able to see the supernatural and share affiliation with these phenomena. This all fits the theme of supernatural horror Sankarea quite nicely. Rea is the main love interest, so obviously, she will look good, with large bright eyes, fair, almost pale skin and physically desirable characteristics in a female, at least in the eyes of this reviewer, full discretion. The leads are easily recognisable, so DEEN has done a good job here. Though the side characters are essentially tropes, they still look presentable and original, and do their job. Special mention to Gramps, he looks shrunken and deformed, making him stand out along with his more bizarre and original personality among the side characters. He eats poisonous leaves for fun. Have I mentioned how this show was weird? Collectively, I have no gripes with the character designs at all, and wish they were give more character definition to complement their unique looks, and DEEN has done well on the blu-ray release.Sound design is average. Again, I would use the word serviceable to describe it. Not bad, not memorable, where comedic scenes, romantic scenes, action scenes all have tracks played systematically to add slight immersion, but I would not recommend it for another’s consumption.  The ending is alright, I did not pay it much heed, but it gave me a feel of melancholy, which does reflect how I felt when I could not watch more Sankarea, so that exists. I would instead like to point your attention to the opening song of Sankarea along with its accompanying visuals. The title of this song is “Esoragoto” or “Pipe Dream” in English. I like it. J-Pop by nano.Ripe. The title of the song, visuals in the opening all tie in back with the entire premise of the show, where giant flying cats, M.C. Escher’s “Endless Stairs” are depicted, all help to demonstrate surrealism at the start of the episode. And this theme of surrealism applies to Sankarea very nicely, by tying back to the context within the show, that of “Zombie Love”, which comes off as far from reality as one can get, to show love toward a being that has risen from the grave, a sort of pipe dream, as the title of the opening song suggests. Also, at the end of the opening, Chihiro and Rea both entering a marked grave symbolises how everything that transpires in the narrative starts with death, as one enters a grave upon death. To analyse more would be to spoil the plot, so I will hold off on that for now, but it comes to stand that the opening of Sankarea shows unexpected depth and I am impressed with DEEN’s detail in the opening design. Nicely done.  Both dub and sub are good.To wrap things up, Sankarea is a series with an eccentric charm to it with competent execution in some aspects of its narrative. It also looks clean and gory in its visuals, which zombie fans may come to appreciate as well. A tale of Romeo and Juliet, layered with palpable zombie love that can melt the coldest of undead hearts. While there are flaws in Sankarea, one could definitely do worse when looking for something to watch, and for what it is worth, it drew me in enough to keep me watching. A recommendation for someone who wants to try something new, and is not afraid to dig through dismembered guts to find it. Wherever I may be, I feel Sankarea will stay in my unconscious forevermore, until someone asks me for something very weird to watch.Overall score: I don’t give scores/ 10 What results, is an eccentric take on the term 'undying love', one that I cannot seem to get off my mind.Chihiro Furuya is our ordinary male protagonist who, as it is very happens in these stories, comes to befriend this mysterious, sheltered girl, Sanka Rea.

Do you like a bit of romance? Do you like a good story? Yes? This is for you! I'm not joking, this anime was recommended to me by friend, I am happy that the person has recommended it to me (if you've ever seen my list of the reviewed anime, you may notice that so far I have the luck for good anime, yet). Lets talk about the story, shall we? (Although not the most original but that doesn't matter). The story begins quietly, as it may seem but then something happens and it starts getting momentum, that continues through one...or two episodes , and then somehow goes away slightly, and at the end turn will begin to get more momentum again (bad example, but it will do), it doesn't matter this anime was/is good. As you could read in the label, its about zombies, more like about one zombie. Caution a slight preview of the story - Reader discretion advised. So our main protagonists had met (Chihiro and Rea) Rea suddently dies from accident, but (that the point when I mentioned its getting momentum) resurrects as zombie (I will not talk about how it happended, if you want to know, go watch the entire series) so her father want her back (When you start watching this anime, you will hate him, buuut at the near end you will forgive him) but she refuse, she want to be with Chihiro, to live as normal girl and have freedom that she hasnt when she was with her father. Still father want her back. In that time we will meet Chihiros sister, cousin, father, his perverted friend aaand ridicuosly small and funny grandpa. Only things that are making barier between Chihiros and Reas relationship is: 1 Reas father, 2. Chihiros cousin (that cousin is actually she, and she want him = incest, thats right folks), 3. circumstances. Still reading this? Good. This anime has 12 episodes and 3 OVAs, if you will manage to watch it all you will find out, that this anime ist that bad actually and you will start like it (as for most reviewers that reviewed this anime) OVAs will take you through story of Mero (Chihiros sister) at the time Rea is in their household, Babu (Chihiros cat, he is zombie too), and the first one will take you to the time before the time of main story. Although this anime is from 2012 its good, very good, and am happy i was able to saw it. Go watch it, if you want... or two episodes , and then somehow goes away slightly, and at the end turn will begin to get more momentum again (bad example, but it will do), it doesn't matter this anime was/is good.

Go watch it, if you want..."", 'Sankarea: Dead and Loving ItWhile I\'m not exactly a fan of the horror genre, this anime does a masterful job of mixing a little horror with a romance genre. Going into this anime, I wasn\'t sure what to expect and even after watching, I was surprised with what I got (if that makes any sense).Sankarea, for the most part, is a series about a girl from a rich family that was dealt with a bad hand and in an attempt to commit suicide, she lives through it, dies later in an accident, and is revived due to her attempt to commit suicide (by poisoning). It...just so happens that the poison she took to commit suicide is part of a potion to bring the dead back to life as an undead life form.This series primarily revolves around two main characters. Chihiro, who is the son of a monk who is obsessed with zombies and Rea, the daughter of a wealthy school master who\'s been mentally abused by her father. Rea meets Chihiro when he tries to revive his dead cat by using an old, handwritten potion book of unknown origins.The best part of this anime is atmosphere. The animation, the writing, the music. Everything is so perfectly intertwined that the plot, as ludicrous as it sounds, becomes almost realistic. I think the theme that struck me the most was Rea\'s side of the plot. You had a rich daughter from a family that she wanted no part of. A family that granted her no freedom. Yet, when everything went against her, Chihiro, some ""weirdo"" kid with a zombie complex helped her in her time of need. It was such an enthralling story because even despite Chihiro\'s rather odd obsession with zombies, his main goal was to help Rea live the life of a normal girl, even though she\'s technically a zombie.This series is a little difficult to describe because for one reason or another, it was an enjoyable watch. Chihiro, Rea, even the minor characters like Mero, Ranko, and Doon in their own way had their charm albeit Chihiro, Rei, and Danichirou for the most part stole the show. I really loved the family element behind this show with Rei struggling with the ""real"" family atmosphere before she\'s introduced to Chihiro\'s family. For someone who had a borderline pedophile father who\'s psychological abuse was quite extreme, this had to be quite a culture shock for Rea\'s character to handle. It was interesting watching the interactions and I must say, I absolutely loved Chihiro\'s interaction with Danichirou when the time came.My biggest problem with this series, despite my enjoyment of it, was the plotholes. They were quite evident with the biggest one being, why did Rea have a poision liquid that completed the potion for immortality? This was a MAJOR event early on in the series that got no explanation afterward although I was expecting one throughout the series. It did seem like one of those things that they would possibly cover in a 2nd season...if it even got one (at this point, I have my doubts). Another one of the plotholes would include the ending, which again, leads to the possibility of a 2nd season. I\'d say the biggest problem the Sankarea season might have is their is probably enough material for a 2nd season (or a 24 episode anime) but since we\'re left with an open-ending, it leaves too many open questions.With Sankarea being so open ended, how do I feel about this series as a whole? Well, it\'s enticing and unique for starters. Anytime you have a story about a zombie trying to live a normal life, I\'m sure there\'s an audience wanting to know how that turns out. I\'m not even really a big zombie fan and I found this series fascinating. The biggest problems with this series are as I mentioned. It just left way too much unanswered after a 12 episode series. This is one of those animes that really should\'ve received a 24 episode set but wasn\'t granted that. One minor complaint I had with it was there was WAY too much fan service. I usually don\'t mind fan service that much as long as its used in moderation and there are reasons for having it...this series just sort of slapped it in your face and said, ""here you go, all the zombie fan service (and then some) that you could ever want.Overall, it\'s a fascinating series. I really enjoyed watching it and I find the enjoyment factor to be the strongest part of this series. However, there\'s far too much missing from this series for me to say it\'s a great anime. A good, fun-filled anime, yes indeed.

The whole faint zombie feel is nice. Not too heavy and not too light, just the right touch.(May have some spoilers, maybe)Story: This anime ends up being a cliche where the heroine is saved by the main protagonist, but the story develops in a way where it is unique though, given the genres. Certain information is relayed later as the anime goes on and in a seemingly fitting way. I am not sure what they intended the viewer to feel when...they found out about the heroine\'s situation before meeting the main protagonist. I just got a sense of helplessness from her. Not a strong character and therefore the main protagonist had a role to fill.

Usually, when something seems odd, it\'s worth a shot, and sometimes I\'m rewarded for my time. It turns out to be a good series no matter how crazy it initially seemed. I\'m sure all romance-watchers out there have seen human + vampire and human + demon. I\'ve seen those, and also a human + alien. Just when you thought things were crazy, I\'m now watching a human...+ zombie show. Odd, right? Well, maybe you wouldn\'t think so, but I did.Story~The first few episodes were what caught my interest. I\'m the ""dark twists and turns, depressing backstory"" sort of person. When we found out that the main girl, Rea, is from a very odd and broken home, it snatched my interest. I was intrigued. We have the main guy, Chihiro, who\'s overly-obsessed with zombies trying to revive his dead cat, and a sheltered girl from a very ""different"" family. It\'s fun, right? Right. And so when some dramatic stuff happens (to be precise, Rea\'s overprotective father found out she was with Chihiro)... Well, all right, long story short she falls off a cliff and dies. Let\'s skip back slightly. Chihiro needs a potion to bring his cat back to life, and he needs a certain plant. But all he knows about this plant is that it\'s poisonous. He tries a bunch of different things, until finally, he decides it\'s not going to work and he gives up. But Rea had snuck some of the potion and drank it in the hopes it would kill her, since... you know, she\'s depressed about her life. The potion later ends up working, and Rea is revived, thus becoming a zombie.If that didn\'t make sense, go watch the show. I don\'t know how else to explain it.After this happens, some cliche things ensue. Rea goes with Chihiro to his house, where she stays. Some dramatic stuff happens, and she realizes she needs to eat hydrangea leaves to stay alive. It\'s another long story. After this, a love triangle ensues, and I can\'t say there\'s anything special about it. It seems stereotypical, and sometimes I wondered why I was even watching this. It was entertaining, though, so I couldn\'t seem to stop clicking the link for the next episode.And then episode 10 comes on. Warning-- this might be slightly spoiler-y. To me, this was one of the best episodes (along with the first few), because it was so dramatic and, to me, different. (Or maybe I just haven\'t seen that many anime.) Aria, Rea\'s mother, reveals some secrets about her marriage with Dan\'ichiro (Rea\'s father, if you didn\'t know). The entire story caught my attention very well, and my eyes wouldn\'t move from the screen. It was a depressing and very odd flashback episode, but I personally enjoyed every minute.Now that we have an overview of how I feel about the plot, let\'s move on.Art~Well, the art is well-done. It\'s a bit unique in its own way, but is bright and eye-pleasing. However, the backgrounds are pretty good at setting moods. It\'ll be dark when it needs to, giving an air of sadness or mystery. Then, other times, it will be bright and joyous. The characters themselves are rather interestingly-drawn, and it did take a while for me to get used to Chihiro\'s cat-ear-like hair.All in all, the art is quite good-- happy and shiny when it needs to be, darker when the show calls for it. It doesn\'t seem jumpy or poorly drawn to me, but there is fanservice here and there. It isn\'t super ecchi quite yet, but it does have jiggling boobs and the occasional glance up some girl\'s legs. I hate fanservice, personally, but I can deal with this because it\'s occasional and isn\'t used when it isn\'t needed.Character~Eh... they\'re ok. They\'re different in their own way, but I wish they\'d develop a bit more. Perhaps they will, so I\'m waiting to see. Chihiro seems to be the somewhat-sterotypical anime guy, except that he has an insane zombie obsession. Just this alone drew me into his character, wanting to know more. He\'s a decent guy, and seems sweet and helpful sometimes, but he\'s not overly considerate of those around him when he\'s watching a zombie show or reading about them. He\'s got his interesting quirks, but I\'m hoping they\'ll develop him enough to peel away just a few of his cliches here and there. Maybe he needs them, I dunno.Rea is interesting enough. She\'s your average naive, sweet girl type, who doesn\'t seem to know much. I would have been irritated and given this show up if it weren\'t for the reasons behind that. Of course, she\'s sheltered... overly much, and her father is a maniac who takes nude pictures of her. She used to think it was normal, but as she matured, she realized it wasn\'t. She struggles, and hides it behind a facade for the most part-- but she is truly a little naive, and sweet to those she cares about, I\'d say. She isn\'t too bad of a character at all.Ranko is Chihiro\'s cousin, and she likes him. As in like like. Yeeeah. She seems to be your utterly stereotypical teasing-strong-girl type, with a soft side she doesn\'t want to show (but she does anyway, whether she likes it or not). And she has big boobs, which is a large cause of fanservice in this show. I\'m hoping they\'ll flesh her out a little and make her different, but so far she\'s just the same as all the other ""part of a love triangle, has unrequited love"" girls I see so often in anime.Soundtrack~Well, I heard it in there somewhere. Every time I start a new series, I bug myself about remembering to listen to the soundtrack so I can write a review on it. And yet I always forget to. I do know that the music matches the mood pretty well, and brings out the actual happenings on-screen more.The voice actors are rather... average, but they do fit their roles. They don\'t do a terrible job at voicing their character, which is good-- but Rea\'s voice seemed way too high for me in the beginning of the show. Either that has changed through the course of the series or I just got used to it.The opening song seems pretty average, nothing special, but the animation that goes along with it is just... odd. It reminds me of some stupid dream I had when I was seven about a magical world with fluffy, sharp-toothed bunnies. Not that there are any fluffy, sharp-toothed bunnies in this (I think) but the setting of the theme song just reminds me of it. It\'s weird, and that\'s all I can say. And I haven\'t listened to the ending song yet.Overall, this show is very entertaining and intriguing, though it has its cliches. It is fun to watch, and will pass the time very nicely. I\'m excited to see the next episodes. It\'s good overall, but if you\'re not a romance fan, I don\'t know what to tell you. It\'s not amazing enough to recommend, but I will tell you to at least try it and see how you feel. It\'s the type of show romance-lovers might find very interesting, but not the type I\'d go around telling everyone I know to watch it.Still, it\'s worth a shot, and my time was not wasted on this show. + zombie show.

When I watched it, (if I had not read the episode summery before) I would have definately (sorry about spelling errors) been totally curious from episode 1 - but I had the general idea. The plot was unique because it was one of the first anime I watched in which the plot revolved around the ""non - living"" and living - and wanted to know how the show would flow - but I ended up...enjoying almost every bit of the anime. The plot followed well and I loved the art work. The music also flowed and (kind of a spoiler alert so I\'ll just leave it in parenthesis - I was surprised by the perverted nature of the Sankarea\'s father - it gave me the creeps, but I also kept watching this show because in my head I would hope that somehow she gets aways from her father). I saw there was a manga that goes farther into this plot so im gonna have to just wait till hopefully second season because I\'m to lazy to start reading - but I really loved the unique twist to this anime. One thing that did annoy me though was how clique the main characters (including and especially Ranko) were - but I love Furuya\'s grandpa\'s personality and how the show is all because the death of Babu. Hopefully the person reading this review enjoys the anime as much as I did :). enjoying almost every bit of the anime. The plot followed well and I loved the art work.

This is of course far from uncommon in the anime world, as male protagonists often act chaste and reject the conventions of romantic or sexual attraction, but the difference with Chihiro is that he has an actual reason...  He’s been obsessed with zombie fiction for as long as he can remember, he’s been on the look out for a certain kind of girl that’s just drop dead gorgeous...  That is to say, a hot zombie chick.  One day, after finding a mysterious ink-splatted book about resurrecting the dead in his attic, his...precious pet cat Babu is run over by a local man’s car, killing the freaky feline instantly.  Not yet ready to part with one of his only friends, Chihiro begins to study the old book, and begins to experiment with the potion listed inside of it, crafting different variations of the same concoction to try and find that one sweet mix that will bring Babu back to life.  Of course he can’t do this at home, so he chooses an abandoned hotel as his makeshift mad science lab...  And that’s where he meets Rea.As one of the most popular girls in school and the daughter of it’s owners, you might expect her to live a happy and privileged life, fulfilling and free of want, with nary a care in the world that wouldn’t fall under the term “First world problems.”  You would be wrong, as the lifestyle of this rich and famous heiress is closer to that of a detainee than that of a debutante.  Putting up with her Father’s soul-crushing over-protection and her Mother’s alcohol-influenced indifference, she finds Chihiro’s weirdness to be a pleasant diversion, and winds up becoming the igor in his experiments.  Unbeknownst to them, she actually manages to perfect the potion, so when she secretly steals of a vial of it to end her own life with, she soon winds up becoming the one thing he’s always wanted...  A living dead girl.  But with her psychopathic father waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and her own mysterious condition presenting them with challenges at every turn, is there any hope for their boy-meets-ghoul romance?  Or like Rea, are they simply living on borrowed time?Once upon a time, I came across somebody in the forums I frequent, denouncing Studio Deen as the worst animation company he’s ever seen.  He showed a mediocre-looking clip from the first episode of Fate/Stay Night, calling it “literally the best looking thing they’ve ever done.”  Now I’ll admit that that Deen’s put out a few ass-looking anime before, but I was quick to show him clips from a few shows that I’d specially selected to show just how amazing some of their shows can look...  And one of them was Sankarea, which had just begun to air on Funimation.com.  I selected this particular title for one specific reason...  Because the animation in this series is nothing short of perfect.Now, don’t get me wrong...  We are of course not talking about constant fluid motion, like what you may find in the best looking Kyoto Animation hows...  On screen movement is restricted to what’s necessary, but it never feels like they’re being held back by anything other than their own discretion.  When the movement does slow down, it’s almost always for the sake of an emotionally significant moment, at which point it’s more like the visuals stepping back and letting you become engrossed in the shock and gravity that you’re supposed to be experiencing, which is further amplified by the exquisite art design and brilliant use of sound effects.  This gives the series a sense of energy and atmosphere that can, at times, make you feel as though you’re really there in the moment alongside the characters.For the most part, the art design is rooted firmly in reality...  Well, blonde japanese girls with large breasts aren’t exactly realistic, but you could consider that the exception that proves the rule.  Everything from a field of flowers to a row of trees to your basic urban settings are drawn with elaborate detail down to the very last blemish, arranged on screen with strict adherence to attractive color palettes and in ways that draw your eyes directly to the human characters living out their lives in the midst of it all.  Having said that, the use of off-beat camera angles and just plain weird shot set-ups doesn’t always work, and can at times feel a little over-excessive, like they’re trying way too hard to look like Studio Shaft, who can be extremely hit or miss in terms of visuals in their own right.  Some occurrences deserve to be explored from less commonplace angles, but when you’re trying to spice up a conversation in a locker room by having three characters open up their lockers as though they’re practicing their timing for a synchronized swimming meet, the show can start to look a little pretentious.  The character designs are also a bit strange, despite the mostly realistic body proportions...  I will never for the life of me understand why old people are often portrayed as little people...  And then there’s the main character’s cat-like hairdo, which I’m sure has some sort of symbolic meaning in regards to his zombie cat.  Rea looks like the stereotypical standard of young Japanese beauty, and while I would be crying ‘generic’ over it, there’s an argument to be made that her father simply raised her to look like that.The opening and ending portions are just beautiful.  The OP, Esoragoto by nano.Ripe, is one of my favorites of all time for some damn good reasons.  Asiude from the throwawayside-character breakdown that happens at about 45 seconds in, the imagery used in this opening is full of metaphors for the story of the anime, none of which you’ll understand until probably your second time through.  They’re very subtle in the way their presented, and the childish voice singing the lyrics perfectly emphasizes the tragedy of a young adolescent who was never truly allowed to experience childhood, and thus hasn’t been allowed to grow up.  The ending, Above Your Hand by Annabel, takes that idea to it’s natural conclusion...  Rea in a bowling alley, what one might consider the ideal teen hangout, just lying in the lane and waiting to get struck, knowing she’ll never truly live and patiently, serenely awaiting death to take her.  There’s a good reason the singer sounds older here than in the OP...  It’s the harsh reality to the op’s unsettlingly upbeat fantasy.In keeping with these thematic ideals, Yukari Hashimoto composed the soundtrack to hit two major note...  One decidedly better than the other.  Half of the OST explores the emotional trauma faced by Rea...  The exact nature of which is betrayed by an array of music box, organ and piano orchestrations.  The other half is tailored more towards Chihiro, and there’s a reason nobody’s going out of their way to upload them on youtube.  These tunes skew more towards the background, and have a much more homey feel to them...  They can be downright happy and disarming, and while they’re perfectly fine in their own right, the emotional resonance of the stronger half of the soundtrack does tend to attract more attention.  Personally, my favorite is Babu’s theme, Babu no Iru Fuukei, which just sounds like the anthem of a cat strutting around town without a care in the world, and it’s surprisingly easy to dance to.The English dub is also top notch, which shouldn’t surprise you if you look at the list of names involved before viewing.  The backstage work is in the hands of the right people, with Joel McDonald directing and Monica rial writing the script, two choices you can’t go wrong with.  Jamie Marchi stayed the hell away from the script, which is also to it’s great credit, as she’s a far better actor than she is a writer.  She plays Chihiro’s cousin Ranko, and while she’s played more than her fair share of loud, energetic girls, her character has a great deal more emotional depth than your typical incest-obsessed cousin cliche, and Marchi makes you genuinely feel for this character who would probably come off as annoying in anyone else’s hands.  David Wald, whom I’m convinced can do no wrong, plays Rea’s creepy father, bringing forth an air of pride and nobility, with some heavily unsettling tones lurking just beneath the surface.Monica Rial is of course adorable as a zombie cat, as is Felecia Angelle, who plays Chihiro’s ghost-obsessed sister Mero with the perfect deadpan sarcasm.  However, the real surprise here is with our two leads, Chihiro and Rea.  Ever since Aaron Dismuke hit puberty, I’ve found his performances to be extremely hit-or-miss, but he was luckily able to play off of his own obsession with zombies to play his strange, socially awkward character.  His performance could be described as one note, but it’s the kind of one-note an introverted teenager would believably use, and he’s more than capable of emoting through it whenever he needs to.  And what’s more shocking is that I’ve NEVER liked Tia Ballard, the high-pitched banshee who ruined the first episode of Shiki for me.  But in the title role of Rea Sanka, there are no words for how amazing she is.  She shows an unbelievable amount of control over her voice, and is able to put forth consistent quality whether her character is cheerful, suffering, or going through rigor mortis(her approach to which is hilarious).  When she goes into her backstory, her expository dialogue can be downright heartbreaking, and it’s clear she feels all the pain in her character’s heart.  She can come off as a bit too whiny and spoiled at some points in the story, but I can’t really fault the actor for that...  It is, unfortunately, the way the character was written.What’s that?  You think it’s weird for a girl who’s been established as an abuse victim to be portrayed as annoying and spoiled?  Well, get ready for worse, because this show is really freaking weird.  And I’m not referring to it’s concept, either...  This is one of the most bafflingly executed anime series I’ve ever seen.  It has no sense of tone, it constantly shoots itself in the foot with it’s lack of focus, and seemingly has no idea what it wants to be.  Is it an intense, dramatic character study?  Is it a light-hearted slice of life with an unusual premise?  Is it a tongue-in-cheek love letter to the zombie genre?  Hell, it could be all of those things without feeling nearly as jarring...  Comedy, drama and off-kilter subject matter has been handled expertly in shows like Ouran Highschool host club... but Sankarea just doesn’t understand how.Our central character is Chihiro, a zombie obsessed boy who immediately gains your attention via some subtle hints that he actually doesn’t want a zombie girlfriend, and is only saying that as an excuse to himself as others as to why he’s not yet mature enough to be interested in girls.  He lives in a house with what could almost be called a Japanese Addams Family, has a dead cat he’s trying to resurrect, which(along with his own cat-like appearance) could be a metaphor that he desperately wants to get a life himself.  He’s one of the better male protagonists I’ve seen, but he’s immediately over-shadowed by the lead female, Rea.  Not long after she’s introduced, we start to hear her story, and it is so bizarrely horrifying that it winds up hijacking the story.  It’s like hearing about a triplegic puppy who just found out it has another case of leg cancer, it’s that merciless of an attack on your sympathies.At first, we’re told that her father takes naked pictures of her on her birthday, which she’s sick of.  Then we find out that he shelters and controls her, firing any maid who he doesn’t agree with, possibly killing a stray cat that got too close to the house, and using his influence to destroy the lives of the family of a girl she’d confided to about the pictures.  You’d think that’s bad enough, but as the story goes on, we also learn some things that are supposed to make him feel more sympathetic, but they just wind up making the situation feel all the more sinister.  I won’t give away the spoiler that reveals this, but it becomes evident by the end of the series(to anybody who’s really paying attention) that he’s planning to start engaging in a physical relationship with her as soon as she turns 16.  Hell, there’s an OVA episode where it’s heavily implied that he takes extra naked pictures of her that DON’T wind up in the official collection.Every time I watch this series, my heart feels heavy for Rea, and the tone of the series at that point is appropriately crushing.  But that tone starts to fade, and by the time she’s become a zombie, it’s all but gone.  We go right back to silly, weird slice of life zom-com fare.  It feels like you’re watching a different show, and the worst of it has to be the gratuitous fan-service.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I’ve got nothing against animated nudity.  I’m no prude with that kind of thing, and if it’s done well, I welcome it.  But Sankarea is that rare title where it just feels like a horrible, misguided idea.  Remember, we just got through a soul-crushing backstory where it was firmly established that the exploitation of her naked body is supposed to feel sick and wrong.  Why not follow this up with pointless shower scenes(she even states that she doesn’t need them because she doesn’t sweat) where she’s confusedly squeezing a loofa between her boobs and getting comedically attacked by an old man?  Yeah, they use her hair as a source of convenient censoring, and even if they didn’t she has no nipples for us to ogle(which is strange, because Ranko definitely does), but it still feels wrong.  It starts to feel like the writers and animators are no better than her father.Now, it is of course possible to start an anime on an emotionally turbulent note and still have it be a comedy.  It’s not an immediately terrible idea, but you have to commit in some way to both sides of the story.  In Kotoura-san, we follow a telepathic girl as she doesn’t know she’s not supposed to be able to read minds, so she unknowingly alienates her friends and destroys her own family by revealing peoples’ secrets to each other.  She grows up depressed and cynical, until she meets a group of friends who are willing and eager to accept her for who she is, and even though she has many hilarious misadventures with them, we’re never spared the psychological effects of her unfortunate childhood and the damage that she has to overcome, and we’re terrified of what will happen when her mother re-enters the story.  See?  This sort of thing can be executed well, but you have to work to make IT work.And it’s not like Sankarea doesn’t try...  That’s the most frustrating thing about it.  It has depth, but it doesn’t know what the fuck to DO with it.  First of all, this series is a subversion of the magical girlfriend genre, style of story where a male protagonist who’s unlucky in love receives a female companion who’s perfect for him through supernatural means, and likely has to teach her an unspecified amount of stuff about the world around them, while she finds fulfillment in simply being his waifu.  Sankarea is the zombie version of this, which is a welcome diversion compared to the homogeny of the genre.  She’s found happiness in death that she didn’t have in life, a;though this is eventually shelved so the story can focus on exploring the physical properties of zombies in it’s canon.  Frankly, I would have loved to see the trope humanized further by having Rea get uncomfortable with Chihiro filming her for research, as such an activity would probably remind her of her father’s photo sessions.But while we’re on the subject of Chihiro and Rea’s dad, there’s a whole other can of worms lurking in that subject.  A few times during the series, Chihiro reflects on how he’s no better than her Dad, because he keeps her locked up in the house.  This serves as a convenient reason for him to take her on some walks around town, but what the anime fails to realize is that the similarities go a lot deeper than that.  Yeah, they both keep her locked up, but it’s also worth mentioning that she symbolizes an unusual fetish for each of them, and also that they both value her primarily as a triumph of life over the tragedy of death...  Chihiro because she’s a zombie who literally came back from the dead, and Rea’s father for certain spoiler reasons.  Aside from those rare moments of lucidity that I mentioned before, Sankarea never capitalized on these things, forgoing a wealth of possible depth in exchange for an ending that begs for an unlikely sequel and a resolution that deals with Rea’s father almost as poorly as Akihiko was dealt with in Sword Art Online.So is Sankarea a bad show?  I don’t think so.  Yeah, there are a lot of negative aspects to the writing and execution of the series, but most of them are more like missed opportunities than actual flaws.  It’s like I said before, this is just a really weird show all around, and it can make for a bewildering experience, regardless of what you were expecting from it.  It’s overuse of cliches can be irritating, especially when it comes to Chihiro having basically the same two best friends as Kyon from Haruhi and several other protagonists had, but it manages to cast more of it’s cliches in an interesting and fresh light than not.  Hell, even the incest-crazy cousin is way more sympathetic and relatable than she should be, by any convention.  Honestly?  I just can’t help but enjoy it in all of it’s flaws, just because of how bizarre it is.Sankarea is available from Funimation.  It was originally released as the censored TV cut, but was later released uncensored, although if i’m being totally honest, if you can save some money by picking the censored version, you probably should.  There really isn’t that much difference between them.  For the extra money you get a couple shots of zombified Rea with her guts hanging out, as well as no more than 30 collective seconds of uncensored nudity that you’ll barely miss.  The uncensored version is cheaper now than when it was released, going for thirty-five bucks instead of sixty, but you can still find copies of the censored version floating around Ebay for ten to fifteen bucks.  The original manga is available stateside from Kodansha entertainment, and while I haven’t read it, it apparently offers a more complete story.  It has a few OVAs, and while one of them made it onto the DVD set as an episode, the other two did not, and are not available stateside.Sankarea is far from perfect, but I still have to stick to my guns on one thing I said two years ago...  It’s the best zombie anime ever made.  It creates it’s own logic from scratch instead of clumsily trying to reinterpret and reinvent the existing logic, choosing to paint the many established zombie lores as the works of fiction that they are.  It’s love of the zombie sub-genre and dedication towards being a new and distinctive entry into said sub-genre is what ties the series together with a note of other-wise sorely lacking consistency, and to it’s credit, the off-kilter execution just serves as one more thing that’s unique about it.  There’s a lot of things that it could have done better, and there are parts of it that feel jarring and uncomfortable, but I really like it’s brand of weirdness, and would easily recommend it to anyone who loves zombies, but is sick and tired of watching the same old genre fare.  Even as a Halloween title, it might not be for everyone, but with it’s high production values, offbeat campiness and unwavering devotion to the undead, I still recommend checking it out.  I give Sankarea a 7/10. precious pet cat Babu is run over by a local man’s car, killing the freaky feline instantly.  Not yet ready to part with one of his only friends, Chihiro begins to study the old book, and begins to experiment with the potion listed inside of it, crafting different variations of the same concoction to try and find that one sweet mix that will bring Babu back to life.  Of course he can’t do this at home, so he chooses an abandoned hotel as his makeshift mad science lab...  And that’s where he meets Rea.As one of the most popular girls in school and the daughter of it’s owners, you might expect her to live a happy and privileged life, fulfilling and free of want, with nary a care in the world that wouldn’t fall under the term “First world problems.”  You would be wrong, as the lifestyle of this rich and famous heiress is closer to that of a detainee than that of a debutante.  Putting up with her Father’s soul-crushing over-protection and her Mother’s alcohol-influenced indifference, she finds Chihiro’s weirdness to be a pleasant diversion, and winds up becoming the igor in his experiments.  Unbeknownst to them, she actually manages to perfect the potion, so when she secretly steals of a vial of it to end her own life with, she soon winds up becoming the one thing he’s always wanted...  A living dead girl.  But with her psychopathic father waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and her own mysterious condition presenting them with challenges at every turn, is there any hope for their boy-meets-ghoul romance?  Or like Rea, are they simply living on borrowed time?Once upon a time, I came across somebody in the forums I frequent, denouncing Studio Deen as the worst animation company he’s ever seen.  He showed a mediocre-looking clip from the first episode of Fate/Stay Night, calling it “literally the best looking thing they’ve ever done.”  Now I’ll admit that that Deen’s put out a few ass-looking anime before, but I was quick to show him clips from a few shows that I’d specially selected to show just how amazing some of their shows can look...  And one of them was Sankarea, which had just begun to air on Funimation.com.  I selected this particular title for one specific reason...  Because the animation in this series is nothing short of perfect.Now, don’t get me wrong...  We are of course not talking about constant fluid motion, like what you may find in the best looking Kyoto Animation hows...  On screen movement is restricted to what’s necessary, but it never feels like they’re being held back by anything other than their own discretion.  When the movement does slow down, it’s almost always for the sake of an emotionally significant moment, at which point it’s more like the visuals stepping back and letting you become engrossed in the shock and gravity that you’re supposed to be experiencing, which is further amplified by the exquisite art design and brilliant use of sound effects.  This gives the series a sense of energy and atmosphere that can, at times, make you feel as though you’re really there in the moment alongside the characters.For the most part, the art design is rooted firmly in reality...  Well, blonde japanese girls with large breasts aren’t exactly realistic, but you could consider that the exception that proves the rule.  Everything from a field of flowers to a row of trees to your basic urban settings are drawn with elaborate detail down to the very last blemish, arranged on screen with strict adherence to attractive color palettes and in ways that draw your eyes directly to the human characters living out their lives in the midst of it all.  Having said that, the use of off-beat camera angles and just plain weird shot set-ups doesn’t always work, and can at times feel a little over-excessive, like they’re trying way too hard to look like Studio Shaft, who can be extremely hit or miss in terms of visuals in their own right.  Some occurrences deserve to be explored from less commonplace angles, but when you’re trying to spice up a conversation in a locker room by having three characters open up their lockers as though they’re practicing their timing for a synchronized swimming meet, the show can start to look a little pretentious.  The character designs are also a bit strange, despite the mostly realistic body proportions...  I will never for the life of me understand why old people are often portrayed as little people...  And then there’s the main character’s cat-like hairdo, which I’m sure has some sort of symbolic meaning in regards to his zombie cat.  Rea looks like the stereotypical standard of young Japanese beauty, and while I would be crying ‘generic’ over it, there’s an argument to be made that her father simply raised her to look like that.The opening and ending portions are just beautiful.  The OP, Esoragoto by nano.Ripe, is one of my favorites of all time for some damn good reasons.  Asiude from the throwawayside-character breakdown that happens at about 45 seconds in, the imagery used in this opening is full of metaphors for the story of the anime, none of which you’ll understand until probably your second time through.  They’re very subtle in the way their presented, and the childish voice singing the lyrics perfectly emphasizes the tragedy of a young adolescent who was never truly allowed to experience childhood, and thus hasn’t been allowed to grow up.  The ending, Above Your Hand by Annabel, takes that idea to it’s natural conclusion...  Rea in a bowling alley, what one might consider the ideal teen hangout, just lying in the lane and waiting to get struck, knowing she’ll never truly live and patiently, serenely awaiting death to take her.  There’s a good reason the singer sounds older here than in the OP...  It’s the harsh reality to the op’s unsettlingly upbeat fantasy.In keeping with these thematic ideals, Yukari Hashimoto composed the soundtrack to hit two major note...  One decidedly better than the other.  Half of the OST explores the emotional trauma faced by Rea...  The exact nature of which is betrayed by an array of music box, organ and piano orchestrations.  The other half is tailored more towards Chihiro, and there’s a reason nobody’s going out of their way to upload them on youtube.  These tunes skew more towards the background, and have a much more homey feel to them...  They can be downright happy and disarming, and while they’re perfectly fine in their own right, the emotional resonance of the stronger half of the soundtrack does tend to attract more attention.  Personally, my favorite is Babu’s theme, Babu no Iru Fuukei, which just sounds like the anthem of a cat strutting around town without a care in the world, and it’s surprisingly easy to dance to.The English dub is also top notch, which shouldn’t surprise you if you look at the list of names involved before viewing.  The backstage work is in the hands of the right people, with Joel McDonald directing and Monica rial writing the script, two choices you can’t go wrong with.  Jamie Marchi stayed the hell away from the script, which is also to it’s great credit, as she’s a far better actor than she is a writer.  She plays Chihiro’s cousin Ranko, and while she’s played more than her fair share of loud, energetic girls, her character has a great deal more emotional depth than your typical incest-obsessed cousin cliche, and Marchi makes you genuinely feel for this character who would probably come off as annoying in anyone else’s hands.  David Wald, whom I’m convinced can do no wrong, plays Rea’s creepy father, bringing forth an air of pride and nobility, with some heavily unsettling tones lurking just beneath the surface.Monica Rial is of course adorable as a zombie cat, as is Felecia Angelle, who plays Chihiro’s ghost-obsessed sister Mero with the perfect deadpan sarcasm.  However, the real surprise here is with our two leads, Chihiro and Rea.  Ever since Aaron Dismuke hit puberty, I’ve found his performances to be extremely hit-or-miss, but he was luckily able to play off of his own obsession with zombies to play his strange, socially awkward character.  His performance could be described as one note, but it’s the kind of one-note an introverted teenager would believably use, and he’s more than capable of emoting through it whenever he needs to.  And what’s more shocking is that I’ve NEVER liked Tia Ballard, the high-pitched banshee who ruined the first episode of Shiki for me.  But in the title role of Rea Sanka, there are no words for how amazing she is.  She shows an unbelievable amount of control over her voice, and is able to put forth consistent quality whether her character is cheerful, suffering, or going through rigor mortis(her approach to which is hilarious).  When she goes into her backstory, her expository dialogue can be downright heartbreaking, and it’s clear she feels all the pain in her character’s heart.  She can come off as a bit too whiny and spoiled at some points in the story, but I can’t really fault the actor for that...  It is, unfortunately, the way the character was written.What’s that?  You think it’s weird for a girl who’s been established as an abuse victim to be portrayed as annoying and spoiled?  Well, get ready for worse, because this show is really freaking weird.  And I’m not referring to it’s concept, either...  This is one of the most bafflingly executed anime series I’ve ever seen.  It has no sense of tone, it constantly shoots itself in the foot with it’s lack of focus, and seemingly has no idea what it wants to be.  Is it an intense, dramatic character study?  Is it a light-hearted slice of life with an unusual premise?  Is it a tongue-in-cheek love letter to the zombie genre?  Hell, it could be all of those things without feeling nearly as jarring...  Comedy, drama and off-kilter subject matter has been handled expertly in shows like Ouran Highschool host club... but Sankarea just doesn’t understand how.Our central character is Chihiro, a zombie obsessed boy who immediately gains your attention via some subtle hints that he actually doesn’t want a zombie girlfriend, and is only saying that as an excuse to himself as others as to why he’s not yet mature enough to be interested in girls.

Even as a Halloween title, it might not be for everyone, but with it’s high production values, offbeat campiness and unwavering devotion to the undead, I still recommend checking it out.  I give Sankarea a 7/10.', 'As you might recall i first wrote a review on this anime when the first 6 episodes were the only ones available and in that time the entire show changed from what i thought would be a contender for top 8 anime of the year to the endless abiss of ""meh"" where all anime have a component that makes it stand out yet cant break apart from its cliche enough to be deemed ""unique"". So i will start this review the same intro as the review when there was only 6 episodes and all parts that is in CAPS are the edited parts after finishing...the anime to give contrast on how stagnant this anime becomes.You must die to live.Words that have been used time and time again in many plays originating in Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet and Much ado about nothing. Sankarea takes that simple quote to a whole new level. Sankarea is the story of Furuya who loves zombies, wait right there before you  think this is just another high school of the dead otaku filled anime cuz if you think so then your very wrong.Sanka is a girl that lives a luxorious lifestyle and is an idol in and out of the classroom but she keeps a secret with her. During her birthday each year she takes a picture fully nude which is done in secret by her father originally she felt contempt and happy with this as a young girl but into her adolescent year she started to think it was rather strange. Her father also is seen as over protective in which everyone she had a relationship with would either be fired or for mysterious reasons have to quit there job. Sanka realized that her father was manipulating other people in order to keep his baby girl all to hisself. Eventually Sanka started to sneak from home to an abandon building where she meets Zombie lover Furuya. Furuya is there trying to revive a cat that recently died and sanka asks if he succeeds would he take resurrect her if she died and would take ""responsibility"" for her. (>.>) Furuya says yes.Story (10): studio deen has a good record of anime with good story lines that has good comedy such as Higurashi, Ruroni Kenshin, Detective loki, and Vampire Knight but the thing that all these anime have in common is that the ending is the absolute weakest part of these anime and unfortunately it looks like Sankarea is going down that path as well since 5 episodes in it haven\'t developed any form of purpose yet. So yes so far i give story a 10 but don\'t expect that to stay the same till the end.STORY(8 AFTER FINISHING):THE STORY OF A GIRL WANTING TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE STARTED TO FADE AS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SHOW CAME INTO PLACE AND IN MOST CASES THOSE INDIVIDUAL PARTS SUCH AS GIVING ENTIRE EPISODES TO A SIDE CHARACTERS WAS POINTLESS AND TOOK UP SPACE SINCE SANKAREA ONLY HAD 12 EPISODES TO WORK WITH. ALSO IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE SHOW THE GIRL WHO WANTS TO DO NORMAL THINGS ONLY DOES SOMETHING NORMAL ONCE... SHOPPING AT A MALL BEFORE CRAZINESS AGAIN HAPPENS.Art (10): When i first watched this anime i instantly thought SHAFT because the art resembled Bakemonogatari so much so that i started to get a nose bleed at the simple sight of the scenery. When i realised that it was Studio Deen work i was bamboozled as i never seen such high quality work done for any anime that ever came out of studio deen before and thats saying something.ART (STILL A 10): STUDIO DEEN TRULY OUTDID THEMSELVES WITH THIS ANIME TAKING SOME THINGS THAT MAKE SHAFT AND GAINAX SO POPULAR AND MAKING IT THEIR OWN IS SOMETHING THAT ALOT OF COMPANIES WOULDN\'T WANT TO RISK ON SUCH A WELL BUDGETED SHOW LIKE THIS. REALLY ITS LIKE WATCHING SEITOKAI ICHIZON THEN HIGURASHI THEN SANKAREA AND SEEING HOW BEAUTIFUL SANKAREA IS COMPARED TO TWO ANIMES THAT WERE CONSIDERED DECENT ANIMATION AT ITS TIMESound (8): good music but easy to forget not much moving music except for some zomb music here and thereSOUND(8 STILL BUT NO THING TO ADD)Characters (7 ): Dont let this seven fool you the characters for this show is great but the only reason i gave the characters a seven is because they\'re sterotypical (i word to overly used in anime) but thats okay in some cases. These characters are never going to change or grow or expand their gonna be as naive as they were from the beginning of the series but thats what this anime needs it to be. If Sanka never changed then she would\'ve by now taken action against her father along time ago. Sanka\'s father would\'ve changed to and would learn why her daughter doesn\'t understand his love for her. These characters are supposed to be so rigid in which their beliefs are already set and can\'t be modified so in this a 7 is neccessary.CHARACTER (6 AFTER REALIZING HOW STUPID MY ABOVE COMMENT WAS OF CHARACTERS I HAD TO DEDUCT THE SCORE A BIT CUZ THE CHARACTERS BEING UNIQUE DOES MATTER AND AFTER 12 EPISODES OF STAGNANT CHARACTERS MAKE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELFenjoyment (9): Its not often that i write reviews most of my reviews are youtube video reviews and are scripted edited and then recorded so i have alot of time to watch it and revise it so the mere fact of me taking my time and writing an essay trying to get people to watch this anime is prove enough that this show is awesome. Give the first two episodes a try if you like shaft youll like this anime if you like romance youll like this anime if you like bakemonogatari youll like this anime if you like a show with a driving plot yet good unconventional humor youll like this anime.ENJOYMENT (7 ITS SO HARD TO SAY THIS BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT COULD\'VE GONE RIGHT ON THIS ANIME. AND WORST OF ALL THE ENDINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG WHY ITS LIKE THE SHOW ENDED WITH OUT GIVING WARNING ITS ABOUT TO EN...SOME THING LIKE THAT YEAH EXCEPT YOU GO ON MYANIMELIST.NET AND REALIZE THAT PROBABLY IS THE REASON WHY THE RATING FOR SANKAREA WENT FROM BEING #443 TO THE HIGH #800OVERALL SANKAREA MADE THE RIGHT MOVES AT FIRST THEN JUST TOTALLY BUSTED AND EXPLODED WHEN CRUNCH TIME CAME ROLLING ABOUT. A PROBLEM TO OFTEN SEEN IN ANIME THE END RESULT WAS TO ANTI-CLIMATIC AND JUST LEAD TO A ""MEH"" TYPE FEELING AT THE END. SANKAREA IS A START THOUGH A NEW WAY STUDIO DEEN CAN POSSIBLY TRY TO PRODUCE ANIME SINCE THE CONCEPT WASN\'T TO BAD AND I WOULDN\'T MIND SEEING MORE ANIME LIKE SANKAREA THIS ANIME RIGHT NOW IS NOTHING MORE THAN A BUST AND WASTE OF INVESTMENT ON FUNIMATION POINT OF VIEW (WHICH JUST LICENCED SANKAREA AS AN ANIME THEY ARE PLANNING TO DUB IN THE FUTURE):D have a nice day the anime to give contrast on how stagnant this anime becomes.You must die to live.Words that have been used time and time again in many plays originating in Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet and Much ado about nothing. Sankarea takes that simple quote to a whole new level. Sankarea is the story of Furuya who loves zombies, wait right there before you  think this is just another high school of the dead otaku filled anime cuz if you think so then your very wrong.Sanka is a girl that lives a luxorious lifestyle and is an idol in and out of the classroom but she keeps a secret with her. During her birthday each year she takes a picture fully nude which is done in secret by her father originally she felt contempt and happy with this as a young girl but into her adolescent year she started to think it was rather strange. Her father also is seen as over protective in which everyone she had a relationship with would either be fired or for mysterious reasons have to quit there job. Sanka realized that her father was manipulating other people in order to keep his baby girl all to hisself. Eventually Sanka started to sneak from home to an abandon building where she meets Zombie lover Furuya. Furuya is there trying to revive a cat that recently died and sanka asks if he succeeds would he take resurrect her if she died and would take ""responsibility"" for her. (>.>) Furuya says yes.Story (10): studio deen has a good record of anime with good story lines that has good comedy such as Higurashi, Ruroni Kenshin, Detective loki, and Vampire Knight but the thing that all these anime have in common is that the ending is the absolute weakest part of these anime and unfortunately it looks like Sankarea is going down that path as well since 5 episodes in it haven\'t developed any form of purpose yet. So yes so far i give story a 10 but don\'t expect that to stay the same till the end.STORY(8 AFTER FINISHING):THE STORY OF A GIRL WANTING TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE STARTED TO FADE AS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SHOW CAME INTO PLACE AND IN MOST CASES THOSE INDIVIDUAL PARTS SUCH AS GIVING ENTIRE EPISODES TO A SIDE CHARACTERS WAS POINTLESS AND TOOK UP SPACE SINCE SANKAREA ONLY HAD 12 EPISODES TO WORK WITH. ALSO IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE SHOW THE GIRL WHO WANTS TO DO NORMAL THINGS ONLY DOES SOMETHING NORMAL ONCE... SHOPPING AT A MALL BEFORE CRAZINESS AGAIN HAPPENS.Art (10): When i first watched this anime i instantly thought SHAFT because the art resembled Bakemonogatari so much so that i started to get a nose bleed at the simple sight of the scenery. When i realised that it was Studio Deen work i was bamboozled as i never seen such high quality work done for any anime that ever came out of studio deen before and thats saying something.ART (STILL A 10): STUDIO DEEN TRULY OUTDID THEMSELVES WITH THIS ANIME TAKING SOME THINGS THAT MAKE SHAFT AND GAINAX SO POPULAR AND MAKING IT THEIR OWN IS SOMETHING THAT ALOT OF COMPANIES WOULDN\'T WANT TO RISK ON SUCH A WELL BUDGETED SHOW LIKE THIS. REALLY ITS LIKE WATCHING SEITOKAI ICHIZON THEN HIGURASHI THEN SANKAREA AND SEEING HOW BEAUTIFUL SANKAREA IS COMPARED TO TWO ANIMES THAT WERE CONSIDERED DECENT ANIMATION AT ITS TIMESound (8): good music but easy to forget not much moving music except for some zomb music here and thereSOUND(8 STILL BUT NO THING TO ADD)Characters (7 ): Dont let this seven fool you the characters for this show is great but the only reason i gave the characters a seven is because they\'re sterotypical (i word to overly used in anime) but thats okay in some cases. These characters are never going to change or grow or expand their gonna be as naive as they were from the beginning of the series but thats what this anime needs it to be. If Sanka never changed then she would\'ve by now taken action against her father along time ago. Sanka\'s father would\'ve changed to and would learn why her daughter doesn\'t understand his love for her. These characters are supposed to be so rigid in which their beliefs are already set and can\'t be modified so in this a 7 is neccessary.CHARACTER (6 AFTER REALIZING HOW STUPID MY ABOVE COMMENT WAS OF CHARACTERS I HAD TO DEDUCT THE SCORE A BIT CUZ THE CHARACTERS BEING UNIQUE DOES MATTER AND AFTER 12 EPISODES OF STAGNANT CHARACTERS MAKE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELFenjoyment (9): Its not often that i write reviews most of my reviews are youtube video reviews and are scripted edited and then recorded so i have alot of time to watch it and revise it so the mere fact of me taking my time and writing an essay trying to get people to watch this anime is prove enough that this show is awesome. Give the first two episodes a try if you like shaft youll like this anime if you like romance youll like this anime if you like bakemonogatari youll like this anime if you like a show with a driving plot yet good unconventional humor youll like this anime.ENJOYMENT (7 ITS SO HARD TO SAY THIS BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT COULD\'VE GONE RIGHT ON THIS ANIME.

But that\'s not necessarily bad. Their actions are and chars are well fleshed out and nothing illogical at least to my eyes...The art is absolutely beautiful and stunning. Nothing really unique but the colors are just great. There is a particular scene that even made me wonder if i was...watching anime or a real life picture. There are details and overall overwhelmingly good. I can say its an eyeful literally.The story tho is clearly aimed for teenagers. And this anime is clearly for only to those who liked its concept otherwise you don\'t want to get involved trust me in this one.Its comedic aspects are highly laughable and romance content average.

Personally if someone told me he was a zombie i would seriously call a hospital for him. Last but not least,2nd season baiting or manga advertising. Dunno but it was so obvious that was bad!Overall, i wouldn\'t call it completely bad since it was an easy and not so disturbing watch, but its not for everybody. So unless you are really edgy and tolerant to stupidity i wouldn\'t suggest it to you.Reasons to watch it:-the most normal and cool sister ,i\'ve seen in an ecchi romance.

It was something that nearly met my current expectations. The first few episodes of the show really caught my attention, but as I watched more and more episodes I started to get really worried with the pace the show was going at near the end. Keep in mind that there is a possibility that to you the series may have an incomplete feeling to it. Even so, the later episodes did have great moments that got me excited or surprised when I was watching. Basically the story had a good start, but a questionable end.Art:...8/10The art style for most of the supporting characters was generic and did not stand out too much to me. But the two main characters, Chihiro Furuya and Rea Sanka really stood out. I liked how Furuya's hair looked like he had cat ears, and there was an odd feeling I had when I saw the ultra pale skin and the red and black eyes on Rea. I would also like to mention Mero Furuya and Danichiro Sanka. Mero's silver-blue hair and her almost emotionless reactions were super adorable. Danichiro's character design was plain mesmerizing to me because of those 3 dots going down the middle of his forehead.Sound:7/10I have only seen the dub of this show, but in my opinion the dub was decently casted. I quickly got used to all of the voices, except Ranko, which I thought was ok at times, great other times. Also Mero's VA fit perfectly 99% of the time, only one moment was awkward hearing. The other VAs were good but were not stand outs in my opinion. Also there was not any OSTs that really stood out, but it is good enough to set the tone.Characters: 7/10Not going to spend too much on this part. A good number of characters followed a certain type of archetype is some way. What is good is that there is development for our main cast throughout the show and if there was a little more development I would definitely push this rating up to an 8.Enjoyment: 8/10I usually try not to expect to much out of a show unless I'm hyped about it. With that in mind, the show was entertaining and even brought up small little bits of information a few episodes back and put them in the light near the end of the show. Those little events that foreshadowed was one of the reasons that kept me watching the show. Although there was small bits of comedy thrown in by our comedic relief character, it kinda broke the immersion sometimes when he was on screen.Overall: 8/10Liked the show but it is not really something I'd recommend to someone newer to anime. I would recommend this show if you just want to kill time. Also, would like this show to have more episodes if it ever does. 8/10The art style for most of the supporting characters was generic and did not stand out too much to me.

It is a very light story without any heavy, mind-blowing or amazing plot. Maybe the director could've make it a little bit faster? Some episodes just seemed like sllice of life-type of episodes. It worried me, because this was a 12 episode anime and the director made the pace as if it were a 24 episodes anime, which usually has a slower...plot. The thing is that the climax in the last episodes did not give much of an impact and the romance is still kinda underdeveloped.Art 8/10I liked the art. I liked how the characters were made and some scenes. However, I do not think there was much variety or scenes that made a big impact. Of course, I know that this anime doesn't have the same budget as Fate/Stay and other big budget-animes. So, for the art, I guess it's good.çCharacters 6/10We do not see them struggle that much.

Girl becomes zombie and is the love interest for the guy with the creepy zombie fetish. After that there isn\'t much of a plot. She has an abusive father who she managed to get away from when she got ""zombified"" and the father tries to get her back, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda, etc. Aside from this, the plot is basically our main character trying to find a way to preserve his zombie crush - who will eventually decay like any other corpse. So he\'s basically observing...her, yandere father, trouble ensues, yadda yadda yadda. As you can tell, I am not extremely enthusiastic about the plot.There are also some really unnecessary filler episodes. Well, not completely unnecessary, but only have about a minute or so of actual plot, while the rest seems to be just for lols. Speaking of which: this is a comedy. Nnnnnnnnot that funny. I slightly chuckled. Twice. As for horror, I never get scared with the horror genre. At the most I\'ll just get really on edge, but I didn\'t really have any moments like that with this anime.Really important part here: if you don\'t like inconclusive endings, you won\'t like this anime. It ends and leaves you like ""WTF that\'s it?""Art: 7 (Good)Not quite what I\'m used to, but good. Some of the backgrounds tend to be kind of bland, though, while others really stand out.Sound: 7 (Good)OP and ending theme are catchy, though not enough for me to not skip over them. Voices are good and reflect the characters nicely.Character: 4 (Decent)We\'ve got a loooooot of stereotypical characters here. A 12 year-old girl who seems like she\'s completely emotionless, a junior high kid who\'s the main character\'s friend and also happens to be a complete pervert, a senile old man who sometimes has ""sane moments"", a tomboy, an adorable airhead, the girl next door who has always been in love with the main character, and a girl with incestuous daddy-issues.The most original character is the main character, and that\'s only because of his weird zombie fetish.Enjoyment: 7 (Good)Despite the ""eh""-ness and being not quite impressed, I DID find the anime enjoyable to watch. It took me until episode six to get really interested, though. If it was really long I might not have bothered finishing it, but I was able to handle only twelve episodes of mediocre plot. Overall I found it fairly enjoyable to watch.Overall: 6 (Fair)If you\'re interested in ecchi anime, however, have a seat and watch the show. We\'ve got partial nudity, bouncy boobs, panty shots (not even because the character was seated in a certain way; they LITERALLY just cut to up someone\'s skirt for no reason whatsoever), a girl licking another girl\'s boobs and all that classy stuff.I, however, watched this anime because I read the synopsis, thought it was one of the stupidest things I\'d ever read and thought it would make for some laughs, though they ended up giving the story a more serious tone than I had anticipated.

I have seen some unique ones in the past that I could not follow the purpose for there changes in direction, and this one seems to fit into that category for me.The premise of the story being of a boy, Chihiro, falls in love with a zombie girl who becomes that way under some very unusual circumstance I find to be very ""avaunt guard"". Chihiro, being a horror NEET as it would be, has the way freaky fetish for falling in love and having a romance with only an zombie girl.  Completely unheard...of, but actually meets a sweet, naive girl; all be it tormented, that becomes a zombie which is even more unheard of. They go about the few episodes explaining how this comes about, which fit together well from it\'s description, that being one of a mainly supernatural/ horror genre; however after a bit, that feeling to the show, seems to fade. In it\'s place raises a much larger main stream romantic/comedy air about it.Being devoted to the story line as much as the development of the characters I found this to be a bit distracting, and confusing. It starts out working really hard to get it\'s viewer\'s to feel the suspense and a, as best as I can put it, type of shuddering fear for a horror. Then is then soon dropped for for many more cutesy events or scenes that don\'t seem to fit with it\'s original flow. It is as if the writers are having a hard time balancing the idea\'s of loving romance and chilling horror. Overall with this confusion they seem to do a decent job of pulling it all together by the time they finish.Yet again even with all is said and issues resolved, there are some hints that stay unanswered that bother me.  First you get hints that Chihiro\'s deceased Mother may likely have been turned into a zombie for some reason by his Grandfather. This issue seen enough to make you wonder is never really addressed. Then you get the whole complete and utter insanity of the Sanka household. Most of it seems to be done and taken care of, but Dan\'ichirō leave on a flight to look for a so called ""cure"", and is it just me or does the rich Sanka family seem to have trace hints of the occult to it that the rest of the society is oblivious to. Finally the most important one of all. WHAT HAPPENS TO REA?! I mean does she truly rot away in the end, does Chihiro finally figure out how to perfect the potion, does Rea stay undead forever or is some odd cure or change take place?

Uhhh, if it's done well, yes please!The art style is different, but very nice. It's dark and moody the way it's supposed to feel, yet there's bright light elements to it at the same time.You have a different type of boy, and a smiling, 'happy' girl. Seeing them together is adorable. Then things get a little sad..Then you're faced with a cute zombie girl?Things aren't all happy, as they shouldn't be. Dealing with things that happen to someones body when they die and other things make...the story more interesting than just having it basic, like oh she's a zombie now, everything's going to be perfect.The Horror is not so much, either is the Ecchi. It's just a nice story with bits of Romance and a decent amount of Comedy mixed in. It all goes nicely together and the result is a fun anime experience. The ending leaves you with some questions, so hopefully one day they'll get answered.I'd definitely recommend it to those who enjoy the listed genres and different types of stories. the story more interesting than just having it basic, like oh she's a zombie now, everything's going to be perfect.The Horror is not so much, either is the Ecchi.

There are so much interesting and refreshing things in the storyline. The scary, comedy, drama, and romance parts are all well-balance.If the story is unique, wait until you see the very unusual characters. There’s a father who loves his daughter so much that it’s becoming incestuous. There’s the very weird and unusual boy who loves zombies and dreams of having a romantic zombie encounter. And not only his personality is strange; his appearance is also very weird. Well, it’s not...every day you see a protagonist with hair that looks like cat ears. And that’s even more with a love story. He’s definitely not the typical cool male lead in a love story. Finally, there’s the zombie female protagonist who dreams of a normal girl’s life and that includes experiencing a normal romantic life which is extremely weird considering she’s not “normal” in the first place. It’s weird that she has to be physically abnormal just to have a normal life. And this is the first time I see a very “kawaii” zombie. In this way, she looks more like a vampire and not a zombie at all.I really love vampire love stories and I already seen so many. I also love zombie action stories but this is definitely the first time I encounter a “zombie love story”. That kind of originality is absolutely interesting and refreshing not only from the everyday anime but also with the everyday love story. If you are fed up with traditional animes or love stories that look like made by the same person then this series is like a breath of fresh air. It’s not particularly exciting as there are not really explosive plot like some mainstay shounen animes of today but it is still very much interesting. every day you see a protagonist with hair that looks like cat ears. And that’s even more with a love story. He’s definitely not the typical cool male lead in a love story. Finally, there’s the zombie female protagonist who dreams of a normal girl’s life and that includes experiencing a normal romantic life which is extremely weird considering she’s not “normal” in the first place. It’s weird that she has to be physically abnormal just to have a normal life. And this is the first time I see a very “kawaii” zombie. In this way, she looks more like a vampire and not a zombie at all.I really love vampire love stories and I already seen so many.

It dares to do something different by adding the main character, Chihiro\'s, zombie fetish, which may be strange but is original.  The show is a little better than your average ecchi romance and I would put its importance on your ""Plan to Watch"" section a little above those that you want to watch because you are bored but no above those that you definitely should watch.Story:  The story of Sankarea revolves around Chihiro, a high schooler that has a strange infatuation with zombies.  As I said before, pretty original....The show brought up what it needed to and I don\'t think that there was more that needed to be added.  At times it seemed a little slow, and at first I thought that they were avoiding the goals that they set forth but eventually Sankarea got around to them.  It finishes strong and was pretty enjoyable, but since some episodes included a little filler here and there I will give it an 8/10Art:  The art was very nice, nothing original but I really liked its look.  It was consistent and had no problems.  However, I have seen better.  The character design was very nice as well.  Since it doesn\'t go above and beyond though, I will give it 9/10Sound:  Nothing noticeably good in this section, the intro and outro were good but nothing too special.  As far as the background music, nothing that I can quite remember.  I\'m gonna stick this section with a 7/10Enjoyment:  Although parts of my review might seem like I thought of this series as an average anime, that is not how I feel.  I enjoyed the anime at all times even when some episodes were slow, I kept moving forward without break out of enjoyment and wondering what would happen next.  Although I cannot ignore that some of the aspects of the show were not to my liking.  I\'m going to put this at an 8/10Overall:  The anime was well done, could have been better but still well done.  By how it ended I would expect to see a season two if the show does well enough.  It was a good addition to the list of 2012 anime and the show has made me interested enough to look into the manga.  As I said earlier, put this show above shows that you just want to watch in your free time.  This show is not a waste of time like some other shows end up being but it is not going to make it into one of the anime that I look back on and say that I really enjoyed a ton despite not being a favorite unless they improve with the second season, which is definitely a possibility.  For this section I will give the first season a solid 8/10 The show brought up what it needed to and I don\'t think that there was more that needed to be added.

For this section I will give the first season a solid 8/10', ""I don't realy want to rate this anime because i enjoyed it but there is just so much annoying and plain trash writting in it that it is hard to give it a good rating.Well i actually going to review almost every episode and ill try not to spoil much. Lets start with characters:1. Chihiro, he like zombies and he is gay.2. Rea, smart and beautiful both in and outside, shes the reason i watched this show.3. Chihiro's Family, Monks that seems to be on drugs all time because they talk very slow.4. Ranko, annoying childhood loveinterest of Chihiro, she realy wants a bf and...dosn't realy care about anything even real zombies.5. A bunch of annoying sidecharacters that exist to prevent you from enjoying the story by constantly force dumb and uninteresting scenes that dosn't have anything to do with the story.Now to the episodes:ill count first 0-4 together because ist just a little pre-story that was streached from 15 minutes to almost 2 hours.It's like you go to a movie about zombies and zombies appear only after 2 hours. In those story tells about Chihiro and Reas life.Episode 5. Well imagine you meet a real zombie girl and she is cute and nice 17 year girl.What would you do?1. talk to her for days2. ask her how she feels and what is is like to be a zombie3. flirt with her4. just stare at her for days5. go out to with your friends for like 10 hours and talk about something unrelatedWhat do you think Chihiro that is all crazy about zombies picked? Yes you guessed its 5! So 45% of this episode where zombie girl finaly appears is not even about her.Episode 6. Little spoiler: zombie girl dosn't feel well, so what is our hero going to do when a girl need help?1. find out why zombie cat dosnt have such problems2. make another potion3. go clean a shrine for a whole day because your parent said so and you want ot be a good boy.Ofc our gero picked 3. and this whole episode is basically him cleaning temple and talking to his very slow talking family then when you think it finaly done.. a Ranko appear to help keep you away from the story longer. Well basically this whole episode is about our hero cleaning th temple. On some point Rea gets a bit better and decided to save herself, ofc because even in her zombie mode where she cant realy think or even talk she is still smarter then Chihiro, che choose first option and fallows the cat tofind out how he survived and as result saves herself.Episode 7. For no reason we get a whole episode about annoying Ranko, we learn about her childhood and her love for Chihiro and buch of other boring shi we never wanted to know.Episode 8. Finaly back to actual story!!! yay!!! This is so special, every scene in this Episode deserves a seporate review and an oscar.This story starts so well, Rea finaly goes out to a mall and enjoys life she realy desered after all she has been thru.But not for long, because for some reason Chihiro desides to go check another side of this mal leaving her.And suddenly annoying friend of chihiro appears and start to talk how he likes Rea and how they should go check outside and not listening what Rea says just takes her hand and drags her towarde entrance LEAVING HER STUFF BEHIND.. japan is fkn weird..But thats is just a start, there also 3 guys that want to kidnap Rea and because a multi level full of people mall is best place for this they decide to attack them near entrance because there were only 10 random people around but they they were like 3 meters away so nobody noticed how 2 grown up guys attacked 17 your girl picked her up and are draging her out while shes resisting.. every day life in japan it seems..As Rea gets a bit lose and yell for help so loud that even our hero on second level of the mall hears her but all the >200 mall shopers ignore it completely, nobody care, nobody call cops and apperently there is no security in this mall.So Rea has to save her herself again. When our hero finaly gets there, all 3 criminals and his dumb friend anre on floor, so naturaly he decide to not call cops but to ask those guys questions, because they will surly answer right?!Well they decide to kidnap him.Well i will start a new paragraph because what happen next is so epic.Two kidnapers take chihiro and run with him.For no reason in same second chihiros friend regain conscious and catches Rea's foot so she cant run after them.Then after get far enough he releases her foot and gets unconscious again.While third kidnaper apperently managed to stand up run towards his car that was like 10 meter away, open door, start engine, drive to pick other guys and that all in like 5 seconds.There you have to pause anime an just think about. Then you release that third kidnaper mus be able to accelerate to about 58 k/h in les then 300 ms and i cant explain how he managed do stop and not crashed in his own car.Epidode 9. Well we got a half season anime where 0-4 episode is a prestory and here goes another whole episode about unrelated side story about another sidecharacter nobody cares about. Well to be fair there is a short but nice scene with Rea and a bit of related story.Episode 10. actualy good, we get to learn some non surprising story about Reas live, even if it feels like we knew all this from before, but it is a related story.Episode 11. This is just weird and unserius sometimes, considering this being the big bos fight, it is actualy not good. Rea is being awesome as usualy, but story is plain trashy.Episode 13 / 12 , very good episode, just nice watch.Well considering Rea and awesome outro song, i decided to overrate this anime. dosn't realy care about anything even real zombies.5.

Not that it was an a terrible show- it wasn't- but more in that it started out as a very good show in the first three or four episodes, probably on pace for a strong 8 or maybe even a low end 9, but then it became super mediocre and ended up with the weakest possible 7, maybe even a 6.5.The first three episodes do most things right. They're in no rush and they take the time to develop the important characters and give context and motive to the base premise of the plot. It sets up an excellent...foundation that had the utmost potential to be built upon. It's all downhill from there.In a show that is only 12 episodes to begin with and runs at a relaxed pace, there's somehow still a couple of filler episodes, which boggles my mind. With the amount of potential material here it's crazy they couldn't fill just 12 episodes with content that is relevant to the main story. Especially given the way this show's ending, which feels incredibly unsatisfying and incomplete, it's all the more frustrating they didn't utilize the time they had available to continue telling the story they'd established.The ending, as stated, was pretty terrible and felt far more like a stopping point for an upcoming season 2 than an actual ending. And, indeed, this anime only covered the first couple volumes of what would ultimately be an 11 volume manga when completed, so perhaps a season 2 was intended, but as of this writing, in late 2019 more than seven years after this anime's initial run, there is no news whatsoever of a season 2 and in my opinion it's unlikely to ever come. If that is indeed the case, you're left with a very incomplete show with no resolution, which is bitterly unsatisfying.The anime as a whole requires a significant amount of suspension of disbelief, which is fine, but even within the context of its own rules there are still some holes. It's very important for the zombified Rea to not expose herself to the sun too much or to overly exert her muscles via strenuous physical activity, which they make a point to address, but what about Babu? The zombified cat spends the majority of his day outside doing whatever he pleases, including spending large amounts of time in the sun, and he is frequently seen jumping from trees or from rooftop to rooftop and all sorts of activities that would, clearly, require utilizing your muscles in a more than just casually walking around would. There is also absolutely nothing, frequent showers or not, that would keep a walking corpse that walks around and does normal human activities all day, from both decaying and smelling really, really bad, especially after weeks have passed. I understand there is a magic potion involved but that was used one time and one time only and that can only go so far.Another weak point of the show was probably the soundtrack, which didn't stand out to me or feel memorable whatsoever. Very forgettable, if there's anything worth remembering in the first place. The voice acting was fine, but nothing special.Overall while I really liked the first few episodes, was into the base premise and am definitely down for a lighthearted anime with a sprinkle of darker, more morbid zombie stuff on top, this anime just didn't execute. It loses steam before hitting its midpoint and simply continues to lose it as opposed to ever getting it back and as stated the ending was very abrupt, random and disappointing. I may be being too nice in even giving a 7 because I liked the first few episodes and the base premise so much but make no mistake- this show is, quite frankly- simply mediocre.OBJECTIVE RATING- 6.5~ MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE Generous 7PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Weakest Possible 7, but still just the tiniest little speck better than a 6... foundation that had the utmost potential to be built upon.

(very minimal, just suggestive :D)-------------------------Quick Disclaimer:This is my first review, and while it isnt my forte, i felt compelled to write one for this series. All of the words stated below are just my opinion.-------------------------Story: 3/10While interesting at times, Sankarea has a confusing and over complicated story with its progression moving at odd speeds. It starts by following Furuya Chiriro, an eccentric person and overall zombie nerd. Due to a recent development, he starts experimenting on how to create a ""zombie-like"" lifeform. Now, the pacing through the first two eps or so is relatively slow, but understandably so, as it is essential...to creating that premise for the story. Sankarea doesn\'t actually mess up all that much in the first 5-6 eps, but after that, it starts to fall flat and the drama element is much less impactful. The pace of the story starts to pick up as new developments occur and characters are in peril, which is of course great, but after this event takes place, the story grinds to a halt and gets sidetracked for quite a while, leading to incomplete progression which just leaves a bitter aftertaste. Overall though, i do appreciate that it was trying to go for something unique and tie it back into a SoL romcom/drama sort of thing, but it just doesn\'t work.Art: 7/10No qualms here. Great for 2012, and pretty beautiful as a whole for the time period. Especially nice animation on action parts.Sound: 8/10Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Nano.RIPE was used for the opening (one of my personal fav bands) and it also has a stunning and somber ending, perfectly accentuating the mood and fitting perfectly. Stellar.Characters: 4/10Another slip up of this series, the characters aren\'t exceptionally intriguing/interesting. While relatable at times, some are so underdeveloped that their actions feel very useless in the serie. It just doesn\'t feel like the amount of screen time was used efficiently in development and the overall focus of the series shifted too much between characters, leading back to that ""underdeveloped"" feel.Enjoyment: 5/10Not too bad, i had some good laughs here and there, and nothing hindered the experience of the show too much. Just a fun show.Overall: 4.5/10Now this may be a little harsh, but from an objective standpoint, Sankarea is struggling in key points and just doesn\'t achieve certain elements effectively and as strongly as what they were going for. While this score is a tad bit low, i would encourage people to watch it as it can appeal to a relatively large audience. to creating that premise for the story.

The whole anime felt like a filler as they drag a chapter of manga into an episode of anime. I think the anime episode 12 of anime reached the manga chapter 8? AND THERE ARE SOME CHARACTERS UNINTRODUCED IN THE ANIME TOO. In my opinion,the anime is too slow and the animators are visibly milking.The manga is legit good tho. The plot is much faster and much more interesting and...thrilling to read.Go read the manga.Trust me thrilling to read.Go read the manga.Trust me"", 'Sankarea starts off really, really good! The main couple is pretty interesting with Furuya\'s weird zombie addiction and Rea\'s overly sheltered life and how they mesh together. The story itself is sort of .. err.. ""fun"" just with the whole ability to bring somebody back to life. Plus, there\'s surprisingly a lot of consideration put into each character\'s backstories which, alone, could make up for the horror aspect. Unfortunately, I don\'t think Sankarea really knows what it wants to be. There are serious moments they seem to brush over and long interludes where it feels like they\'re stalling. Still, I was very impressed with just...how deep they were willing to go with these characters.I started watching this for the zombie part of it, not knowing this was considered ecchi so around halfway through I started getting really annoyed with all the boob shots. I\'m not here to shame! But the story and characters are very well done and then they slow the progression of the show to make sure that we know the protagonist is a heterosexual guy that looooooves zombie ladies. Out of the main romance men I\'ve watched, Chihiro isn\'t that bad in my opinion and actually seems to care about Rea and is super funny at times! But they bring Rea and Chihiro down to the usual romance level during the middle part where the plot slows a bit but when it picks back up towards the end, I really like them as a pairing but also as characters. how deep they were willing to go with these characters.I started watching this for the zombie part of it, not knowing this was considered ecchi so around halfway through I started getting really annoyed with all the boob shots.

It was decent don't get me wrong, I mean, it could've been way better as the premise was really interesting, in fact, the whole concept of the story showed great potential and was very promising. It's just that; it was only good and exciting on the first half of the series then it kinda went downhill from that. Towards the first few episodes, I was really invested in the characters especially on the plot but they just failed to keep the momentum and couldn't remain consistent.The main character lacks actual personality, the pacing was all over the place, some...parts were dead slow (no pun intended) and some parts feels a bit rushed. The music and art was good and they did a great job on that aspect. So, probably the downfall of the whole series is that is that they started really strong but the latter part was very uneventful and ended in an anticlimactic manner. The series concluded abruptly and very little justification was given to the characters and their story.But I did appreciate this series as a whole and if you can disregard the fact that this series had inconsistency issues, then you might find it enjoyable. parts were dead slow (no pun intended) and some parts feels a bit rushed.

The series concluded abruptly and very little justification was given to the characters and their story.But I did appreciate this series as a whole and if you can disregard the fact that this series had inconsistency issues, then you might find it enjoyable."", 'Season 2? It does path a way for another season. The story is kinda short imo plus it has some filler episodes or sections within a 13 episodes season. However, it is still quite enjoyable withstanding the fact of being lacking of ""plot"".okay this sort of genre is actually quite new for me. It is definitely worth watching since it is not very mainstream. (but you could still relate to many characters in other anime probably because of the arts). I personally like the art.You should definitely take this anime lightheartedly since it includes many taboos such as ""possessive"" father, romantic relationship with undead ......The ED ""Above your hand"" by Annabel is simply beautiful. It does compliment the anime by being soft, dreamy and relaxing. It\'s just beautiful! Probably one of the reason why I didn\'t plan to drop the anime since it has kinda a slow build up for the first few episodes.... I never skip the ED.The character development is okay but kinda slow. Bear in mind, it is surprising fun and relaxing to watch although it includes horror elements.Lastly, just try watching it till the the 5th episodes ... you might like it  or you could drop it after then.

As of now, I haven't watched that episode, so I'm just reviewing the first 12 episodes.This anime is kind of wonky. I didn't have a problem watching it, which means that I didn't find it bad by any means. However, it also was that great. The story itself was kind of all over the place. My biggest issue with it is that Rea's father got a redemption arc, which to me, is unacceptable. Not to mention,...it was completely out of place and out of character. It didn't line up at all with the rest of the story.Beyond that, the premise is very strange. I guess I can give it points for originality, but the fact that Rea being a zombie is so easily accepted by all of the characters is sort of annoying.As far as good aspects of this anime go, it was entertaining, and that probably is mostly because of the main character. I'm familiar with his voice actor, so pretty much anything he said was entertaining to listen to.Is this a love story? Not really, no. At least, not one that's well done. It's essentially grasping at straws and running with the smallest hint of attraction these two have for each other. Anyway, it wasn't a complete wash to watch, but I don't think I'll be returning to it in the future. it was completely out of place and out of character.

I have good luck that I managed to see this show because it's uplifting in the nicest way, yet it has dark and morbid topics which I like lol, but it's also the reason that I can relate to the characters and can't wait to see what happens next. It has that sort of way of not letting you predict what happens next, or making you want to skip through. Overall, I think...it's bound to be one of my favourite animes, It's a shame there's no more though to watch of it lol. it's bound to be one of my favourite animes, It's a shame there's no more though to watch of it lol."", ""I'm telling you straight: this Anime is beautiful, so moving, that I almost found myself crying.... The plot, the development of the story behind, the progressive construction of the characters. It is deeply catching, the Art is damn good and I also liked both Opening and Ending themes.DAMN I BEG FOR MORE ANIME LIKE THIS!!!!! I do understand that probably they avoided to develop a Season 2 project not to spoil what they created with this 12+3 episodes work.I gotta say that it fascinated me so much that I will probably go for the Manga as well in order to follow the story.I...warmly recommend this Anime. warmly recommend this Anime."", ""I may be over-rating this because it's the first series I've totally finished.  This series could have easily been a confused mess, since you can't really nail it down as one or even two genres, but it actually works really well.Story:  Although this series centres around a young boy's unhealthy obsession with zombies, it's overall quite unambitious in scope and knows its limitations only being a 1 season, 12 episode series (but i STRONGLY recommend watching the 2 OVA episodes & 'episode 13'). The word ambitious isn't intended as a criticism here, rather that it knew better than to delve way too deep...and develop way too complicated character arcs that couldn't possibly be fully fleshed out in a single season.  You could probably guess what the series is going to mainly comprise of after watching the first 5 minutes of episode 1, but that doesn't mean it's not good storytelling.  POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THE SECTION: I also found the episode centred around Mero Furuya particularly good, providing some additional background to some of the side characters that I wasn't expecting the series to be able to do elegantly, also at the beginning of the episodes there's quite an amusing 4th wall break which I liked considering the series doesn't really take itself too seriously.Art:  There's not really anything to complain about here, the art isn't as beautiful as some animes that are renowned for their artistic beauty but I would say the art style used was a perfect fit for the seriousness of the series.  If it was 'Kimi no na wa' levels of art with a stunning panoramic every 15 seconds it would've felt out of place here.Sound:  Based on the intro and the credits songs it deserves a solid 9 at least, since they're both just a perfect fit for the series in my opinion.  A critique of the music would be that the outro song wasn't written for the series (not that that matters particularly) and throughout the series the same soundtracks are used quite a few times frequently.  They're always used at times where you could consider their feel to be appropriate for the section of the show in which they're used, but nonetheless hearing the same track a few times cheapens things slightly.Character: (SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION)  This is probably the one area where the whole series kind of lets itself down.  One of the main characters, Chihiro Furuya, has about all the depth of a puddle.  He's constantly portrayed in an incredibly shallow way, with a constant, unrelenting affinity for anything related to zombies since he was a toddler and complete reluctance to participate in any activity that is not directly related to zombies in any way.  Obviously you need to be in a weird place mentally to want to have a zombie girlfriend, but spending ~12 years obsessed on one thing and one thing only?  Especially considering that the study of zombies isn't a particularly nuanced topic with lots of complicated angles.  Some other side/supporting characters also had some characteristics that were clearly unbelievable and clearly just plot devices, but considering the entire series is told over roughly 5 hours, I can't hold that against them and thought that it was a very good effort.Enjoyment:  This is where the series shines for me.  Every episode felt good to watch and there was very little padding, the story explains itself very well and then wraps itself up in a neat package.  The show doesn't deal with some challenging issue that will make you reconsider your existence so you can really just enjoy it without having to go at full capacity just digesting its message, which can be a nice change of pace depending on what kind of stuff you normally watch.  At no point was I hovering my mouse trying to see how long an episode had left, as I've often done in the past.Overall:  I'd recommend this to just about anyone, but maybe don't watch it with someone who is on the fence about anime, because there are a few shower scenes that will probably reinforce negative stereotypes about anime.  You'll know within about 10 minutes of the first episode if this is your kind of thing to watch.  Will it ask you big questions about life and leave you a different person than before you watched it? No.  Will you have fun watching it and feel satisfied after watching it?  For sure.

Needless to say I was impressed by this one. It proves that romances don’t have to be frilly dramas. They can blend seamlessly into other genres and make a great story.The best part of this anime is the premise. It is original, interesting and had me hooked. I especially like the blend of romance and psychological horror. It gives the show a very tense feeling that makes the romance lively.So why doesn’t it get a ten? The pacing is too slow. While the premise takes a while...to set up, the plot grinds to a halt very quickly. This pace does somewhat add to romance/horror aspects of the story by adding atmosphere, but it doesn’t stop some parts from being dull. Each episode feels like one episode stretched into 2. Many of the themes and characters flaws end up getting over-repeated just to fill space. There is also some filler, which is unnecessary for a 12-episode anime.Even so, I enjoyed it a lot and the other aspects are good enough to make the pacing forgivable. I would recommend it. Some good advice, if you find the ending slightly unsatisfying then I highly recommend the last OVA. It gives the horror aspect a little boost and is a great setup for the second season. to set up, the plot grinds to a halt very quickly.

Its one of the worst I watched until now although that might sound kinda harsh. At the beginning it was interesting but the closer it came to the final episode the worse it became. Also I dont know why its under the genre romance. There was no romance just some hentai boy who likes Zombies in general. Also I didnt like the ending it is incomplete end many of my questions about things that where going on in this anime and where actually ineteresting werent answered. I got my peace when i read the wikia of sankarea because I didnt...want to read the manga. It could have been a way more interesting anime but the best parts of the manga are missing. Some episodes are just boring or dont make any sense. It just felt like I have to watch it quickly so it will be over... want to read the manga.

BEWARE maybe....Although this was an overall enjoyable anime for me, there was one thing that really turned me off about this anime. At first I really enjoyed the first few episodes getting to know the characters, but it didn't go too far into the characters sadly. That leads me into what I really hated about this anime was the fact that themes from the first few episodes continued throughout the whole anime. Maybe I'm just used after x is done y can now happen, but by x I mean the objective is completed mid season and is done for the remainder. Unfortunately...the father character maintained being a creepy dude till the last episode where I found him slightly more tolerable. Although that is the sole reason I dislike this anime, it has a good plot but not the lovey dovey shit I like so much haha. the father character maintained being a creepy dude till the last episode where I found him slightly more tolerable.

Many people have so much imagination on the topic of zombies. What are they like? How do they act? In Sankarea, the zombie are completely different from what we learned or picked up along our ways of ""real zombies"". In truth, the kind of zombies in Sankarea is much more realistic in my imagination than all other Anime, Movies, etc., except for Kore wa Zombie desu ka, which is a little of what I thought zombie would be like. It makes more sense for zombie to be like the one in Sankarea because in some cases in a movie, zombie doesn\'t...even have brain, which is pretty weird because how can they move without the brain signaling through their body? Well, same goes for Sankarea. I don\'t get this, so if someone could explain, if zombie can\'t feel pain then that mean all the signal from your whole body must have stop, and so how could they even move if the brain is not really functioning, because if the electrical impulses aren\'t being sent from the body to the brain, then it goes the other way around too right? Maybe I\'m just not that smart on this topic so I\'m gonna stop there on the brain thing. In ""real zombies"", people turn into zombies by viruses, but in Sankarea, it\'s not really viruses, instead, like an old type of thinking, where you can resurrect the dead by potion, which i think makes somewhat more sense. Well, there\'s many more things I could ask but I\'m just going to skip it because it\'s boring.Story: 9I have got to admit that there are quite some plot holes in Sankarea. There are many more things they could explain to get the viewers to understand more, but they didn\'t, which i why I believe that, people who like the anime should read the manga, because it\'s still publishing, and probably have much more information to fill in the gaps that are confusion. Although there\'s many holes in the anime, the plot were great. They move the story in such a nice speed, and How they think of the story is what pulls me in the most. I didn\'t like the way they cut episodes to fill in some of the personal views the characters had though. Okay, it was important, but they put it in between the episode where it\'s just before the climax, and that\'s not what I want. Actually, it irritates me, and may also to some of you too. I also like the plot because it doesn\'t just go with the zombie topic, but instead, the family situation, the depression of humans, and the desire of people. The romance weren\'t really that great, but it\'s pretty nice and lovely, if I do say so myself.Art: 10The art are just fantastic. I really like the kind of art they chosen for this. It added, not only pure and nice background, but some dramatic scenes fit perfectly with these type of art. Of course I do think that this style that is used isn\'t really the best I\'ve ever seen, but it fit well in the plot, and for the type of genre they had created. The blood doesn\'t fit well in this type of art though. I\'m not sure if it\'s just me, but the blood is not really thrilling, and it leaves me to feel neither happy nor sad. In High School of the Dead, or some anime like that where it\'s mainly based on the zombie, even if High School of the Dead is more on fan service side, the type of art really fits well with the blood and gives you the thrill. In conclusion, I think I over rated the art on Sankarea, but I personally just like the art style, and the character design really make you smile.Sound: 9I think the sounds for the background, character\'s voice, or any other soundtrack are great overall. It sets the mood to where it\'s suppose to be. The part where it gets serious or not could be tell by either characters tones, or the soundtrack they put in. It also gave the viewer a little thrilling added in. Sometime only, I found the character\'s voice to be a little irritating, and doesn\'t fit with some scene. Maybe it\'s just me though. I just really enjoy the voice and soundtrack of Sankarea. It\'s really calm and relaxing, if you pay close attention to it, or you might just feel it without noticing it.Characters: 8Every characters were great, besides only one. I gave this an 8 just because that character makes me do a face palm for a reason which they didn\'t explained why she did it. It\'s Ranko if you wanna know. (SPOILER: Could anyone Please tell me why she threw the thing at Chihiro\'s gram-pa\'s face? It\'s really bugging me, so if anyone could explain with good explanation I would really appreciate it. ) Even though it\'s only one character, I just don\'t like that person. Now then, I think every other characters did a very well done job for duplicating human reaction to a specific situations that they\'re in. I think to myself every time in every anime, if I was in that situation, and I have the same exact personality as that character, what will I do in this and that situation? Sankarea did great on that. There\'s no surprise on it, which is a bad part in another way, but I like these types of characters, because if they act too differently than how you expect them to act, or hope them to act, it will definitely annoy you.Enjoyment: 9I would say that Sankarea is lacking on the romance, but I did enjoy it very much. I\'m a big romance fan, so I would say, this is an average romance anime. I would probably enjoy it much, much more if they explain, or at least put more episode in it, just to explain some stuff that are missing in the plot. This is why I\'m going to plan to read the manga. I wonder if this is exactly what the creator had plan.To get people to be a bit confuse so they will want to read the manga to get a clear understanding.Overall: 9I can\'t say that it\'s one of the best anime in 2012, but I think it\'s one I enjoy very much just as equal as anime i consider in my top 50 of 2012. If I have to recommend this anime to anyone, I would probably recommend it to someone looking for a nice plot, enjoyable setting, and only a bit of romance. I big romance watcher, I don\'t think they will like Sankarea much, as well as zombie geeks. Someone who would just want to enjoy the plot, and doesn\'t care about the reality. That\'s the kind of person I would recommend it to, because it\'s not realistic as y\'all may know already.

One of the reasons why an anime is good is when you're emotionally attached to it, you know when it shows relevance in your life,personality. When the character shares/resembles the same aspirations with you. I liked how the characters were introduced as to their own perspective , you gonna go on a feels trip every time. I didn't like the ending(but still I love Sankarea), because they introduced a new character while leaving an open ending.That's why you better read the manga after watching so you'll have peace of mind, lol. This anime is full of mystery, that's...why every episode is exciting. why every episode is exciting."", 'Vegetarian Zombies!.... Really!.. It seems like the zombie genre is getting more and more creative now. They added a bit more life into the supposedly dead this time, and made a really hot zombie... a hot zombie....As to the introduction, Sankarea basically falls into a lot of strange genres that I really didn\'t think would work before. But they managed to somehow work things out so that it didn\'t seem weird. It\'s pretty much just a Romantic Comedy with Zombies and incest. Wait no, scratch that. It\'s an anime about Romance with a Zombie and incest. Yeah, that\'s better.With that kind of plot...line, you\'d think that this could be a ""great and original"" anime. Well, for the ""original"" part, yes. I can certainly say that this is the first anime I\'ve seen with this strange a plot line. But on the ""great"" part, I don\'t think so. Yes I enjoyed the anime, and yes, the story was nice. It was fascinating till the end. But it just seemed to lack the ""attractive"" element. What I\'m saying is, It really didn\'t grab my attention. I could remember myself losing focus at some parts of the anime too.The story is about a boy with a zombie fetish, a zombie girl with a really, REALLY overprotective father who dies but gets turned into a zombie, another girl who\'s in love with her cousin, and the boy\'s even stranger family. Them and a zombified cat.The definition of a zombie here is sort of similar to the zombies in Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Meaning they zombies that don\'t really loose all their sanity and they loose their body limiter. But Sankarea has also added another element that I find really nice. Rigor Mortis. It made me think about what would happen if all the zombie themed media included Rigor Mortis in their movie. It would probably be like ""magic hour"" for humanity. Although this is an element that is usually ignored, Sankarea managed to make this element fit in with the rest of the story line, and adding more depth and realism.Now the first few episodes were really dark. It gave the impression of a serious ""tragedy romance"" plot. They made the atmosphere perfect for the whole thing. It really made me think that this was going to be a really serious drama. But after episode 3, the plot literally made a U-turn and it ended up into a strange romantic comedy. I don\'t really have any complaints on that part though. I enjoy plot twists... even if they decide to just break the plot altogether.The plot progression was decent. It left holes, but they were purposely dug holes. Meaning they are there for a reason. They get annoying sometimes, but it\'s not that bad at least. It also left a hole that could probably either indicate a season two, or just a teaser for the manga since the Manga has more detail and is more advanced.The art was decent. It\'s a step up on some of the new anime. Props to Studio Deen. All the characters have their own special personality, and the art really makes it pop out. Although until now, I still can\'t help but think of Chitanda from Hyouka whenever I see Rea make a cute face.... I don\'t know why I do that though.And lastly, the sound. The OPs and EDs were all decent. Although I wish they could have hired a better seiyuu to do the OP. But I guess the voice also somewhat adds to the ""lightheartedness"" of the anime. The ED was fine too, but sometimes I wish it didn\'t have to sound TOO sad.In entirety, this is a good anime. Although I can\'t give it more than a 7. It\'s a nice anime, but I couldn\'t get myself to focus on it. It just didn\'t capture me that much. But I guess that\'s just a personal problem. All in all, this is a good anime, but I can\'t say that it\'s a ""great"" anime. But I can still gladly recommend it to anime fans who love ""unique romances"". line, you\'d think that this could be a ""great and original"" anime. Well, for the ""original"" part, yes. I can certainly say that this is the first anime I\'ve seen with this strange a plot line. But on the ""great"" part, I don\'t think so. Yes I enjoyed the anime, and yes, the story was nice. It was fascinating till the end. But it just seemed to lack the ""attractive"" element. What I\'m saying is, It really didn\'t grab my attention. I could remember myself losing focus at some parts of the anime too.The story is about a boy with a zombie fetish, a zombie girl with a really, REALLY overprotective father who dies but gets turned into a zombie, another girl who\'s in love with her cousin, and the boy\'s even stranger family. Them and a zombified cat.The definition of a zombie here is sort of similar to the zombies in Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Meaning they zombies that don\'t really loose all their sanity and they loose their body limiter. But Sankarea has also added another element that I find really nice. Rigor Mortis. It made me think about what would happen if all the zombie themed media included Rigor Mortis in their movie. It would probably be like ""magic hour"" for humanity.

Although I agree that the anime lacked direction from its few 12 episodes for plot, I will give it top marks for enjoyment. I mean come on, the first 30 seconds consist of a guy in an abandoned building in the middle of the night while a high class lady is screaming ""Noooooooooo!"" into a well. Although I feel like the line that hooked me into watching more would be""If I became a zombie, would you please take care of me?""""I love zombies, so I\'ll love you even if you\'re...undead.""(my apologies to readers, this is not actually the order that they appeared. xD the second line was actually to babu the cat, but the first is still from the girl to furuya. Just thought it would be more interesting this way.)The story itself is interesting as it takes the involvement of a zombie much more seriously and ""realistic"", if you may, than many anime. This is what gives it a feeling that wants you to watch more. Though it has these good points, it lacks plot developement. Very little happens in these 12 episodes regarding how they planned to deal with the problems of having a zombie girl. There were some episodes that didn\'t even have her show up. Although the darkness of the series keeps me watching it, the plot developement isn\'t much of a plus for me.The art was....plain but beautiful. There was no amazing details, but that adds to the story since this is about two average people with the most unusual of circumstances.Characters are meh. Though the heroine is a but recycled, the mc furuya is somewhat more unique. He is in a family of priests with a (supposedly) crazy grandfather and a zombie fetish. The heroine comes from a rich family that wants to enjoy life and lo and behold she gets it in the most unusual way possible..by becoming a zombie.Enjoyment is what made it good for me. The way they presented the situation, and with fairly good music complementing it, makes the series much more enjoyable. I especially liked the ecchi horror combination between the two girls. The cousin was searching through movies and found a strand of hair in the room. Knowing this can\'t be her cousin, furuya, she thinks there\'s someone there(typical zombie scene) and *music plays* opens the closet except no one\'s there. phew right?...Except the camera pans behind her to show a zombie girl with a creepy face. Screams occur and when furuya rushes to the room, he finds Rea licking Wanko\'s boobs.......o.O....that is just one example of how it combined horror and ecchi, but I found that to be the best example.Overall if you\'re looking for enjoyment in an anime Sankarea should keep you interested. If not, and you\'re looking for deep plot with amazing art and whatnot, there are many other series out there. undead.""(my apologies to readers, this is not actually the order that they appeared. xD the second line was actually to babu the cat, but the first is still from the girl to furuya.

The Japanese voice actors especially Rea and Furuya capture the emotions and quirks of the characters effectively.The sound didn't leave me too impressed but perhaps it is because I got wrapped in the story, for anyone wanting to know more of these lovely characters I suggest reading the manga, chapter 8 is were the anime started to diverge slowly from the story. Yet the 'filler' episodes were nicely done and still used conversations from the manga itself...making a well rounded 'what if the story had taken another direction' seeing as some characters were not introduced in the anime. Most of all I love the realistic approach to Rea's condition, she's a zombie, this is a fantasy story but she won't just survive with some random zombie magic or anything, she will rot if she doesn't take the hydrangea leaves, and it won't work forever both for her body and her mental stability as a human. Although this part of the plot is more furthur explored in the manga its still very real in the anime which makes it easy to get attached to both story and characters.Having picked up the manga just before finishing these twelve episodes I'm not displeased at all and although it seemed a bit rushed in the end  I can give it a solid overall 8 seeing how the quality of the art style was kept topnotch throughout. making a well rounded 'what if the story had taken another direction' seeing as some characters were not introduced in the anime.

Of course the whole theme of zombies was new to me and I found it intriguing at the start, but as I progressed in the episodes sure the zombie elements where there at times, but in the end the focus was put to ""How can we end this series?"", which was done in a manner that is so cliche in the anime genre all the while forgetting about the characters which then became, funny enough, zombies metaphorically,...since there was no depth to their characters anymore.That being said the series is a few years old like most of the reviews too, so this might\'ve been something completely new in the 2012, I\'m not sure.

The animation sort of starts off slowly and really catches you by surprise when Rea dies.

The story is well written, the characters have actual character, and the art is beautiful. At first, I didn't expect it to be good, but on the other hand I didn't expect it to be bad. I just came across it one day and thought it seemed interesting. Point being, I was pretty damn skeptic. Immediately after finishing the first episode, I was hooked. Everything that happened to Chihiro felt like, it was all too real (obviously, it's fake), it felt real. Chihiro is the best character, no doubt about it. He had the conflicts of a real boy, but...he also did the right things to not make all to real, like reanimating Rea and Babbu. Yeah my review is mainly about Chihiro, but don't get me wrong, everyone else is great too. Except Rea's dad (nothing is perfect). While, he was the only downside and my first impression of him was that of a child molester, he was just a creepy, extremely over-protective dad who hate's anyone that isn't Rea. So, all in all, great anime. he also did the right things to not make all to real, like reanimating Rea and Babbu.

So, all in all, great anime."", 'You know that feeling that when you finally gotten what you got, you lose that sense of satisfaction and want, such is the want of freedom...Sankarea was LA\'s Halloween Special for 2018 and well, this wasn\'t quite the ""horror"" anime LA picked out to be but nonetheless for what Sankarea had of one of the weirdest ""meet cute"" scenarios well Sankarea succeed in it\'s own fronts...with some slight weaknesses to go with it.Spoilers Ahead!Sankarea is essentially a meet cute scenario of a zombie by the name of Sanka Rea voiced by Maaya Uchida and the zombie fanatic Chihiro Furuya voiced by Ryohei Kimura, add a...dash of love triangle romance and deep character development of most of the core cast and we have Sankarea.Sankarea is by this front a more character focused plot than a narratively focused anime but the development of the core cast is what LA call one of the best strength of Sankarea, tie that in to it\'s thematic core of freedom and the ""different kinds"" and the plot as somewhat laxxed as it is, packs ALOT of it in.For characters, let\'s start with Rea, she\'s the typical ojou rich girl however is completely restricted and obeys every word her father tells her, but she longs to be ""normal"" and would kill herself in order to do so, once she becomes a zombie, she by all reasoning is ""reborn"" and wants to experience being a normal girl but her father obviously bars that mainly through Chihiro, you really do feel for Rea and she is something of subversion of the ojou archetype in a ways of wanting to be normal. Chihiro is a zombie fanatic, thinking nothing but zombies and wouldn\'t mind having a zombie girlfriend, he gets his wish but at the cost of Rea well being in the process. As much as LA thinks he gets the least change of the cast, his development in moving away from zombies into caring for someone, something he\'s never done is development to say the least and how his ""wish"" though granted is something is slowly finds ironic. Ranko Saouji voiced by Sayuri Yahagi is Chihiro\'s cousin and our third wheel to our love triangle, YUP we have kissing cousins trope with Ranko and the thing is, LA actually finds Ranko also a good character even with this trope in place, sure she\'s the childhood friend to Rea\'s maniac pixie girl but childhood friend trope has their backstory that Chihiro and Ranko has together and by all reasoning as much as LA doesn\'t like the kissing cousins trope with her, LA was rooting for her yeah...dumbfounded LA. Next we have what LA deems the most irredeemable character in the series, Rea\'s father, Danichirou voiced by Unshou Ishizuka, why?, well him being the strict father is nothing, for what\'s it worth, he made everyone around him suffer for his own delusional grandeur to the point of wanting to preserve Rea and by extension his wife\'s memory and purity by taking naked pictures of Rea every year like what the fuck, add to that his control over Rea and his utter dismissal of Aria that once Aria got her backstory about how she met Danichirou and the backstory tried to sympathize with Danichirou, LA felt more sorry about ARIA than Danichirou and Aria plays off the ""wicked stepmother"" trope!. As much as the finale loosened Danichrou up, LA just can\'t ignore Danchirou\'s delusional sense of freedom and grandeur over his own daughter...just...creepy as hell. With that who was LA\'s favourite character?...Mero voiced by Yuka Iguchi, yup Chihiro\'s little sister and no LA isn\'t a siscon with this pick, as both Rea and Ranko were pretty even with their love triangle thus couldn\'t pick either, LA went with the most chill character of the cast thus leading LA to Mero and she\'s something of deadpan comedic relief and that was enough for LA!Sankarea does take the zombie thing in a playful but realistic in a sense of what happened if you have a zombie girlfriend, everything from Rea getting rigor mortis to some of the lore as to how Rea became a zombie and using that to help Rea normalize herself in being a zombie and of course comes her notion of eating and the such, but Sankarea\'s depth of world building of zombies doesn\'t dive too deep and focuses more on it\'s characters more.Freedom itself is a fickle thing, it\'s something you want but what happens once you do?, be happy to do what you want at some point you will either restrict others with your newfound freedom like Danichirou or let things run it\'s course like Chihiro, if anything Rea is a manifestation and symbolism of freedom and funny how ""death"" is her way into freedom, huh the ""only things that are certain are death and taxes"" right?. Chihiro does touch on the subject of freedom but the thematic weight goes more to Rea, Chihiro more or less goes into what happens if your wish was granted and it both changes you as a person but that you lose that want once you obtained it. Sankarea may be a love triangle romantic comedy with zombies in it, but Sankarea\'s thematic significance is solid and explores it in earnest.In terms of animation done by Studio DEEN, well from the character designs and backgrounding is decent enough from Studio DEEN, especially with the colorful palette of the characters, but something LA noticed is of the transitioning of the anime and the odd quirks it has at times, i wasn\'t until LA looked the director, Shinichi Omata that it clicked, as Shinichi was Episode and Storyboard Directors for Arakawa Under the Bridge, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko and Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica that it was clear that Sankarea\'s direction has SHAFT influence towards it and all the more for it for the animation to moderately have that flair that SHAFT is well known for, really Shinichi\'s SHAFT touch was actually used well is what LA is getting at.For voice acting, LA was pleased with many of the voice cast from Maaya Uchida, Sayuri Yahagi, Yuka Iguchi, Ryohei Kimura and as much as LA hated the character, Unshou Ishizuka as Danichirou. Mayumi Asano as Aria though she was the drunk abrasive character, she did well as Rea\'s stepmother and portrayed her well with all regards, LA says this as LA sympathized with Aria through Mayumi\'s abrasive acting. But LA\'s MVP would go to....Sayuri Yahagi and Maaya Uchida...of course.The only faults to Sankarea LA would say is the more obvious finale to how leaves things open ended, it\'s a manga adaptation things like this happened ALL the time for people to read the manga, that and during the build up it takes a detour with it\'s core cast from an Mero and her friends antics to how Ranko and Chihiro meet and the aforementioned Aria backstory but to this one\'s defense, it builds and develops the characters even further and for a character-focused narrative only strengthened it\'s plot as well as subtlety answering some loose small questions that was in the air and executed extremely well with the adage of ""show don\'t tell"" in the form of backstories no less! LA\'s final fault is that Sankarea has some fanservicey moments sprinkled throughout the anime and in the more serious moments kinda ruins it at times though it seems Sankarea is self aware at times with Mero but the fanservice is blatantly apparent is with Ranko and her jiggle physics and Rea with her fanservicey costumes, but nonetheless a ""sprinkle"" of fanservice didn\'t hurt anyone so this flaw is more subjective to say the least but wanted to bring up nonetheless.Sankarea wasn\'t the zombiefest LA was expecting instead getting a meet cute anime with zombies and the moral quandaries of freedom, unexpected but executed well. Sankarea\'s finale may have left things open ended with Rea\'s condition and the love triangle still going but for what it\'s worth, Sankarea was a pleasantly interesting experience with zombies, having great thematic ties to it\'s characters and an overall decent production value coming from Studio DEEN.The only things that are certain are death and taxes...huh. Sanka Rea begs to differ... dash of love triangle romance and deep character development of most of the core cast and we have Sankarea.Sankarea is by this front a more character focused plot than a narratively focused anime but the development of the core cast is what LA call one of the best strength of Sankarea, tie that in to it\'s thematic core of freedom and the ""different kinds"" and the plot as somewhat laxxed as it is, packs ALOT of it in.For characters, let\'s start with Rea, she\'s the typical ojou rich girl however is completely restricted and obeys every word her father tells her, but she longs to be ""normal"" and would kill herself in order to do so, once she becomes a zombie, she by all reasoning is ""reborn"" and wants to experience being a normal girl but her father obviously bars that mainly through Chihiro, you really do feel for Rea and she is something of subversion of the ojou archetype in a ways of wanting to be normal. Chihiro is a zombie fanatic, thinking nothing but zombies and wouldn\'t mind having a zombie girlfriend, he gets his wish but at the cost of Rea well being in the process. As much as LA thinks he gets the least change of the cast, his development in moving away from zombies into caring for someone, something he\'s never done is development to say the least and how his ""wish"" though granted is something is slowly finds ironic. Ranko Saouji voiced by Sayuri Yahagi is Chihiro\'s cousin and our third wheel to our love triangle, YUP we have kissing cousins trope with Ranko and the thing is, LA actually finds Ranko also a good character even with this trope in place, sure she\'s the childhood friend to Rea\'s maniac pixie girl but childhood friend trope has their backstory that Chihiro and Ranko has together and by all reasoning as much as LA doesn\'t like the kissing cousins trope with her, LA was rooting for her yeah...dumbfounded LA. Next we have what LA deems the most irredeemable character in the series, Rea\'s father, Danichirou voiced by Unshou Ishizuka, why?, well him being the strict father is nothing, for what\'s it worth, he made everyone around him suffer for his own delusional grandeur to the point of wanting to preserve Rea and by extension his wife\'s memory and purity by taking naked pictures of Rea every year like what the fuck, add to that his control over Rea and his utter dismissal of Aria that once Aria got her backstory about how she met Danichirou and the backstory tried to sympathize with Danichirou, LA felt more sorry about ARIA than Danichirou and Aria plays off the ""wicked stepmother"" trope!. As much as the finale loosened Danichrou up, LA just can\'t ignore Danchirou\'s delusional sense of freedom and grandeur over his own daughter...just...creepy as hell. With that who was LA\'s favourite character?...Mero voiced by Yuka Iguchi, yup Chihiro\'s little sister and no LA isn\'t a siscon with this pick, as both Rea and Ranko were pretty even with their love triangle thus couldn\'t pick either, LA went with the most chill character of the cast thus leading LA to Mero and she\'s something of deadpan comedic relief and that was enough for LA!Sankarea does take the zombie thing in a playful but realistic in a sense of what happened if you have a zombie girlfriend, everything from Rea getting rigor mortis to some of the lore as to how Rea became a zombie and using that to help Rea normalize herself in being a zombie and of course comes her notion of eating and the such, but Sankarea\'s depth of world building of zombies doesn\'t dive too deep and focuses more on it\'s characters more.Freedom itself is a fickle thing, it\'s something you want but what happens once you do?, be happy to do what you want at some point you will either restrict others with your newfound freedom like Danichirou or let things run it\'s course like Chihiro, if anything Rea is a manifestation and symbolism of freedom and funny how ""death"" is her way into freedom, huh the ""only things that are certain are death and taxes"" right?. Chihiro does touch on the subject of freedom but the thematic weight goes more to Rea, Chihiro more or less goes into what happens if your wish was granted and it both changes you as a person but that you lose that want once you obtained it. Sankarea may be a love triangle romantic comedy with zombies in it, but Sankarea\'s thematic significance is solid and explores it in earnest.In terms of animation done by Studio DEEN, well from the character designs and backgrounding is decent enough from Studio DEEN, especially with the colorful palette of the characters, but something LA noticed is of the transitioning of the anime and the odd quirks it has at times, i wasn\'t until LA looked the director, Shinichi Omata that it clicked, as Shinichi was Episode and Storyboard Directors for Arakawa Under the Bridge, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko and Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica that it was clear that Sankarea\'s direction has SHAFT influence towards it and all the more for it for the animation to moderately have that flair that SHAFT is well known for, really Shinichi\'s SHAFT touch was actually used well is what LA is getting at.For voice acting, LA was pleased with many of the voice cast from Maaya Uchida, Sayuri Yahagi, Yuka Iguchi, Ryohei Kimura and as much as LA hated the character, Unshou Ishizuka as Danichirou.

A boy who loves zombies tries to bring his dead cat back to life, but ends up creating an actual zombie girl.This anime had quite a few funny moments in it, and it did also touch on some dark serious themes, but it wasn\'t enough to distract me from all the plot holes. One of the most confusing things about this series is the fact that Chihiro appears to be a neko since he has cat ears, and occasionally makes a ""Nyaa"" noise. But nobody ever mentions it or points it out, and none of...his relatives have cat ears.Other confusing points centre around Rea being a zombie. Shortly after she becomes a zombie a certain problem arises but simply rectifies itself without any explanation. It\'s also ambiguous about whether Chihiro\'s family know she\'s a zombie or not. Sometimes they directly refer to her as a zombie, implying Chihiro has told them and there\'s no secret. But then at other times Chihiro seems to be desperately trying to cover up her odd behaviour as if they don\'t know. His cousin is called Ranko yet he refers to her as Wanko which is never explained either.The ending is incredibly dissatisfying. To put it simply, there is no ending. The last episode leaves everything open with no solutions or answers. There\'s also a new character introduced in the very last scene but who remains nameless and we have no idea who she is. Presumably they hope a teaser of a new character would be enough to secure a second series. But since there is no second series this is just incredibly annoying.Rea is an okay kind of character but there\'s nothing particularly interesting about her.

He's into zombies for another reason, to date one?Story (6/10) - Aside from a few fan-service aspects and scenes, it's hard to believe that this series falls under the Ecchi category.

how a Zombie would live in human society.The story begins with Chihiro Furuya who has a weird fetish for zombies, then suddenly one day he meets a girl called Rea Sanka who ends up dying so Chihiro uses an ancient potion to bring her back as a zombie.What I really like about the story for this anime is that it doesn\'t rely on killing zombies to keep you entertained instead it decides to create one zombie...and see how they live within human society, what I also like with the story is that it really goes deep into the physiology of zombies like how long they can last before the skin rots away, how sunlight affects them, what they can consume that isn\'t human flesh and a few other things, it was really interesting seeing how Rea would live her life as a zombie after her unfortunate accident and it really centres on the topic of whether you can live a fun life after you have died.This series can also be really dark too because Rea doesn\'t have the happiest of childhoods in fact it\'s downright creepy what her father uses her for and there are moments where Rea does slip into the actual zombie state we all know.The one thing I have against the story is of course the cliffhanger since we may never get another season and the filler episodes, they weren\'t bad they just dragged me out of the story.The characters were mostly good, they were funny a lot of the time and had a bunch of serious interactions too.Chihiro who is the male MC is a strange guy who has weird fetish for zombies and is very socially awkward, but he can be a good guy and does care for Rea\'s well being when she becomes a zombie and tries his best to try and preserve her body from rotting away.Rea is the female MC and is the one who becomes a zombie, she is a very sweet person and yearns to have a fun life which as a zombie believes this can finally happen since her family were very strict, the relationship between her and Chihiro is odd, but adorable at times because they work well together and always look out for each other.Ranko is Chihiro\'s cousin and is a bit annoying since she has a crush on Chihiro and she isn\'t always annoying, but she mostly interrupts good moments between Chihiro and Rea, she\'s a tomboy like person and is also very protective of Chihiro since he is no good at protecting himself.Mero is Chihiro\'s sister and is a very monotone person, but she can be funny even if you can\'t tell with her tone and she has club with her friends where they try and look for extraterrestrial stuff which always turns up empty.Baabu Chihiro\'s cat is a loveable runt who is also a zombie and becomes close friends with Rea.There is also Rea\'s parents and they are pretty messed up since Rea\'s father took pictures of Rea naked in a weird setup on her birthday every year and this just solidifies how creepy he is and Rea\'s mother or second mother Aria is someone who is desperate for ""cough"" sex ""cough"" and she is a pretty sly bitch.The artstyle was good you could see the changes in Rea\'s body as a zombie and you can see the composition as her body is starting rot away, Rea\'s death was also pretty graphic you could see her guts hanging out and there was certainly a lot of moments where there was a dark, gloomy effect.There are certainly funny moments and I\'m not sure if this should be counted as a horror although Rea\'s father fits the bill nicely there and maybe the moments when Baabu and Rea slip into their zombie moments would be counted as horror moments too, there are some moments that were pretty intense like when Chihiro faced Rea\'s father or when Rea had to fight off some of her fathers goons.I liked the relationship that built up between Chihiro and Rea because considering Chihiro likes zombie girls he does consider the human side of Rea and takes that into note whereas Rea takes note of how much Chihiro is protecting her and is willing to find a way to preserve her body.Overall this is a fun take on the zombie genre and is something a little different from the usual kill every zombie you see show so if you\'re looking for a guy who has a weird zombie fetish who ends up with a zombie girl then this is certainly

I'm sure that Chihiro Furuya has, your typically normal high school teen who has an obsession for anything zombie related.  He also has a thing for zombie girls and has always wanted to date one.  After meeting Rea Sanko, the typical cute and popular girl at Sanka Academy, he just might get his wish after Rea dies and comes back to life as a member of the living dead.After watching the series I found that I was thoroughly entertained by the unique and...simple plot that anyone could follow.  Something that caught my attention were the many twist and turns through out the show.  I personally love a good suspenseful mystery, and with Chihiro doing his best to deal with the situations presented to him with what little knowledge he has about non fictional zombies, it personally kept me on the edge of my seat.I found that the character development was pretty well written.  Chiriho is lazy, nerdy, and anti social.  But after the death of Rea he has come to realize that he has a responsibility,to do his best in taking care of this girl.  Rea, being the daughter of a rich family never had the right or privilege to do the same things that normal girls do.  After her tragic death she is given the true freedom she desires and does her best to come to terms with her feelings for Chiriho, considering she has never had a boyfriend.The only draw back to this amazing anime series is that the very last episode is left on a cliff hanger.  Due to the ending, you are forced to read the manga to get the full story.  I felt like I was kind of cheap shot, having to force myself to read the manga.  Though I do admit that I binged read the entire thing in one day.  Once I reached the end of the story I was satisfied at the development of story and characters, but sense this is also a romance story, the ending wasn't really what I expected.If your looking for a funny romantic and horrific time, than Sankarea is the anime for you.  Especially if you don't mind reading the manga to get the full details.  That being said, if your the type of person that does not approve of a happy yet sad ending than get your anger medication ready.

This one's a bit more twisted and maybe a little psychological.Story: I loved the story. Romance with a zombie sounds kind of silly but the way the story was told was quite interesting. With just one season (14 episodes in total if you watch the Special and OVA), the characters all get a lot of development.Art: The art is pretty nice for this series, especially the way Rea is drawn. She just looks so beautiful!Sound: There's nothing outstanding about the sound. Nothing...bad either, so that's good.Characters: Like I said before, the characters are all pretty interesting. I found myself hating one in particular for likely the same reasons you will... But really, each character the story focuses on are given a good bit of plot and development.I enjoyed it! It's different from your typical romance or comedy anime. The only regret is that there are obviously no plans for a second season, despite there being sufficient manga content.

I won’t really go into the elements where the plot is lacking. You can see all that by skimming some of the other reviews. No, my main argument in this review to keep you away from this review is that...the main male character, Furiya, is drawn with a hair style that looks like cat ears, and it looks pretty fucking hideous. In the show, he’s basically an ungrateful and overall useless piece of shit with no redeemable qualities but to compound that by looking as stupid as he does is just too much.The plot goes absolutely nowhere, and the character development is also pretty much non existent. The zombie girl doesn’t experience the freedom of being out of her father’s grasp because she’s now chained by having to preserve her body from decay and the loner,  zombie obsessed freak boy acts like a douche to the zombie girl who actually likes him for some reason. Some might say the father of the zombie or cousin might important characters but in reality after the first episode no one else matters.

There were some things that were a bit questionable, but not enough that it really ruined the show for me. I would mainly recommend this show to any guy or girl interested in seeing the love story (mainly from a male perspective) of a zombie obsessed teen boy and, well, a zombie.PLOT: 6 | FairThe plot wasn't amazing, it was fairly simple, mainly just to live out the fantasies of a teenage boy who loves zombies. For a love story, I will give it credit...for being a bit more of a unique one. If it weren't for Rea's deep back story and the character depth we get to see within her family, I don't think this show would have been that great. I think the bits of backstory for characters helped the show. Not to mention, the fan service really was thrown in there quite a bit, so if you're into that then this is for you. Personally, I found it unnecessary--especially at times when things could have been very serious moments.ART: 7 | GoodThe art was cute. It was like your average modern-day anime art style. I think Chihiro's art style was a bit different from the rest, and I honestly still question why the heck he looks like a human cat?

It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't the worst either. I'd recommend this to any guy who wants a romance anime with fan service, lol.ADDITIONAL NOTES:I thought the English dub for this was amazing, though! Great voice actors for Chihiro and Ranko especially. for being a bit more of a unique one. If it weren't for Rea's deep back story and the character depth we get to see within her family, I don't think this show would have been that great. I think the bits of backstory for characters helped the show. Not to mention, the fan service really was thrown in there quite a bit, so if you're into that then this is for you. Personally, I found it unnecessary--especially at times when things could have been very serious moments.ART: 7 | GoodThe art was cute. It was like your average modern-day anime art style.

This anime wanted to make a Rom- Com, supernatural anime but instead made a poorly executed anime in general. The plot was just awful, it's base on a daughter obess weirdo as her father which was pretty much the entire anime. The MC was just clinche i can't even remember his name even though i just finish the series. They tried to put the comedic effect on him omg worst mistake ever. Not only that he was bland but also dumb and oblivious. Ngl i wish...the fun side character was the main.

There are plenty of interesting and satisfying twists, and the story flows nicely throughout. I always prefer to start watching a series before getting too deep in the reviews, but here are some spoiler free remarks:The characters, while the actions some of them partake in are morally questionable, stand out as independently complex within their world, something not all works of fiction manage to accomplish. Although perhaps the characters being ""morally questionable"" is an understatement. This anime covers some pretty ugly concepts, and the art itself carries plenty of...sexualization. Wholesome is not a word that should be used to describe this show.There is, however, plenty of depth in some of the broader concepts found in the show. The problems of the characters are blown up, exaggerated, to bring some deeper themes up to the surface. This, in my opinion, was one of the best successes of the anime. For example: Is freedom worth dying for? It takes a few episodes, 3-4 really, for the show to settle in, for it to become apparent the type of show you\'re watching. Romance specifically only ever remains superficial, so don\'t expect much there. As an additional heads up, supernatural is not off the table.The music is nice and thematically fitting, and add substance to the vibes. The opening and ending sequences are also well done.The art has this sketchbook-esque feel, quite typical of a Studio Deen production. This may be a cause for concern, since their art seemingly ranges from a grade school doodle to, at its best, the character designs of KonoSuba. However the art of Sankarea was surprisingly refreshing. It was clean and simple, with plenty of odd angle shots almost reminiscent of a Shaft anime. There were a few jarring moments involving the layering of the background, but at the very least it keeps up with its time period. The art is definitely one of this show\'s strengths.The plot has plenty of complexity, and at many points seems to hint towards tragedy, but as a stand-alone series lacks such power in its conclusion. There\'s a well-done climax, and the plot progresses nicely. It\'s always disappointing to finish a show only to realize it\'s been abandoned. Here\'s how I believe Sankarea works and doesn\'t work as a stand-alone series:In fiction if a question is raised within the story it has to be answered, and, as an unfinished adaptation of the manga, it fails to do that. It does raise and answer plenty of them, enough to where the story itself can be appreciated, but many go unanswered simply because the source material keeps going. There aren\'t exactly any major plot holes, but plenty unfinished business. There is some sense of a conclusion within the anime, but to experience this as a stand-alone series, instead of tying up all the loose ends of the plot it sheds off most of its branches. In terms of plot, the anime ends up complete but imperfect. If a powerful ending is what you\'re looking for in this anime, you will have no such luck. Luckily the manga is finished now, so if you do finish this, you can always look there next.Overall, I think this show is worth a watch. There is no other anime quite like it.

Runs away from home, is chased down by her father but ina tussle with abuser daddy she falls to her death and is reborn a zombie.Then imagine this...same ABUSED, PEDOPHILED child being used by the animator in multiple fan service ecchi shower scenes full front and back nude shots as well as the usual bouncing breasts, panty peeks, and typical fan service muck.And then add the worst most pathetic ending known to man.  The writer didnt even have the guts to kill off the pedophile father.  No he flies off into the sunset.JESUS, at LEAST have the zombie daughter rip and tear the throat out of her pedophile father for GODS sake.I honestly feel gross that i watched this to the end but i sooooo wanted to see the dad get ripped apart or burned alive or something.

She then licks his wounds and is revived as a zombie by her magic saliva (you learn Rea’s magic saliva in the show) and they go off as two zombies into the sunset.NOPE NOPE.  SORRY.

But YOU dont have to because youve BEEN WARNED.', 'Sankarea is your stereotypical ecchi comedy with a very bold and weird premise.- The boys in the series go to males-only school and are constantly horny by the other side of the river, which has a prestige girls-only school. This alone can make the viewer feel how desperate for sex they are, although I don’t see why they can’t go have some fun with them after the school is over.- The protagonist, whose hair for the lulz makes him look like he has cat ears, doesn’t care about all that because he is content at masturbating (out of screen) while watching zombie horror movies. As...if that wasn’t enough, he has this hot cousin named Wanker (Ranko actually, but it does sound similar) having the hots for him and constantly doing ecchi foreplay by bringing him even more zombie movies to keep masturbating (out of screen) as well as not to miss the chance to make him horny with her body. Very healthy; how considerate of her. Not that he seems to give a damn about her, since she is not a corpse.- So the protagonist’s cat dies and he decides to raise the dead, since it sounds like a very arousing thing to do. He finds there Rea, the hottest girl from the prestige school, who is fed up with her life as a role model, as well as her father taking nude pictures of her and scaring away all her friends. She agrees to let him kill her as means to get rid of her misery. As a reward for turning her into a zombie he can do all sorts of necrophilia-related deviant things with her.As interesting as all this mess sounds, it is not much of a good show by miles.- The first hint to that is the animation studio, which is none other than DEEN, notorious for trashing the adaptations of whatever it gets its hands on with poor production values and pathetic directing that cares only about fan service. I can’t say anything about the director by the way, since this is his first full anime work. Prior to that he only did a few scattered episodes here and there, and none where exactly quality material. In this particular case, they tried a bit more though; so at least it doesn’t look horrible and even has a few artistic overtones in it. It uses stylized backgrounds from time to time and makes good use of lightning effects to make dark places to be unsettling. Now don’t imagine it is awesome in production values; they are simply far better than what the studio usually does. I can say something similar for the soundtrack, which is easy going (and thus completely unimpressive) J-pop you will forget ten seconds after the music stops.- The premise of the show ends up being its biggest setback. Although the hook of the show is zombies and fan service, something which seems to work all the time in luring in the casual viewer just by curiosity alone, it is still nothing more than shallow dumb fun in the likes of Highschool of the Dead or Kore Wa Zombie Desuka? . It tries at times to offer some depth by including heavy and unsettling themes, such as horror (boogie-boogie, dark places and necromancy), social drama (the unbearable pressure of social demands that may lead teenagers to deviant fetishes and suicide), and incestuous love (hurr-durr, I take nude pictures of my little daughter, hurr-durr, I rub my boobs on my cousin’s face). But it never happens in a serious manner and all those issues are nothing but a generator for erotic situations. Meaning, despite the seemingly interesting premise, the show is still mostly a dumb ecchi harem. And of course despite the really bold image it gives you at first, it is doing nothing but patting your crotch with several hentai premises which of course never head anywhere because this is not a hentai show. Seriously, do not go in expecting something amazing to happen because you will be greatly disappointed with how little they did with all that and used them as nothing but tired softporn.So you basically get this constant cocktease where:- On one side Wanker is constantly trying to go incest with a blunt harem lead. She is the typical dumb blond with a hot body that likes her cousin for no apparent reason other than keeping her company. Get real bitch! And go look for a guy that doesn’t live in the same neighbourhood you do.- On the other side you get Rea, constantly being moe and naked and defenceless for him to do all he likes with her. Ever heard of a moe zombie? Here it is, conveniently getting stiff so you can throw her naked without complaints in your closet. And she doesn’t even act like a zombie to begin with, since all she does is not trying to eat brains but sucking on Wanker’s boobs and catboy’s tongue for the lulz. She also doesn’t eat, drink, or go to the toilet; she costs nothing to maintain her and thus is the ideal sex doll all otakus dream of having. But at the same time, what if anyone else tries to do something she doesn’t like? She then gets all powerful and kicks ass and then runs to cry in the lap of her useless boyfriend, as if he protected her by doing absolutely nothing. How convenient.- And of course there are also the parents of Rea, who are completely messed up. One is an incestuous sadist and the other is a drunkard slut.- Yeah, sounds dumb enough to keep watching and does feel interesting if you don’t try to see it seriously. But just like all DEEN shows it is mostly fan service. Despite at the attempts of the show to flesh out Ranko and Rea, they are still presented as nothing more than half-naked horny sluts after a boy with no redeeming qualities. I mean everybody is constantly admitting that he has absolutely no talent and is a deviant pervert on top of everything else, yet they still like him for not much of a reason. Trying to cater too much the pervert audience, are we? And as I said, do not expect any sexy developments to the above spicy relationships. Nothing really progresses because they are either constantly interrupted by random people passing by them or turn completely chicken to go for the real thing.And even if one could accept all the retarded fan service as part of the story and still try to enjoy it, this still does not save the show from having inconsistent character reactions considering their sexuality. It’s as if the show deliberately makes them turn from horny beasts to cowards when the time has come, just for the sake of not turning the whole show into a messy hentai.- The protagonist went to all the trouble of getting a hot zombie girlfriend and has another hot live one in reserve, both of which are willing to do anything he likes with them. And yet he is doing nothing; thus rendering the whole premise useless. He couldn’t wait for that moment when he would have his own zombie chick, he even had wet dreams about it, and now that they are at his lap, he goes all shy and gentle? This is a complete character rewrite! He also does nothing in the whole show. Seriously, the chicks get all the focus and he is just there as the passive observer for us to identify, like deviant stalkers who film and peek and masturbate at teen girls but never actually trying to go for the real thing. The epitome of NEET mentality modern anime strive for as means to cater the main audience; boy I hate that. He is also weak and stupid, so again he has no redeeming qualities even if you don’t try to identify with him and instead seem him as an individual personality.- The two chicks are doing something similar. At first they have no qualms to be naked and outgoing with him but as soon as they come closer to the actual thing, out of nowhere they start to feel embarrassed and scared. This is a lame excuse of a cock-blocker! Also, seriously, Rea’s plan was to become a normal girl by turning to a zombie??? Are we efing kidding here?- Rea’s parents are also such contrived element in the story. They are supposed to be there for some drama and sick romance but they are completely underplayed since by the time you get to know more about them, the story is almost over and they just go away like nothing much happened.- Furthermore that resurrected cat Babu is more than obviously the only thing that progresses the actual plot. Everybody is running after it and do or learn stuff just because of that cat conveniently pointing them at stuff. It gets annoying to see them not having free will to do anything on their own or the knowledge to figure out something without the scriptwriter continually using that cat as a plot devise for that. It is a cat, ok? It is an animal mascot, it shouldn’t be doing more things plot-wise than the supposed human-intelligent protagonists. It only makes them feel stupid and useless.Seriously, you are not going to be watching this for the plot. And this rather disappointing, since unlike most ecchi shows I really like the premise in this one and I can imagine several interesting arcs coming out of it. Yet I get nothing since the fan service is there all the time, jumping in the spotlight and kicking to the side any attempts to make something intellectual out of it. And yes, I say intellectual since this is the only way a show won’t be forgotten a month after it is completed. No matter how outrageously hilarious the premise sounds, if they go completely GAGA with it, you will forget it very fast or won’t like it for long altogether. And this is the case with Sankarea. If you really think about it, almost half of the show was filler, since it was wasted on the hot cousin, the oblivious family of the protagonist, and the sick family of Rea. They weren’t even important to the longrun, since the core theme was about “what to do with a zombie” and not random incest side stories. Unless of course random softporn scenes count as important to you.Thus you get an interesting premise that is ruined by too much fan catering. I once again blame DEEN for that.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 8/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks nice)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (basic but fitting with the feeling of the series)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 2/2 (artsy)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (typical)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 5/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 1/2 (erratic)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 3/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (low because of too little plot)Memorability 2/4 (the zombie premise is interesting but other than that nothing much to care for)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Art 1/1 (looks ok)Sound 0/2 (sounds boring)Story 1/3 (good concept but barely exploited properly)Characters 0/4 (softporn stereotypes)VERDICT: 5/10 if that wasn’t enough, he has this hot cousin named Wanker (Ranko actually, but it does sound similar) having the hots for him and constantly doing ecchi foreplay by bringing him even more zombie movies to keep masturbating (out of screen) as well as not to miss the chance to make him horny with her body.

In this particular case, they tried a bit more though; so at least it doesn’t look horrible and even has a few artistic overtones in it. It uses stylized backgrounds from time to time and makes good use of lightning effects to make dark places to be unsettling. Now don’t imagine it is awesome in production values; they are simply far better than what the studio usually does. I can say something similar for the soundtrack, which is easy going (and thus completely unimpressive) J-pop you will forget ten seconds after the music stops.- The premise of the show ends up being its biggest setback. Although the hook of the show is zombies and fan service, something which seems to work all the time in luring in the casual viewer just by curiosity alone, it is still nothing more than shallow dumb fun in the likes of Highschool of the Dead or Kore Wa Zombie Desuka? . It tries at times to offer some depth by including heavy and unsettling themes, such as horror (boogie-boogie, dark places and necromancy), social drama (the unbearable pressure of social demands that may lead teenagers to deviant fetishes and suicide), and incestuous love (hurr-durr, I take nude pictures of my little daughter, hurr-durr, I rub my boobs on my cousin’s face). But it never happens in a serious manner and all those issues are nothing but a generator for erotic situations. Meaning, despite the seemingly interesting premise, the show is still mostly a dumb ecchi harem. And of course despite the really bold image it gives you at first, it is doing nothing but patting your crotch with several hentai premises which of course never head anywhere because this is not a hentai show. Seriously, do not go in expecting something amazing to happen because you will be greatly disappointed with how little they did with all that and used them as nothing but tired softporn.So you basically get this constant cocktease where:- On one side Wanker is constantly trying to go incest with a blunt harem lead. She is the typical dumb blond with a hot body that likes her cousin for no apparent reason other than keeping her company. Get real bitch! And go look for a guy that doesn’t live in the same neighbourhood you do.- On the other side you get Rea, constantly being moe and naked and defenceless for him to do all he likes with her. Ever heard of a moe zombie? Here it is, conveniently getting stiff so you can throw her naked without complaints in your closet. And she doesn’t even act like a zombie to begin with, since all she does is not trying to eat brains but sucking on Wanker’s boobs and catboy’s tongue for the lulz. She also doesn’t eat, drink, or go to the toilet; she costs nothing to maintain her and thus is the ideal sex doll all otakus dream of having. But at the same time, what if anyone else tries to do something she doesn’t like? She then gets all powerful and kicks ass and then runs to cry in the lap of her useless boyfriend, as if he protected her by doing absolutely nothing. How convenient.- And of course there are also the parents of Rea, who are completely messed up. One is an incestuous sadist and the other is a drunkard slut.- Yeah, sounds dumb enough to keep watching and does feel interesting if you don’t try to see it seriously. But just like all DEEN shows it is mostly fan service. Despite at the attempts of the show to flesh out Ranko and Rea, they are still presented as nothing more than half-naked horny sluts after a boy with no redeeming qualities. I mean everybody is constantly admitting that he has absolutely no talent and is a deviant pervert on top of everything else, yet they still like him for not much of a reason. Trying to cater too much the pervert audience, are we? And as I said, do not expect any sexy developments to the above spicy relationships. Nothing really progresses because they are either constantly interrupted by random people passing by them or turn completely chicken to go for the real thing.And even if one could accept all the retarded fan service as part of the story and still try to enjoy it, this still does not save the show from having inconsistent character reactions considering their sexuality. It’s as if the show deliberately makes them turn from horny beasts to cowards when the time has come, just for the sake of not turning the whole show into a messy hentai.- The protagonist went to all the trouble of getting a hot zombie girlfriend and has another hot live one in reserve, both of which are willing to do anything he likes with them. And yet he is doing nothing; thus rendering the whole premise useless. He couldn’t wait for that moment when he would have his own zombie chick, he even had wet dreams about it, and now that they are at his lap, he goes all shy and gentle? This is a complete character rewrite! He also does nothing in the whole show. Seriously, the chicks get all the focus and he is just there as the passive observer for us to identify, like deviant stalkers who film and peek and masturbate at teen girls but never actually trying to go for the real thing. The epitome of NEET mentality modern anime strive for as means to cater the main audience; boy I hate that. He is also weak and stupid, so again he has no redeeming qualities even if you don’t try to identify with him and instead seem him as an individual personality.- The two chicks are doing something similar. At first they have no qualms to be naked and outgoing with him but as soon as they come closer to the actual thing, out of nowhere they start to feel embarrassed and scared. This is a lame excuse of a cock-blocker! Also, seriously, Rea’s plan was to become a normal girl by turning to a zombie??? Are we efing kidding here?- Rea’s parents are also such contrived element in the story. They are supposed to be there for some drama and sick romance but they are completely underplayed since by the time you get to know more about them, the story is almost over and they just go away like nothing much happened.- Furthermore that resurrected cat Babu is more than obviously the only thing that progresses the actual plot. Everybody is running after it and do or learn stuff just because of that cat conveniently pointing them at stuff. It gets annoying to see them not having free will to do anything on their own or the knowledge to figure out something without the scriptwriter continually using that cat as a plot devise for that. It is a cat, ok? It is an animal mascot, it shouldn’t be doing more things plot-wise than the supposed human-intelligent protagonists. It only makes them feel stupid and useless.Seriously, you are not going to be watching this for the plot. And this rather disappointing, since unlike most ecchi shows I really like the premise in this one and I can imagine several interesting arcs coming out of it. Yet I get nothing since the fan service is there all the time, jumping in the spotlight and kicking to the side any attempts to make something intellectual out of it. And yes, I say intellectual since this is the only way a show won’t be forgotten a month after it is completed. No matter how outrageously hilarious the premise sounds, if they go completely GAGA with it, you will forget it very fast or won’t like it for long altogether. And this is the case with Sankarea. If you really think about it, almost half of the show was filler, since it was wasted on the hot cousin, the oblivious family of the protagonist, and the sick family of Rea. They weren’t even important to the longrun, since the core theme was about “what to do with a zombie” and not random incest side stories. Unless of course random softporn scenes count as important to you.Thus you get an interesting premise that is ruined by too much fan catering. I once again blame DEEN for that.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 8/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks nice)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (basic but fitting with the feeling of the series)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 2/2 (artsy)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (typical)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 5/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 1/2 (erratic)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 3/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (low because of too little plot)Memorability 2/4 (the zombie premise is interesting but other than that nothing much to care for)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Art 1/1 (looks ok)Sound 0/2 (sounds boring)Story 1/3 (good concept but barely exploited properly)Characters 0/4 (softporn stereotypes)VERDICT: 5/10', ""so this is an anime with a very stupid plot but it does write a decent storytelling into a ecchi/slice of life i think i does tell a story look at other ecchi anime eromanga sensei , kanokon those may have stories but the don't have the wider story of sankarea the characters are ok but i do think i underestimated this anime its enjoyable to the point that i wanted a second season im going to try my best not to try and spoil the story but its about a girl whos dealing with suicidal thoughts because of here father and theres a boy...whos obsessed with zombie girls they meet in a graveyardx trying to ressurect the boys cat and they become everlasting friend or foreverlasting friends8/10 whos obsessed with zombie girls they meet in a graveyardx trying to ressurect the boys cat and they become everlasting friend or foreverlasting friends8/10"", ""Imagine your ideally prefect girlfriend in Sankarae: Undying Love Zombie girl anime which is very fantastic and awesome and somehow Rea didn't  rotten fast like the zombie in dead body. However, this anime kind portray romantic between Furuya(male main character) and Rea (female main zombie girl) almost like a Westen movie call Warm Bodies more slightly unrealistic which the ending is  from zombie to human. Sankarae is kidda like quite okay anime. But for me Anime did cover story of supporting character, that is quite decent.Story is not bad I guess definitely must have crazy father like Dan'ichirō love too much of...her story reminding of her death mother by taking nude photo of Rea almost all the time, even though her father told once a year during her birthday, then turn tragically into zombie.I like the best character is Wanko female girl which is Furaya's counsin, she really like to tease and make laugh of Furaya and she also fall in love with Furaya. If the anime wanna portray more Romantic between Rea and Furuya, perhaps can be more deep and doing some kind of beautiful scene.Sound is kidda okay but not too deep.There are flaws in this anime like I feel is it unfinished romantic anime and didn't portray much love scene, Wanko is more too outstanding female character compare to Rea, try to make Rea more better female unforgettable zombie girl.  Jogoro is like a very small unimportant old man told the secret of revive zombie, hope they make the old man better character and not some cheap looking amnesia small guy.Overall, if you are fan of zombie girl or wanna watch nice a while anime, Sankarea is your choice but perhaps you watch on one time might forget about it.

Although it\'s not for everyone, for me, it was a heartwarming and heartbreaking experience. To others, it can be considered boring and slow-paced but fast-paced at the same time. Sometimes it focused on the romance, and other times the plot. But nonetheless, it\'s an anime that\'s supposed to leave you hanging. The OP and Chihiro\'s obsession with zombies were my favorite things above all. I really liked the way Rea couldn\'t escape from her demise as a zombie, and how Babu told the story in the Special.Characters: 9/10The characters were placed greatly. I liked Chihiro\'s sister and how their father...looked plain, but was actually one of the good characters in the show. Rea\'s father was shown as a weirdo who only loved his daughter because his lover died. He did take nude photos of her and constantly ruined her life by taking her friends away from her. Not to mention, he also blocked the outside world.But the last time we see him, he accepts Rea\'s and Chihiro\'s relationship for the sake of protecting her. He leaves them alone because he notices that he\'ll never get his daughter to see him the way a daughter sees her father. There\'s no justification for his actions, but at least he understood that he never knew Rea, only his love for her mother.Chihiro, overall, was my favorite character in the show. He\'s really cute and I liked his hair more than anything. His obsession for zombies isn\'t much of an obsession, but more of a liking for them. The way they showed that even though Rea was a zombie, he didn\'t love her for just that. He was lazy and undependable in the start, but as he had his own things to take care of, he couldn\'t lay around like he used to. His family noticed this change and was happy for him. That\'s what I liked about his family the most. They had character and weren\'t all that boring.Ranko wasn\'t a pleasant experience. She liked her cousin and he didn\'t like her back. Their backstory was cute and the way they didn\'t make her an obvious tsundere really helped me watch the show.. From the comments I\'ve seen, (on the site I\'m watching the show on,) they didn\'t like her. But she doesn\'t just love him for the sake of the story, I think.I believed she was a good character too. Her personality was slightly worse than the others, but she noticed his love for zombies, and even though she was scared of them when she was younger, throughout the show you see her ask for more of zombies movies.She likes him, but it\'s forceful and at the same time, it\'s soft and subtle to the point where it\'s just plain cute. She wasn\'t careless or reckless with jealousy, just a slight distaste. She was calm when she told Rea they would be fighting for his love if they both wanted to be with him. I liked that about her. Ranko never really troubled me because of her understanding.Plot: 7/10Like I said, the plot disappears and allows romance, and then pushes romance out and starts the plot again. It\'s on and off. I would\'ve rated it a 5 if the plot wasn\'t in the least interesting. But the plot stayed wowing and confusing at the same time. The mom disappearing and the kids not having much memory of her were only touched briefly. I would\'ve liked more info on the topic.The OVA where they showed how Chihiro found the book made a bit of sense. You know, I was wondering where he got it from. How he got the page messed up, and what it said on the page. They never showed us what it said, but I bet it had something to do with preserving the zombie body.The special where they just showed that Rea\'s and Chihiro\'s relationship won\'t last because of Rea being a zombie and her body slowly decaying. Chihiro never really told her all the information she needed because if she knew, then she would never feel like a normal girl.Chihiro stresses over taking care of her and wants her to be happy. Their relationship is cute, but vague.Romance 6.5/10The romance wasn\'t big because it wasn\'t that much to scream over. I said romance pushed out the plot to let themselves in, but I want to say that there\'s not much romance at all. There\'s blushing, Ranko crushing over Chihiro but never making the right moves and therefore always a step back from getting him, Rea being the frail, confused girl she is and liking Chihiro but allowing and even saying she\'ll let Ranko have him because Ranko has known him for the longest, and there\'s Chihiro who is shown to like Rea, and feel the need to protect her.But when we talk about romance, this is it, right? I expected hand-holding, pure kissing and confessions. However, I also didn\'t know why I expected that. This is a story about how a guy who likes zombies more than he should tries to revive his dead cat with a book that looks old. In the mist of that, he meets a girl who has a father that likes her more than he should that also takes naked photos of her on her birthday. They meet while this same girl is screaming out her troubles and cries in a well. She was sheltered and dense like a rock.This girl takes interest in what the guy is doing, and asks him to revive her once she dies too. But once she does die, and once she is revived, we start the story of two people who love each other, but will have to say goodbye sooner or later. A love confession would be cute, but this story is better leaving off sad than happy. There was no crying or wailing, just them walking together both knowing that they would never be together the way they want to. And therefore there was no kiss, no ""I love you in that way"", just them having different desires and wanting a different outcome.Angst(Depressing stuff): 8.7/10I won\'t say much. But this was amazing to a certain extent. I liked the way they showed Rea\'s fake mother, and how she really wanted one drop of love from the person who married her just to use her. The person who never paid attention to her and instead liked his daughter in a nasty way one should never feel towards their daughter.This ""fake mother"" was disgusted by him liking and wanting his daughter, but she kept on acting badly towards Rea, just because she wanted to blame this all on her.The special made me realize that maybe she never loved Rea\'s father all that much, but still felt distaste at the fact that she lost to someone like Rea. I don\'t know all that much about her, but the special showed us that she stopped bullying Rea, that she stopped trying to get attention from her husband because she realized there was no point.The mother was a beautiful woman.Overall, 10/10.Everything was a half and half masterpiece. No, it wasn\'t the best, and it certainly wasn\'t the worst, but for me, I\'ll love this anime for years to come because it changed the way I look at things. Like I said, it\'s not for everyone, but try it, and if you don\'t like it, then spit back out and go on about your day. looked plain, but was actually one of the good characters in the show.

The story, although addictive and cute, had too many faults pile up, inevitably leading it to become a jumbled mess.Yes, this is an Ecchi, but the fan service did intervene with the plot an annoying amount, similar to what happened in Fire Force. There were some crucial, serious moments that were constructed, and then suddenly torn down, induced by the change of tone fan service brings. For example, when Rea didn\'t know she needed to eat the hydrangea leaves and started going rogue, the licking scene was totally unnecessary and unfitting of what was going on. Ranko\'s relationship with Furuya was uncomfortable, and when she called him her ""brother"" it didn\'t make it any better. She was infuriating to say in the least, trying too hard to squeeze into Furuya\'s life and get him to love her, provoking him, and prodding to get a reaction out of him.

This show doesn\'t have many episodes, though wasted time with filler to keep on going. It was excruciatingly boring to manage through some of these moments, especially episode 9, where the filler was stretching out after the cliff hanger of the previous episode. Many plot points faltered, such as the rigor mortis somehow completely wearing off before Rea even tried to take the Hydrangea medicine. It was also mentioned she was rotting, but there were little signs of it, nor any other complications besides her wound reopening.

Then it just sort of went full on this weirdo ecchi comedy bend that made me not really engaged with it as much.Any sort of serious moments or tension that I had wanted just sort of got undercut by wanting to do some anime tropes.I will say that the music for both the opening and closing of the show are good. Not that that affects much, just wanted to share. And I will even say the music used in the show is also solid.VAs are fine but...nothing to write home about.

Everything is well and fine until the family cat, Babu, is hit by a truck and dies. Chihiro, the teenager of the family and protagonist of this tale, can't accept losing his pet cat and so tries to bring it back to life by following an ancient, mysterious manual that contains a recipe for a ressurection potion.One night, while working the recipe with his mortar and pestle he spots a girl outside...the building screaming down a well about the several nasty things her dad does to her. This turns out to be Rea Sanka, the richest girl in the land.

There is absolutely no substance to this anime, the story, or the characters - despite how optomistic I felt about it within the first half of its 12 episodes.It actually has an okay start. You know it\'s going to be a weird anime right from the beginning -...and so its easily something that you might mistake as interesting.

Tales of the Abyss,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4884/Tales_of_the_Abyss,"['Now, I should mention first that I have not played the Tales of the Abyss video game on which this anime is based.  Despite that, I found it a great series to watch, with excellent characters and character development, brilliantly animated scenes, spectacular artwork, and a well-paced excellent story.The story starts out slowly, but each character gives the viewer an immediate impression when introduced and one quickly develops feelings towards him or her, whether good or bad.  Each character is developed to the fullest extent, with detailed backstories, distinct personalities, personal motivation and conflicts, and excellent designs.  You can truly feel the...conflicts they experience, and the depth they get into is truly spectacular.  The antagonists are as well-developed as the protagonists, and since their development is on the same level, when conflict does arise, it’s felt much more forcefully since you don’t know which side has more willpower to win the ensuring battles.  The development is especially strong for Luke, and just seeing him undergo his transformation throughout the series is breathtaking.  Also, all the characters just mesh in with each other extremely well, and the chemistry amongst everyone is well-done, again, both protagonists, secondary characters, and antagonists.The animation, like the characters, is wonderful, with fluid movements and flashy attacks.  Pair that up with colorful drawings and excellent backgrounds and scenes, and scenes exceed my expectations.  It even gives the .hack series a run for the money in this aspect.  The pacing helps get the animation and drawings noticed, since there are moments where it’s slow enough to admire the drawings and detail work woven into the scenes, but it’s not too slow so that you get bored and drift off.  There is enough action mixed into each mission to keep the pace up, plus good dialogue amongst the characters.Unfortunately, there is a flaw in the dialogue in that the vocabulary often used is difficult to comprehend, and many references are made to these words.  Explanations are given for the vocabulary and what the world is like, but having not played the games is a bit disadvantageous, since the explanations are long and require pausing, rewatching, and analysis before one understands it.  What’s offered in the anime is just a fast-placed blurb and a quick picture where you have about 5 seconds to absorb all the information.  Thus, without pausing, it limits the viewer’s degree of plot comprehension.  I’m sure those who have played the games will be able to enjoy and understand the series without pausing and thinking for this kind of comprehension.Despite having to take a little more time to understand some of the terminology in Tales of the Abyss, I do think the series is well worth the time.  Even if you haven’t played the games, the series is very enjoyable.  Great characters, good plotline, fantastic drawings and animations await those who watch Tales. conflicts they experience, and the depth they get into is truly spectacular.

The anime first aired 3. Of October 2008 and it’s the fourth installment of the “Tales” series to be adapted into an anime. I liked the game a lot and thought I should review the anime for the users on MAL.In the review below I’ve tried to include an objective opinion of both the fan treats and possible faults that a game adaption poses to viewers, who haven’t played the game. To this end a section called “Compared to the game”...can be found later on in the review.StoryTales of the Abyss’ storyline has a balanced amount of both good and bad points. The main storyline is interesting, but is highly dependent on long tiring explanations of terms like “fonons”, “Yulia’s score” and “fomicry”. However the main story moves along at a fairly good pace even if a few explanations are needed along the way.Also the short stories about the characters’ relationships and pasts are very good. They bring a fresh perspective once in a while and makes sure the viewer isn’t left totally clueless about the characters’ former lives. Especially the slight romances make the story appear more appealing.The most alarming point of the anime’s story is the sudden leaps in time and progression. A few times during the show an episode ends on a cliffhanger only to skip the situation, and leave the viewer wondering what happened in between the two episodes.These sorts of skips are continuously used throughout the show and might irritate even the most die hard fans of the game.Despite the tiring explanations and unresolved cliffhangers Tales of the Abyss presents a fairly enjoyable story with a lot of powerful action and appealing side stories.CharactersThe protagonist of Tales of the Abyss is primarily Luke von Fabre. However the rest of the protagonists play essential roles regarding both the main storyline and the immense character development of Luke.One of the best elements of this particular anime is the character development that all the main characters go through. The development of each character is carefully included in the storyline and none of it seems forced or out of place. This makes for a cast of very likeable characters and a pleasant watch.Even so a few of the major developments happens in a very short amount of time and a few characters loose some of their distinctive and humoristic character traits. This is a very small fault but it’s still bound to upset some viewers, even if the characters actually seem more likeable after the development.Altogether the anime presents the characters in a good way and the character development is smooth and nicely included in the main storyline or some of the previously mentioned short side stories.AnimationThe category in which Tales of the Abyss performs the best is animation.The high quality of character models and scenery is constant through all 26 episodes, and it doesn’t seem like Sunrise and Bandai Visual made any noticeable or irritating mishaps.The production team should especially be credited for the fast paced swordfights which are all breathtaking and surprisingly fluid in motion.Also a select few scenery shots seem particularly well made; for example the shots of the capitals: “Baticul” and “Grand Chokmah” seen from bird’s eyes view.The character models are all highly detailed, very distinctive and recognizable. This is certainly a positive aspect during the high paced fighting where some viewers might have confused one character for another, had the characters been more alike.The only slightly infuriating thing about the characters might be the cast of “good” characters, who seem a bit neutral compared to the “evil” characters. The evil “God-generals” simply seem to be more unique and interesting in design. Animation wise some of these characters definitely deserved more screen time.  However, despite the critique, the good characters shouldn’t be called boring or uninteresting.The show also contains a high amount of well placed CG and the CG objects don’t seem out of place. Some of the computer generated spell graphics are a bit extravagant. However this isn’t really a flaw since the same graphics and spells were used in the original console game.All in all the show should be particularly credited for the high quality of animation which the production team at Sunrise and Bandai Visual is responsible for.SoundThe music of the show didn’t impress me much. The background music used during the actual episodes is neither spectacular nor bad. The music helps set the mood but I personally didn’t notice the music much throughout the episodes.I did like the opener “Karma” by Bump of Chicken but just listening to the song without the animated intro makes it loose some of its charm. Especially because a lot of the emotions expressed in the song is complimented by the opening sequences. Nevertheless “Karma” is worth recommending to any fans of J-rock (myself not particularly being one of them though). The ED ""Bouken Suisei"" by Kurumi Enomoto, like the background music, was okay but nothing out of the ordinary.The voice actors did a decent/good job portraying the emotions of the characters and it’s always a treat for the fans of the game, when the original voice actors also do the voices of the anime. However the voices of Luke fon Fabre and Mieu did irritate me a tad at first but getting used to both voices doesn’t take long.Compared to the gameBeing an adaption of a RPG game, it’s inevitable that the show doesn’t contain some obvious game-based faults, one of them being the unexplainable fast-travel from one location to another.If the viewer hasn’t played the original game or equivalent, the jumping could seem weird and confusing, since no information about the trips is given. Also the spells, abilities and tech terms (see Story) might be confusing if the viewer has no knowledge of the game. The use of the original spells is simply a treat for the fans without any real meaning to the individual watching Tales of the Abyss by chance.The last big fault is the dramatic change in tempo during episodes.

If you’re a fan of the “Tales” series or an adventure/action fan this show is worth checking out. can be found later on in the review.StoryTales of the Abyss’ storyline has a balanced amount of both good and bad points. The main storyline is interesting, but is highly dependent on long tiring explanations of terms like “fonons”, “Yulia’s score” and “fomicry”. However the main story moves along at a fairly good pace even if a few explanations are needed along the way.Also the short stories about the characters’ relationships and pasts are very good. They bring a fresh perspective once in a while and makes sure the viewer isn’t left totally clueless about the characters’ former lives. Especially the slight romances make the story appear more appealing.The most alarming point of the anime’s story is the sudden leaps in time and progression. A few times during the show an episode ends on a cliffhanger only to skip the situation, and leave the viewer wondering what happened in between the two episodes.These sorts of skips are continuously used throughout the show and might irritate even the most die hard fans of the game.Despite the tiring explanations and unresolved cliffhangers Tales of the Abyss presents a fairly enjoyable story with a lot of powerful action and appealing side stories.CharactersThe protagonist of Tales of the Abyss is primarily Luke von Fabre. However the rest of the protagonists play essential roles regarding both the main storyline and the immense character development of Luke.One of the best elements of this particular anime is the character development that all the main characters go through. The development of each character is carefully included in the storyline and none of it seems forced or out of place. This makes for a cast of very likeable characters and a pleasant watch.Even so a few of the major developments happens in a very short amount of time and a few characters loose some of their distinctive and humoristic character traits. This is a very small fault but it’s still bound to upset some viewers, even if the characters actually seem more likeable after the development.Altogether the anime presents the characters in a good way and the character development is smooth and nicely included in the main storyline or some of the previously mentioned short side stories.AnimationThe category in which Tales of the Abyss performs the best is animation.The high quality of character models and scenery is constant through all 26 episodes, and it doesn’t seem like Sunrise and Bandai Visual made any noticeable or irritating mishaps.The production team should especially be credited for the fast paced swordfights which are all breathtaking and surprisingly fluid in motion.Also a select few scenery shots seem particularly well made; for example the shots of the capitals: “Baticul” and “Grand Chokmah” seen from bird’s eyes view.The character models are all highly detailed, very distinctive and recognizable. This is certainly a positive aspect during the high paced fighting where some viewers might have confused one character for another, had the characters been more alike.The only slightly infuriating thing about the characters might be the cast of “good” characters, who seem a bit neutral compared to the “evil” characters. The evil “God-generals” simply seem to be more unique and interesting in design. Animation wise some of these characters definitely deserved more screen time.  However, despite the critique, the good characters shouldn’t be called boring or uninteresting.The show also contains a high amount of well placed CG and the CG objects don’t seem out of place. Some of the computer generated spell graphics are a bit extravagant. However this isn’t really a flaw since the same graphics and spells were used in the original console game.All in all the show should be particularly credited for the high quality of animation which the production team at Sunrise and Bandai Visual is responsible for.SoundThe music of the show didn’t impress me much. The background music used during the actual episodes is neither spectacular nor bad. The music helps set the mood but I personally didn’t notice the music much throughout the episodes.I did like the opener “Karma” by Bump of Chicken but just listening to the song without the animated intro makes it loose some of its charm. Especially because a lot of the emotions expressed in the song is complimented by the opening sequences. Nevertheless “Karma” is worth recommending to any fans of J-rock (myself not particularly being one of them though).

I really should\'ve dropped it after ep8, like what I usually do for all the other bad animes. I thought it was going to improve later on because of all the ""Luke is going to change you have to watch this"" crap from the game fans. Let me start with the most annoying part which is all the characters seem to have acquired the ability to teleport. One minute they are in City A then the next minute they are City B, and they keep doing...this in every single episode. Now this wouldn\'t be too bad if they didn\'t give every city the same look and design, which leads to my next point,who was in charge of the worldsetting?I watched 18 episodes and I still don\'t understand a thing about how this world functions. I might not the smartest guy in the world but my recollection is that the only time they actually attempted to explain the world is at the beginning of the first episode during which they said something about tune and musci and all that. After that it\'s all jargons. The consequence is that I have no idea what the group is doing in any of their missions, for example why did Akzeriuth sink when Luke started resonating in front of that shrine, and for that matter, what is that shrine? I know I probably can figure everything out by reading every single line for twenty times but if I do that why would I want to watch animes in the first place then?So basically I gave up on the plot later on in the show. Unfortunately the character are not so interesting either, including Luke. Ok he changed, so what? Character change has nothing to do with how well developed this guy is. Basically he changed from a spoiled brat to a good guy, big deal. The rest of the cast are just boring. The only purpose they serve in this anime is to say the lines and introduce new missions so that the plot can move forward. What I don\'t get is even the battles are boring. And we are talking about Sunrise here which is one of the most funded, if not the most, studio in Japan. Even Bleach the animation has more exciting battles that ToA. I think the main problem is that the game is a big success so they think they can make a good anime out of it by just borrowing everything from the game without putting any efforts in. It just doesn\'t work that way.Really a waste of time, don\'t watch it. this in every single episode.

False hope, plus the excellent experiences with the Tales of xxx franchise (e.g. Tales of Phantasia fan-translations on SNES and PlayStation) kept me interested... but the operative word was ""false"".I won\'t summarize the story, or explain why it was ""dreadful"" for me. Rather, I\'ll tell you why I hate this: there was potential for greatness, but from the very beginning, major details ruined it.Annoying characters, huge plot holes, directing which seemed to not take itself seriously, personalities which are easily interchangeable, and no sense of ""suspended disbelief"".Nothing in this anime was worth the time...it took to make it. Somewhere, early in the design process, a competent director and editor were misplaced with writers who previously only wrote fanfics and a commitee who designed the storyboards.As as result, even with competent animation and enthusiastic efforts by the music and character design staff, the end result is much less than the sum of its parts.Please give me back the nearly 13 hours of my life that I wasted on this! it took to make it.

There\'s no meaning in living. When I sensed my own death, I wanted to live. I know now.

I give my feedback on the two...points separately below, in order.If you want to know how well it adapts the story:Tales of the Abyss runs a story very much similar to what the game-players will remember while leaving out only the most minor of details, things that in hindsight even a die-hard fan would admit the story could do without.For example, instead of using the scene where Engeve\'s villagers discuss the food thieves, the anime moves right from when Luke takes the apple without paying to being brought to the village chief, a smooth and clean transition that cuts out runtime it didn\'t really need. This even at times adds some realism; no slowly-sinking town so you can leave for three days to get the Albiore, it\'s sinking NOW and the Albiore just swooped in to save the day.Best of all, while it cuts out the unnecessary portions, it adds some scenes the game could have benefited from: backstories that were originally only dialogue get actual flashbacks depicted.If you want to know about the story itself:The story centers around Luke fon Fabre, the spoiled, sheltered son of a noble who knows nothing of life outside the villa and is basically designed so that you\'ll hate him out of the gate. He\'s soon taken far away from his known universe into the outside world when Mystearica Grants (usually just called Tear) breaks into the manor to kill Van, Luke\'s swordfighting instructor. Feeling responsible for them being teleported away, she vows to get him home. This is where Luke\'s long journey of character development begins, as he has to learn of even the most basic of real-world concepts, initially not even understanding the concept of money.As much as Luke develops, the story still manages to give plenty of screen time to the other five playable characters of the game, and let them develop sufficiently as well. Nothing is iced over, even traits that are initially portrayed as comical are of large importance to their characters. Guy\'s afraid of women? That stems from a deep trauma we later learn about. Anise is obsessed with money? She\'s got people around her who always need it. Their pasts and their connections to the villains are well fleshed-out. Only one villain out of many is your generic, power-hungry fool, and he was ultimately a pawn. The rest all have deeper motives for doing what they do, and you may even mourn the deaths of some of them.This tale is centered around several varied but important themes such as being outside of the world you\'ve known, defiance of what\'s claimed to be inevitable, prejudice based on the uncontrollable being unjustified, living with a sin that can never be forgiven, finding a reason for life, and why everyone deserves to live. If someone has lost their way to despair, they would likely feel a kindred spirit in Luke and find an answer through this powerful Tale. points separately below, in order.If you want to know how well it adapts the story:Tales of the Abyss runs a story very much similar to what the game-players will remember while leaving out only the most minor of details, things that in hindsight even a die-hard fan would admit the story could do without.For example, instead of using the scene where Engeve\'s villagers discuss the food thieves, the anime moves right from when Luke takes the apple without paying to being brought to the village chief, a smooth and clean transition that cuts out runtime it didn\'t really need.

I completed watching it about 1 week ago and I never quite got it out of my mind. And it really is the first time, I cannot stop thinking about an ordinary Anime. The music is good, the Animation very neat, the story complex but that is far from enough for earning a 10. However, this Anime has at least 3 very good points that make it outstanding.First of all: the characters. This is the first and only...Anime I know with a real anti-hero. In the first episodes I was frustrated by Lukes childish behavior. I almost wanted to punch him several times or even hoped, he would just leave the Anime. I have never been so dissatisfied with a hero and that is, in fact, an amazing feeling. I don’t have to say that his changes were incredible. On the contrary, one thing I found really disturbing is that the characters never changed their clothes (and also that they traveled in one episode to 20 different places without a clue how they did it this fast).The other people were really sophisticated characters with interesting histories. There was not one you could not like.Secondly: the bad guys. Often the bad guys are those frightening and purely evil monsters, that just love to bring about death and destruction. There are still far too many Animes in this black-and-white-style. In the “Tales of the Abyss” I found not one, so called, bad guy, whose reasons I could not understand in some weird or humanly way. It even took me some time to realize, who the real boss of the villains was. I also do not think that the boss fights were too short, as many have mentioned. In fact, I am no fan of long fights with loads of bizarre attacks, when you just wait forever for the story to continue. Due to the shortness of the fights, they were sometimes even more surprising.Last but not least: the story telling. Tales of the Abyss does not belong to those stories, where the viewer gets to know everything right in the beginning and is wondering for the rest of the series, when those stupid characters find out themselves. The most naive person with the least knowledge is Luke and the viewer has just as much knowledge. As Luke gets to know and understand things, so does the viewer. When I started watching Abyss I did so, because it looked nice. I had no idea how complex and compelling the thing would get. I sometimes thought, the whole story was a great riddle with so many seemingly unimportant details in the beginning turning out to be an important clue. I did not think it was rushed, though, unless you watched it half asleep. There was probably no avoiding the happy ending (“saving the planet”), but I was still curious till the end who would survive, as it is that kind of Anime, where everybody could just end up dead. I watched all the last 10 episodes at one go.Concludingly, Tales of the Abyss may deserve an “8 - Very Good” or “9 - Great” (which is still a high score) compared to the Game, where there are probably many more side stories and more information. Yet, even the Anime left me enthralled and there was no way not to give it a 10. Anime I know with a real anti-hero. In the first episodes I was frustrated by Lukes childish behavior.

The ending is not the best but it is executed well.Art: The art is good, that's the only thing I won't deny. The characters are not unique in appearance but at least they're not hurting my eyes.Sound: The worst. There are times when I literally mute it. The MC's voice is annoying, really. He literally does nothing but SCREAM, SCREAM and SCREAM. The voice actors don't seem to understand their roles as well. Not only...the MC but also his friends as well.Characters: Poor and inconsistent. The characters would change at times but they would revert back over and over and over again. It's really bad. The MC is annoying as fuck, not because he's childish but because almost the entire series, he's shouting and shouting and shouting. I understand he's still a child since he's only 7 years old but still... Gosh, I'm cringing. His friends are pretty awful as well, they left him when he needed them most. I understand their sentiments but it's not like the MC is all to blame. Some of them know that he's 7 years old and pretty much ignorant of the world but they don't fill he's ignorance and ignore his will to learn. They all know that he doesn't understand anything but all of them did not bother to explain. Then, how do you expect  him to make logical decisions? Gosh... it's really annoying. To add salt to the injury, after all that, it seemed like nothing happened. Their words contradict their actions.Enjoyment: I almost dropped this anime but I don't because I promised to myself that when I start a series I have to see it through the end. If not for that, I would have probably dropped it. At the start of 14th episode, I even needed to play it at 1.3x just so I could finish the series.

Gosh, this anime has zero re-watch value.All in all, this is anime is bad and pretty much overrated."", 'As someone who had played the original game long before watching the anime, I say the adaptation is rather bad. Indeed the plot did not go under any major changes, no important events present in the game was removed while some scenes not shown in the games are not bad(some are anime-original, while some are taken from official anthology). What is terrible is how battles are carried out. The anime took the word \'random battle encounter\' in the game too literally, it is a \'battle encounter\' and the event, along with the feeling it gives is \'random\'. In the game you would not really care...if all animals and monsters in the area would suddenly join forces with its natural predator or prey to prioritize killing you and your party for exactly zero reason since in game you would want to fight a great variations of enemies and not just 1 or 2 kinds per stage anyway. But out of game mechanics when this logic is placed into anime format, it is too random, weak, and pretty much just a waste of screen time just to show some fancy moves they are capable of in the original game. The boss battles are even worse, not only that bosses with supposedly 50,000+ HP would be reduced into dying within 2-4 blows, the human bosses present near to zero strength or tension in the battle. Boss battle against human characters consisted of elongated speech while they just parry, guard or dodge against each other\'s strikes and nobody takes any hit, and when the conversation reach peak the party would just decide to pull off some lame tricks(sleep inducing, bitchslap, or simple arrow shots) and the boss will fall just like that. It seem like the bosses are incredibly weak, and the party always had the option to kill them pretty much easily right from the second the battle start but they just wanna wait until the long talk end before they think the bosses should have been put out for good. Then there\'s go the 50,000+ HP within seconds and the tension it gives? None. The characters struggling in the heat of the battle are just the guys doing all the parrying and dodging, and there\'s just someone who get to stand there doing the talk until the time came that they became bored of talking, which is when the lame trick happen.As for story as a fan of Tales series who have played many other games Namco gave me, Abyss is among those that have mediocre score for story. How Luke changed didn\'t make him any much likable to me, actually his development leap is done too quick(both in game and anime), changing from one person to a totally different one doesn\'t happen in 5 minutes. How Luke manage to act all goody-goody without slipping out his former douche self for a single second made me feel unreal. I prefer him to ""try"" becoming good, struggling with his speeches and how to react in different situation, and gradually become better and better, not just perfectly have the instant soul change he did.Further on Luke, I did not quite enjoy Tear\'s romantic development towards him either, because similarly to Luke, it happen pretty much too sudden. Tear was introduced as a stubborn girl that have the body and mind of a 20-22 years old woman even when she is still 16, she was depicted as taking her duty seriously and will not hesitate to kill someone in self-defense. Her relationship with Luke started out terrible with her being unable to cope with his endless immaturity, but then suddenly show signs that she had developed some feelings for him as soon as he cut his hair, even before seeing the results that \'could he really changed or not?\' So what happen to that mature tsuntsun girl we had earlier, is cutting hair all it take to turn her dere? That could\'ve been betterThe other characters I am too lazy to describe them all but I liked Jade the most of the entire cast, he\'s a mature leader figure that will often time make childish jokes and hold some grand sarcasm in his arsenal(it\'s sad that he isn\'t the leader of the party). However, his sarcasm, which is his biggest appeal, was toned down for some odd reason within the anime, which  is alittle disappointing. (His ability to troll people was demonstrated to greater extent in the game and several preorder CDs for other Tales game which he did show up as the commentator)The art of the anime was good, though some choices of camera viewpoint could have been better. The music, though was somewhat disappointing, I would have not mind and even encourage them to use the original BGMs that were in the game, the OST the original game offers are fitting enough to each scene(though the battles in the anime might not be able to meet up with the battle BGMs the game used). I have no further comments on the voicing because all roles are directly reprised from the original game so they already knew how hey should portray each character. if all animals and monsters in the area would suddenly join forces with its natural predator or prey to prioritize killing you and your party for exactly zero reason since in game you would want to fight a great variations of enemies and not just 1 or 2 kinds per stage anyway.

The characters struggling in the heat of the battle are just the guys doing all the parrying and dodging, and there\'s just someone who get to stand there doing the talk until the time came that they became bored of talking, which is when the lame trick happen.As for story as a fan of Tales series who have played many other games Namco gave me, Abyss is among those that have mediocre score for story. How Luke changed didn\'t make him any much likable to me, actually his development leap is done too quick(both in game and anime), changing from one person to a totally different one doesn\'t happen in 5 minutes. How Luke manage to act all goody-goody without slipping out his former douche self for a single second made me feel unreal. I prefer him to ""try"" becoming good, struggling with his speeches and how to react in different situation, and gradually become better and better, not just perfectly have the instant soul change he did.Further on Luke, I did not quite enjoy Tear\'s romantic development towards him either, because similarly to Luke, it happen pretty much too sudden. Tear was introduced as a stubborn girl that have the body and mind of a 20-22 years old woman even when she is still 16, she was depicted as taking her duty seriously and will not hesitate to kill someone in self-defense. Her relationship with Luke started out terrible with her being unable to cope with his endless immaturity, but then suddenly show signs that she had developed some feelings for him as soon as he cut his hair, even before seeing the results that \'could he really changed or not?\' So what happen to that mature tsuntsun girl we had earlier, is cutting hair all it take to turn her dere? That could\'ve been betterThe other characters I am too lazy to describe them all but I liked Jade the most of the entire cast, he\'s a mature leader figure that will often time make childish jokes and hold some grand sarcasm in his arsenal(it\'s sad that he isn\'t the leader of the party). However, his sarcasm, which is his biggest appeal, was toned down for some odd reason within the anime, which  is alittle disappointing. (His ability to troll people was demonstrated to greater extent in the game and several preorder CDs for other Tales game which he did show up as the commentator)The art of the anime was good, though some choices of camera viewpoint could have been better. The music, though was somewhat disappointing, I would have not mind and even encourage them to use the original BGMs that were in the game, the OST the original game offers are fitting enough to each scene(though the battles in the anime might not be able to meet up with the battle BGMs the game used). I have no further comments on the voicing because all roles are directly reprised from the original game so they already knew how hey should portray each character.', ""Laohoam- I was a bit skeptical when starting this anime, mainly because the main character was a douche.  After the plot started to develop it became more and more enjoyable.  Also the fact that this was based off an RPG makes it a bit more enjoyable for me because you can see some RPG characteristics in it.  Overall I recommend watching it the beginning is a little rough but give it some time it is worth it.Tadgh: This anime is also a video game. There are several times when that is noticeable, but if...you know that going in, it's not a big deal. Otherwise it is excellent. You meet and learn about every character, the art and movement was smooth an excellent, the story had several twists and kept me on the edge of my seat. There is some contention among our group as to the ending, but I  think it was perfect. If you like well developed characters, this is for you.Dr. R. Dash:  So this anime is my cup of tea! I love Video games that are similar to the story line and Tales have many many games and when we all first started watching this we all got the idea well we kinda wanna play this game but now I'm not sure, well I WANT TO PLAY it! I loved the selection of characters the back story the friendship the family the whole 9 yards. I would recommend this anime to people who understand and love RPG's. I will re-watch this and seek out other Tales, games and manga or anime in the future.Rasanaph- In the beginning I was doubtful even pessimistic on how this anime would develop, but I must say it greatly improved and I quite enjoyed it. Character development was amazing and I think I even developed a crush for Tear. There are a few loop holes in the story and even a few things that lack in detail. Don't get hung up on them and enjoy. you know that going in, it's not a big deal. Otherwise it is excellent.

I found that the ending was a bad one because through the series the story built up alot of relationships and then when you get to the end its like the author just kind wrote it really quick and dropped it so i found that abit boring and dull...but the start was very good i enjoyed it alot and i also enjoyed the plot line and well once again i dont wanna give away anything but its a very interesting story that makes you think about how you should live your life.~characters~I found the main male protagonist a very frusterating character because he only cared for himself and no one else and he never thought any of his actions through which ended up causeing not only him but millions of people problems and loss and he never apologized outright for the things he did that destroyed countless others lives so i found that rather hard to deal with but the other characters were very good and different and the author did a great job with the others.~overall~I enjoyed the series to a point before the characters and plot start to fall apart and then it just becomes a mediocre series but mabey that was what the author wanted im not sure. I suggest this anime to people who like deathnote because personally both are very frusterating plots with selfish characters who learn nothing. Thanks and hope you enjoy Tales of the Abyss!-Lamy but the start was very good i enjoyed it alot and i also enjoyed the plot line and well once again i dont wanna give away anything but its a very interesting story that makes you think about how you should live your life.~characters~I found the main male protagonist a very frusterating character because he only cared for himself and no one else and he never thought any of his actions through which ended up causeing not only him but millions of people problems and loss and he never apologized outright for the things he did that destroyed countless others lives so i found that rather hard to deal with but the other characters were very good and different and the author did a great job with the others.~overall~I enjoyed the series to a point before the characters and plot start to fall apart and then it just becomes a mediocre series but mabey that was what the author wanted im not sure.

It\'s during these moments when you suddenly watch TV commercials of some shows that are ""coming soon."" The trailer got you because it showed pretty cool fight scenes and flashy awesome spellcasting. Then, it says that it\'s a rendition of a PS2 game. It doesn\'t faze you, and you watch it anyway.Tales of the Abyss, hereby shortened to TA for convenience, was introduced to me this way. I never played the game (I was more of the handheld fanatic, really), but I wanted to see it...anyway. I\'ve always been interested with battles and cool spellcasting (Fullmetal Alchemist-esque shows), so it wasn\'t really a problem for me.And I am proud to say that I didn\'t regret shoving this series off. It\'s earned its place as one of the best shows I\'ve ever watched. TA proves to be a great viewing experience, and here\'s why.TA is great for two things: pacing and character. I\'ll tackle pacing first.As you may well know, TA is an animé rendition of a PS2 RPG. And, if you\'re a gamer, you know that RPGs are notorious (or famous in a good sense) for their extensive storylines. And when you have an extensive storyline, you need detail--and lots of it. The storyboard directors of TA must have had a hard time compressing the whole story in 26 episodes, and I assume they must have shortened some parts and omitted others. But overall, TA as an animé doesn\'t give off a sense of being cut off; in fact, it\'s paced quite nicely. Sure, parts have been trimmed here and there, but the flow remains constant.The second part is character. I included this because I really liked the character of Luke Fon Fabre (the main character). People might call this cliché, but I appreciated his development from being an arrogant prick to the savior of the world. His emotions drive him and the series forward. With each episode, you witness him changing slowly with the watchful (and caring) eye of Tear Grants. The story of these two people aren\'t so bad either, but I\'ll leave it for you to figure out once you watch the series.Art isn\'t bad either, as I mentioned the beautiful spellcasting and the awesome battles. It\'s clean, and well-done. Sound isn\'t so bad, either. Being based on an RPG, you\'re really going to get good sounds (or at least good renditions of them). The BGMs fit the scenes very well, in my opinion. I especially liked the opening and ending themes, too. Big thanks to BUMP OF CHICKEN and Kurumi Enomoto.Overall, Tales of the Abyss is a great watch. You\'re really taken on an adventure about saving the world and yourself; you get to witness the change of one person for the better, and how he ultimately uses his change for the betterment of the world. This definitely belongs to my ""best shows ever"" list. anyway.

I found myself rewatching the eppisodes to understand what was going on. Furthermore, it seems like they tried to make the characters look deep (having a complicated past that not anyone could realate to. But it's actually better if you can relate to it at least A LITTLE bit.) but they weren't.They made the characters overly deep, witch reversed the whole process, making them seem childish. I didn't get very far because of this.

The plot of the series mainly focuses on the “Score” and how our heroines contend with seemingly impossible obstacles to prevent its alteration. In order to achieve this and maintain the order of the “Score”, they must face off against foes that they once looked up to as family. The task is not easily realized, as matters of the heart arise to...challenge their course of action. Despite the heart aching challenges that stand poised to thwart their progression, our heroines were able to find solace in the bond they share with one another, as they continue their quest of salvation. With self-determination of an iron will, our heroines march on with resolute courage to ensure the survival of the world they love.Characters:Fon Fabre, LukeVoiced by: Suzuki, Chihiro (Japanese)Heroes are more often than not, bred of courage, wisdom and compassion, but those were traits that Luke profoundly lacked at the start of the series. Being imprisoned for almost the entire duration of his childhood, due to a kidnapping incident, Luke grew up not knowing much about the world around him. As the story progresses, our hero finds his true calling in life. His journey of discovery and salvation would negate all of his self-demeaning characteristics, and impart upon him the traits of a true champion.AshVoiced by: Suzuki Chihiro (Japanese)Reality forces us to grow up both physically and emotionally, and in Ash’s case this was certainly no different. In the series he’s portrayed as character full of heart and pride. As one of the six God generals, Ash originally supported the idea of overthrowing the “Score,” but after numerous encounters with our heroes, he changes his mind and assists them in their quest.Curtiss, JadeVoiced by: Koyasu, Takehito (Japanese)Jade, also known as Jade the Necromancer is a very knowledgeable and mysterious individual. He is considered the originator of the fomicry art. During his adolescent stage, Jade experienced some horrific events that would later result in his peculiar behaviors in the show.  Having a military background only excelled Jade’s decision making and profoundly developed his ever present self-awareness.IonVoiced by: Kobayashi, Yumiko (Japanese)As the leader of the Order of Lorelei, Ion was kind and open minded. His ability to read the fonstones immensely helped our heroines in their quest. He remained humble and courteous until his demise. As he was nearing his death, as a final act of good will, he used his last remaining power to extract the miasma that threatened the life of Tear.Grants, TearVoiced by: Yukana (Japanese)A courageous and an extraordinary person full of compassion and love. She is the descendent of Yulia and the blood relative to Van in the series. In the series she aids Luke and the rest of the ensemble to help defeat her beloved brother. She is strong willed and kindness is her strongest strength. She’s constantly consoling Luke whenever things don’t go his way. One of her notable traits is the series of hymns she sings and utilizes as battle tools.Cecil, GuyVoiced by: Matsumoto, Yasunori (Japanese)Guy, originally a descendent of royal blood, but due to certain circumstances, he found himself working as a servant in the Fabre’s mansion. He is Luke’s best friend in the series. As a friend, Guy saw it his responsibility to guide and be there for Luke when things were at their bleakest point.  Guy has a wonderful persona, but when it comes to women, that persona quickly gets erased and turns into a phobia.Luzu Kimlasca Lanvaldear, NataliaVoiced by: Neya, Michiko (Japanese)Natalia is the princess of Kimlasca, and Luke’s fiancée in the series. As a princess, she lived up to the title, and as a fiancée she has been nothing but wonderful.  She is very supportive of Luke, and her determination to help him never once wavered. In the course of the series, Natalia’s resolve was tested countless times, but she never allowed herself to succumb to the evil that threatened her and her companions.Tatlin, AniseVoiced by:  Momoi, Haruko (Japanese)Anise is a peppy and cheerful girl, but her intentions always tend to misguide others. In the series, she acts as shelter that fends off all harm that is likely to befall master Ion. She also helps out Luke and the rest of the gang in their quest, but for a different reason. Some of her distinct traits that are rather perceptible in the series are her deceitful ways and, her passionate love for money.Grants, VanVoiced by: Nakata Jouji (Japanese)Van is the commandant of the Order of Lorelei. He commands the six Gog generals, and he is also Luke and Ash’s mentor in the series. After the destruction of his birth land, Van has made it his mission to overthrow the “Score” that predicted the eradication of his home land. To achieve this, he joined the ranks of Lorelei in order to amass a strong following that is loyal and willing. His resolve to achieve his objective never changed, and he thwarted anyone that dared to stand in his way.Summation:Tales of the Abyss manages to sustain the elements of the premise, without severally hampering its growth.  By doing so, it maintained its charm devoid of ever leaving the viewer feeling discontented.  The series pretty much narrators itself throughout the entire process, so the likely hood of any confusion on the viewer’s part is minimal. As a fantasy genre, the series didn’t portray that element to its fullest; rather, it was rarely present much of the entire storytelling. Where the series does succeed is in the manner by which the story was represented: Succinct and fast paced, thus allowing the viewer to experience every aspect of the show with straightforwardness.Theme:The overall theme of the show was never hidden from the viewer; rather it was present from the opening ceremony of the show. It depicts with simplicity, without throwing unnecessary weight on the script, the dire message of great change and salvation. This was evident throughout the process of the storyline, as Luke continuously confronted spectacles that questioned his existence. The general message of the series is humble and sincere, something that the viewer will profoundly come to acknowledge as the story arrives at its conclusion.Media Related:The animation sequence was superbly executed. Visually the series was amazing, and that was reinforced by the beautifully realized world where the story takes place. The character design was appropriate and delightfully complemented the overall fantasy element of the show.The style of the series was well constructed to help transmit the over all message of progression. The fight scenes were rather brief, but potent enough to distinguish the style of the show. The creation within the world itself was well detailed and conspicuously presented. Though the visual style of the show was fully realized, the musical aspect of it was rarely touched. Suffice to say, these minor gaffes are hardly ever noticed, as the overwhelming substance of the storytelling easily removes these protracted shadows.JJ challenge their course of action.

There are about two or three that have ever really impressed me and even then the scores are low. This one joined the list of ones that I've liked, and I like it a lot.Let me first say here that I quite literally had to look up the main character's information because if he wasn't going to change from what kind of character he was at first I would not watch it. As it were the...first couple of episodes were long and a bit painful but in my opinion worth it. Sadly though his shitty clothing choices last the whole anime.This show would have certainly benefited from being about 5 or so more episodes long to do more world building but at the same time things weren't to hard to understand. The fights are well done, the animation in pretty much every part is gorgeous, and characters grow like they should.I have never played the game so I have no idea if it is anywhere near to accurate, but from an anime point alone it stands pretty darn well. I enjoyed it and I saw it getting some flack for being to hard to understand/confusing/stupid/boring but I disagree. This definitely filled my fix for an action fantasy with a dash of mystery and I can honestly say I was pretty sad when it ended.All in all, good anime, loaded with information and world to explore, and great story. first couple of episodes were long and a bit painful but in my opinion worth it.

I haven't played the game before, so I will not be able to tell you whether or not it followed the original storyline, or how different the graphics are, but only the overall enjoyability of it.It is an exciting adventure that really pulls you in. The main character, Luke Fon Fabre goes through an epic journey where he learns what it means to depend on others and have all others depend on him. And as cliche as it may sound, he learns what it truly means to be alive.The story was...interesting because everything fits together in the end. Things that we thought we knew and understood in the beginning turn out other than expected. The overall journey and the characters' evolution was enjoyable. This is not to say that the story was perfect. There were plot holes, and the entire belief system and the politics of the world was kind of hard to follow. Also, they would sometimes pull things like abilities out of thin air.The art was amazing. The backgrounds looked very precise and high quality. The characters were easy to look at and all held their unique appearances. There were some really flashy colorful fight scenes and things like that.Some of the characters were over the top, a few of them having characteristics added in for slapstick humor that they would sprinkle in the drama so it wouldn't be too heavy. For example, there was a character who was literally afraid of women. Characters kind of seemed 2d at first, but then you start to see their pasts and see them grow and change as the show goes on. They start feeling very real and you start getting kind of attached. Luke who was arrogant, spoiled, ignorant, and sometimes unknowingly cruel changes after he made one grave mistake.

That is when the anime becomes fulfilling to watch.Personally, I enjoyed it even though it was not a genre I usually watch. I'd especially recommend it to people who like adventure type anime. Action too."", ""even though i haven't finished this series, i don't even plan to. i stopped after episode 4 because i found that the story is really confusing...it explains the world they are in unclearly. i also find the main character,luke, very dumb and frustrating because he's very spoiled and selfish, but i do understand that he is spoiled since he's been locked up for most of his life. i just cant stand to watch his stupid actions along with a confusing plot that doesn't lead anywhere. -_- thank god i stopped. "", ""After reviewing the Symphonia OVA’s and the Vesperia movie I’ve finally arrived at the only full length Tales adaptations (apart from the one from WAY back in the day; I'm not going to review that). “So, how did it go?”, “Is it any better than the other adaptations?”, “IT’S STILL NOT AS GOOD AS THE GAME!” I hear you cry. Well shut up and let me tell you!The Short Version:(+)There’s blood; I always think this is a good thing.(+)Characters actually grow and change instead of remaining static.(-)It takes too long for the show to kick into gear.(-)The MC is downright unbearable for half the show.(-)The...writing has plot holes; yeah it’s that bad.The Story (6/10): Being a JRPG adaptation, the show starts out pretty simple but then kicks itself into gear to a grander scale and just becomes generally better. With the start of the story you have a lad who is unsatisfied with his life at home when a certain event takes places he’s suddenly transported to the opposite side of the ‘world’ and is now trying to make his way back. The story then evolves into preventing a war for happening between the two major powers in the show, and then even later into something much bigger that a war between to powers. I have one problem with the story, because I haven’t played the game some of the stuff included in this adaptation didn’t make sense to me. “That’s just because you haven’t played the game.” You’d probably say. Well I shouldn’t need to play the game because no matter how good the source material is. If the adaptation can’t stand by itself to deliver the same experience as the source material then the adaptation has failed.The Characters (7/10): This being a JRPG adaptation there’s a fair bit of characters to remember in the sense of who’s tied to who and for what reason, but they’re aren’t so many that it makes the show feel blotted in any way, the main characters take up most of the screen time with the occasional side characters in order to provide some necessary plot development, helping out the main party when needed. In this sense it’s just like a JRPG. Now to do what I normally do and run through the main characters really quick.Luke Fon Fabre: A fucking coward and a spoilt shit until he grows a pair; then he becomes tolerable.Jade Curtiss: A colonel and the one with the most badass nickname.Tear Grants: One time assassin and main love interest.Asch: Someone I feel sorry for and has the lushest red locks ever (for a lad).Guy Cecil: Servant to Luke and gynophobeNatalia Luzu Kimlasca Lanvaldear: Bethored to Luke and….. That’s really the only trait she has.Anise Tatlin: Hyperactive and Puppet-master.Ion: The one with the voice that annoys me and is more of a plot device than a character.This is very much a slow burn type of show when it comes to the characters, because as it goes on the characters change and some of their secrets are revealed, and the MC is a LOT more likeable past the halfway point. For the romance element that this show has, the relationship in question is really quiet baffling in the beginning but then you get past the magical mid-way point and you actually start believing.The Art & Sound (7/10) & (6/10) : If you ever seen a Tales adaptation or an OP from the games you know what you’re in for. The animations for the most part are fine and there’re no real points that are unbearable. A side note that I always like to see in any anime that involves even a little bit of action is if there’s a bit of blood. Not to the point to where you think there’s an entire blood bank stored inside of them, and there’s not so little that a massive gash across the chest is more akin to a pin prick. The character designs, as a whole, are really quite good I felt. The only person who I felt didn’t really have a unique design was Guy because he was designed the same way as the civilians were. But my favourite design would be Asch’s; his red and black cloak just radiates the word BADASS. A quick word of warning to the intolerant, there is CGI in this anime but it isn’t as bad as say…… Kill la kill. (Or anything made by GONZO).I don’t really pay attention to CG so it didn’t bother me too much, but if you’re not a fan of 3D rendering, some scenes aren’t going to sit well with you.The sound is all round pretty solid, nothing in the OST was ground-breaking or great. It was good. Average. Par. Stan- okay I’ll shut up. The voice acting was also done to standard no outstanding performances from the cast, but there was one characters voice that annoyed me to no end.What did you think of this show?Well I’m not buying the show, nor am I buying the game.Would you recommend this show?If you’re a fan of the game, or just the series in general, go right ahead.

There is one guy who helps the enemy, but the main cast lets him escape, then next time he spies on them but, the \'smart glasses guy\' says it\'s not a problem, then a the next episode, said guy brings the bad guys on them, resulting in others dying, then a few episides later said guy heps the main cast.While the...starting point and the end point of the story is clear, the inbetween is murky at best. Enemies survive clearly fatal hits for the sake of plot, the main group has the ability to teleport,  only shown travelling when there is some interaction during, otherwise they can travel as much as half a continent from one scene to the next.Generally it feels like some episodes had material for 2-3 other episodes, while there are some episodes that are just a waste of time, thus the pacing is all over the place.The art and sound are good, but these are about the only things the show got right, though there are some inconsistencies like size differences and ""interesting"" design choices, but I suspect the had to follow already existing designes. The voice acting is mostly good, the annoying character has annoying VA, which I wouldn\'t really put as a negative.The characters are bad, lots of side characters get introduced who barely show up later and don\'t really serve any purpose. The main cast seems forced, most of the things they do are for advancing the plot even at the cost of not staying in character. As already mentioned everyone has some dark secret, which doesn\'t really seem to impact relations, as already mentioned.It\'s not enjoyable at all, I\'ve only finished it to see where it would end up, but should have dropped 4 episodes in. The combat is boring, mostly consisting of talking while hacking at each others sword, then when it\'s time to finish them someone from the main cast defeats/kills the opponent in one hit, there is no casting time or the like, so they could have done so from the start which ruins any suspension. Wounds, even lethal ones, don\'t seem to matter, only if the plot requires the character\'s death.Overall it\'s really bad, you are better off reading the plot somewhere. While it does have interesting concepts it fails to integrate them into the story, there really isn\'t anything special, except the unusually high number of turncoats, it\'s generic magic/fantasy hero saves the world, and bad at that. starting point and the end point of the story is clear, the inbetween is murky at best.

This anime isn't perfect. It's pacing is a little too fast (which I understand, since it has to boil down what is basically 60 straight hours of gameplay) so it feels a bit rushed, it did a few things the game didn't do for foreshadowing plot twists that made them no longer feel that surprising, and it felt a little bit cheesy at times. That being said, I think the story itself just works better as a whole in a JRPG setting.The anime did as...best it could in the format of an anime,  and I'm honestly just happy that my favorite game got a new medium to be presented. The art is overall very pretty, and honestly, it was very enjoyable to watch. I understand why some may not like it (especially those who don't have a connection to the game) but I had a good time, and I think it's fun. World-building is a bit annoying, but the characters are so so loveable and the voice acting is fantastic. best it could in the format of an anime,  and I'm honestly just happy that my favorite game got a new medium to be presented.

With this being said LA looking at Tales of the Abyss looked like a generic fantasy JRPG, however as the anime proceeded and showed more of it\'s characters and world it became something MUCH more, with some baggage here and there.Luke fon Fabre voiced by Chihiro Suzuki getting whisked away early onto the story and him trying to get back home uncovers ALOT of the world with Tear Grants voiced...by Yukana helping him, but it quickly escalates into something HUGE. Of course for a traditional JRPG, party members do join, from Guy Cecil voiced by Yasunori Matsumoto, Luke\'s best friend and servant, Jade Curtiss voiced by DI- Takehito Koyasu, a colonel serving in the Malkuth military and a famous wielder of the Fonic Arts, Fon Master Ion voiced by Yumiko Kobayashi, the Master of the Fon Arts and Leader of the Order of Lorelei along with his minder Anise Tatlin voiced by Haruko Momoi and finally Natalia Luzu Kimlasca Lanvaldear voiced by Michiko Neya, Princess of Kimlasca and fiancee to Luke. Now if you thought LA regurgitating all the information about the main party cast was off, then more or less it\'s the same for the world building early on, key word being ""early on"" as Tales of the Abyss.Before LA talks about the world building, the main party cast\'s development throughout the anime is actually handled nicely, sure at the start it\'s a bit rocky with the anime\'s pacing trying to insert them into the party with little to no personality about them, but it\'s as the party goes on their journey through wars, civil battles and a religious upheaval does the seams on some of the party cast unfold on themselves, both in terms of different incidents past and present or characters interactions that causes them to open you and make the cast likeable even with their bland personalities at the start. The biggest and major problem with the characters however is Luke as at the start he was probably the most annoying bratty asshole character in the party, sure Luke\'s state of personality does come up as a subtle nod with some plot twists but nonetheless it made him out to be an utter asshole, however he works for and earns his redemption as the anime goes along, in a ways it\'s sorta similar to Tidus from FFX and his change of personalities as his journey went along as well. To say that ""Luke gets better"" becomes an understatement as he truly does become the hero of this story. As for LA\'s favourite character...hmmm had to either Tear or Natalia.Now much like traditional JRPG\'s, the minor characters as well as the antagonists has ties to the party cast in one form or another that does move the plot forward and give alot of the party\'s cast member\'s grievances and trouble physical form as it were, with the supporting minor characters doing what they do best, support the main party members, so for the minor cast sure they are used plot-wise but expected for a traditional JRPG, while the antagonists roles and affect to the plot, well move the plot and characters forward, so nonetheless the entire cast have uses and links to the main cast one way or another which is decently done if not expectedly so.Onto the world building, well much like the flaws of the characters personalities early on, the world building DOES at the start just regurgitate information to us thinking we know what they are talking about, sure for those who played the game, it\'s obvious but for outsiders coming in, the throwing of terms and the like did felt like they were just explaining without much respite. But where Tales of the Abyss\' world building works out is how the information the audience gathered goes full circle as we get used to the terminology (something that was hard to get around early on for LA) thus making the world building of Tales of the Abyss excellently done to this end. However one last nitpick about the world building would be that the world building ""elements"" does conveniently show up and with Jade being the resident exposition fairy considering his knowledge of the world and everything does come into effect BUT that\'s traditional JRPG\'s for ya.Tales of the Abyss is actually if anything one of the more darker Tales of anime if it\'s successors Tales of Zestiria (the only one LA watched before Abyss) is to go by, from the religious upheaval, minor characters dying off or slained to THOUSANDS of people dying, it\'s definitely one fo the darker Tales of. To coincide with this, like traditional JRPG about saving the world, well we also have themes of free will and of being chained to fate and fakes and how their existence are to the world and with how Tales of the Abyss is structured, namely towards it\'s world building and it\'s focus on characters too, these themes run DEEP to both elements and done again quite well too.The animation done by Sunrise was decently from the distinct character designs, atmosphere and ok battles, there were the occasional 3DCGI used but ONLY used with the larger mechanical elements to used sparingly well to that end. The battles were just decent overall and to evoke the traditional turn based JRPG, the animation did go a bit flashy at times but for LA it was merely decent enough. Overall for a Sunrise venture the animation was just decent, nothing to brag home about.The voice cast were decent as well with some well known veterans at the time, with Takehito Koyasu as Jade, Joji Nakata as Van Grants with Yukana as Tear being well known in her role as CC from Code Geass. Even with that and with the HUGE voice cast in Tale sof the Abyss LA might as well go into LA\'s MVP\'s of this anime, that being Chihiro Suzuki as Luke, Yukana as Tear and Joji Nakata as Van, though LA will give Haruko Momoi as Anise and Michiko Neya as Natalia some props as well with their performances.Tales of the Abyss has some early problems but as the story progresses and you get invested in the world of Tales of the Abyss and it\'s party cast, things just falls into place and makes the anime much more investable and enjoyable, mitigating most of the flaws at the beginning of the anime, with LA feeling a nice tinge of traditional JRPG ala Final Fantasy X with a hint of IX in there.Tales of the Abyss looks like another generic fantasy JRPG anime adaptation and for it being a pretty decent retelling of it, LA will give the anime some decent praise, but looking deeper into it and the story it had in store, well colored LA surprised that LA actually really invested (namely Luke wanting redemption and his entire redemption arc is when the anime started to get really good) and even before then, what the story did before was good setup as confusing as it was with all the terminology.Nonetheless Tales of the Abyss was a fine adaptation of the game and LA will say this for most video game to anime adaptations, and in the case of Tales of the Abyss, but trying to retell EVERYTHING from the story and the like spanning 64+ hours into a 26 episodes, they would cut the minor details out and this is coming from someone who didn\'t play the game and LA is looking at this as an outsider looking in. Tales of the Abyss was the black sheep of the series for some time, but has now in the time of LA writing this anime, has grown to be a respected title when before it was just ""meh"" also considering the much more widely beloved Tales of Symphonia (another Tales of LA need to watch at some point) came out AFTER Tales of the Abyss but with all the praise LA has given it much like the fanbase with it\'s well constructed world and characters and being one of the darker titles until Tales of Beseria. Tales of the Abyss LA will reiterate a fine anime adaptation, flaws and all...much like Luke.Why is it called Tales of THE ABYSS?...well ""if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you."" by Yukana helping him, but it quickly escalates into something HUGE.

Tales of the Abyss LA will reiterate a fine anime adaptation, flaws and all...much like Luke.Why is it called Tales of THE ABYSS?...well ""if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.""', 'TLDR, I generally enjoyed watching this series but overall it was just, fine.Now on to the review. I did not play the game so I essentially went in blind/fresh.Is an anime series considered a success if it successfully triggers contextually accurate emotions in the viewer? Some would say it is and I would generally agree, but in the case of this anime, I\'d say it was a little overdone and it ends up working against itself.Premise/StoryOn the surface, Tales of the Abyss ticks all the boxes for my kind of anime. It has elements of action, fantasy, adventure, magic and a touch...of romance. It certainly is an interesting take on the age old premise of ""young spoiled brat goes through stuff, grows up and tries to save the world"", but beyond the interesting approach, the story is quite predictable like most anime these days.The primary let down of the series, and quite common with ""just fine"" anime in general, is how the entire plot is based on events that could have been avoided by simple communication. X knows something Y doesn\'t, has no real reason to not tell Y what it is, yet has many opportunities to do so but chooses not to, and by the time Y finds out it\'s too late. This formula is repeated multiple times throughout virtually the entire series and at times I was left wondering what the point of the whole preceding act was.Nonetheless, the story development is decent. It evolves into a story of the struggles between ends vs means and how 2 sides may want the same end but their means differ so much that they are willing to kill one another or die because of it.CharactersMost of the character development is fed to you in ""Oh dang! Plot twist!"" style moments which gets old when used too much. I have also never watched an anime where practically all the good guys are so hypocritical. The MC is heavily chastised for not thinking for himself and when he did eventually try to think for himself he was either silenced, brushed off or chastised once again by the very same characters. This is where the question at the start of my review stems from. I did really come to dislike the characters that I was meant to dislike, abit too much. So much so that when redemption came knocking, going along with it felt too forced, but I went along with it anyway.Now we run into the next problem: The supporting characters did such a good job at fanning the flames of dislike that by the time said redeemed characters become likable again, it almost felt like the rest of the cast didnt deserve to be associated with them. This made it hard to genuinely like some of the characters which the story eventually intended for the viewer to like.That being said, it wasn\'t all bad. The series does dive pretty deep into the history and motivations for some of its characters and there are a few that I did end up liking, ironically one of them being the MC. Taking a step back and looking at the cards he was dealt and what he needed to do, I ended up really sympathizing with his situation and rooting for him. There were also some plot twists that, while predictable, were well executed and justified.ConclusionThis may sound like a bad review but as I mentioned at the start, I did enjoy watching it general, it ticked the right genre boxes for me and had just enough to make it enjoyable. So I give it a 6/10, i.e. Ok to watch if you have time to kill and like the genres and themes. of romance. It certainly is an interesting take on the age old premise of ""young spoiled brat goes through stuff, grows up and tries to save the world"", but beyond the interesting approach, the story is quite predictable like most anime these days.The primary let down of the series, and quite common with ""just fine"" anime in general, is how the entire plot is based on events that could have been avoided by simple communication.

The MC is heavily chastised for not thinking for himself and when he did eventually try to think for himself he was either silenced, brushed off or chastised once again by the very same characters. This is where the question at the start of my review stems from. I did really come to dislike the characters that I was meant to dislike, abit too much. So much so that when redemption came knocking, going along with it felt too forced, but I went along with it anyway.Now we run into the next problem: The supporting characters did such a good job at fanning the flames of dislike that by the time said redeemed characters become likable again, it almost felt like the rest of the cast didnt deserve to be associated with them. This made it hard to genuinely like some of the characters which the story eventually intended for the viewer to like.That being said, it wasn\'t all bad. The series does dive pretty deep into the history and motivations for some of its characters and there are a few that I did end up liking, ironically one of them being the MC. Taking a step back and looking at the cards he was dealt and what he needed to do, I ended up really sympathizing with his situation and rooting for him. There were also some plot twists that, while predictable, were well executed and justified.ConclusionThis may sound like a bad review but as I mentioned at the start, I did enjoy watching it general, it ticked the right genre boxes for me and had just enough to make it enjoyable. So I give it a 6/10, i.e. Ok to watch if you have time to kill and like the genres and themes.', 'Pretty much the same as the game, which is really good.. the characters developments are really great, great story, great music, especially the ending music, really worth every seconds of my time to watch it.. by far the best tales series for me, really blew my mind..enjoyed this with my family and no complaints at all.. everything were spot on, although I would really love to see more than the ending, probably will be much better to see more after the ending..Pretty much the same as the game, which is really good.. the characters developments are really great, great story, great music, especially the...ending music, really worth every seconds of my time to watch it.. by far the best tales series for me, really blew my mind..enjoyed this with my family and no complaints at all.. everything were spot on, although I would really love to see more than the ending, probably will be much better to see more after the ending.. ending music, really worth every seconds of my time to watch it.. by far the best tales series for me, really blew my mind..enjoyed this with my family and no complaints at all.. everything were spot on, although I would really love to see more than the ending, probably will be much better to see more after the ending..', 'Recommendation: This show was so much fun to watch. The plot is pretty bonkers and the characters are interesting, so it gets an unqualified thumbs up from me for anyone that likes fantasy anime.Positives:+ Wild story full of twists and turns that you won\'t see coming.  Once you get into the meat of the story, almost every episode has at least one ""oh shit what"" moment.  For me, the viewing experience was something like watching Code Geass, or more recently, Back Arrow.  It just keeps escalating with crazy plot twists until it gets really weird, and it\'s so much fun to just...be along for the ride.+ Interesting flawed protagonist in Luke.  He\'s a spoiled little rich kid at first, and his party likes him overall, but gets exasperated with his arrogance and some of his antics.  I\'ll keep it vague to avoid spoilers, but this essentially directly leads to him making a terrible and unforgivable mistake, which then leads to his own friends abandoning him in disgust.  Some valuable context is added to explain why he is the way he is, and much of the rest of the series is about him attempting to rebuild the trust he broke with his comrades earlier in the series.  It\'s an interesting and somewhat unique way to present a protagonist, because he is a genuinely loathsome figure at times, and I actually thought they were going to kill him off or make him a villain and have a new protagonist (that being Asch) at one point.  But by the end of the series, he\'s earned back the respect of both the characters and the audience.  It\'s a very well developed and satisfying character arc.+ Other characters get good development over the course of the series as well.  In particular, I liked what they did with Princess Natalia.  She\'s presented early on as the sort of ""childhood friend that\'s bound to lose"" archetype, being engaged to Luke from birth as a matter of royal politics but with no romantic feelings between them.  But her character develops largely independent of Luke (this isn\'t a harem series after all), and the matter of her parentage that comes up midway through the series really elevates her as one of the best characters in a series that has several.+ The OP and ED are both bops.+ The voice acting is strong throughout, but the highlight is of course Jouji Nakata hamming it up in the way that only he can as Van, Luke\'s mentor and swordfighting teacher.+ Animation and artwork is quite good, easily on par with or exceeding modern standards even though it came out roughly 15 years ago as I write this review.  The CGI doesn\'t look amazing, but again, I\'ve seen far worse in anime airing in 2022.  There aren\'t a ton of extended fight scenes, but the ones that exist are well-directed and animated, dynamic and exciting.  The little things like background art, city and building design, and so forth, are all very creative and nicely done.Negatives:- Mieu, the little floating mascot character, is useless and annoying.  He has no reason to be in any scene, adds nothing of value, and his overly cutesy voice is extremely grating.  It\'s kiddie shit in a series that should be above that.- Inconsistent worldbuilding.  They will do things like going into great detail in explaining a peripherally-important system called Planet Storm that circulates Seventh Fonons around the world, but then not actually explain what Seventh Fonons are, which is a major part of the series lore.  It seems to just be a fancy word for magic particles from what I could put together, but there\'s a lot of missing context.  Like are there 6 other kinds of fonons?  We may never know.- Cast size is a bit too large.  It\'s not a huge problem, but it can be difficult to keep track of who everyone is at times and what their significance is, and I imagine it would be even more so if you were watching week by week instead of watching the whole thing in 2 weeks like I did.  Just a handful fewer characters would make a big difference. be along for the ride.+ Interesting flawed protagonist in Luke.

The Sky Crawlers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3089/The_Sky_Crawlers,"[""STORY - The Sky Crawlers is a thinking movie. It’s a cynical commentary where there is so much more going on underneath the surface than you might initially think. Walking into it with no real idea as to what it was about, I was both tried by its deceptive slow pacing and amazed by its eventual depth, relevance, and poignancy. The movie follows the life of Yuichi Kannami after he’s transferred to a small military outpost in a setting similar to WWII-era Europe. He and his comrades are fighting a war, but appear largely indifferent to both their occasional dogfights and everyday life. However, from...the start, Kannami appears to be haunted by the ghost of the man he’s replaced — a soldier that had been killed, though his plane remains for Kannami to fly.The story unravels with no real urgency, but something always seems to be off. Events occur in a disconnected and puzzling fashion. The pacing would suggest that the film is only showing something boring and ordinary, but that’s obviously not the case. Gradually, it becomes clear that the characters appear to be caught in an infinite loop of actions and lives. They’ve been there before. They’ve done that before. They are who they’ve always been, never changing, and without regard for anything in the past or future. They have died before. They have lived before. Themes of repetition, disconnection, meaning, childhood, and adulthood appear, chastising a refusal to change or evolve and those who have become complacent. They are themes that can be related to other issues, such as the human condition and post-industrial disillusionment, and the film makes a suiting metaphor for a number of parallels.It’s difficult to say where the story ends up thematically without revealing too much, but suffice to say that it’s a tidy package with a well-done, albeit cynical, conclusion. A call to action, perhaps. Mamoru Oshii is known for his heavy films, but this is the first that’s really struck a chord with me. Be sure to stay through to the end of the credits for the final punch.CHARACTERS - It’s appropriate, I suppose, that I find it difficult to see the characters in The Sky Crawlers as actual people. They are odd entities, vehicles for a story, and portrayals of something that isn’t quite real enough or human enough to be called a person. Kannami is curious about his predecessor, but not too curious. He might ask questions, but seems perfectly content to let the issue drop if an answer is denied. Still, his apparent apathy and complacency is easy to latch on to and you remain curious even if he doesn’t seem to care. You want him to care, you wish he would, and you react to the subtly disturbing mood of the film: the quiet unchangingness of everything.Kusanagi first appears to be similarly indifferent, but there is a coldness and desperation to her that permeates the stoic exterior. She’s creepy. She becomes the first sign that something is not quite right about the environment, the situation, and distantly, the war they’re all fighting. She’s the one that seems to know what’s going on. Of course that must be why she and Kannami seem drawn to one another, but that strange deception exposes itself in expository dialogue so blatant that it’s almost alarming. And throughout it all, forced apathy reigns supreme. They are interesting foils, mostly because they are not so different at all.ARTSTYLE & ANIMATION - To be honest, despite the various recommendations I’ve received for this movie, one of the original reasons I was ever interested was because I’d been shown much of the concept art in a class and really wanted to see the film attached to it. The backgrounds, environments, and animation in The Sky Crawlers are all beautiful. Interiors are lush with detail and very intricate, though often, the abundance of little things makes the larger scene appear awkward. For example, the doors may have detailed ridges and corners, but they’re also gigantic and oddly proportioned compared to the people. Similarly, the fighter jets and vehicles are slick and look incredibly convincing and the dogfights are beautifully animated… but then you notice that their designs are very peculiar — all of the propellers are on the back, which makes no logical sense at all. They might look nice, but if they were actually constructed, they would never fly.Addendum -- So I've been informed (thanks, jotunheim) that there were apparently a handful of WWII-era planes designed to be propelled by rear-end propellers such as the Saab 21 and Kyushu J7W Shinden. The physics of these things still baffles me, but I'm not an engineer, so this is an interesting discovery. In any case, I suppose my revised view is that it's a compelling design choice for the Sky Crawlers -- despite that the planes actually existed, they weren't common and that perhaps adds to the slew of things that are just a little off about the movie -- something to make you a little uncomfortable and wonder a little more. Something not quite right, but possible.As usual, the price of fancy environments is simple characters. The limited cast of characters in the movie all have exceedingly simple designs, though all are extremely effective, especially Kusanagi, who strikes you as odd and slightly off-kilter from her design alone. The plainness of Kannami is also significant in that it makes him nearly anonymous. There are no features that might distinguish him from any other man; he is interchangeable, replaceable, and in many ways, relate-able. Particularly for this kind of story, the anonymity and capacity for audience sympathy in the character design alone goes a long way.MUSIC - I’m generally a fan of Kenji Kawai’s work, so it’s no real surprise that I enjoyed The Sky Crawler’s poignant, and often subtle, soundtrack. Many of its tracks are drawn out and thoughtful, accompanying similar scenes for maximum effect. They’re eerie and occasionally force a feeling of anticipation. Action scenes are highlighted by fast-paced and shrieking violins, punctuating every twirl of a jet plane and burst of firing. It’s all wonderfully appropriate. Additionally, The Sky Crawlers had some very well placed silence, which is likely something you don’t notice that often. Some scenes are long and slow and completely silent save the stray sound effect — they are disconcerting in a way, but both force you to focus both on the immediacy of what’s going on and allow you time to think about and collect everything else that’s happened. It’s very effective silence.The ending theme, “Konya mo Hoshi ni Dakarete…” by Ayaka, has a lot of similarities with the music in the rest of the movie and is therefore also quite fitting. Ayaka’s voice is rather nostalgic and the soft piano is both peaceful and sad; in the latter part of the song, the energy picks up considerably before resigning again, which fits oddly well with the pacing of the movie itself.VOICE ACTING – I’ve only seen this subbed, but both Kannami and Kusanagi are wonderfully portrayed and have a great balance of conflicting and confused emotions, which is especially surprising since neither of their voice actors seem to have any other credits.OVERALL - The Sky Crawlers is fascinating exploration of a lot of ideas I probably couldn’t do justice trying to describe or explain. The most important thing is to be receptive to those ideas and to not try and force the film into any pre-imagined mold. Despite the dogfights, most of the action here takes place internally; once again, this is a thinking movie with classical themes that are sure to bridge interests and culture gaps. If you like to think, if you like philosophy, psychology, and human nature (certainly, this is a human v. human story), you’ll probably enjoy The Sky Crawlers. the start, Kannami appears to be haunted by the ghost of the man he’s replaced — a soldier that had been killed, though his plane remains for Kannami to fly.The story unravels with no real urgency, but something always seems to be off.

It’s a topical and timely subtext, especially during one scene where a conflict is taking place on a screen in a...local pub in replacement of the more traditional game of football.There is so much attention to detail, as expected of Production I.G., but juxtaposed against the bland character designs it’s distracting how good it is.  The characters themselves are so lifeless, their dialogue so perfunctory, the voice acting so bored, it really is a struggle to watch them lounge around an airfield chugging away at cigarettes.Almost an hour and a half into the movie it’s revealed that director Mamoru Oshii was directing a romantic drama on the boil, though unfortunately for the viewer the heat was on low the entire time, thus making us endure the pointlessly glacial pace filled with ineffective scenes that don’t survive repeat watches.A slow pace in of itself is not a bad thing, but something worthwhile being conveyed in every second and frame is essential, vivid characters are essential, and Sky Crawlers lacks them for most of the running time making the pace a chore to get through rather than an immersive experience that other directors, like famed live-action director Takeshi Kitano, excel at.Back to anime though, Oshii himself has handled this difficult balance of pace and content well with his two previous major anime films, but this time it doesn’t work.  With his Ghost in the Shell films, the pace served as a montage to show the unique environment to the viewer, and to also allow the viewer time to breathe and pause, time to contemplate the heavy philosophy conveyed in the film, but with Sky Crawlers there's nothing to contemplate except for superficial thoughts like 'what happened to the previous pilot?', ‘what are kildrens?’, etc.  Hardly so important as to slow the brakes of the film to allow us time to chew it over.Oshii manages to direct the story well without resorting to heavy exposition, the narrative proceeds with characters moving the story forward, but then when that point comes where the story comes to the boil, he resorts to having a character basically waffle revelations and exposition to the viewer.It’s a shame and again relegates anime behind live action movies, most of which would choose to simply continue to let the characters drive the story forward and let the mysteries of the film become apparent more fluidly rather than in the forced anime nature of having a character basically stare at the camera and just give an unnatural speech.It’s a competently made film with a decent story, and although Oshii’s directing method is always a divider of viewers, it’s not the issue this time round.  The biggest problem is that the screenplay needed a few more redrafts before being green-lit for production, because there is no good reason for the way it’s been paced for the first hour and a half, especially considering the lack of unique and bold world design on show.Good films should make efficient use of their running time.  Great films should have something worthwhile to convey in every single frame.  Sky Crawlers has many wasted frames that could have been used in other ways.Crawling around a futurescape ala Ghost in the Shell is impressive, but crawling around the sky and a depressing airfield populated by animated mannequins for two hours is not, no matter how visceral the aerial dogfights are, how superb the sound production by Skywalker studios is, or how romantic you consider the ultimate story in the end. local pub in replacement of the more traditional game of football.There is so much attention to detail, as expected of Production I.G., but juxtaposed against the bland character designs it’s distracting how good it is.

Though a few battle scenes are depicted, most of the film follows a slow, almost languid pace, showing the interactions between Kannami and the small cast of characters of the film, most importantly the base commander, Kusanagi Suito. Over the ensuing days, through the use of slowly moving dialogues and long stretches of silence, rather a few questions are raised on the 'Kildren', their existence and meaning, only a few of which are answered, and, more importantly, attention is given to Kusanagi and the results of her having lived for longer than she perhaps should have. On an interesting note, one major question is left both answered and unanswered: those viewers preferring to see the question unanswered can safely turn the film off when the end titles start rolling, while those who prefer to see an answer can watch the little scene afterwards.Ostensibly, The Sky Crawlers seems to wax philosophical on the nature of war, mentioning how it is a clean, brutal way of determining winners and losers in whatever game, political or otherwise, is played. Yet, for being constructed around a message on war, there is very little focus on the actual military situation in the story or the battles themselves. Yes, there are a few scenes containing aerial dogfights and a campaign briefing, but they are very short and tend to serve more as scene markers (more on this later).There is, however, another message, hidden in plain sight. The message is not deep. It is not novel. In fact, everyone watching the film will have the feeling of having seen exactly the same story once before. The Sky Crawlers is simply about interaction between humans - and about interaction between those who can't be called exactly human. The film voices once more the questions of what happiness is, what the effects of change (external and internal) are on it, how it is achieved and, most importantly, how it can be recognised at all. In order to do so, it shows the differences between those who are able to understand both human interaction and human emotion, acting upon it in a natural fashion, and those who have either never had or have lost this ability to understand, to whom it is not natural. Thus, no matter how suggestive a situation, nothing will happen if it is not clearly expressed or shown and no action will be taken unless it has been discussed or asked, while even on acting the hesitation and unease remains.The effect of this is that those who have an ability to read between lines will undoubtedly be particularly unimpressed by what happens and the slow pace in which the story progresses, but also that those who do need the whole sentence are exposed to scenes that, because they are clearly expressed and/or aided by visual markers, become very powerful in their clarity, at times perhaps even touching uneasily on the recognisable.It is in this view that the film is strongest and the role of Oshii Mamoru as a visual director appears most clearly. It is no coincidence that one of the greater truths voiced in the film is shown through almost glazed eyes, voiced by a Kusanagi who is pale and dishevelled and clearly has had to much to drink, speaking with that lack of inhibition and that truthfulness of the drunk. It is no coincidence that the intrinsic emotional violence of the passionate encounter is accompanied by the visual promise of physical violence. And while it is a coincidence that the female protagonist is named Kusanagi, her striking resemblance to one of Innocence's gynoids is too strong to be a coincidence, and so it is not surprising to see her with an almost child-like body, a mature poise and an old mind, both as human and as inhuman as that other Kusanagi is.The film strongly uses both time and space to place its protagonists and enhance their being in the world and their being special. Again, both are clearly presented visually. Most of the film is set in the countryside of what is clearly the British Isles, most likely Britain but perhaps Ireland. It is wholly unclear in what time the film should be set. On the one hand, the advent of world peace and the existence of the Kildren may point to some future date, yet on the other the aeroplanes that we see are all propeller-driven while a prominent car looks suspiciously like one of the big American 1950s vehicles, suggesting an alternate near past. Finally, the map hanging in the commander's office shows present-day Europe.Whatever the exact time period in which the film is placed, visual markers abound in marking the progress of time, showing both how things change and how things are eternally unchanging: the film shows the characters amidst standing stones, some marked with glyphs, legacies of an ancient past; before the typical dry-stone hedges of the British countryside and collections of chinaware, common in a past that is closer to us; and in a roadside diner where the people of the present day congregate. The same sky rolls over all these temporal markers in an essentially flat land, as day follows unchangeably on day and the markers of the past form part of the spatial realm of the present. In the same vein the viewer is shown paintings of past people hanging in a restaurant, looking over the shoulder of the present characters, while a monologue is uttered on how some things never change.Spatially, most scenes are cramped in only a few places, connected to each other by societal and economic ties, and the characters move between their barracks, the diner, a brothel and the countryside. Only once in the entire film is a larger settlement shown and for most of the film there is a striking lack of people. It is interesting to note that the mercenaries (and what might almost be termed their camp followers), Japanese all, are shown to speak two languages, Japanese amongst themselves and English to the locals. In this manner is shown how the protagonists differ from their surrounding society that comes on top of their being Kildren, ensuring a type of clinging together.Because of all this, the concept of change looms large. Living in what is essentially a foreign country, in an area where past and present seem to flow together, the close-knit group of Kildren roam from one placid day to another, while due to their longevity they ought to see the same drama played out time and again, whatever the small changes over time, as well as the same groping for what is essentially simply not well understood.Change, both temporal and spatial, is quite often accompanied by more action-oriented scenes. Travel and, especially, the few combat scenes in the film have a tendency to serve more as markers separating one time period or area from the following, fast-forwarding as it were the story for a moment.The characters, as well, are defined by change, or the lack thereof. Long-living, the Kildren's physique simply stops developing at some point, the question remaining whether the mind follows suit. The difference in attitude on aging and changing is what defines both protagonists, Kannami and Kusanagi, and drives much of their interaction. The former emphasises continuously that he is child, still, and entitled to be one, given that he might die at any moment in battle. Thus, he seems to shirk much of an adult's sense of responsibility, not by actively refusing but by not getting involved. Kusanagi, on the other hand, older and with a better sense of time's progress, and, most importantly, being confronted with actions of the past, seems to stand in between child- and adulthood, unwilling to take responsibility but unable to refuse it, in the end having both more to lose and less to look forward to. The result is that the two interact in an atmosphere of palpable carefulness, melancholy and distance, avoiding getting hurt while suggesting offering closer companionship.All remaining characters seem to function more as walking commentators, divulging snippets of the past without mentioning their own roles therein. Most remain rather flat when compared to the expressed mess the more noticeable characters are in and, even with a hint of an unpropitious romance offered later on, remain really asides. It is telling that one character that is never shown but only referred to seems to be more developed than most of the characters with speaking roles. That said, while development is rather non-existent and characterisation doesn't go beyond each having a clear role, these roles are executed very well and each fulfil a function in the story.With regard to the art and animation used, the film can be called a hybrid of typical Oshii style and the style favoured by Production I.G in its latest releases. Throughout the film the audience is treated to wide, open vistas of mostly empty countryside. Especially under the intensely blue, cloud-specked skies that dominate many such shots, both buildings and people are kept very small. When the screen shows all in a more human scale, however, the relative emptiness is being replaced by a profusion of detail. Not only is every crack in every wooden beam of some little room visible, but most spaces that are worked and lived in are veritably cluttered with all kinds of apparel, embellishments and personal belongings, capturing the eye in most of the many silent, languid scenes that the film is filled with. Some such trappings, especially the seemingly omnipresent chinaware plates and vases might hint at symbolism, at some meaning, but nothing is explained or even mentioned.Equally noticeable between the scenes on a grander and on a more human scale is the difference in colourisation. Whereas, barring some rainy skies, though even here rays of sunshine flitter through, the open vistas are coloured in with the brighter spectrum of the colour palette, both soft and sharp, especially the indoor scenes are shadowy, gloomy, sometimes even drab, with all brighter dashes as well being generally more dark of tone in their crimsons and navy blues, the rare light bulb orange and pallid white only giving this stronger emphasis.In sharp contrast to their detailed surroundings, the characters themselves seem to follow the standard used by Production I.G in their newer releases (Ghost Hound, Toshokan Sensou, et al.), being drawn with a paucity of lines, leaving especially the face as devoid of details as possible. While this has been used to great effect in other shows, where the style provides for the wide range of very visually recognisable expressions asked of the characters, The Sky Crawlers is almost minimalist in this regard, thus leaving the characters rather empty of detail. Mostly likely deliberately, this applies more strongly to the Kildren than to the ‘normal’ humans presented.As far as design of especially the backgrounds go it seems that the makers opted for realism, even if they went out of their way to prevent having any area entered that can be recognised as actually existing. The realism of setting, even if embellished at times up to a point where it starts deviating from reality, is apparent in almost all details, especially of contraptions of human make. The main exception is formed by the aeroplanes, which for the most part are unlike any that have been in general, active use, added, almost, as if only in this manner can they befit the equally unreal Kildren.Clearly being intended as a theatrical release, The Sky Crawlers seems to want to disturb your neighbours. Volume levels vary disparately, with sound effects, especially those of the aeroplane engines, being louder by far than music, which in turn has a tendency to overwhelm the voices. The net result is an assault on one’s hearing, especially as one sometimes has to strain to hear what is said.It doesn’t help that the orchestral pieces that form most of the music is rather lacklustre, accompanied at times by the sort of female chanting that composer Kenji Kawai famously used in the Ghost in the Shell films, which is quite out of place in this film. On the other hand, quite a few scenes are unaccompanied by music. In fact, the film toys with meaningful silences overly much, thereby removing their meaning, though at least then the dialogue is more pleasant to listen to.The voices are mainly subdued, as per the story at many times properly devoid of extremes in expression.The Sky Crawlers shook me far more strongly than it ought to have done, all things considered. As has been mentioned above, the interplay between what is said and what is shown on screen is at times strong enough to make for very memorable scenes, especially because the film manages, at times, to visualise some of the concepts it mentions. For all that it might have a predictable story, has a pace that is at times too slow for its own good, has emotions enter the fray in explosive amounts when at all and does not voice anything that can be considered innovative, the questions raised on change and happiness, on how change affects humanity and is needed for continuation remain important ones. As so often with this type of film, it is not the happiest of stories, but there is a certain serenity in its calm sadness. where he is seen settling in amongst his new surroundings. Though a few battle scenes are depicted, most of the film follows a slow, almost languid pace, showing the interactions between Kannami and the small cast of characters of the film, most importantly the base commander, Kusanagi Suito. Over the ensuing days, through the use of slowly moving dialogues and long stretches of silence, rather a few questions are raised on the 'Kildren', their existence and meaning, only a few of which are answered, and, more importantly, attention is given to Kusanagi and the results of her having lived for longer than she perhaps should have. On an interesting note, one major question is left both answered and unanswered: those viewers preferring to see the question unanswered can safely turn the film off when the end titles start rolling, while those who prefer to see an answer can watch the little scene afterwards.Ostensibly, The Sky Crawlers seems to wax philosophical on the nature of war, mentioning how it is a clean, brutal way of determining winners and losers in whatever game, political or otherwise, is played. Yet, for being constructed around a message on war, there is very little focus on the actual military situation in the story or the battles themselves. Yes, there are a few scenes containing aerial dogfights and a campaign briefing, but they are very short and tend to serve more as scene markers (more on this later).There is, however, another message, hidden in plain sight. The message is not deep. It is not novel. In fact, everyone watching the film will have the feeling of having seen exactly the same story once before. The Sky Crawlers is simply about interaction between humans - and about interaction between those who can't be called exactly human. The film voices once more the questions of what happiness is, what the effects of change (external and internal) are on it, how it is achieved and, most importantly, how it can be recognised at all. In order to do so, it shows the differences between those who are able to understand both human interaction and human emotion, acting upon it in a natural fashion, and those who have either never had or have lost this ability to understand, to whom it is not natural. Thus, no matter how suggestive a situation, nothing will happen if it is not clearly expressed or shown and no action will be taken unless it has been discussed or asked, while even on acting the hesitation and unease remains.The effect of this is that those who have an ability to read between lines will undoubtedly be particularly unimpressed by what happens and the slow pace in which the story progresses, but also that those who do need the whole sentence are exposed to scenes that, because they are clearly expressed and/or aided by visual markers, become very powerful in their clarity, at times perhaps even touching uneasily on the recognisable.It is in this view that the film is strongest and the role of Oshii Mamoru as a visual director appears most clearly. It is no coincidence that one of the greater truths voiced in the film is shown through almost glazed eyes, voiced by a Kusanagi who is pale and dishevelled and clearly has had to much to drink, speaking with that lack of inhibition and that truthfulness of the drunk. It is no coincidence that the intrinsic emotional violence of the passionate encounter is accompanied by the visual promise of physical violence. And while it is a coincidence that the female protagonist is named Kusanagi, her striking resemblance to one of Innocence's gynoids is too strong to be a coincidence, and so it is not surprising to see her with an almost child-like body, a mature poise and an old mind, both as human and as inhuman as that other Kusanagi is.The film strongly uses both time and space to place its protagonists and enhance their being in the world and their being special.

I’m tired of this endless cycle…The Sky Crawlers is a movie about genetically altered humans beings called Kildren (kill+children) who can never grow and are bound to endless aerial battles in an alternate historic period. This is a standard synopsis, the real one is that this is a story about meaning of the existence, wars, love, suicide, destiny, and emptiness.It’s not a movie for general public taste; actually, most of people will probably want to give up on the movie before the first hour, since even though it’s a movie with war as a central subject and...has some battles, the development is somewhat slow. The silence of their empty lives almost dominates the entire movie and the great moments are like slices of their lives; nothing really outstanding by an action point of view, but really deep in a psychological one.Having said that, the visual effects are really something else. The air battles are truly well done, and the 3D effects catch the eyes. It’s a partnership between Warner Brothers and I.G., so this is not so surprising. Besides, it’s from the same director of the Ghost in the Shell movies. The OST is just beautiful. There are a lot of variations of the main theme, from piano to harp, and most of the songs are depressing. There are the ones fitted for battle, and the ones fitted for sadness.As an adaptation of a novel, the development of the plot sometimes seems to have some flaws. As a matter of fact, the series’ author said that this was the most difficult of his works to adapt. But these “flaws” are almost part of the charm of the movie; you’ll receive some answers, but you will still wonder about a lot of unsettled things.They don’t know who they’re fighting against nor why – a reflection about war itself. The main characters are just children, but they have to act like adults, and this paradox is explored all the time. They go to places like a brothel, but at the same time they like engaging in childish activity, such as playing with toys. All of them try to fill their emptiness with something: Yuichi Kannami, the main character, doesn’t even remember his past, so all he does is trying to comprehend why he’s there, their purpose. Kusanagi, a female commander, has a morbid point of view, always caring a gun to commit suicide or murder.They kill in the air, but on earth they’re just like normal human beings - the sky is like a cage to these birds.

Lucky.I\'m not sure really what the other reviewers saw in this movie, giving it a 9 and an 8 but I know full well it didn\'t get that for me.The story is the only saving grace for this movie. But the way it was presented was like shit (sorry but that\'s the word that comes to mind). Your sort of introduced to these kids who fly aircraft and you get the gist of the story bit by bit, but I was confused for the entire first half of the movie until...things started to get...serious. (But there was hardly any emotion AT ALL that I\'m not sure serious is what they were). And after I looked up descriptions of the people and the background I finally was able to piece things together. That and I figured out what the plot was and how it was going to end. Which is not how an epic anime is. I shouldn\'t be able to predict the end so quickly. The plot: These Kildren are here for one reason, and that is to fight for the \'adults\'. That\'s the generic basic plot. But after watching the movie in full I understood the point of the movie and I thought it was very well done. Something that people think about but don\'t go into detail. There\'s also a...romantic love tale behind it. But it was so non-existent that I didn\'t know it was there until I realized that \'HEY! There supposed to be....blah blah"" (trying not to spoil). But the way it was presented movie style was just horrible. It makes me want to read the novels because I\'m sure there much much better.The art gets a 7 because of the CGI moments. The flight scenes, among others, were very real and life like and the characters had their own uniqueness about them, but the size of those very round chins (reminded me of manju buns) bothered me to no end. That\'s about the only flaw in art I found in the movie. Otherwise the art was nothing to complain about.The sound? Well what can I complain about? There was none. I have never encountered a movie that had no background music before. It reminded me of 5 Centimeters Per Second in that aspect but 5CPS had sound when it was needed and that movie is epic to me. There was music for moments that needed it and there was no music for those that already had enough impact with the story. Sky Crawlers needed music. The entire movie (okay except for literally TWO scenes) there was no music. Whatsoever. Although it sort of gives it a realistic feel because in life we have no theme song to our moments, but honestly? That\'s one of the reasons I watch anime. The music is what gives the shows beauty and flavor. That in my opinion is the maker of an epic anime. And without music I can\'t be pulled in the story and I can\'t get emotionally involved with the characters.Now the characters are also a downfall in my opinion. It wasn\'t as bad as the music, but I just couldn\'t get involved with this anime! Seriously, the people were so bland and they had no facial expressions (except for Naofumi, he was a character) so I couldn\'t really tell what they were thinking (which is also why I\'d read the novels to get more and better details). I understand why Suito was so emotionless. She\'s been around longer than she\'s needed to and been through more than I\'d care for, but other than that the characters were just ok.Did I enjoy this movie? Absolutely not. But something compelled me to watch it. I felt after I watched it that I wasted three hours that I could have slept (watched it at 1 AM) but I just couldn\'t press pause to watch it later. I needed to know if it would get better and if there would be something grand that would make me even consider this something worthy of watching. I just HAD to know. So I watched and I was disappointed.Overall? This movie is nothing worth noting in my opinion. If your looking for something to watch then sure. If you\'ve got 2 hours to spare? Then sure. But I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone I knew, unless they were into this kind of thing. This movie is an epic FAILURE in my eyes.Oh yeah.The ending credits song I really liked. There. There was something I liked about it.I also suggest reading BEATNIK\'s review (although I don\'t agree with their score of 7) because they go into a much better detail about the specifics of the story that I just didn\'t care to go into. They also make brilliant points about the failures of the movie. things started to get...serious. (But there was hardly any emotion AT ALL that I\'m not sure serious is what they were).

Although it sort of gives it a realistic feel because in life we have no theme song to our moments, but honestly? That\'s one of the reasons I watch anime. The music is what gives the shows beauty and flavor. That in my opinion is the maker of an epic anime. And without music I can\'t be pulled in the story and I can\'t get emotionally involved with the characters.Now the characters are also a downfall in my opinion. It wasn\'t as bad as the music, but I just couldn\'t get involved with this anime! Seriously, the people were so bland and they had no facial expressions (except for Naofumi, he was a character) so I couldn\'t really tell what they were thinking (which is also why I\'d read the novels to get more and better details). I understand why Suito was so emotionless. She\'s been around longer than she\'s needed to and been through more than I\'d care for, but other than that the characters were just ok.Did I enjoy this movie? Absolutely not. But something compelled me to watch it. I felt after I watched it that I wasted three hours that I could have slept (watched it at 1 AM) but I just couldn\'t press pause to watch it later. I needed to know if it would get better and if there would be something grand that would make me even consider this something worthy of watching. I just HAD to know. So I watched and I was disappointed.Overall? This movie is nothing worth noting in my opinion. If your looking for something to watch then sure. If you\'ve got 2 hours to spare? Then sure. But I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone I knew, unless they were into this kind of thing. This movie is an epic FAILURE in my eyes.Oh yeah.The ending credits song I really liked. There. There was something I liked about it.I also suggest reading BEATNIK\'s review (although I don\'t agree with their score of 7) because they go into a much better detail about the specifics of the story that I just didn\'t care to go into. They also make brilliant points about the failures of the movie.', 'Story:Okay, I just finished watching this movie. I have to say that the two hours I spent watching it seemed to have been much longer. From the first few mintues of the movie it seemed interesting. But like right after the dog fights, it just was like; ""Is the movie done yet?"" I mean in the last 20mintues of the movie the story basically sums up everything and things finally make sense of what is really going on here. Couldn\'t they have started off the a more pleasing storyline and actually keep the audiences attention? It would have been a good movie, if it was...played out correctly in my opinion. So overall, I had to rate the story a 1/10.Art:The CGI artwork in the whole movie was fabulous and just breath-taking. I can\'t complain about the art at all. From the very beginning to the very end the quality didn\'t fail to shine. So, nice work there! 10/10!Sound:The sounds were very good during most of the movie, especially during the dog fights. I can\'t complain much there, but I would have prefered alittle more sound to be involved in the movie. Cause some parts were just quiet and made the scenes even more dull. Sound gets a 7/10.Character:The character development to me was just beyond poor. The main characters show no emotions at all through the entire movie, or failed to connect to me at all with interest. Sure, there was like one or two that actually had some emotion that they were expressing near the very end of the movie. But failed there too. 1/10Enjoyment:""The Sky Crawlers"" made me not want to crawl, but run to end of the movie. I kept thinking, ""Is it over?"" or ""How many more mintues left..."" Would I recommend this movie to others? No. Why? Cause if it wasn\'t for the artwork in the movie, this would be an unwatchable anime in my opinion. But hey, if you want to waste 2hours with a boring and dull anime, be my guest. 1/10Overall:This movie isn\'t worth buying or even renting. I don\'t ever plan on rewatching it or buying it for a penny. Overall the artwork is the savior to a poor anime movie! 2/10. I hope this review saves some of you from wasting 2hours of your life with much better anime to watch out there. played out correctly in my opinion.

Be it Ghost in the Shell or Patlabor 2, the man injects so much personality into his films that it’s impossible not to recognise his touch. There is, of course, his famous basset hound, but there’s also a poetic side that transports this viewer into the ether. I can’t tell if it’s just that his films are ageing like fine wine, or if I’m now of an age where I’m better able to appreciate what he’s trying to say, but whatever the case, he’s now one of my favourite film directors.I watched The Sky Crawlers for the first time...last night. With Kenji Kawai and Production IG alongside him, it’s a film as thoughtful as it is beautiful. Set on an alternate Earth, the ageless Kildren (“kill-dolls”) are fighter pilots forever clashing amidst the clouds in a war that is at best extremely vague and at worst totally pointless. The story exists in a place that’s like Neverland gone bad, where the children’s only escape from the endless cycles of war is heavy drinking, sex and suicide: the sheer monotony of their lives is reflected in the film’s subdued colour palette, everything is so hazy and drained: an apt worldview for a doll. A doll isn’t alive. A doll doesn’t have memories. A doll is content with its place in the world because it knows no better.There’s an urgency that underpins The Sky Crawlers. Is it okay to live a life like this? To feel so desensitised and free of passion? In both a very literal and metaphorical sense, it’s about people who can’t grow up, but has a message of perseverance for us too: “You must live until you can change something.” Throughout the film, Kusanagi carries a loaded gun, points it at her temple and threatens to kill herself. To put this into context, when you realise that 30,000 people in Japan kill themselves every year, the ideas behind The Sky Crawlers begin to make sense.The Kildren are clones, and coming to terms with the fact that you’re not special, or unique, can be hard, but being human means accepting that reality and moving forwards anyway. “Just because it’s the same path doesn’t mean it always has the same scenery. Isn’t that… good enough?” For me, at least, it’s good enough. It’s like how I’m an anime blogger, and I’ve been doing this for years now. I could give up and nothing would change. People will still be writing about anime tomorrow and I’d be forgotten. Why should I bother? I’m not asking for your sympathy here, it’s just a fact.This is what The Sky Crawlers is about. Facing the reality that you’re not doing anything different with your life, but taking the responsibility to push yourself forwards anyway, that is how I’m interpreting Yūichi’s last line, “I’m going to kill my father.” Although it means he’s almost certainly going to his death, he’s at least trying to step out of the cycle, cast aside his history and change his life. There’s a huge difference between dying in pursuit of change and dying without ever having tried anything. It beautifully transforms what’s ostensibly such a sad end into such a moment of rapture. It’s wonderful to struggle, to be imperfect, to change. Life would be so boring otherwise: don’t give up.Suffice to say, The Sky Crawlers is an excellent film. As should be expected of Mamoru Oshii at this point, it’s another deliberately paced, deep drama punctuated with moments of exciting, visceral action. I couldn’t ask for any more from a film. It’s one of the best I’ve seen in years. last night. With Kenji Kawai and Production IG alongside him, it’s a film as thoughtful as it is beautiful.

It’s one of the best I’ve seen in years.', ""Basically, this film revolves around humans with manipulated genes - Kildren, the children who live forever. Their job is therefore to mantain the balance between good and evil by fighting wars and nothing else.It starts out with our lead hero, Yuuichi Kannami who has no recollection of his past when he is first assigned to be his new base. However, as days go by, he slowly begins to find things familiar and struggles with the identity of the mysterious pilot whom was the owner of his current plane.Soon after, he begins to understand the reason behind his commanding officer, Kusanagi Suito's stoic behavior. In...reality, all the pilots who die in battle are somehow reincarnated so that their skills are not lost. And the mysterious pilot whom Kannami was so interested about was actually him before he was shot by Kusanagi at his request.The story tells of philosophies about war and why up till today, it is rare to find a time of absolute peace. Suito had in her drunken state explained that wars were around to keep everyone at the tips of their toes, ensuring that they do not take peace for granted. Unfortunately, wars in one way or another, also allow the Kildren to feel alive.Whatever philosophy about war that is seen in the story is understandable and true and can also be related and compared with our modern day situations. It also shows the fortune of being able to grow up and not living your life by repetition.The animation is absolutely breath taking with the detailed portrayal of their battles. And it is really amazing how the creators managed to incorporate fluent English and well as Japanese into the character dialogues. The soundtrack was beautiful and the instrumental is a favorite of mine.The story will probably not be appealing to everyone especially children of 12 years and below as many major events in the story are not clearly distinguished. To put it bluntly, you would have to multi-task of both watching the movie and reading between the lines of what each character is trying to portray. However, if given a chance to be well-absorbed and understood, a magnificent and absolutely worth watching anime.Simply breath taking. reality, all the pilots who die in battle are somehow reincarnated so that their skills are not lost.

Here it goes.Story:Well, the movie\'s named appropriately, because the plot just crawls along. (I know others have pointed this out too.) Once you can actually figure out what\'s going on, it\'s predictable, too. I figured out the plot twist half an hour in and fast-forwarded through the rest because it was so boring. The overall idea was good; they just didn\'t execute it very well. All in all, story gets a 2/10.Art:I did like the art. Some scenes were absolutely beautiful. However, some of the character designs were definitely lacking. during the boring scenes where there was hardly any...dialogue, I thought about how ridiculous the main character\'s hair was. And in my opinion, the shading seemed a little off, somehow. Overall, though, 8/10. the beautiful scenes distracted me from the little things that irked me.Sound:Really not much to say here. The sound was very unremarkable and could\'ve been done much better. There were too many scenes with characters sitting around, with their usual snail-pace plot, made worse because the sound sucked/wasn\'t there. 3/10Character:Uuuuugh. What character? They all acted the exact same. No emotion, monotone voices. At certain points it was actually funny: (Spoilers!) The 2 main characters stop at a cabin or something after going to some sort of military base for some reason that wasn\'t explained. At the cabin thing, the girl whose name escapes me tells the main character that they have to go back to their base. Then she says, ""or... We could stay the night..."" and oh-so-subtly with the same blank expression, undoes the top button of her shirt. (End Spoiler!) Hardly any of them ever took off their \'bored\' faces. 1/10.Enjoyment:Read all the parts of my review up to this one. 2/10.Overall:3/10. If you have an amazing attention span and you can listen to boring conversations about nothing without falling asleep, then watch it. For everyone else, avoid this movie. Possibly the worst anime movie I\'ve ever seen. dialogue, I thought about how ridiculous the main character\'s hair was. And in my opinion, the shading seemed a little off, somehow.

Possibly the worst anime movie I\'ve ever seen.', ""The Sky Crawlers is my favourite Mamoru Oshii film, neigh, my favourite anime film of all time, which is surprising as I’ve only seen the movie twice as of writing this. It’s just that the first time wowed me in ways no other media, anime or otherwise, had done in the past. Hell, I didn’t even know who Mamoru Oshii was when I discovered it. I just thought I had found a rather interesting, obscure piece of anime cinema. So, only after watching it a second time, a little over a year later, I’m now able to grasp at why I was so enamoured with...the film in the first place, and why I can now claim it be my favourite.The tone of The Sky Crawlers is cold; it’s bitter, it’s methodical, and it’s meticulous, but in that cold reservation of character and narrative, I find more comfort and solace than I have with any other form of media. It’s incongruous and artful whilst remaining reasonable and grounded; I don’t feel an iota of pretension coming from it whatsoever. Though, unfortunately, 'pretentious' seems to be the word this film gets stigmatized with the most, despite being perhaps the most straightforward film Oshii's ever directed. There's very little Ito geo- socio- enviro-political discourse splugery going on.See, The Sky Crawlers is interesting; it’s interesting in the way that it never divulges much information pertaining to its central narrative (play the game or read the book if you were looking for any), instead, it lets the viewer piece together relevant information subjectively, as informed by the one-of-a-kind surrealist tone. This creates a unique situation wherein the viewer must find their own meaning from where there may be nothing. I feel the film is purposely vague in that regard. So much so, that I think Oshii’s point may have been to present a life without meaning at all, just decay and stagnation, propped up by meaningless conflict. That isn’t to say the film has no meaning or thematic point whatsoever though—because it does. The usual Oshii themes are all there: the commodification of war, false peace, cynicism, existentialism, basset hounds. But what the film is great at is pushing all that to the side and letting you ruminate with the characters, soak in the setting, feel the atmosphere like a cold breeze blowing against your face, and reason your own interpretations informed by those aspects.Right down to the composition, this movie is fascinating. Oshii throws the three-act structure out of the window, favouring a more non-linear, cyclical approach to the narrative flow, leaving normally climactic, emotional moments for the middle of the film rather than the end. Thus, complementing the aforementioned dry and cold pacing he seems to revel in, all of which is further complemented to perfection by Kenji Kawai's most hands-off compositions to date. Out with the blood-pumping, 80s synth anthems of Patlabor and the experimental, theistic insanity of GITS, and in with the drifty, sporadic, lilting, calm, contradictory explosivity of TSC.Visually, this movie is more than unique. It's a near-perfect marriage of CGI and cel animation. A fully realized product of I.G’s DGA style that they’d been perfecting since the mid-’90s. So, in addition to the breathtaking fidelity of this film, bringing onboard someone like Tetsuya Nishio to provide character designs was ingenious. His reinterpretation of Tsuruta’s designs brings a whole new dimension to their portrayal. Nishio imbues the characters with subtle idiosyncrasies most films would skip over: like oddly specific levels of pupil dilation and realistic body fat. Their designs truly make this film one-of-a-kind, and just looking at their faces gives you a sense of the often duplicitous ambience Oshii is trying to convey in any given scene. They’re simple and grounded—which are, surprisingly, qualities arthouse films often forget to incorporate—however not so simple that they lack depth. I.G brings the characters—and by extension, the film—to life thanks to the highly animated attention to detail the studio prides itself on, like a specific way in which a character lights a cigarette or folds a newspaper.The way I interoperate this film is imparted mostly from its characters. I see this movie as a story about trying to find a direction, a reason, a meaning to your life. It’s a concept that connects with me so much because of the stage of my life I’m at now. A stage where I’m having to move forward and solidify my future, but without a cause, I ultimately feel directionless. So watching this film just puts all my feelings into words perfectly. The Killdren live in a world where they don’t have a reason, not one to fight, nor one to live. At the end of the film, Yuichi finds his: protecting the one he loves. Kusanagi, on the other hand, spends the whole film lamenting the maternal position she’s put herself in, ultimately coming to terms with the fact she must live for the child she has brought into this world. Yuichi and Kusanagi found their reasons and came to terms with their lives. But that begs the question, when am I going to find that something to die for, so I can make it beautiful to live. *Bam* *Mic-drop*.

What'ya make of that?"", ""I've heard nothing but great reviews of this movie so I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't. The theme is great, but that's the only thing I enjoyed. The character design is horrible. The voice acting is horrible. The main character's voice is horribly monotone. The plot moves at about 1 mile/hour. I finally just gave up about an hour in. I tried to watch the whole thing, but I would have just fell asleep. I do not suggest watching this unless you like deep philosophical animes with no action(besides the plane action). "", 'The Sky Crawlers gets its name from the fact that it\'s a movie about fighter pilots. It\'s the closest thing to the Japanese Top Gun that I can think of, in that it contains amazing dogfight scenes, but doesn\'t have much of anything else going on.The latest of Oshii Mamoru-sensei\'s creations, the director of Ghost in the Shell, it also features the same composer, Kawai Kenji, and sound director, Wakabayashi Kazuhiro, as GitS. However, rather than the original GitS movie with its thought-provoking themes, Sky Crawlers feels a lot more similar to the GitS sequel with its mind-numbingly slow pacing and pretentious quotes. Thankfully, Sky...Crawlers doesn\'t bombard you with obscure quotes every 2 minutes, but it will invite you to ponder fairly superficial and uninteresting philosophical concepts in the company of uninteresting characters. Suffice it to say that I do not believe Mamoru-sensei is in any danger of overshadowing his magnum opus any time soon.In all fairness to the film, it does present one idea that is fairly poignant and merits discussion. In a conversation between characters, or more precisely said, one character\'s monologue, Mamoru-sensei posits that true peace can functionally not be achieved because war and conflict are some of the deepest instincts humans have. As such, even if you achieve peace at a surface level, armed conflict is still necessary, even a contained, controlled armed conflict, to channel that ancient instinct into. People need to know that other people, somewhere in the world, are fighting and killing each other, in order to psychologically be at peace, to keep the world balanced, if you will. Otherwise, in the absence of that controlled conflict, people\'s psyches are liable to become unstable and give in to their Hobbesian urges. Like, I said, it\'s an interesting thought, but not so revolutionary that it\'s enough to carry the entire movie on its own, and since this is a film that relies almost entirely on its themes to carry it, I was not sold.Comparing Top Gun to Sky Crawlers could not make the difference between Eastern and Western storytelling any clearer. It was so exciting to watch a protagonist make the same expressionless face for 2 full hours. It was so interesting to look at a cast of characters who, bar one, all have the same stoic, bored, jaded, cynical face all the time. I really appreciated the constant breaks in animation where the characters just sit there and do nothing so as to give me time to consider themes and ideas I didn\'t care about in the first place. It was truly an experience I am glad I spent my time on.If you read the MAL description, it says that in addition to the dangers of aerial battles, the protagonist has to uncover the mysteries of the base he\'s been assigned to. That makes it sound like there\'s some really suspenseful shit going on. I had a good to fair understanding of what was going on after about 20 minutes. After that, all of the reveals mostly just confirmed what I was already suspecting or gave me new information I didn\'t think of, but which nonetheless substantiated my theory. As such, the whole mystery shpiel was dead to me for 75% of the movie. The best it got out of me were reactions like: ""Mhm, yeah, sure, figures.""It felt essentially like watching A Cure for Wellness with the occasional flight scene sprinkled in there, except even A Cure for Wellness was actually creepy and unpredictable.Everyone praises the movie for how well-animated and realistic the dogfighting scenes are, and while I cannot speak to their realism, I have to confess I found them extremely exciting. Reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell, Kawai Kenji-sensei composed some really beautiful soundtracks for this movie. As such, I fell in love with the film from the very first minute. It opens with an impressive dogfight while the main OST is playing in the background. Beauty incarnate!Alas, that\'s when it started to go downhill for me. I kept waiting for the movie to ""start"" and I just waited right through to the end.P.S.: Like pretty much all other media portraying aerial combat, aircraft machine guns are portrayed here as making a ""RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT"" kind of sound. Even in movies that portray the machine guns as faster and more efficient, the best you get is still a ""DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-DU"" kind of sound. The point I am making is that you can always hear individual bullets in movies. That\'s a huge Hollywood myth. It ain\'t not how aircraft machine guns work. They fire thousands of bullets per minute. Even WW II planes (which is roughly where I would chronologically place Sky Crawlers based on the technology displayed, though it\'s a fictional timeline) could fire hundreds of bullets per minute. There is no classic machine gun ""RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT"" noise like in Rambo. All you hear is a constant ""ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"". That\'s how fast they are. Crawlers doesn\'t bombard you with obscure quotes every 2 minutes, but it will invite you to ponder fairly superficial and uninteresting philosophical concepts in the company of uninteresting characters. Suffice it to say that I do not believe Mamoru-sensei is in any danger of overshadowing his magnum opus any time soon.In all fairness to the film, it does present one idea that is fairly poignant and merits discussion. In a conversation between characters, or more precisely said, one character\'s monologue, Mamoru-sensei posits that true peace can functionally not be achieved because war and conflict are some of the deepest instincts humans have. As such, even if you achieve peace at a surface level, armed conflict is still necessary, even a contained, controlled armed conflict, to channel that ancient instinct into. People need to know that other people, somewhere in the world, are fighting and killing each other, in order to psychologically be at peace, to keep the world balanced, if you will. Otherwise, in the absence of that controlled conflict, people\'s psyches are liable to become unstable and give in to their Hobbesian urges. Like, I said, it\'s an interesting thought, but not so revolutionary that it\'s enough to carry the entire movie on its own, and since this is a film that relies almost entirely on its themes to carry it, I was not sold.Comparing Top Gun to Sky Crawlers could not make the difference between Eastern and Western storytelling any clearer. It was so exciting to watch a protagonist make the same expressionless face for 2 full hours. It was so interesting to look at a cast of characters who, bar one, all have the same stoic, bored, jaded, cynical face all the time. I really appreciated the constant breaks in animation where the characters just sit there and do nothing so as to give me time to consider themes and ideas I didn\'t care about in the first place. It was truly an experience I am glad I spent my time on.If you read the MAL description, it says that in addition to the dangers of aerial battles, the protagonist has to uncover the mysteries of the base he\'s been assigned to. That makes it sound like there\'s some really suspenseful shit going on. I had a good to fair understanding of what was going on after about 20 minutes. After that, all of the reveals mostly just confirmed what I was already suspecting or gave me new information I didn\'t think of, but which nonetheless substantiated my theory. As such, the whole mystery shpiel was dead to me for 75% of the movie. The best it got out of me were reactions like: ""Mhm, yeah, sure, figures.""It felt essentially like watching A Cure for Wellness with the occasional flight scene sprinkled in there, except even A Cure for Wellness was actually creepy and unpredictable.Everyone praises the movie for how well-animated and realistic the dogfighting scenes are, and while I cannot speak to their realism, I have to confess I found them extremely exciting. Reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell, Kawai Kenji-sensei composed some really beautiful soundtracks for this movie. As such, I fell in love with the film from the very first minute. It opens with an impressive dogfight while the main OST is playing in the background. Beauty incarnate!Alas, that\'s when it started to go downhill for me. I kept waiting for the movie to ""start"" and I just waited right through to the end.P.S.: Like pretty much all other media portraying aerial combat, aircraft machine guns are portrayed here as making a ""RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT"" kind of sound. Even in movies that portray the machine guns as faster and more efficient, the best you get is still a ""DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-DU"" kind of sound. The point I am making is that you can always hear individual bullets in movies. That\'s a huge Hollywood myth. It ain\'t not how aircraft machine guns work. They fire thousands of bullets per minute.

That\'s how fast they are.', ""A great movie with stunning animation and sound, yet still a mile away from being flawless.Although story takes place during a war, it concentrates on the mental and moral aspect of conflict. The main characters are involved in a fight which leads to no benefit at all. Like in a game, the only result is that one party will win over the other. They become cogs in a warfare machine, their humanity is slipping away with every angagement with the enemy. Their life has no meaning at all, once they die new soldiers will be manufactured to fight and step in the same way as...new planes are constructed when some get shot down.The story may seems not to be told to the very end, which in most cases is a great thing. It gives the viewer the incentive to think of what more would happen in the conflict and therefore it makes him contemplate not only on the aspect of war but also on the aspect of what it means to be human.The art is breat taking, it seems realistic, the air battles are a particular highlight to it. It is also worth to notice how the chracters travel to different places, all of which have been designed to the greatest detail, such as the writings on the wall of a building.The only flaw of this gem is the fact that sometimes the chracter animation seems stiff. This is mostly the result of the poor eye animation. The eyes of all the characters seem empy, as if they had no soul left even in the moments whan that part of them is emphasizing its existence.The sound is a masterpiece. It's melancholic, nostalgic and dramatic. Although the tones are simple they perfectly fit with the story, along with it they go to the root of the human soul. The voice of Ayaka which we can hear during the closing titles adds value to an already outstanding score creating a memorable experience.Although the characters seem to be merely tools in a war machine, somehow the viewer develops a bond of pity with them, which I find to be a good thing since it makes the audiance want to learn from the story of the character they are watching. The tragism of who they are seems to be illuminating from them leaving an everlasting impression.Despite the fact that the flaws of the movie are noticealbe to say the least, because of its philosophical value I personally enjoyed it to an extent which cannot be described with mere words.If you are looking for something to stimulate your mind into thinking about what it means to be human, you have my word this movie is just what you are looking for. If you want only to kill some time, leave it for another time and watch something less engaging. new planes are constructed when some get shot down.The story may seems not to be told to the very end, which in most cases is a great thing.

I assume it would be in the near future, due to some notices of technological advances.The plot involves ace pilot Yūichi Kannami is reassigned to Area 262 after the deaths of three...pilots and bond with the other piloting corps, the chief mechanic, and the base’s CO. There is also a subplot with the mystery that is Kildren and they are humanoids genetically designed to live eternally in adolescence and one of these people in Area 262 happens to be one of them but I’m not going to reveal who it is. Also there is a master pilot fighter who goes by “The Teacher” and this is, by far, the biggest threat to the main characters despite it not being more important enough.Now it’s time for a HybridMedia fun fact: The Japanese dub version both feature actresses Rinko Kikuchi & Chiaki Kuriyama and I happen to know there is a movie “Six-degrees” like connection with them. As in, Rinko Kikuchi played the deaf girl in “Babel”, a movie which stars Brad Pitt, who was in “Inglorious Basterds”, directed by Quentin Tarantino and he did “Kill Bill” and yet…..there are double connections. Production I.G. did the anime sequence in Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Chiaki Kuriyama played Gogo Yubari. Isn’t learning fun?(crickets chirping......)But…….both the Japanese and English dubs sounded like they were either drifting off to sleep at some parts, especially from both actors that played Yūichi Kannami. It is very slow-paced and if you wondering about any dogfight scenes, they exist but I felt like I missed an interesting part of the movie and only see the ones not worth mentioning. Also, the CGI is really not a good idea (in my opinion, of course). It felt more liked a computer game rather than a movie and Production I.G. is no stranger with CGI, counting the opening of GiTS: Stand Alone Complex, 1st season & GiTS2: Innocence but the animation is still standard.Now, I get some people call this movie “pretentious and slow”, and they are….Well, they are 50/50 on this.FINAL VERDICT: Despite some good dogfight scenes, I completely lost interest in some parts of this movie. It’s just average quality in terms of storytelling and characters but I wasn’t expecting GiTS quality but I think they tried too hard with what they got and it backfired and disappointed. pilots and bond with the other piloting corps, the chief mechanic, and the base’s CO.

The depths of the movie is masked under abysmal editing and quality of this film. I do understand that this movie has a lot of depth to it. There are topics such as fate, love, and existence which are to be questioned. But the mark of a good film is not merely what is portrayed, but how it is portrayed.I love movies that make you think. Especially ones that make you question and look introspectively at your own life. This movie had the potential for it, but it failed miserably.Characters: The characters in this film are...quite bland. Although there is a sense that they are meant to be cold. They showed a lot of characters that seemed extremely out of place. Showing them for the sake of showing them; while leaving out any relation to the story of their role. Many felt extremely two-dimensional; I find it surprising that the dog seemed more interesting and more fulfilling as a character than some of the main characters. It seems almost rushed (which is hard to believe that I am saying that), the characters are thrown in to where you do not even feel any attachments to them.Art/Sound: The animation is very difficult to grasp for this movie. The fight scenes were amazing, beautifully done and a lot of attention to detail. Even the sound of them taking off thrilled me. There were moments where I thought it looked amazing. For example, when they were strolling through town during the night. The general feel was quite nice. The problem I have was the animation of the characters. I do get that there was an artistic design to them. That is not my gripe with the animation. The problem I have are the moments where no one moves. There are many moments where the character would stand there, nothing movie. It was as if I was looking at a screen shot.I remember thinking to myself; when someone is not speaking, they are not moving. Even moments when someone is talking, there is only animation for the mouth while nothing else moves. There was a portion where we were looking at one character for approximately 6 seconds of nothing moving, just listening to the music. Now, the music I did like which goes with the sound. Although not many songs, they were quite nicely done with some they were nice and calming.Story: The story has quite a few problems with it. As I mentioned in my earlier post, there is meant to be a lot of depth with this movie. The problem is that, the movie did a poor job of illustrating that point. The depth of a movie is only strong if the actual movie compliments it, which was not the case here. It felt like I was watching two movies, and one just so happens has a more deeper meaning to it. Overall, I think it could have done quite a lot better. The silent moments needed so much more work to them. It is like differentiating between a nice quiet moment and an awkward moment. The film is riddled with moments where the silence just felt awkward, almost as if they were forcing depth to something that which is not there. quite bland.

The whole point of the movie is that the first hour and a half is monotonous. Then, with a half an hour left of the movie, we get a clumsy infodump about how people like war. A little after that, there's a scene where this girl starts freaking out about how her life is totally rote. That scene would have been pretty cool if she didn't flat out yell out the theme of the movie in the process. If you're trying to make...a serious film, you have to do it more gracefully than that. What doesn't help this movie is how serious business it is. What I mean is everyone in this movie is super serious all the time. The characters are really mellow all the time. If the characters themselves aren't interested in what's going on, then why should I care? I have to admit, as bad as the story is, the animation is spectacular. I almost always hate CG in anime, but the animators seemed to realize that CG should be treated like backgrounds so it blends nicely. The sound design is unmemorable except for the dogfights. Sky Crawlers has wonderful visuals but even that won't excuse the boring, clumsy story. a serious film, you have to do it more gracefully than that.

But it turned into completely surprising experience, full of hints and details of life, specific for autistic personality. To be more precise, for high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome.The art style itself has the really huge contrast between super-detailed backgrounds and locations, while human characters are very schematic. Indeed, it can be often found in anime, but here, the scale of this contrast is striking. It fits...autistic perception perfectly: many Aspies (people with Asperger syndrome) have unusually high attention to visual details, while their perception of other people is (not literally) schematic due to difficulties with interpreting non-verbal language, emotional reactions and other aspects of behavior.As I said before, locations were painted with very high attention to every detail. And for me personally, these are absolutely great locations, since these large open spaces with cliffs, dividing land from the sea, remind me of ocean coast of Ireland and Brittany. Megaliths, heather, stone walls along the roads are just beautiful. It feels like someone spent many days thinking about all these details, showing up on the screen for only a second. I mean, for example, circular patterns on megaliths, definitely borrowed from the stones of Gavrinis tomb - mysterious megalithic site, located in Morbihan, Brittany. Same thing with aircraft, aerodrome equipment (being an avionics engineer, I can recognize many pieces of it), with architecture and atmosphere of the town, where pilots staying on their way to another base. It looks just like an old part of Krakow, Poland, with tiny details such as tramway or taverns.“Kildren” - most of the main characters, definitely have autistic personalities. Physically, they are very young, but being a bit childish and immature mentally, they all bear a sign of being tired of life, fighting boredom in an own way. It resembles some psychological features of people with Asperger syndrome. Many other things fit the picture too: keeping a distance from life, having some odd pragmatic relationships with death. Interpersonal relationships are a kind of cold and awkward between them, but sometimes we can see, how strong their attachment can be, so they are not really cold psychopaths. Logic rules their everyday world, but emotions can burst out in their own special cases.Description of suicidal thoughts is very natural. There is a study of suicidal behavior in Aspies, telling that it is a relatively common thing for them to think about suicide in connection with a purpose or “function” of own life. Often, it doesn't lead to an actual suicide, but planning and preparations could be made. In Sky Crawlers, we can see all that.I honestly don't know, if anyone from film crew has this mental condition, but somehow, Sky Crawlers got so many different independent features, related to it, so it is hard to imagine that nobody knows about it from own experience. And I believe that for people, who have never met any Aspie, it might be interesting to watch Sky Crawlers keeping all that in mind.As a disclaimer, I want to add, that Asperger syndrome has many faces, and I'm talking about only one of them, familiar to me. So, if it doesn't fit someone’s experience, I'm not responsible for that. autistic perception perfectly: many Aspies (people with Asperger syndrome) have unusually high attention to visual details, while their perception of other people is (not literally) schematic due to difficulties with interpreting non-verbal language, emotional reactions and other aspects of behavior.As I said before, locations were painted with very high attention to every detail.

It is an era where the majority of the population lives in peace, with wars being mainly a plaything between different mercenary groups in the name of their respective contractors. These so called mercenaries, who engage in the dance of death in the sky, pre-eminently consists of teenagers who ‘never age’ and are known as ‘Kildren’.It is under this context we are introduced to one half of our central characters, Yuichi...Kannami, who arrives at a small military base, where he meets the enigmatic base commander, Kusanagi Suito and a bunch of other notable side characters. Despite its ‘military’ tag, the actual battle scenes are few (albeit brilliant and will be readily relished by any action enthusiast), with the bulk of the storytelling focusing on the interactions between Kannami and the other characters. But what separates TSC, or rather elevates it from the majority of other slow paced shows is its, for the lack of a better word, fragility. Despite the lack of urgency of any degree whatsoever, one gets the feeling that something’s off right from the start. As the story rolls on, bit by bit of light is shed on various aspects of the Kildren’s; the purpose of their existence, on Kannami, and more so on Kusanagi, all of which invariably keeps the viewer on edge right until the final quarter, ensuing in a thrilling, and unquestionably haunting climax. That TSC ironically pulls off the elements of mystery a whole lot better than the plethora of mystery shows is a thing that Oshii can certainly be proud of.The characters, for the major part, carry the same feeling of fragility that the story possesses right from the get go. The Kildren’s, on account for their apparent lack of growth after a specific stage, remain as teenagers for the rest of their lives. The existence of this gulf between the progress of the mind and the lack of progress of the body is what defines our protagonists and the relationships between them. Kannami’s actions are readily conflicting; he’s unwilling to accept of him being anything but a child, and as such, fails to understand what it means to live, given the fact he (as well as others) could die in the very next battle. He’s curious about his predecessor, but only to an extent where he would drop the subject first hand if he’s denied an answer. His apparent lack of will to know more about his surroundings and that of himself brings forward to what is probably the most important thematic feature of the movie: the eerie, and almost frustrating lack of change in anything. Kusanagi, haunted by her past actions, is significantly more tragic. Standing on the edge of child and adulthood, she desperately looks for a way to get out of it, to be free from all burdens that being a Kildren presents, even if it means by taking her own life. As fate would have it, the relationship between the two leads is merely a facade, fragile to such an extent that one needs to stop the other from pressing the trigger even while seemingly kissing each other.The remaining characters mainly act as a reminder to the viewer as to what pain being a Kildren brings. They look isolated for the most part, desperately trying to fill the void in their lives and as such, play no such major roles compared to the two lead characters. While development of the said characters is pretty much non-existent, they play their given roles with precision and fulfills what the story expects from them.Production I.G. is well known for consistently producing aesthetically pleasing stuff, and TSC is another notable addition to that list. The very first thing that strikes you are the beautifully colored backgrounds. The various aspects of the countryside, coupled with the intensely blue, partly cloudy skies (particularly in the fight scenes) dominate a handsome portion of the movie. However, more telling is the amount of detail present in the finer portions. Interiors of houses and restaurants are filled with various objects, from colorful vases to chinaware plates to other personal belongings. One odd feature, however, is the rather gargantuan doors compared to the people going through them. Similar amount of precision is attained in the designs of the fighter jets and other vehicles. Whether they are valid from an engineering point of view or not is a question I’d rather leave to the people associated with it.Almost in contrast are the minimalistic designs of the characters, to the point one might call them lifeless and unattractive. However, it could be easily seen that the supposed lack of vitality in the character designs as compared to their surroundings is an indication of how directionless their existence is in particular. (Fun Fact: Ghost in the Shell fanatics should find no trouble to be able to point out at a drunk Kusanagi looking extremely similar to one of Innocence’s gynoids).Kenji Kawai, at this point of time, should be a rather well-known figure to anime fans; so it’s nothing surprising to find his work in TSC to be among his best. Many of the tracks are subtle, poignant, drawn out to the point for optimum effect. The action scenes are very well accompanied by sharp and fast paced violins that manages to bring out the desired emotions. Additionally, a wonderful feature in TSC is the use of silence. At places, long scenes are accompanied by an eerie silence which actually captures you and keeps you on track. A special mention to the voice acting, particularly to the VA’s of the two lead characters, who successfully manage to maintain the delicate balance between the conflicting emotions and otherwise.A major theme in TSC is that of repetition, disillusion and the resultant resolve required to break from it. The Kildren’s, on account of the curse they are born with, live in a world devoid of any passion and sensation whatsoever. Being edible is enough, because they can’t feel the taste. Being alive has no such meaning, because they don’t know what it means to be in the first place. Fighting for their lives is of no consequence to them, because their existence doesn’t have any other purpose. In a metaphorical sense, the Kildren’s represent people who are stuck in the cycle of life. They represent people who can’t overcome the hurdle from childhood to adulthood, who believe the only way to escape from their grim reality is by taking their own lives. And just as Kannami tries to stop Kusanagi, TSC has a message for us too: ‘You must live until you can change something’. That with the required perseverance and will, anyone can and will surely be able to move forward. The desire to bring a change in our lives is what makes us human, and as such, elevates Kannami’s resolve to fight against his destiny, even if it did ultimately lead to his downfall. The Kild, who all but merely floated all his life, devoid of any desire and will to struggle, ironically was at his magnificent best, flying as high as he ever did in his final moments. In a world and era where suicide has turned into such a grave issue, TSC’s message is certainly admirable.TSC impressed me with its direction, use of themes and quality storytelling. Its cynical commentary on the nature of war and that of the people involved with it certainly puts it a step above than most other shows under the same genre. As with most of the slow paced shows, one needs a good amount of patience, and keeping in mind the themes portrayed, probably needs a requisite amount of maturity as an adult to enjoy TSC to the maximum. All in all, TSC is, without a doubt, one of the best things I’ve had the pleasure to watch in this medium and it gets a 4.5/5 in my book. Kannami, who arrives at a small military base, where he meets the enigmatic base commander, Kusanagi Suito and a bunch of other notable side characters. Despite its ‘military’ tag, the actual battle scenes are few (albeit brilliant and will be readily relished by any action enthusiast), with the bulk of the storytelling focusing on the interactions between Kannami and the other characters. But what separates TSC, or rather elevates it from the majority of other slow paced shows is its, for the lack of a better word, fragility. Despite the lack of urgency of any degree whatsoever, one gets the feeling that something’s off right from the start. As the story rolls on, bit by bit of light is shed on various aspects of the Kildren’s; the purpose of their existence, on Kannami, and more so on Kusanagi, all of which invariably keeps the viewer on edge right until the final quarter, ensuing in a thrilling, and unquestionably haunting climax. That TSC ironically pulls off the elements of mystery a whole lot better than the plethora of mystery shows is a thing that Oshii can certainly be proud of.The characters, for the major part, carry the same feeling of fragility that the story possesses right from the get go. The Kildren’s, on account for their apparent lack of growth after a specific stage, remain as teenagers for the rest of their lives. The existence of this gulf between the progress of the mind and the lack of progress of the body is what defines our protagonists and the relationships between them. Kannami’s actions are readily conflicting; he’s unwilling to accept of him being anything but a child, and as such, fails to understand what it means to live, given the fact he (as well as others) could die in the very next battle. He’s curious about his predecessor, but only to an extent where he would drop the subject first hand if he’s denied an answer. His apparent lack of will to know more about his surroundings and that of himself brings forward to what is probably the most important thematic feature of the movie: the eerie, and almost frustrating lack of change in anything. Kusanagi, haunted by her past actions, is significantly more tragic. Standing on the edge of child and adulthood, she desperately looks for a way to get out of it, to be free from all burdens that being a Kildren presents, even if it means by taking her own life. As fate would have it, the relationship between the two leads is merely a facade, fragile to such an extent that one needs to stop the other from pressing the trigger even while seemingly kissing each other.The remaining characters mainly act as a reminder to the viewer as to what pain being a Kildren brings. They look isolated for the most part, desperately trying to fill the void in their lives and as such, play no such major roles compared to the two lead characters. While development of the said characters is pretty much non-existent, they play their given roles with precision and fulfills what the story expects from them.Production I.G. is well known for consistently producing aesthetically pleasing stuff, and TSC is another notable addition to that list. The very first thing that strikes you are the beautifully colored backgrounds. The various aspects of the countryside, coupled with the intensely blue, partly cloudy skies (particularly in the fight scenes) dominate a handsome portion of the movie. However, more telling is the amount of detail present in the finer portions. Interiors of houses and restaurants are filled with various objects, from colorful vases to chinaware plates to other personal belongings. One odd feature, however, is the rather gargantuan doors compared to the people going through them. Similar amount of precision is attained in the designs of the fighter jets and other vehicles. Whether they are valid from an engineering point of view or not is a question I’d rather leave to the people associated with it.Almost in contrast are the minimalistic designs of the characters, to the point one might call them lifeless and unattractive. However, it could be easily seen that the supposed lack of vitality in the character designs as compared to their surroundings is an indication of how directionless their existence is in particular. (Fun Fact: Ghost in the Shell fanatics should find no trouble to be able to point out at a drunk Kusanagi looking extremely similar to one of Innocence’s gynoids).Kenji Kawai, at this point of time, should be a rather well-known figure to anime fans; so it’s nothing surprising to find his work in TSC to be among his best. Many of the tracks are subtle, poignant, drawn out to the point for optimum effect. The action scenes are very well accompanied by sharp and fast paced violins that manages to bring out the desired emotions. Additionally, a wonderful feature in TSC is the use of silence.

The silence and the on-screen action are characters themselves, at times conveying more emotion than the most gifted actor. When dialog takes over, superb English voice-acting and impeccable characterization reign. If the tangible silence is broken, the brilliance of...the musical score shines through. Built on this canvas, a story unfolds on the futility of war, as kildren (children that do not grow) dogfight, not for a cause, but as employees for companies. The sole function of their jobs? Provide a valve for citizen unrest, a lens for headlines, fodder for sound bites. With this being their purpose, you come to the inevitable realization the cycle can never break and the end is also the beginning. 5-star brilliance and a new high bar for the genre. the musical score shines through.

It can easily be mistaken for being boring, but there’s a very fine line between a slow film that’s boring and a slow that lets you stew in its world, in its mood, and in its subtle details.I went into Sky Crawlers without seeing any trailers or reading summaries. I think that’s the best way to enjoy entertainment. I won’t lie. This can easily bore many people. I found myself struggling to stay focused because the film’s pacing is so deliberately...slow. But that’s what I like about it.There’s very little dialogue. There isn’t heaps of exposition. You’re thrown into the film with almost no clue of where or what year it’s taking place in. That’s a bold move because I’m so used to having other shows or films spoon feed you the exposition in the beginning. You’re left struggling to piece together what’s going on.There’s a lot of subtle emotion and it’s done visually. For example, there’s a scene where a young woman comes into a male character’s sleeping quarter while he’s gone. She then kneels over and lays her torso on the bed and gently rubs her face into the sheets with a sad look on her face. My description sounds silly, but it really got across that she misses or is fond of the male character in some way. It’s rare for anime to simply let the visuals convey the scene when ironically anime is all about visuals.What I like most about Sky Crawlers is the atmosphere. There are many scenes are that somber. There’s a quiet, distant feel to everything. It could be a character looking into the distance, it could be two characters sitting in an empty restaurant drinking. It’s this gloominess that the film invokes that I really enjoyed.The film doesn’t tell you anything. There are so many questions that it raises but never seems to answer. What this place? Who are these people? What’s going on? Couple this with its deliberately slow pace and bleak tone, it’s a tough film to watch—let alone enjoy. But I without a doubt liked it, and it’s going to stay with me. Do I think it’s actually good? Not necessarily but it’s certainly unique. I probably wouldn’t re-watch it, though, but I do think as whole it’s a refreshing watch some a typical TV or film that shoves everything in your face.I want to rate this higher, but I can't in good faith because its unconventional in its qualities. But I will say that if you're patient and looking for something different then try this. slow. But that’s what I like about it.There’s very little dialogue. There isn’t heaps of exposition.

When I decided to repost it here, I skimmed through other reviews. I was surprised.  Not one review had any mention of the anime industry in it.I have always felt that people attribute things to stories and their creators that are not really present.  Much of the brilliance of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, for example, comes from a near infinite ambiguity that allows AP English teachers to draw myriad conclusions that probably had nothing to do with the author's thoughts when he wrote it.  That doesn't mean...it wasn't brilliant to begin with.  That doesn't mean that the author didn't mean some, or even most of the things that people see in it.  People will find things if they are looking, even when they aren't there, and the best creators take advantage of that.What do you think of something that never really matures, never changes, and only dies if something else kills it?  I'm not talking about the elf of every fantasy story since Tolkien.  I'm talking about anime.It has been ages since I watched Sky Crawlers, so I have forgotten most of what I was thinking at the time.  Still, I would like to convey the gist as best I can from memory:  Sky Crawlers is an allegory for the failure of the anime industry.Maybe I'm giving it too much credit.  Maybe not.  In either case, the movie shows us endless repetition.  In essence, we see an immature product that utterly lacks change, except when some outside force effects the end of an existing member.  Is this not the embodiment of the industry's failures?  We have seen what amounts to the same product remade every year.  For the most part, said product is juvenile.  For the most part, specific variants of the product only die out when profiting from them becomes completely infeasible, or when (perhaps due to closures) no one remains who makes that variant.Of course, this doesn't address the principle problem, which is that people actually want the same old crap over and over again.  They complain about things being the same, but whenever something new and different comes along, people hate it.  I have seen it many times, both with anime and with other products.  Only comfortable, familiar products are consumed in worthwhile quantity.  Anime creators have no incentive to change.That's enough of my rambling.  Here's my review.--------------------------------------------------Sky Crawlers is thoughtful and well made.  Its visuals are brilliant.  It's one of very few anime that are worth watching in 1080p.  It's also dead boring.Okay, so it probably isn't entirely fair for me to say that.  I enjoyed it, but I have to say:  not everything Mamoru Oshii does is a masterpiece.  In fact, I think his crap/quality ratio is about average.  His best stuff, Talking Head for example, is the kind of thing you can argue about endlessly.  Sky Crawlers succeeds on that count, but the real question is:  will you want to?  The average viewer will lose interest five minutes in.The Sky Crawlers is a prime example of a show that feels like the creators are trying way too hard.  It's a magnificent production.  It also largely fails to be fun.  As amazing as Sky Crawlers may be, it ultimately fails in its job as entertainment. it wasn't brilliant to begin with.

It follows Yuuichi Kannami, an eternally-young fighter-ace, assigned to Area 262 following the death of three of their pilots. The plane Yuuichi is given seems puzzlingly unscathed, and the fate of its previous occupant serves to drive the plot forward. At the centre of this mystery is his similarly stunted Commanding Officer, Suito Kusanagi, with whom Yuuichi quickly develops a bond.While this search for answers is fairly entertaining, It does not dominate the movie, which instead focuses on establishing the world and characters, and...exploring the chemistry between them, much like Oshii's most seminal work, Ghost in the Shell. Unfortunately, The Sky Crawlers is not a movie that particularly deserves this same deliberate and pondering pace. While Production IG's 2D background work is predictably stunning, the same cannot be said for the characters that inhabit this world, as their design and voice acting is oddly flat, lifeless, and uninspired. One could argue that this complements the movie thematically, but it certainly makes for a difficult watch during the fairly uneventful first ninety minutes.Similarly, the setting, a relatively empty airfield surrounded by open space, allows little room for cinematic exploration, and Oshii's typically-wide landscape shots feel more grating than artful. This incompatible dichotomy of styles continues in the eponymous skies, with Polygon Pictures' CGI planes clashing violently with the hand-drawn world they occupy; in stark contrast to the expertly blended animation of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, The Sky Crawlers can sometimes feel like the cruel result of two entirely different productions coming together, and the transition between them is exceptionally jarring. The 2D characters often seem clumsily superimposed onto a 3D scenario, or vice versa, and the landscapes conjured up by our two animation houses are alike in name only. While each half of the film is technically impressive, the awkward marriage of the two only serves to cheapen them both. A rather flaccid Kenji Kawai score accompanies.Audiovisual criticism aside, The Sky Crawlers does tell an interesting story, and eventually, manages to inject some humanity and accessibility into its lifeless protagonists. Despite the insultingly contrived exposition of the final act, its message is subtle, relevant, and incisive, and does in-part redeem an otherwise unremarkable film. exploring the chemistry between them, much like Oshii's most seminal work, Ghost in the Shell.

They don't explain anything until very late which caused a lot of confusion early on.This movie would have been much better with a little more exposition at the start.

The ending kinda sucks. It all felt very... Pointless because of it. Like none of that mattered.

It came off as slow and I\'m not even sure how I managed to stay awake to the end.  And that ending came out of nowhere.I felt cheated.  Like I had missed something along the way, but I don\'t remember seeing...anything that would have led to that conclusion.  The movie just pulled it out of it\'s own exhaust.Oshii directed it too, so it has the ""Walking"" montage.

Used as tools and weapons, they are experiments used by their government to fight an endless war. Even if they die they’ll be cloned back to life and lose that life’s memory. At the center is the longest survivor who feels she has lived for too long.They don’t know how many times they’ve died and been brought back, though once they realize what’s happening some lose meaning in their lives. How many have they killed? How many times have they died? Their miserable state is subconsciously reflected on their...drones like, apathetic personalities. Some reach such a dreadful mental state, they start asking to be killed by the other Kildred. Some look for a better way.And the cycle of reincarnation continues.Tokino is the only one that makes the best of it and who tries to enjoy life. The tragic reality is that he is, who knows what number clone of himself and the reality just hasn’t sinked in yet.

Her struggle for the truth made her feel worthless, as she tries to help make sense of it all with the rest. Her eternal fate as a tool of war to live and die endlessly broke her down as she tried to share this with the others and struggle to cope.And the cycle of reincarnation continues.(This will be a political analysis from here.)The Sky Crawlers is a film that at most important, tells you what you need to know with brutal honesty, that war and humans are inseparable. The rest is up to interpretation as a lot of what is happening is mysterious, and not directly answered to the viewers. What is the importance, necessity, and horror of war? To what, to those that just see it as their job to become hired killers. Ironically, politicians use war to give the illusion of peace. The people start to believe that if other countries are in a disastrously violent state, and if they can be fooled enough to believe that they have it better where they are. As a result, they will be made to believe there is peace where they are. Their governments believe more so, however, that as long as there is war, there can be profit, not peace. War is a profitable business where the dollar has more value to them than a person. Because in their eyes, war must always happen, they must prop up an undefeatable enemy. To do this, they must train people on the other side, and use the media to maybe parade them at first, but then to vilify them and turn them into powerful enemies, which justifies the invasion.It is true that war has brought about heroes and change for mankind. Some say it gives meaning and life to some, though really, it’s misery and destruction for most. Take a look at my rotten country called America where politicians like to point fingers at other countries to make people think it’s peaceful and great here when there’s yet another mass shooting that results from the degenerate, and trigger-happy culture that has tainted the minds of the young.

It will be ended by highly educated people using weapons developed by highly educated people, law-abiding people, people with little fair-haired kids, house on the corner, professors in colleges.

By our good Christian citizens. What does the army want to recruit? Nice American people. Christian boys. Law-abiding boys. High school graduates. People with clean records. Because they are the most conducive to making into killers. They make the best killers. Why? They’ve been trained to submit to authority only without thinking. They’ve shown by their clean records that they’re not rebels, so if the officer says “Take that hill,” off they will go, it doesn’t matter what the point is. They’re used to bowing to authority and following authority unthinkingly. They have been trained into conformity. They’ve been trained to respond to patriotic music, so you play the music and beat the drums and off they march to war; it doesn’t matter what it is for.They have been trained to believe that as Americans or whatever nationality, they are morally superior to their enemies, and that their enemies are less human than they. And therefore you can use their very religion as the key to getting them to kill by designating the other people as pagans; nonbelievers.

Our protagonist, Yuuichi Kanami, is one of such pilots.Arriving at Rostock Corporation\'s Area 262 after 3 of its fighters were downed by a rival ace named ""Teacher"", Kanami is greeted by his new comrades, the base\'s mechanic and the...Chief of Operations, Mizuki Kisanagi. The plot progresses as we learn more about her and discover the existence of the mysterious Kildren, seemingly immortal artificial soldiers. Kannami also learns more about the man he replaced, and what it means to have been brought to pilot his old fighter.Contemplating the nature of war and order isn\'t something new to Oshii\'s body of work, (I.E. his Patlabor duology, the Kerberos series) however Sky Crawlers takes this common motif to a much more subdued environment, replacing the dense near-future urban landscapes with hangars and regular establishments closer to the 20th century than anything. The mechanical design is appropriately close to WW2- era machinery and vehicles as well.These machines are brought to life by Polygon Pictures\' CGI, which is unsurprisingly competent but not nearly as interlaced with the 2d animation as in their earlier collaboration with Oshii and Production IG, Ghost in the Shell Innocence.The 2d animation itself is another thing. I was not a fan of it, as I\'m not a fan of the character designs (to put it mildly) and how they would move outside of zoom-ins. Again, previous Oshii/IG films did it much better.The backgrounds are very well done, and arguably the most important part of Sky Crawler\'s aesthetic. The sky looks beautiful, and the interiors are extremely detailed and tight.Kenji Kawai\'s score is good. The movie asks for a subtle piece, and he delivers. The main theme plays more than once during the movie, solidifying the point about cycles the narrative makes.As for the narrative itself, Sky Crawlers is cryptic and slowly paced. The mysteries are up to the viewer to piece together, as characters hint at possibilities and mew information through their mostly apathetic dialogue.The characters themselves aren\'t very... vivid. As they shouldn\'t be. The themes they bring up and represent sustain the narrative perfectly well, as everything eventually drives the main point home: ""War"" is both a neverending reality and a profitable and necessary spectacle for the masses. The only escape for those involved  is death. But that doesn\'t mean hope can\'t shine through this bleak realization.In conclusion, Sky Crawlers is both technically competent and thematically rich, and shows a mature Oshii masterfully tying everything together.

It\'s just an air combat game, the important part to understanding the movie is that these characters are all clones(aka NPCs you shoot down in the game). When they die they are replaced by an exact duplicate who restarts the cycle all over...again. The antagonist is the player of the game aka you, and in the opening scenes you are killing the NPCs under the alias of ""The Teacher"" whom the NPCs can never hope to match or beat ""The Teacher"" and they die then in a way they ""respawn."" The rest of the movie is inconsequential as it\'s just the NPCs who basically have no emotion because they are NPCs living the day-to-day life of an NPC doing whatever and then getting killed by you ""The Teacher"", the respawning while almost no one seems to care as they have been through the cycle so many times they can no longer feel the emotions of losing someone.By the time you learn this in the movie, it\'s the 1-hour 30-minute mark and you\'ve fallen asleep, given up watching, or are on your third sitting trying to get through this slog of a movie. Fuck the movie honestly don\'t watch it, go to YouTube and watch all the dogfights and call it a day.There are no characters in this movie period. The only ones who display any kind of emotion are treated as secondary characters with no screen time.The music is bland and forgettable just like the NPCs themselves which is why it is that way to emphasize just how boring it is to be an NPC. Voice acting is dead on arrival, in the cockpit, they always speak English and on the ground Japanese both of which are delivered calmly and with no emoting or passion, which is probably what they were going for.The Low-quality characters with high-quality planes and backgrounds are odd. Most of the faces have about 10 lines total while everything in the background has excellent art grade quality.Overall, as I said before fuck this movie, about NPCs because it\'s just as boring as you would expect NPC life to be except when they are facing the player. Watch the dogfights on YouTube and forget this movie ever existed just like the NPCs in the movie.Once you see and watch the videogame of the same name everything will make sense and you may be deeply intrigued or just hoping you\'ll never see a movie like it ever again.Now go watch Yukikaze a far more realistic and much more enjoyable OVA series about Advanced Aircraft that won\'t bore you to tears or put you to sleep. again.

Throughout that two-hour experience, literally all I could remember was that scene in the backseat of the car... and melting into my couch for what felt like at least 3 hours, just waiting for it to finally end. This was a movie I\'ve always wanted to revisit, because I\'ve definitely made an effort to better appreciate this kind of quieter, subtly beautiful storytelling as I\'ve gotten older. But even now, I\'m not sure I can recommend this one wholeheartedly.Make no mistake, it\'s stunningly beautiful to look at. And the music in...this movie has made me want to go track down everything else Kenji Kawai has ever worked on. But the storytelling leaves something to be desired. If I hadn\'t read the summary on here ahead of time, I fear I\'d still only have a vague idea of what exactly the Kildren were, how they came about, why and what they were fighting... I just needed a little more of a balance. I can appreciate the time spent showing us the monotony and hopelessness of their existence... But we\'re literally 20 minutes from the end before any sort of conflict with those story points are really brought up. It\'s a huge exaggeration for the summary to describe Kannami as ""endeavoring"" to understand their situation, because he really couldn\'t seem to care less. There are maybe three scenes in the entire movie where any of the important characters show any emotion at all.It\'s an interesting idea... but the way it\'s presented in this movie is just really fucking boring. And personally, I just can\'t get past that. this movie has made me want to go track down everything else Kenji Kawai has ever worked on. But the storytelling leaves something to be desired.

I just needed a little more of a balance. I can appreciate the time spent showing us the monotony and hopelessness of their existence... But we\'re literally 20 minutes from the end before any sort of conflict with those story points are really brought up. It\'s a huge exaggeration for the summary to describe Kannami as ""endeavoring"" to understand their situation, because he really couldn\'t seem to care less. There are maybe three scenes in the entire movie where any of the important characters show any emotion at all.It\'s an interesting idea... but the way it\'s presented in this movie is just really fucking boring. And personally, I just can\'t get past that.', ""Chop 50 minutes off, and this movie becomes a 9/10 without question.Mamoru Oshii is egregiously hit-or-miss when it comes to the pacing of his movies. Jin-Roh and Ghost in the Shell manage to hold my attention no problem. Kerberos: Stray Dog, Patlabor, and Sky Crawlers on the other hand just dragged on and on and on.There's a great story in here, decent animation, good sound effects, passable voicework, thoughtful character development, and an interesting setting to delve into. Plenty of subtlety to look out for and churn over. Just wish it didn't take as long to get to those great moments. You'll be rewarded for...sticking through the slow bits, don't worry. I really enjoyed the story and I do recommend it for those of you with patience or a fast forward button. I only wish Oshii were more consistent on this issue.Anyone who abridges this down to a watchable runtime has my appreciation. sticking through the slow bits, don't worry.

In the sense that it is a dull, pessimistic, slow film that most would define as boring. The protagonists are apathetic and do nothing to change their situation within the film. Furthermore, every key moment, every twist or revelation is greeted coldly. Plus, the action scenes, especially for a war film, are very few. Essentially the anti-film. But that couldn\'t further from the truth. This is not the anti-film, this is the film. An absolutely incredible experience that will take your breath away and leave you speechless.The story is about the Kildren,...these boys created artificially and incapable of dying or aging who are sent to a battlefield to fight a ""fake"" war between two multinationals. War that takes place in a world of peace but whose aim is precisely to maintain peace and not to make man forget the horrors of war as well as to entertain them. In essence, the Kildren are cannon fodder sent to die and somehow resurrected only to be killed again and again and again... A sad and dark plot, very philosophical and profound. Narrated in a masterful way with ideas such as making each plot twist arrive in the most anti-climatic way possible, absolutely brilliant.The characters are all expressionless, emotionless, unaware of the truth about their existence and they don\'t make you feel the slightest apathy for them as they are simple puppets built and manipulated by the strongest. Yuichi, the protagonist, is the exact opposite of a protagonist. Instead of fighting to find out who he is or where he comes from, he simply exists. He exists and is a puppet like the others. Only in the ending does he try to redeem himself with an extreme gesture and this leaves a glimmer of light which, in my opinion, is destroyed by the true ending in the post-credit scene. The characters, however, work. Their apathy and unawareness mixes perfectly with the sad and dark tones of the film. They involved me much more than many other characters in many other anime where, in theory, the characters are the strong point.The animation is absolutely brilliant, visually it\'s one of the most satisfying experiences I\'ve ever seen. A perfect use of CGI with the animations of the flying combats which are the flagship of an incredible technical sector. The tones and atmospheres are muted, making everything even more unique. Oshii does a masterful job of directing with some excellent ideas, such as using the subjective view for some scenes during the flying combats. The soundtrack is wonderful with the absolutely perfect main theme which, with its sweet tones, clashes with the atmosphere of the film but which, in reality, hides a lot of melancholy.Must-watch for any fan of animated films, I can\'t believe there\'s so little talk about it. Do yourself a favor and watch one of the most atypical yet brilliant works ever. these boys created artificially and incapable of dying or aging who are sent to a battlefield to fight a ""fake"" war between two multinationals.

Strawberry Panic,https://myanimelist.net/anime/855/Strawberry_Panic,"[""This is one of my favorite Yuri based anime's I have come to find. Once I began watching it, I couldn't stop. If you really want an anime that you can get into whole heartedly it is this one. The in depth analysis on all the variety of characters makes it so you can relate to at least one of them. The play on suspense, romance, and other relationships is so perfect for anyone who is into anything that may make your eyes tear up. "", 'If you are in anyway a fan of yuri anime, then Strawberry Panic is a bit of a rite of passage for entry into the genre.  It probably garners the highest amount of fanaticism and emotionalism from its supporters and detractors.  Though I wouldn’t call it a love or hate it kind of show as you might expect from that.  I think of myself as a reasonably objective person and found that my opinion of it split almost right down the middle between absolute love and complete contempt.Strawberry Panic\'s story centers on a new student to a prestigious all girls’ school, Nagisa...Aoi.  The school is divided into three separate campuses which operate separately, have different uniforms, but are functionally really the same institution.  Oh, and basically the entire student body are lesbians... hey this is yuri after all!  There isn’t any amazing drama or nefarious villains as the story almost totally revolves around relationship angst.  The story walks the line on being a light hearted romantic comedy to having some pretty deep drama but for the most part it is a lot of fun.  I would imagine most people are going to enjoy it a lot, until you get to the last five to six episodes.  Here is where there is likely to be disagreement amongst viewers as pairings finalize and plot twists emerge.  This is where my enjoyment also suffered, because I intensely disliked almost every final pairing and the ending to the final story arc itself left me quite angry and disappointed.The characters have some magnificent highs but also some annoying lows.  As far as Nagisa goes, whom just about every important plotline flows through, she is a sweet and likable character.  Immediately people are going to gravitate to her much as characters do in the story and find something to like about her.  However as the story unfolds, I found her becoming increasingly unlikable and idiotic.  The decisions she makes, her inability to see the obvious right in front of her face, and her ditzy nature (while extremely endearing at the beginning of the series) becomes annoying and tired.  You want to feel for her angst and conflict but in the end you\'re just so over with her.Shizuma, next to Nagisa, is the most important character in the story and probably the most interesting.  Though that doesn’t mean she is particularly likable.  A friend once referred to her as the ""Mac-Daddy"" of the school.  She seems willing to go after any girl in the school while seemingly not really caring about them or the consequences of her actions.  Her past is tragic and explains the reasons why she is the way she is.  But she is a psychologically damaged person and hurts a lot of people along the way, though probably not intentionally.  She simply just can’t help it.  While she does make a lot of progress and matures some over the story I still couldn’t help but think that in the end in her heart of hearts she really hadn’t changed.Tamao is the last of the main cast.  She will be instantly likable by all though will not come across as a terribly unique character in the annals of anime history.  As the other love interest for Nagisa, this is where viewers of the show are going to start to separate themselves.  You’re going to be a Tamao fan or a Shizuma one.  Depending on which character you find yourself rooting for is likely to affect the way you view the anime in the end.  I did like her, though she has a lot of Nagisa\'s personality traits and her ditzy nature does get annoying towards the endNow for the bad and it pretty much starts and ends for me with Amane and Hikari.  Amane is the stereotypical character we seem to always have forced on us in anime.  The emotionless robot who happens to be admired by all despite having no personality and looking and dressing like a man.  Yes, this is YURI; I am watching it for the girls!  So what is this mannish toad-face doing in my show!  I found absolutely nothing redeeming about her and the only reason I could even think of that all these girls revered her so much was that at an all girls school she was the most likely to have a sausage in her pants.  This all being said, it seems fitting that she is linked with the second worst character in the show, Hikari.  Hikari is basically a functional retard.  She has no personality attributes besides being moe to the extreme that would make anyone care about her.  She spends all of her time in constant angst over what Amane thinks of her and ignores the people who truly care about her (though heaven only knows why they do).  Honestly I think if nobody guided her along and told her when to wake up and eat she would just stand in the corner and starve to death.The rest of the supporting cast is actually pretty good.  Yaya and Chikaru stand out above all the others.  I would liked to have seen both of those characters get better endings and felt they were ignored a bit too much.  Almost everyone would be considered likable and friendly, the kind of people you would want to be friends with.  The only exception would be Kaname and Momomi.  I really found them to be despicable characters and their actions and motivations were pretty hard for me to stomach.Art and animation is exceptional.  I really enjoyed the beautiful settings and costumes and with the exception of Amane, all of the girls were quite stunning to look at.  The voice acting and music was also very good.  A few of the character voices grated on me, but mostly because they were characters I didn’t like. (Hikari, Amane)  The OP and EN songs were performed by Nagisa\'s and Tamao\'s voice actress and I thought fit the theme and feel of the show wonderfully.Your enjoyment of Strawberry Panic is going to greatly depend on how you felt about the final pairings.  Some people are really going to like this a lot and others are going to feel very disappointed as I was.  In addition I very much disliked how the final arc played out and that several key characters basically got the shaft in terms of their own romances.  It’s a fun show for the most part, required viewing for yuri fans and probably one of the better shows of the genre out there.  That in itself is an indictment of yuri anime. Aoi.

As a bit of a technical story snob, I usually find that well-animated and voiced series with somewhat weak storylines tend to rate quite poorly with me. I find myself dropping them, or rating them well below a seven, but this series just has that something compelling about it that makes you enjoy it thoroughly-- despite some glaring problems with the plot. If I had to sum this series up in two words, it would quite easily be: Guilty pleasure.It is one of a very small number of series that...I can watch repeatedly and still enjoy quite a bit, despite my somewhat low 'overall' score. As you can see, I found this series ridiculously entertaining which--for me--is sometimes more important than a good technical overall score.Possibly the weakest part of this series was the plot. It was, at times, ridiculous, superficial, far-fetched, full of cheese and melodrama, but still oddly compelling. If it were a novel, the story would most likely be in a two-dollar bin in your local book store, yet there is somehow still enough substance buried in there to keep it afloat. Despite all I may say about the plot there are some truly touching moments buried in there -- and those are the little gems that keep you wanting more, despite yourself.Essentially the plot is separated into two mini-stories: The main following bumbling transfer-student Aoi Nagisa from Miator, and the secondary following Konohana Hikari, a timid choir-girl from Spica. While the majority of the plot centres around Nagisa, there is enough material from Hikari's story to keep you entertained if you find yourself uninterested by the protagonist's antics.With healthy doses of fluff and comedy, hefty smearings of romance and the odd tragic moment or two, there is certainly enough going on to keep the plot from idling. It was just a slight pity that they couldn't inject just a little more substance to enable me to rate it a little higher.Visually this series is quite beautiful. While not on par with KyotoAni's breath-taking animation, gorgeous scenery, dynamic colours and interesting character designs, it makes for quite the pleasant viewing experience. That said-- there are times when the artwork looks a little awkward, though fortunately they are few and far between. And if you can quickly adjust to the stick-thin legs and arms that are common in this series, the character designs are quite striking, of special note are Hanazono Shizuma and Minamoto Chikaru, though with an ensemble cast of well over twelve there is bound to be at least one design to find pleasing.Musically, Strawberry Panic is neither ground-breaking nor particularly breath-taking, yet there is a simplicity in the classical tracks that fit with the setting and overall tone of the series. Seiyuu performances are rather exquisite, with a cast consisting of: Nabatame Hitomi, Nakahara Mai, Shimizu Ai, Noda Junko and Kuwatani Natsuko there is more than enough skill to inject feeling into sometimes two-dimensional characters. Certainly there are some emotional scenes that are simply made by the skill of these masterful seiyuu.As I mentioned earlier, this series is made of an ensemble cast, but unfortunately they tend to be rather two-dimensional or stereotypical characters. That said, there is a wonderfully subtle build-up in a few of the characters that really does surprise, and you can't help but empathise with your favourites as they are put through an emotional blender.Despite it all I found myself strangely addicted to this series. Yes, the plot is weak, uses cliche plot progressions, makes no sense at times and is borderline ridiculous, yet I found it to be one of the most entertaining series in my collection. The chemistry between the characters, some brilliant work by the cast and some truly spectacular scenes mean that I enjoyed this series for what it was-- mindless fun. By episode twenty-six, I was more than disappointed that this series was over, and I would have to go elsewhere to find my fix of cheesy-goodness.If you want a deep and sophisticated plot in a similar vein, watch Maria-sama ga Miteru; if you want hours of cheesy, light-hearted goodness: Sit down, buckle in and prepare to turn off your brain and watch something that will have you going through severe withdrawal when it is all over.

I guess it&rsquo;s because of the look and feel of the anime &ndash; the girls didn&rsquo;t really look like they would engage in such &ldquo;activities&rdquo; &ndash; they all looked very innocent and sweet. It&rsquo;s a good thing the anime focused more on the dramatic side than sex scenes. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of sex scenes too, which is a huge sigh of relief for me.Poor Nagisa. She&rsquo;s obviously straight when she first came in and Shizuma had to corrupt her mind. I don&rsquo;t get how Shizuma would fall for...someone like Nagisa though. Nagisa is one ditzy girl and Shizuma&rsquo;s elegant and classy (with stone cold glances and stares too). I felt like Nagisa would have been better off with Tamao, and Shizuma with Rokujou. Hikari and Amane were a more convincing couple &ndash; mostly because Amane actually looks like a guy and Hikari&rsquo;s very ladylike.There&rsquo;s a part of me that still can&rsquo;t believe there were no male characters throughout the entire series. It reminded me even more of the 11 years I went to an all girls school wherein males are a rare commodity. I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed with the characters, because they didn&rsquo;t have much depth in them, so I&rsquo;m thought how interesting it would be if at least one guy showed up. They all had similar personalities too &ndash; with the exception of the older students such as Shizuma, Rokujou and Amane. Chikaru was a joy to watch though. She could very much be Haruhi Suzumiya&rsquo;s long lost sister. I bet if they ever meet they&rsquo;ll have a blast with each other.Animation and art were actually pretty good, as expected of Madhouse. Everything was drawn and designed well, from the meticulous, colorful backgrounds to the characters. The only problem I have is that the characters faces were almost too similar &ndash; the only thing that kept them distinct from each other (appearance &ndash; wise) were their hair color. Speaking of hair color, I noticed that only the main characters had different hair colors. The main characters had pink, blue, orange, etc. colored hair, while the background characters (extras) only had black or brown hair. Because of that the main characters really popped up when in a scene with many people. The character&rsquo;s eyes were very well drawn too.I&rsquo;m actually not familiar with most of the cast, but I do know Mai Nakahara. I loved her as Midori in Midori days &ndash; I really thought she made Midori 2-3 times cuter. She sounded a lot different as Nagisa though, which is why I didn&rsquo;t recognize her at first. I also know Shizuma&rsquo;s VA, Hitomi Nabatame, but sadly Shizuma didn&rsquo;t have a lot of lines for me to notice her either. Most of the scenes with Shizuma has her staring off into space or crying, etc.Strawberry Panic&rsquo;s music was very interesting. I love the very poppy and catchy themes of the show. It was a good contrast from the dramatic and moody BGM heard throughout the series. The BGM was classically-influenced, consisting of piano tracks, which fit the sophisticated atmosphere of Astraea hill. I also like the Ai Shimizu and Mai Nakahara&rsquo;s contribution to the soundtrack. They were a joy to watch and they brought something different to the table. I rarely see live action videos as ending/opening theme sequences.Generally, the anime is a lot like Maria-sama ga miteru. The two series have a lot of elements in common, such as the All girls&rsquo; catholic school, the French undertones and of course the girl-girl love. There was even a hint of a soeur system during the series. I have to say I still like Marimite more, it is my favorite series, but Strawberry Panic! wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It did get over dramatic sometimes, making me want to take a nap almost every time I watch it, but I still think it&rsquo;s worth watching. someone like Nagisa though. Nagisa is one ditzy girl and Shizuma&rsquo;s elegant and classy (with stone cold glances and stares too). I felt like Nagisa would have been better off with Tamao, and Shizuma with Rokujou.

I also like the Ai Shimizu and Mai Nakahara&rsquo;s contribution to the soundtrack. They were a joy to watch and they brought something different to the table. I rarely see live action videos as ending/opening theme sequences.Generally, the anime is a lot like Maria-sama ga miteru. The two series have a lot of elements in common, such as the All girls&rsquo; catholic school, the French undertones and of course the girl-girl love. There was even a hint of a soeur system during the series. I have to say I still like Marimite more, it is my favorite series, but Strawberry Panic! wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It did get over dramatic sometimes, making me want to take a nap almost every time I watch it, but I still think it&rsquo;s worth watching.', ""I watched this when I was 15 and had a completely wrong impression of how to go about a relationship with a girl. Now I find it to be one of the worst starters for girls who are lesbian or bisexual, it teaches you that manipulation and perversion is okay to push onto another, and that consent doesn't matter. At 15 I thought it was magical and incredible, but at 23, just seeing the first few episodes I already feel sickened by the portrayal of lesbians as creepy and abusive, and I think of all the young girls (like I was) watching this and thinking...this is how lesbian relationships must work, that it's okay to kiss another girl without her consent, or use any excuse to touch her (measure her body parts), humiliate her, and just full on objectify and assault her, and all the while the excuse for these abuses is that the subject is 'too cute', and finding another cute and child-like is enough of an excuse to treat her like an object.According to this signs of embarrassment in another girl is cute and a green flag for more humiliation with sexual undertones. Not only this but any sign of a character being uncomfortable, or non consenting is 'kawaii-fied' and another green flag for disturbing behaviour. It lead me as a teen to the impression that this abusive and fetishizing behaviour is acceptable between girls.Yes as a 15 year old I loved it, all of this I thought was Romantic, and I yearned for the kind of unequal relationship that Nagisa and Shizuma had, but looking back I can see how badly it affected me as a young and confused bisexual female, and I wish I had never watched it and given into the ideas that were put across in this anime. So I refuse to notice anything that might be good in this because it's impact is so destructive to a young girl's idea of a healthy lesbian relationships. this is how lesbian relationships must work, that it's okay to kiss another girl without her consent, or use any excuse to touch her (measure her body parts), humiliate her, and just full on objectify and assault her, and all the while the excuse for these abuses is that the subject is 'too cute', and finding another cute and child-like is enough of an excuse to treat her like an object.According to this signs of embarrassment in another girl is cute and a green flag for more humiliation with sexual undertones.

Strawberry Panic does have its share of positive traits, albeit a very small share, but it's main...draw is simply that it features pretty anime girls making googly eyes&mdash;and other significantly less tame things&mdash;at each other for 26 episodes.Strawberry Panic is full of beautiful stills in smooth, pastel colors. The backdrops are wonderfully rendered  and the character art is equally impressive. The trouble begins when those characters begin to move and interact with each other. As a series of loosely animated still images Strawberry Panic fares pretty well, and it usually manages to stick to its guns. However, the series does make a number of ill-advised decisions to break from its formula, when it should have simply polished up what it did have, instead of allowing some of the most important aspects of the series to atrophy in a disappointing display of what happens when good animators&mdash;or at the very least good artists&mdash;decide to get lazy. In a show so focused around drama and interaction between characters, the lack of expressive facial animations and the extensive shortcuts taken with reactions is mysterious, and, frankly, inexcusable. The tennis match late in the series also was a foolish animation decision, along with being a ridiculous and nearly worthless event on all sides, likely costing  significant amount of money and not delivering even a remotely positive effect. In fact, it stands as one of the worst animated sports sequences I have seen in my entire time watching anime.Also questionable is Strawberry Panic's reliance on an interesting all-or-nothing sort of fanservice, which features very few low angle shots or panty shots in general, instead inundating the viewer with essentially still images of two girls&mdash;usually in advanced stages of undress&mdash;entwined, accompanied by either slow camera zooms and pans or the constant gasping and cooing of the two girls anime fans are likely to know only too well. A lot of people are into that sort of thing, but it serves no purpose in the series. It does not enhance the romantic elements in any way, and because the fact that the entire school is comprised mostly of lesbians is taken for granted, it has no bearing on themes of sexuality it might otherwise have. If you're into that sort of thing:great, but if that does nothing or even little for you then you aren't very likely to enjoy most of the Strawberry Panic experience, as the entire series hinges on these exchanges to some degree.As far as audio is concerned, Strawberry Panic is an unimpressive, but ultimately positive, experience. Though the classical score speaks nothing of any ingenuity of any sort, it does nothing to take away from the series and is tolerable at establishing the mood. During the googly-eyed make-out sequences, though, the absence of much noise aside from the dull soundtrack is supremely noticeable, especially when they don't even bother to throw in some sighs and gasps. Variety would have served the soundtrack very well as well, as the same tracks are repeated time and time again. This is fairly common in anime, but it is more noticeable in Strawberry Panic because of the frequency of periods where the music is the only noise.The voice-acting is similarly vanilla. Most of the cast performs passably, but there aren't any real standouts, and the overall product is mediocre, at best, when it comes to the voice-acting. It isn't likely to stand out as especially bad, but neither will it remain in your mind as a paragon of any kind. I will say, though, that the actors perform admirably in many of the spots towards the end of the show, somehow lessening the idiotic melodrama of the latter events of the series. Much of the mediocrity of the voice-acting is also likely, in part, due to poor writing, which is most certainly present in full force.This brings me to the plot, which begins normally and pleasantly enough, but which quickly transforms into a monster of a melodramatic mess. Splitting across multiple storylines like a soap opera on crack&mdash;with delightfully fewer pregnancies and deaths&mdash;Strawberry Panic tries to cram as much drama into as few episodes as possible at every turn, only to suddenly retreat back into a feel good slice of life vibe that carries it to the next dramatic event. These events are sometimes tame events blown horribly out of proportion and sometimes massively ridiculous affairs that actually come off as humorous. By the end of the series it feels as if they were simply proving to the world that they weren't done throwing drama into this sucker. I am still amazed how a series with such a languid pace overall can feel so rushed at the end. Final episodes in anime tend to be  jam-packed, but the entirety of the last six or seven episodes is like a triathlon of bullshit. I kept waiting for it to pull back into safe territory, but Strawberry Panic was content to plunge headfirst into mediocrity and keep digging for the very bottom. It didn't quite reach, but it was one hell of an effort.All in all, Strawberry Panic is a series targeted at a very specific audience, to the detriment of any who watch who does not count themselves as a strong proponent of moe, not as a device but simply for the sake of itself. The series was built around moe, all aspects pointing centrally to accentuate it. The problem is, unlike some moe series which have other things to offer those less interested, Strawberry Panic has very little beyond the moe. The character design and art are good enough, so if moe is something you're really into, Strawberry Panic might very well be a good pick. All others, though, should stay away, as this series was not designed with the general viewer in mind.Final Score: 3/10 draw is simply that it features pretty anime girls making googly eyes&mdash;and other significantly less tame things&mdash;at each other for 26 episodes.Strawberry Panic is full of beautiful stills in smooth, pastel colors.

(if you have ever seen it. if not, then its basically one lyric song played about 5-6 times through the series.) the regular BMG was nothing new either. but the impression wasn't a bad one, and it didn't take away from the series at all.overall, i'd give the show a solid 8/10. it didn't have the real attention grabbing ability of a true masterpiece, and i felt that a few characters were neglected too much. but other than that it was well worth watching! away from the story and development, if anything the lack of sharp colors added some depth to the main storyline.The character and plot development was pretty good as well. the plot was a little slow to develop, and a few things were easy to point out. but then again i was surprised at the way a few things turned out and just at how everything was played. as for the characters, theres a very good variety of them, each holding some form of an archtype, but not blatantly so. the differences were subtle, and not cookie-cutter. unlike the plot development, the character development was a lot faster; you can tell what kind of person the characters were usually within the first few episodes after they were introduced. it didn't delve into the back story often, mostly concentrating on the present and the situations occurring now. so the development as a whole was a little lacking, but the delivery was well enough to make it enjoyable and easy to understand.the music was repetitive. though the opening and ending changed halfway into it, the music within the series was static, much like Madlax.

I ponder over the shadowy pages of the otaku necronomicon and bear the burden of wisdom that comes with it in order to protect my fellow weebs from ever having to do so themselves. As the selfless individual I am, I will always bear this metaphorical cross for you.Recently, in my research, I have made an unexpected discovery: The worst yuri anime adaptation ever conceived.As I poured over the noxious wasteland of foul and tasteless anime, I came...upon a classic girls love series from Spring 2006 titled 'Strawberry Panic.' It was a treacherous path that I walked in order to uncover this cryptic knowledge from a long-forgotten age. After 10 episodes of hogwash and slag I realized that this series wouldn't get any better; but still I carried on.Most of the main cast is shallow and the writers never really let any of them develop. Because of this we're left with a steaming basket of half-baked characters. On top of that, this series is exceptionally predictable from beginning to end: Whatever you think is going to happen is probably going to happen. But even with these negatives, I found two positives: Passionate voice acting and a beautiful soundtrack. But even with the good aspects, watching this anime to completion left me feeling like I had just ran an ultra-marathon through the Gobi Desert.Upon finishing Strawberry Panic, time stopped for me. An unseen weight was lifted off of my shoulders. As I write this post I feel as if the universe has finally reached it's inevitable thermal equilibrium and that I am being embraced by the warm nothingness of the ever-expanding universe. God's course is truly one eternal round and it has brought me back out of the endless pits of hell and into the warm embrace of reality. I've enjoyed every Yuri that I've seen up to now and I love romance anime in general, but this one was an Irish car bomb.Now, if you love super campy romance series, you might get some kind of satisfaction out of Strawberry Panic. It just didn't have anything for me; I tried so hard but I couldn't find anything to truly enjoy about this series. I wish you the best of luck if you decide to take the plunge into this boiling pit of eldritch waste.Godspeed.-------------------FYI: This isn't plagarized, I took the format for this review from a Reddit post I made while watching this series. upon a classic girls love series from Spring 2006 titled 'Strawberry Panic.'

I had so much fun watching this anime, and I\'d quality it as one of the best yuri anime I\'ve seen in all my years. Watching this made me feel guilty for not giving it a shot sooner. Still, this was so worth my time!Story : 9/10The story development was great all through the series, it showed signs of improvement as the story proceeds. The main blemish of this anime in my opinion is the story sometimes become slightly cliche and it made me feel uneasy while watching....The ending was likewise satisfactory, it didn\'t clear up everything. In spite of the fact that I could consider it as a ""decent"" ending. There are numerous things that are left unanswered.**SPOILER BELOW**For an example, what might happen to Tamao and Nagisa after the occasion where Shizuma took Nagisa and fleed? Or on the other hand what might happen to Shizuma? I thought she\'ll be graduating in months. Furthermore, that question prompts to what about Nagisa? After Shizuma leaves the school, what\'d happen next?I\'m almost certain the writer wants us to envision the rest of the story with our imagination, however I loathe little cliffhangers like this. A couple special episodes to clear these things would be great.**SPOILER END**Art : 6/10The art isn\'t terrible for an anime from 2006. Be that as it may, but my perspective in anime is ""If an anime quality sucks, then everything else sucks as well."" still, as I referenced previously. The other factors were excellent, therefore made me give this anime a high score. So I won\'t compose more criticisms about the animation quality of this anime or I\'ll feel guilty doing so. In addition, I believe it\'s fine for an anime this old anyways.Sound : 7/10I don\'t care the slightest bit about the sound. There were nothing extraordinary about the overall sound in this anime except the main opening which I slightly enjoyed it. There were also nothing terrible about the sounds either. I have no comment about the sound, I think giving it a solid score is fine.Character : 8/10The characters inside this anime are likable, however, I feel irritated that the main characters are getting practically the same attention as the supporting characters. For a precedent, Amane and Hikari. They gain so much development. While Tamao doesn\'t generally get enough development ( in my opinion ) in spite of the fact that she is one of the MAIN character.This would\'ve gotten a lower score, but I don\'t really mind and plus the majority of the characters gain a substantial amount of attention and development anyways. With that, it is enough for me.Enjoyment : 9/10A good Shoujo Ai with 26 episodes. How could anyone possibly dislike this? I enjoyed watching this, and I think this anime really should deserve more attention. If you\'re looking for a good yuri with many episodes, this is your next destination. Just try it out! Don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover!Overall : 9/10I enjoyed this anime A LOT! It could\'ve easily gotten 10/10 if things were clearer. But this much is enough for me already.

If you like yuri, it's not really my biggest recommendation, but that still doesn't mean I'm telling you not to watch it, it's still worth the watch for sure, at least in my opinion anyway :)The novel has 3 volumes, and the manga has 2 and I don't think there's anything I want more right now than them 5 books. I have a growing manga collection and I'd absolutely LOVE to have them be apart...of it, I really do think that Strawberry Panic is a masterpiece of it, I really do think that Strawberry Panic is a masterpiece"", 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but given this is my favorite anime I figured I\'d give it a shot. I started watching this anime because I wanted a yurified yurifest with some yuri on top, which, to my great satisfaction, i got. However what I wasn\'t expecting is a touching(and at times heartbreaking) love story that most people who watch this anime seem to over-look. Basically, you have three girl schools, which means three harems, two of which have their own love story, and one of which is for hilarity, comic relief, and general epic-ness. During the more Slice-of-lifey parts of the series, the characters...of the three schools hang out and interact together, but as far as love goes, most romance stays inside it\'s own school harem.Story: 7/10. This is a very character driven story, and as such there are very few outside influences that actually drive the story forward themselves. Of course, this is a love story, so that hardly comes as a surprise. Many of the events come across as cliche\' and sometimes down right cheesy. While there are many moments that are truly touching(I\'ve been brought to tears on multiple occasions), there are others that just make you want to gag. Luckily, these points aren\'t nearly common enough to totally ruin the enjoyment of the series as a whole, and the rest of this series make that barf worth swallowing.(This being a character driven story, i\'ll cover that in the ""characters"" portion)Art: 5/10. This isn\'t to say the art itself was poor, there are some truly spectacular scenes on Astraea. However, for the majority of a 26 episode series to take place in the same locations, the same forest, the same dormitories, the same everything, is just tedious. The lush hill-top Citadel and mansions, surrounded by forest and lake, are beautiful for the first half or so of the anime, but when you start noticing these backgrounds becoming used and reused through-out the series, they start to become old and tired. There are certain points every episode or two when new locations will be introduced and provide a refreshing change, but for the most part, you better get used to those trees and hallways.Sound: 9/10. Hands down, as far as openings go, this anime has two of the best I\'ve ever heard. Both of them are amazing both in terms of music and accompanying animation, and serves the mood of this anime perfectly. Unfortunately, the music played during the anime itself lets this category down slightly. As if this wasn\'t a big enough problem, the ""orchestra-ish"" music, while in all honesty is somewhat enjoyable on it\'s own, only serves to add to the ""cheesy soap-opera"" feel this series has at times, especially when played during the already nearly unbearable corny moments.Characters: 10/10. This is where Strawberry Panic truly shines. One of the greatest casts I\'ve seen in a yuri, and in anime in general. With three schools, each with their own unique ""onee-sama"" character, love interest, ""love interest\'s best friend"", and a fair amount of other, equally awesome cast members, there is no shortage of characters to fall in love with. By the end of the series, you would have to be heart-less to not feel a sense of attachment to the majority of them. Most anime with large casts become annoying and tedious to follow, but the characters in Strawberry Panic are all so unique and interesting, that the large-cast-harem theme was handled perfectly. When this series ended, I was almost as sad about missing the characters themselves as I was that the anime was over. The only gripe I can come up with is that certain characters, such as Chiyo, fall into generic anime arch-typesy, though this is hardly noticeable in the diverse cast SP offers.Enjoyment: 10/10. What can I say? Anime that I enjoyed as much as this one are few and far between. I laughed , I cried, I am head-over-heels in love with 90% of the characters.Overall: 9/10. On my list, I gave it a 10 as well as a comfy spot on my favorites list, but I want this review to be as un-biased as possible, and i cannot ignore it\'s flaws. I leave you with this: If you want a realistic, true to life romance-drama that addresses the difficulties of life, angst and love, search else where. Search FAR FAR AWAY, because you\'re not even in the ballpark, kid. If you want a sweet, touching, heart-warming love story about an all-girls school, my friend, you\'ve come to the right place. of the three schools hang out and interact together, but as far as love goes, most romance stays inside it\'s own school harem.Story: 7/10. This is a very character driven story, and as such there are very few outside influences that actually drive the story forward themselves. Of course, this is a love story, so that hardly comes as a surprise. Many of the events come across as cliche\' and sometimes down right cheesy. While there are many moments that are truly touching(I\'ve been brought to tears on multiple occasions), there are others that just make you want to gag. Luckily, these points aren\'t nearly common enough to totally ruin the enjoyment of the series as a whole, and the rest of this series make that barf worth swallowing.(This being a character driven story, i\'ll cover that in the ""characters"" portion)Art: 5/10. This isn\'t to say the art itself was poor, there are some truly spectacular scenes on Astraea. However, for the majority of a 26 episode series to take place in the same locations, the same forest, the same dormitories, the same everything, is just tedious. The lush hill-top Citadel and mansions, surrounded by forest and lake, are beautiful for the first half or so of the anime, but when you start noticing these backgrounds becoming used and reused through-out the series, they start to become old and tired. There are certain points every episode or two when new locations will be introduced and provide a refreshing change, but for the most part, you better get used to those trees and hallways.Sound: 9/10. Hands down, as far as openings go, this anime has two of the best I\'ve ever heard. Both of them are amazing both in terms of music and accompanying animation, and serves the mood of this anime perfectly. Unfortunately, the music played during the anime itself lets this category down slightly. As if this wasn\'t a big enough problem, the ""orchestra-ish"" music, while in all honesty is somewhat enjoyable on it\'s own, only serves to add to the ""cheesy soap-opera"" feel this series has at times, especially when played during the already nearly unbearable corny moments.Characters: 10/10. This is where Strawberry Panic truly shines. One of the greatest casts I\'ve seen in a yuri, and in anime in general. With three schools, each with their own unique ""onee-sama"" character, love interest, ""love interest\'s best friend"", and a fair amount of other, equally awesome cast members, there is no shortage of characters to fall in love with. By the end of the series, you would have to be heart-less to not feel a sense of attachment to the majority of them. Most anime with large casts become annoying and tedious to follow, but the characters in Strawberry Panic are all so unique and interesting, that the large-cast-harem theme was handled perfectly. When this series ended, I was almost as sad about missing the characters themselves as I was that the anime was over. The only gripe I can come up with is that certain characters, such as Chiyo, fall into generic anime arch-typesy, though this is hardly noticeable in the diverse cast SP offers.Enjoyment: 10/10.

While all the elements in this show would suggest a old-time shojo show - classical music, beautiful senpai with classic shojo drawings of big hair and an elegant aura, a (not so secret) garden, Catholic school complete with a cathedral, a fountain and classrooms,...sports that Japanese girls admire, and other classic shojo things, it\\'s clearly a show aimed at male Otakus because of all the yuri scenes going on, with some fanservice for males.It\\'s kind of odd because in the early days of shojo anime, shows with only women or almost only women and very few men in there would never be aimed at males. Boys/young men/men had always watched shows with men fighting in mechas, with swords, on a sports field, fighting and beating each other bloody, and so on. But with the obsessiveness of the Otaku, whom are often terrible when dealing with women - wanting to be with women but severely uncomfortable in women\\'s presence, shows that discover what women do around each other and alone (real and imaginary) are created.In any case, conflicts of love go on in this show, as various characters fall in love with different women (heehee), some of their love interests respond in kind, others fail to recipicate. A lot of conflicts and a dark past is revealed when love is being sparked. We follow Nagisa, our protagonist\\'s steps as she slowly discovers this campus, herself, her relationships with her roommate, who\\'s deep in love with her, her friends and surroundings, and her real love - the seemingly distant and playful Shizuma - the top of the top of the 3 campuses. Other characters also get developed.It\\'s hard to definite this as a shojo show or not. I call it the &quot;shori&quot; show - shonen fan service with Yuri elements in it. I simply cannot classify it as a shojo show because too many lesbian love in there, I mean, sometimes there are almost no normal female relationships in this show.Love the design of the characters, they\\'re all beautiful,  or cute, and all distinctive enough. The music is OK for me. Mostly classical and light music with nothing standing out. The characters are nicely fleshed out, with some shojo and imaginary lesbian stereotypes - this is made for shy male otakus after all. The plots are shojoesque with infighting and competition over the top title of the 3 campuses but it isn\\'t terribly boring. Maybe it\\'s because I love seeing shojo-ai and I appreciate the seiyuu for their work in this show.Recommended for all who love shojo-ai/yuri.

Love is something strong that can't be understood with mere words. Picture yourself in a fateful encounter with a person that once you met you cannot get enough of.

She wasn’t especially smart, she wasn’t especially pretty, she wasn’t especially noble...  There was really nothing special about her.  Then, one day, she transferred into Miator Academy, one of three all girl schools located at the top of Astraea hill, a sacred place where no males are allowed to enter.  The three schools are affiliated, and they only accept female students from proper, upstanding families...  Well, there’s one other possible qualifier, but we’ll talk more about that later.  Students are expected to live on campus in two person dorm rooms, and as...a right of passage, first year students are expected to act as maids for their elders.  Luckily, Nagisa was able to avoid this fate, transferring to the school in her third year of education because of...  Reasons...  And it was at this school that the once ordinary Nagisa would become...  Well, still an ordinary girl.  There’s no evidence that that part of her is ever going to change.  But somehow, despite this ugly duckling slowly growing into an average duck, there is one thing about her life that is about become extraordinary.For you see, at these three schools way up on Astraea Hill, they elect more than just a student council...  They also elect an Etoile, who represent the school in all of it’s glamour and prestige.  For now, the Etoile is Shizuna, a tall mysterious girl with long white hair and a spirit that radiates with ennui and depression, and for seemingly no reason at all, she appears to have taken a very special interest in young Nagisa.  From long measuring glances to sudden, uninvited embraces that come within a hair’s breadth of ending in a sultry kiss, the most beloved and respected student on campus has her empty eyes on Nagisa, and they’re filling up fast.  Nagisa has no idea how she attracted this kind of romantic attention, but luckily for the older girl, she doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to try to lose it, either.  As the two young ladies become closer, and the bond between them begins to form, they’ll find that the Astraea Hill School System is both a political and social minefield, full of backstabbing, sabotage and political intrigue.  Will our perfectly ordinary heroine brave the dangers of Astraea Hill for the sake of a love that’s truly extraordinary, or will her destiny fall short in the end?The Strawberry Panic anime was produced by Studio Madhouse to capitalize on the successful magazine run of a series of short stories, all focusing on different all-female romances taking place at the Astraea Hill Schools.  Productions from Madhouse rarely ever have generous amounts of money poured into them, which can lead to even beloved classics like Trigun looking wonky half the time, but on the plus side, some shows can still flourish visually without a lot of financial backing, like the dialogue-heavy Death Note.  Well, Strawberry Panic may have a lot of dialogue in it, but the nicest thing I can probably say about it is that it’s not the worst looking anime I’ve ever seen.  They clearly tried their hardest with it, but there’s only so much a bare bones budget can do when it’s attached to a light, fluffy show that doesn’t have the benefit of heavy shadows or obscure angles to hide it’s flaws.  I’m honestly not sure how good this show even COULD look, as it’s clearly the kind of show that Kyoto animation was born for.Madhouse tries to hide the limitations of this show’s movements, and for the most part, it does manage to pull it off, relying on as many staticky conversations and panning shots as it possibly can, and it treads water at least well enough to...  well, not enough that the shoestring budget goes unnoticed, but well enough that you can ignore it and focus on the story.  Having said that, the very second the motion needs to pick up even the slightest bit, the returns can be flat out embarrassing.  Characters walking often look like profile images bouncing up and down as they move across the background, a tragic horse accident in the latter episodes is clumsy enough to bring inappropriate roars of laughter to what’s supposed to be somber scene, and if you can tear yourself away from the beautiful piano melody in one particular scene, you’ll feel duped when you realize that you’re just looking at a panning shot where a couple of frozen characters just move their upper arms ever so slightly.  You can’t even watch a character fall down the stairs on screen, no, there’s a very intentional cutaway.It’s a nice looking show in terms of design, however, as every named character has a specific look that you probably won’t forget, even if you haven’t seen them or thought of them for extended stretches of episodes.  In fact, I got so used to having their looks inform their identities that towards the end, I briefly mistook one of the main characters for being two separate girls all because her hair was sometimes down.  Their designs are generic, but they’re at least different enough to distinguish one girl from another, and the use of different uniforms for each school also helped this to happen.  Miator has black uniforms, Spica has white uniforms, and Lulim have yellow vests paired with checkered skirts, all three of these designs being popular ones from the history of high school anime.  Oh, and of course, there are also maid outfits present.  The backgrounds are serviceable enough, and although it doesn’t really have anything to do with the story, the architecture is also really pretty to look at.  There’s also a lot of flowers...  Yeah, I know, it’s a yuri, big surprise...  But they’re not just border decoration, there’s a greenhouse full of them, and a lot of care clearly went into their rendering.As I mentioned before, whatever beauty the visuals may lack is made up for tenfold with the soundtrack.  The instrumentation is mostly comprised of violin, piano and cello, and while the standard slice-of-life music that occurs while nothing’s really going on can be a bit on the underwhelming side, there’s a lot of melancholy and pain in this anime, and the music translates this beautifully.  There are a couple of classical songs that are played when Shizuna and Nagisa are bonding over the piano, the instantly recognizable but still very well-chosen Moonlight sonata and Maiden’s Prayer.  As for the original music, Yoshihisa Hirano put together a powerful score that almost manages to lend gravity to the melodramatic nature of the series.  There are several emotionally gripping moments that work hand in hand with the score to rip your tear ducts out through your throat, But at the same time, honestly, there are several moments in this show that are so uncomfortable that the music will wind up being the only thing you WANT to remember them for.  Kaori’s theme tends to be a popular favorite, but I strongly prefer the tension present in Unmei and Fui ni Semararete.The aversion to movement is unfortunately carried through to the first opening, which appears to do the bare minimum on a visual scale, showing the different characters in leisurely glamour shots, reacting to the camera before the next character can get their spotlight.  The song, Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete by Aki Misato, is a fine song on it;s own, a little on the generic side but still well orchestrated and catchy.  It’s a good enough op, but it;s also a really predictable one, so I’m glad the second opening threw all of this convention out the window.  It’s called Kuchibiru Daydream, once again by Aki Misato,  but it comes off as a lot more lively and inspired, with more force and flow behind the vocals.  The imagery in this opening is also a massive improvement, as it still kinda reeks of budget restrictions, but it’s able to do a lot more with it on account of the fact that it TRIES to do a lot more with it.  This mirrors the level of effort present in the anime, which started off a little lackluster before picking up steam towards the second half.The endings, surprisingly enough are mostly live action.  You don’t see that very often nowadays, and for good reason, but these ones actually do manage to skew past the awkwardness thanks to the chemistry of the two ladies on screen, Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu.  They also happen to be the singers of Secret Dolls, which has a distinctive goth-rock feel to it.  Makes sense, I guess, since they’re both all dressed up in goth-loli costumes, which I would consider overkill if it didn’t fit the doll theme so well.  They sell the yearning between them mostly through facial expressions and clever directing, and finish by sealing the song with a kiss.  The same two singers reprise their roles for the second ending song, Ichigo Tsumi monogatari, which is...  A thing.  A really weird thing.  It goes off in an entirely different direction with creepy singing paper cut-out CGI, and that’s all fine compared to the fact that the energy and set design remind me of Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi, which is one of those things nothing should ever remind me of .  So yeah, the second opening and the first closing were really great.And since there’s no English dub, I guess we should get right into the writing, huh?  Well, I do have a few comments about the Japanese sub, even though I’m woefully underqualified to judge Japanese acting.  First of all, there are a lot of times where the lip flaps didn’t match the voice of the people speaking, which is a mistake I thought only dubs could make, and it’s a shame that I was only able to watch it with subtitles, because I had trouble keeping up with the dialogue whenever my eyes started to involuntarily close over how bored I was.  Oh yeah, we’re starting on this note;  There are a few things Strawberry Panic is known for, and I’m pretty sure one of them is just how much of a train wreck the story and plot are.  That is, when there’s even story and plot present.  right off the bat, we’re introduced to some meek little redhead with so special or distinguishable characteristics in a cast that’s already bloated from the start, and while it feels like you’re supposed to care about her, you’re never told or shown why she’s worth that kind of attention.The only interesting thing we learn about her...  Possibly ever, now that I think about it...  Is that she has the ability to uncontrollably run through forests like she’s a WWE wrestler waiting to encounter a rope to bounce off of.  Aside from Shizuna’s abrupt attraction to her, nothing else of consequence happens for a very long time.  We’re dropped into a story that has at least a dozen characters, little to no attempts at world-building, and a bunch of creepy non-consensual almost-kisses being our only clue as to what or who we’re supposed to care about.  I would honestly recommend keeping a pillow handy during the first six episodes, and on and off after that, just in case you decide that a dream might be more interesting than what’s going on onscreen.  It meanders through fields of inconsequential fluff before it ever approaches anything resembling a point, wastingtime on characters who wind up getting shoved to the side anyway, including almost everybody from the Lulim school, like a loli with a teddy bear, a pair of useless girls who I just wound up calling Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and one named Chikaru who I wish was important, because she feels really likeable.There is a point, of course, but it takes an inexcusably long time to get there, and even then, there are problems present.  The actual meat of the story is the romance between Shizuna and Nagisa, and while you’re never really given a clear reason as to why Nagisa would develop feelings for the older girl, Shizuna’s attraction to her is VERY well defined, and while I won’t spoil it here, it carries an admittedly compelling layer of conflict and tragedy to the idea of the two of them being together.  Besides, while Nagisa’s feelings may be undefined, they still feel more than real enough to make the audience genuinely care where their romance goes.  They’re not the only major romance, though, as there’s another sub-plot involving an equestrian and a young blonde student, and it starts out okay...  It’s really sweet and heartwarming at first, then it dives into a bit more drama as it evolves into a love triangle, but it all goes south as the two villain characters standing in their way get drawn in, making it a love pentagon, with enough going on in it to make it feel beyond convoluted, and that’s BEFORE the hokey-as-fuck amnesia plot twist.Honestly, thinking back, I’m tempted to say that Shizuna is the only character in the cast who really feels developed and fleshed out by the end.  We know what happened to her, why it happened, how it started, how it made her the person she is, and how it motivated her actions in the present, and there’s a lot of room to interpret whether she’s a selfish character, a sympathetic character, or both.  For the most part, everybody else has personalities that have been defined just enough to differentiate them from each other, but their personalities are almost entirely informed by their role in the story and their interactions with others.  With the exception of a few girls from Lulim, you won’t have any trouble remembering who’s who, but  you’ll have a hard time caring for any of them, aside from the two main couples and maybe Nagisa’s roommate, but that’s a hard maybe.  You’ll probably wind up hating the little girl with the teddy bear...  Well, a lot of people seem to, I personally just ignored her...  And there are a few characters who, after they’ve disappeared for a while, might just coax a “Hey, I remember you!” out of you when they appear again.But you know what?  There was one story arc where everyone generally came out looking good.  Yeah, some of the best moments in the series take place when Shizuna and Nagisa are alone(depending on your tolerance for questionable levels of consent), but the one arc that really worked as an ensemble was when the three schools decided to put on a play.  They pick the European classic Carmen, and just about everybody plays a fun role in this arc.  Egos are challenged in the cast listing, Nagisa gets a little extra depth, the villains get to be nasty for what feels like no real reason, there’s intrigue and last minute improvisation, beautiful costumes...  The problem is that it only lasts two episodes, despite spanning a period of several weeks.  In a smarter anime, they’d have expanded this arc to at least a quarter of the show, using it as a backdrop to other less consequential stories, tying them into it so that there’d be something to look forward to through other boring or forgettable moments.But they don’t do that here...  Strawberry Panic never comes near the level of effort or inspiration that it would take to come up with a solution like that.  Well, fine, you wanna get lazy?  There’s another solution they could have tried...  Cut the length of the series down to 13 episodes.  There’s a ton of material they could have cut, and I’m sorry to say, as pleasant as it was in the beginning, the entire Hikari/Amane/Yaya thing could have gone bye-bye along with it.  I mean, seriously, would anyone miss that sub-plot?  They could have cut the story down to just focusing on one school, Miator, and still had enough time to develop Nagisa and the few supporting characters around her more properly.    The problem is, and I can’t believe more people haven’t noticed this, is because this isn’t a show you’re supposed to think about.  You’re supposed to be drawn into the emotion and the romantic and political intrigue, because if you stop to think about what you’re watching for one second, you’ll realize that very little of what you’re seeing makes even a lick of sense.For example, I can’t be the only one who found the Etoile system to be confusing as fuck.  Let’s see if I’ve got this right...  It’s an elected position where you’re basically an ornament, meant to uphold the beauty and nobility ideals of the school, and you’re not the Student council president, even though you have to sign a lot of undefined papers.  You apparently keep this position until you graduate, which can take up to six years...  If you follow the plot closely, Shizuna’s been doing it about three years...  And it’s vital that you have two of them, but if you lose one for whatever reason, they just carry on without making any attempt to replace her.  Oh, and you can be from different grades, so what happens when one graduates and the other hasn’t yet?  And are you supposed to be a couple with your partner?  If not, why would you have to run away and abandon the election just to be with the person you love?  And why do the people in charge tell prospective candidates that they don’t have a choice when they clearly do?  And why is it okay for one school to not submit any candidates?  Is any of this explained in the source material?And there’s one other thing I had trouble understanding, which hopefully won’t get me into any trouble...  Why and how is everyone in this school a lesbian?  I’m not trying to be homophobic here, but something’s off about that ratio.  If I were to transfer into an all asexual school, for example, I’d find that disturbingly off-putting.  I’d be asking a lot of questions, such as if we’re being segregated, or if they’re quarantining us to protect the local birth rate.  I wouldn’t want everyone in my environment to be like me, so why is everyone in this school a lesbian?  Is it like a Sorting Hat situation?  I’ve heard that one of the best ways to make LGBT stories compelling is to include conflict revolving around dealing with ignorance and bigotry, but none of that exists here, it’s just a sapphic paradise where love between girls is the unquestioned norm.  Nobody even brings up what their futures will be like once they graduate and reenter Japan’s heavily patriarchal society, which almost makes the series feel vapid.  It has no stakes.No, I know exactly what they were going for with this...  It’s an escapist fantasy.  You know, the kind of story where the reader can experience a situation or lifestyle that would be impossible or really troublesome in real life.  It’s unrealistic by design, and it’s pure self-indulgence.  This series was written for the viewer to escape into a world where everyone’s a beautiful lesbian, with no conflict outside of their romantic woes and social standings.  Now, is that a bad thing?  Maybe...  Honestly, it depends on who the fantasy is designed for.  A lot of lesbian media is intentionally designed to exploit queer people for the sake of fetishizing them for the enjoyment of straight males, and that was my initial impression of the series.  Of course, there was also the possibility that the lesbian fantasy in this show was created as an escape FOR lesbians, especially when you consider just how badly oppressed they are in Japan NOW, let alone in 2006 when this series was released.  It’s an important distinction to make in cases like this...  Who’s it for?To answer this question, I took to social media, and asked for anybody who’s seen the series to let me know what they thought of it, along with their gender and sexual preferences.  I didn’t get a lot of responses, which isn’t very surprising when you consider how personal a question that is, but what was surprising was that the few responses I did get were from queer women who had generally favorable opinions of it.  They were well aware that the show had issues, and that it’s problematic in spots and a little dumb, but they all said that when they watched it as teenagers...  Remember, this show is now 11 years old...  It helped them come to terms with their sexualities, and even taught them that it was possible, even okay, for a woman to have romantic feelings for another woman. They even said that the material that was obviously meant for titillation was just as enjoyable for them as it was for presumed straight male viewers, barring the few non-consensual moments.   Admittedly, my sample size was small, but it was still very revealing in terms of what it means to the people I thought it was just exploiting.  It’s not much, but it does earn the series a little redemption in my book.Strawberry Panic is available from Anime works, a division of Media blasters.  The 5 disk thin pack has unfortunately doubled in average price since it was released five years ago, but used copies on Ebay can be found at a reasonable price.  The original novels are available stateside from Seven Seas, and the original manga is available from the same company.While the process of reviewing this title has been enlightening, my opinion on it has remained largely unchanged.  I still consider it a train wreck, full of random fluff, way more characters than it could handle, and an ending that was entirely unsatisfying and wound up raising far more questions than it answered.  Having said all that, I do understand that it has an important place in LGBT anime.  It doesn’t tackle the struggle to define ones’ self, as Utena did, and it doesn’t satirize the oppressive patriarchal society of Japan the way Yurikuma Arashi eventually would, but it does manage to present the idea of same sex romance in a somewhat progressive way, and I can’t really fault it for that.  It presents an escapist fantasy where queer women both younger and older can set aside the idea of forbidden love and guilt so they can just feel normal in a world that’s constantly telling them they’re not.  I still can’t justifiably call it a good show, but at the very least, I do now know that there are people out there that I can confidently recommend it to, even if that demographic is a small one.  I give Strawberry Panic a 4/10. a right of passage, first year students are expected to act as maids for their elders.  Luckily, Nagisa was able to avoid this fate, transferring to the school in her third year of education because of...  Reasons...  And it was at this school that the once ordinary Nagisa would become...  Well, still an ordinary girl.  There’s no evidence that that part of her is ever going to change.  But somehow, despite this ugly duckling slowly growing into an average duck, there is one thing about her life that is about become extraordinary.For you see, at these three schools way up on Astraea Hill, they elect more than just a student council...  They also elect an Etoile, who represent the school in all of it’s glamour and prestige.  For now, the Etoile is Shizuna, a tall mysterious girl with long white hair and a spirit that radiates with ennui and depression, and for seemingly no reason at all, she appears to have taken a very special interest in young Nagisa.  From long measuring glances to sudden, uninvited embraces that come within a hair’s breadth of ending in a sultry kiss, the most beloved and respected student on campus has her empty eyes on Nagisa, and they’re filling up fast.  Nagisa has no idea how she attracted this kind of romantic attention, but luckily for the older girl, she doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to try to lose it, either.  As the two young ladies become closer, and the bond between them begins to form, they’ll find that the Astraea Hill School System is both a political and social minefield, full of backstabbing, sabotage and political intrigue.  Will our perfectly ordinary heroine brave the dangers of Astraea Hill for the sake of a love that’s truly extraordinary, or will her destiny fall short in the end?The Strawberry Panic anime was produced by Studio Madhouse to capitalize on the successful magazine run of a series of short stories, all focusing on different all-female romances taking place at the Astraea Hill Schools.  Productions from Madhouse rarely ever have generous amounts of money poured into them, which can lead to even beloved classics like Trigun looking wonky half the time, but on the plus side, some shows can still flourish visually without a lot of financial backing, like the dialogue-heavy Death Note.  Well, Strawberry Panic may have a lot of dialogue in it, but the nicest thing I can probably say about it is that it’s not the worst looking anime I’ve ever seen.  They clearly tried their hardest with it, but there’s only so much a bare bones budget can do when it’s attached to a light, fluffy show that doesn’t have the benefit of heavy shadows or obscure angles to hide it’s flaws.  I’m honestly not sure how good this show even COULD look, as it’s clearly the kind of show that Kyoto animation was born for.Madhouse tries to hide the limitations of this show’s movements, and for the most part, it does manage to pull it off, relying on as many staticky conversations and panning shots as it possibly can, and it treads water at least well enough to...  well, not enough that the shoestring budget goes unnoticed, but well enough that you can ignore it and focus on the story.  Having said that, the very second the motion needs to pick up even the slightest bit, the returns can be flat out embarrassing.  Characters walking often look like profile images bouncing up and down as they move across the background, a tragic horse accident in the latter episodes is clumsy enough to bring inappropriate roars of laughter to what’s supposed to be somber scene, and if you can tear yourself away from the beautiful piano melody in one particular scene, you’ll feel duped when you realize that you’re just looking at a panning shot where a couple of frozen characters just move their upper arms ever so slightly.  You can’t even watch a character fall down the stairs on screen, no, there’s a very intentional cutaway.It’s a nice looking show in terms of design, however, as every named character has a specific look that you probably won’t forget, even if you haven’t seen them or thought of them for extended stretches of episodes.  In fact, I got so used to having their looks inform their identities that towards the end, I briefly mistook one of the main characters for being two separate girls all because her hair was sometimes down.  Their designs are generic, but they’re at least different enough to distinguish one girl from another, and the use of different uniforms for each school also helped this to happen.  Miator has black uniforms, Spica has white uniforms, and Lulim have yellow vests paired with checkered skirts, all three of these designs being popular ones from the history of high school anime.  Oh, and of course, there are also maid outfits present.  The backgrounds are serviceable enough, and although it doesn’t really have anything to do with the story, the architecture is also really pretty to look at.  There’s also a lot of flowers...  Yeah, I know, it’s a yuri, big surprise...  But they’re not just border decoration, there’s a greenhouse full of them, and a lot of care clearly went into their rendering.As I mentioned before, whatever beauty the visuals may lack is made up for tenfold with the soundtrack.  The instrumentation is mostly comprised of violin, piano and cello, and while the standard slice-of-life music that occurs while nothing’s really going on can be a bit on the underwhelming side, there’s a lot of melancholy and pain in this anime, and the music translates this beautifully.  There are a couple of classical songs that are played when Shizuna and Nagisa are bonding over the piano, the instantly recognizable but still very well-chosen Moonlight sonata and Maiden’s Prayer.  As for the original music, Yoshihisa Hirano put together a powerful score that almost manages to lend gravity to the melodramatic nature of the series.  There are several emotionally gripping moments that work hand in hand with the score to rip your tear ducts out through your throat, But at the same time, honestly, there are several moments in this show that are so uncomfortable that the music will wind up being the only thing you WANT to remember them for.  Kaori’s theme tends to be a popular favorite, but I strongly prefer the tension present in Unmei and Fui ni Semararete.The aversion to movement is unfortunately carried through to the first opening, which appears to do the bare minimum on a visual scale, showing the different characters in leisurely glamour shots, reacting to the camera before the next character can get their spotlight.  The song, Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete by Aki Misato, is a fine song on it;s own, a little on the generic side but still well orchestrated and catchy.  It’s a good enough op, but it;s also a really predictable one, so I’m glad the second opening threw all of this convention out the window.  It’s called Kuchibiru Daydream, once again by Aki Misato,  but it comes off as a lot more lively and inspired, with more force and flow behind the vocals.  The imagery in this opening is also a massive improvement, as it still kinda reeks of budget restrictions, but it’s able to do a lot more with it on account of the fact that it TRIES to do a lot more with it.  This mirrors the level of effort present in the anime, which started off a little lackluster before picking up steam towards the second half.The endings, surprisingly enough are mostly live action.  You don’t see that very often nowadays, and for good reason, but these ones actually do manage to skew past the awkwardness thanks to the chemistry of the two ladies on screen, Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu.  They also happen to be the singers of Secret Dolls, which has a distinctive goth-rock feel to it.  Makes sense, I guess, since they’re both all dressed up in goth-loli costumes, which I would consider overkill if it didn’t fit the doll theme so well.  They sell the yearning between them mostly through facial expressions and clever directing, and finish by sealing the song with a kiss.  The same two singers reprise their roles for the second ending song, Ichigo Tsumi monogatari, which is...  A thing.  A really weird thing.  It goes off in an entirely different direction with creepy singing paper cut-out CGI, and that’s all fine compared to the fact that the energy and set design remind me of Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi, which is one of those things nothing should ever remind me of .  So yeah, the second opening and the first closing were really great.And since there’s no English dub, I guess we should get right into the writing, huh?  Well, I do have a few comments about the Japanese sub, even though I’m woefully underqualified to judge Japanese acting.  First of all, there are a lot of times where the lip flaps didn’t match the voice of the people speaking, which is a mistake I thought only dubs could make, and it’s a shame that I was only able to watch it with subtitles, because I had trouble keeping up with the dialogue whenever my eyes started to involuntarily close over how bored I was.

For the most part, everybody else has personalities that have been defined just enough to differentiate them from each other, but their personalities are almost entirely informed by their role in the story and their interactions with others.

I give Strawberry Panic a 4/10.', ""Well, this was an....experience. And that's about it. Compared to newer titles like Sakura Trick and Bloom Into You, the flaws in Strawberry Panic really shine through. There's so much to go into so I'll try to break down my gripes with this anime.Story: 5/10The anime does have a clearly defined story and major plot points that make up this story but it meanders so much and is packed with filler that makes it a slog to get through. It does its best to build this world and flesh out the history behind the schools and how they're all connected and what their functions are...but it just leads to a bunch of melodramatic politics and painfully slow set ups for other plot points. Students are shown being chastised for sneaking around during lights out and never get caught again. There are a bunch of painful cliches and there are entire episodes I wanted to skip because the series made it hard to care. It's just oozing melodrama.Art: 4/10When there is animation, it's kind of bad. The backgrounds are nice enough and I enjoyed the architecture. The one area that actually looks very nice is the greenhouse, but the flower art seems to have more thought and effort put into it than most of the art in the series.Sound: 3/10I might be alone on hating the soundtrack for this series. The background music can often be shrill and ear piercing, and because there are a lot of melodies that are so distinct that get reused often, I got tired of hearing them over and over again. The lip flaps are wonky and don't match in a few places as well.Character: 5/10My biggest gripe with this anime is the protagonists love interest. We are supposed to view her as a brooding, beautiful, tortured soul that is loved and respected by everyone. But what we're introduced to is a woman that refuses to do her most basic duties and plays with the emotions of those around her because she's brooding and lonely. She goes out of her way to hurt her friends and the main character due to her incredibly selfish nature. I could not stand this character and sadly she's given the most backstory. But for me, this past did not in any way excuse her actions. One of the other love interests for the main character that is far more caring and shown to have been far better in every aspect is shoved to the side in favor of this selfish character.The main character is plain and almost serves as a husk for the viewer to project themselves on. There are multiple romance plots but because the characters involved in them are so one dimensional and boring even the multi love interest love polygons are boring.Most of the women portrayed have love interests in other women, and while not necessarily a bad thing (kind of the point of the show) there could have been a scene where characters caught in the act of such things are reprimanded and warned to not do it. Then at least there would be some stakes involved with where and when these people reciprocate their feelings. On top of that, they throw themselves at each other without consent and it isn't shown as a problem until much later on in the series.Enjoyment: 4/10It's hard to enjoy something when the plot keeps getting diverted and then you're given more melodrama from undeveloped characters that you can't possibly care for. I fell asleep watching this so many times and would restart an episode because it is filled with so much useless dialogue and is lacking in animation. I had to stop the series halfway through and then watched the entirety of Bloom Into You before going back to it. I needed to find a better romance anime and watch the whole thing in the middle of this one to keep watching it. That's how boring it is. It tries to paint itself as mature but lacks a likable cast and consists mostly of meaningless plot developments and painfully overblown melodrama.Overall: 4I recommend this only to see where things can go horribly wrong in this genre. Then to compare that with some of the more modern titles that have come out that are more accurate, more romantic, and far more wholesome than Strawberry Panic. Otherwise I would not point anyone looking for a good romantic story to watch it. but it just leads to a bunch of melodramatic politics and painfully slow set ups for other plot points. Students are shown being chastised for sneaking around during lights out and never get caught again. There are a bunch of painful cliches and there are entire episodes I wanted to skip because the series made it hard to care.

And WOW, it\'s an emotional journey.Even though I crushed all 26 episodes in about 3 days, I had a great time watching the story unfold. The characters are fantastic and all adorable as hell. The bottom line is that this is a great anime. It\'s actually one of the few anime dramas I\'ve seen, and it was quite sad at times. If you can muscle through the sad moments, you\'ll have a great time watching.The only problem I had with some of the characters is that they seem more significant then...they become while the series unfolds. For example, Chiyo, who adores Nagisa to death, seems to fall short of having any real impact on Nagisa despite the fact that Chiyo is a main character. A few other of the ""first year"" characters who are actively involved with Nagisa and Tamao also fall into this shortcoming.Aside from a few flaws here and there, this anime builds up at a very tense pace developing relationships and characters with every single episode. Once you reach home stretch of the last 5 episodes, you\'ll sit there holding your breath anxiously awaiting the ending. It\'s worth every single episode, and in fact one of the most rewarding shows I\'ve completed. they become while the series unfolds.

The anime also didnt just focus on one single couple, but focused on a hole 5 couples total (this...includes a former relationship and a missunderstod one).The series really did go for a emotional show-down in the later-half of the series by putting in one of the biggest missunderstandings and one heck-of-a seriously tragic backstory that surrounded one of the main-characters.To be honest, i personaly think that the later half of SBP was so well carried out that it even made me share a tear. includes a former relationship and a missunderstod one).The series really did go for a emotional show-down in the later-half of the series by putting in one of the biggest missunderstandings and one heck-of-a seriously tragic backstory that surrounded one of the main-characters.To be honest, i personaly think that the later half of SBP was so well carried out that it even made me share a tear.', 'There are not very many yuri anime out there. Among them, not many sink its teeth into character-driven plots or relationships with drama that is more than mere \'misunderstandings.\' What Strawberry Panic attempts to portray are various views of first-love in the setting of Astraea Hill. Love at first sight. Love for someone admired by all. Unrequited love. The loss of love. And, learning to love. Along with the joys, sorrow, anguish, and bliss that comes with it.An ambitious undertaking for sure. However, one that, even with 24 episodes, was not executed well. The pacing often either stagnates or jumps around; while the overall...story can be followed despite this, what the characters experience feels off. Something intense happens one moment, then whiplashes to another mood the next. Two events may be happening at once, but they don\'t share similar qualities, sometimes they conflict, causing confusion in the viewing experience. Thus, the pacing feels, incoherent at times.I am not one to suggest alternatives to the plot to make the story better; that would make an entirely different material.

This show would have you believe it is the most popular person(s) on campus, but I believe the characters think it represents more than just that. Without much spoilers, as an unused element, I think it\'s high up there. Another element would be the wider world. The entire show takes place on Astraea Hill, an isolated campus. But the world beyond the campus is almost never mentioned; not for describing someone\'s past, nor for their future. If characters were to think beyond their campus, or relate their campus to the wider world, some developments would be more natural.Perhaps my biggest criticism with this show is how some character arcs were lacking: both in cause-and-effect, and resolution. To give credit where it\'s due, when something big happens, it does affect the character(s) involved. They will cry their hearts out, open their hearts to those close, and find comfort with friends. But... what happens next...? The same thing, then again, and again. It is incredible how these characters do not grow through their experiences, only to fall prey to it again and again without addressing why. One thing I love in other shows like this, is how a character has grown into a stronger person by the end of their ordeal; be it in how they carry themselves, or how they interact with others. But in this show, if you watch the first the first three episodes, and the last 3 episodes, the characters stay mostly the same, save for one... kinda.In conclusion, Strawberry Panic certainly kept me tuned-in.

XD "", ""Strawberry panic seemed to be a popular 'yuri-shipper' anime so i decided to give it a try..sadly i was a bit dissapointed.[i know there a few of my MaL friends who loved it ..so sorry and hear me out] I'll start with the story.Story left much to be desired. The pace of it for was felt so slow. im not sure if i was the constant --lets have a tea party-- or -- make some cookies-- fillers but for me, it felt as if the episode wouldnt end. [not good if im constantly looking at the timer to see if and ep is...almost done yet] Not tosay there arnt shipper-arks that i wasnt curious about their ending but wherei was taken in the story was either typical or bland. Somthing that also bothered me was the lack of male characters...ANYWHERE!! no male teachers, vistors...brothers...umm..fathers! O.o someone has to have dad iright?! i understand this is a girls school and yuri..but come on! the setting of the story also bothered me they seemed to never leave their school area ..either to shop or do typical high school stuff [in im guessing japan]when they did leave it was for romantic tryst in the country or priviate beach. the only thing these girls did for fun were tea parties,school politics,and make up diff clubs everyday[where id be xD if i was stuck there] just not realistic..even for anime.Art was pleasent to the eye. i did like their character design; Maincharacter shizuma's eyes were very pretty. The design of the outfit design was great w/ the 3 schools having diff dress. i liked the layout of the schooland strawberry dorms w/ it heavy cathloic school feel. some charc seem tohave huge craniums and somes the their legs look like flesh colored sticks,butstill not many complaints.Music meh..not a strong point it seems not even for peoplewho enjoy this series intro and endings were cutsy ,but not really catchyor anything memorable..neither was backround music..so mehCharacters i found to be a bit sterotypical either for theircharacter type or for women in general. Good ex: is Amane: silent,butkind prince type [she even rides a white horse..star bride..really *face palm*] and the shy sweet princess type:Hikari. is it suprising that she fell for Amane..nope!  even if she has perfectly nice,funny, smexy roomateright next to who'madly in love with her Do they do anything unexpected with this story..they tried xP u wana see a good girl whosa prince w/ girl princess story watch Rev. Girl Utena..unless u love predictable story. The fact the complex feeling of love and desire wre either limited to one person or solved w/ tea parties or solved w/ tears[via end w/ hikari and her secrect admier] of hopful --i know you love me,but i wana be just friendssooo can u help me put on this dress for the ultimate date w/ girl i choose over you..thanx ..friend!-- that irked me be/c no one would do that. it alsokinda botherd me that EVERYONE was girlxgirl..there was a mention of male fiance at one point but that was it. but i guess if i was stuck in strawberry dorms for 3-4years id sneak into my roomates bed too xDSo overall This anime could have been much better but hasnt turnedme off of yuri ill just research better on the story next time. Wasnt all badeven if it took forever for a kiss to happen [and it did!] It had it cute momentsand sexy-steamy moments [some still a let down] but still i cant say it was enjoyable to watch. more frustrating than anythign else.

I had this show tabbed sense the beginning of October and had constantly put it off with finding new shows to watch. I finally forced myself to sit down and watch and i was not disappointed.I greatly love the atmosphere the show makes. With the school and the residents. The show takes place on an island witch helps just make it more interesting with the School being on a island in the middle of the ocean with just a town quite far away from the school. I...kind of wish the island was smaller and it showed some characters every now and then going into the small little town.I also very much enjoy the relationships between Shizuma and Nagisa. One of the more interesting couples. I kind of dislike how they had Tamao have a crush on Naigsa. Seems needless and leaves a sour taste in your mouth how they left.Naigsa having a harem of girls only is pretty funny and especially how she doesn't even seem to notice how many want her. In the end they really aren't trying to get with her but more just of being best friends.Shizuma is defiantly one of the more interesting characters. You know right from the start that something happened with her to make her the way she is now. When you find out about her former lover it's actually kind of sad even though we never knew about her. Kind of makes you wish nothing bad happened to her. But having Shizuma slowly start opening up more and more too Naigsa is one of the entire highlights of the show.The show's worst part in my opinion is defiantly the side story and the relationship between Haraki and Amane. The show is constantly shoving their relationship down our throats when we just want to see Shizuma and Naigsa.  You don't really buy the relationship between Haraki and Amane and it feels artificial. Anyone would buy the relationship more between Haraki and her roommate Yaya. It makes no sense that Yaya and Haraki aren't the couple focus. Even Yaya had a crush on Haraki. I actually find the two people that are constantly harassing them more interesting even though one of those two constantly sexually assaults Haraki. I'd rather see those two over Haraki and Amane.Then there is also the entire thing where a Student council president wants Amane to be the next Etoile. No reason is given and it takes away more from the story. Having the Student council president be kind of a Bitch then have her be nice the 2nd half of the show was a weird change but welcomed.I love how the show is subtle too. We are shown that Naigsa is coming to terms with her feelings for Shizuma even though she is a girl. Naigsa not knowing how to feel is confused. The show doesn't just straight out tells us. It actually treats the audience with some respect and not assuming we can't figure it out ( Even though i did see some people in the comments totally oblivious as too what's happening)Naigsa is also kind of eh i guess from episode 17 to 20 ( Around those episodes) She knows that Shizuma is going through lots of pain from having to remember memories from the past two years with her former lover. Shizuma never talked to anyone about her feelings and has bottled them up. So when she finally breaks down on Naigsa and starts balling her eyes out and Naigsa doesn't comfort her but instead runs away. I find it weird and out of place.She is acting overly selfish.I'm also not a fan of the ending with Amane and Haraki winning. I don't even like the idea of Shizuma not being the Etoile anymore. I do enjoy that both Naigsa and Shizuma finally fall in love. I just wish this happened two or three episodes before so we can see them in their relationship afterwards. I'd even love seeing both Naigsa and Shizuma the next summer vacation actually going somewhere and spending time.Last thing i'd like to mention is that the animation can be kind of lazy at times especially with the lip movements. This is mostly a thing in the beginning. The animation itself is nice and you can forget at time that this has the 2006 type of animation.Overall a great show. kind of wish the island was smaller and it showed some characters every now and then going into the small little town.I also very much enjoy the relationships between Shizuma and Nagisa.

No reason is given and it takes away more from the story. Having the Student council president be kind of a Bitch then have her be nice the 2nd half of the show was a weird change but welcomed.I love how the show is subtle too. We are shown that Naigsa is coming to terms with her feelings for Shizuma even though she is a girl. Naigsa not knowing how to feel is confused. The show doesn't just straight out tells us. It actually treats the audience with some respect and not assuming we can't figure it out ( Even though i did see some people in the comments totally oblivious as too what's happening)Naigsa is also kind of eh i guess from episode 17 to 20 ( Around those episodes) She knows that Shizuma is going through lots of pain from having to remember memories from the past two years with her former lover. Shizuma never talked to anyone about her feelings and has bottled them up. So when she finally breaks down on Naigsa and starts balling her eyes out and Naigsa doesn't comfort her but instead runs away. I find it weird and out of place.She is acting overly selfish.I'm also not a fan of the ending with Amane and Haraki winning. I don't even like the idea of Shizuma not being the Etoile anymore. I do enjoy that both Naigsa and Shizuma finally fall in love. I just wish this happened two or three episodes before so we can see them in their relationship afterwards. I'd even love seeing both Naigsa and Shizuma the next summer vacation actually going somewhere and spending time.Last thing i'd like to mention is that the animation can be kind of lazy at times especially with the lip movements. This is mostly a thing in the beginning. The animation itself is nice and you can forget at time that this has the 2006 type of animation.Overall a great show."", ""Its been a while since I've written a review on this site so bear with me just a little bit..Strawberry Panic is a yuri anime~basically its a girl to girl love type story with a hint of lesbianism mixed together. Not that i have any complaints against that, since its my first time watching a yuri anime i was like WTF at first, but the anime was actually better than i thought it would turn out to be. Now on with the reviews:Story: The story was honestly not the best factor of the series, but it is an interesting one. It revolves around the main...protagonist Nagisa Aoi, her transfer into Astraea Hill Girl's Academy, and the relationship she forges with her schoolmates inside the academy. There are 3 schools total: the Spica Academy, Le Rim, and finally Miator(the school Nagisa is in). Over the course of her time inside the school, Nagisa encounters many fellow students who she eventually develops good relationships with along with her fellow dorm roommate and friend Tamao. Because the story is not very solid, and doesn't really have a centralized plot it tends to waver and confuse the audience which explains why i won't give it higher than a 7.Art: As expected of Madhouse, the art was actually very well-designed and developed. Although it wasn't the greatest artwork ever, its still really good for a yuri anime. The background sceneries, the characters, the Strawberry dorms, and the school itself were drawn well and had good use of coloring to top it off. For some reason the art reminds me of some classic paintings from the past with vibrant and rich textures to blend in altogether.Sound: The music i thought was pretty decent. I only liked the OP theme from episodes 1-13 and it was very catchy, i even have it on my Ipod. The ending themes were not very good and were just a turnoff for me. Althoughsome of the piano music played by Nagisa and Shizuma were really good. Nothing too much to say here..Character: I do love the characters in this anime quite a bit, however i was somewhat disappointed by the fact that they didn't quite explain each of the characters in detail, so it was kinda vague in that sense. The only characters that had stories to them were Nagisa (our heroine) and Shizuma Hanazono. Shizuma I thought had the most emotional story out of all the characters, and i thought she was the most developed character in the series.. when you watch episodes 17-19 the real reason behind her emotional facade shows in detail and its really quite compelling. As for the other characters, like Tamao, Rokujou, etc..the characters weren't explained well and it left things hanging at times. Nevertheless, the characters expressed various emotions, feelings for each other, and might i add very kawaii in a good sense. Here you will see where the yuri fits in:Nagisa and ShizumaAmano and Hikari (Great couple I might add!)Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the series it was definitely a good series to watch. At first i was a bit skeptical about watching this but after reading the light novel, I just felt that i had to watch the anime and it didnt disappoint. I've enjoyed it maybe you might too. I'm actually not a big fan of yuri, but there wasn't that many sex scenes in the series which was actually good.Overall: an 8/10 i give it. Strawberry Panic isn't for everyone..you will either like it or not like it that's all i can say, but my recommendation is read the light novel first to get an idea wut the story is like, then watch the anime or vice versa. But for me i've enjoyed it to the point where i might watch it again in a future date. protagonist Nagisa Aoi, her transfer into Astraea Hill Girl's Academy, and the relationship she forges with her schoolmates inside the academy.

I remember initially watching the show as it first came out. I remember being well into the show's story and enjoying it enough to have a sort of urge to continue watching it and I was done before I knew it.Story:Probably the strongest aspect of the show is the story as it centers around an all girls school centered on a hierarchy similar to modern day democracy. It follows a girl who just transferred there and quickly draws the attention of the Etoile (similar to, say President of the Body) and from there it...follows her and she becomes custom to the life in this school. An interesting choice the Anime makes is that there are no males present, or even mentioned specifically in the entire series. The show explores same-sex relations very liberally and doesn't glorify it like most anime centered  on the topic.Art and Sound:I really enjoyed the character designs and I thought the art designs of each of the scenes were beautifully done, but the animation is classic fare. The Music was above average and complimented the story but wasn't especially catching.Character:Seeing as how the plot doesn't really start unfolding towards the end, it's a very character driven show. Development is key and that's what Strawberry Panic is best at. You often see the characters change and strive for what they want. The strongest aspects is how the important characters are explored through their past so we, the viewers can have some introspect on what they've experienced and how they've grown.Overall:If I could fault Strawberry Panic for anything, it'd be for the fact that it can be quite vanilla and predictable at times. It's strongest aspect, however, is how it's unique from other anime in the genre, and is most cases it's parts are all above average. The story and characters all come to together in the end and it has a very satisfying conclusion. If you're a fan of shoujo-ai or just romance in general this is definitely worth looking into. follows her and she becomes custom to the life in this school.

Maria Sama on crack, or maybe a healthy dose of GHB.Lesbian schoolgirl love story.The story introduces everygirl, Nagisa, who gets sent to a private all girls' boarding school where she meets the mysterious, aloof (I hate that word, but it's fitting), and oft-worshipped silver-haired maiden Shizuma. Shizuma immediately wants to jump Nagisa's bones, but for no real good reason. Maybe becuse she's an Etoile, the elected focus of worship in the school.The rest of the show focuses...on Shizuma and Nagisa's budding relationship and I'm left scratching my head AS TO WHY, since the reason is delayed in presentation. Like, 14-15 episodes in.There are other girls who do the nasty, and we're treated to their backstories and obvious denoument of their infatuation--but for some reason I don't seem to remember them all that well and they don't seem that important to the story.So, um, back to Shizuma and Nagisa. Once Nagisa realizes that a creepy older woman wanting to sleep with her is alright, we're treated to why Shizuma is like the way she is. Guess what, there's a TRAGIC BACKSTORY TOLD IN FLASHBACKS, albeit this is when the show arguably becomes somewhat tasteful and takes itself seriously and tries to treat the characters with some actual depth, especially at the point where grief ridden Shizuma forces herself on Nagisa. This moment, shockingly, is very realistic and sad (and likely unintentionally so). That and the fact that unloading dark, unresolved emotional baggage on someone does not make them love you more, like most other anime seems to imply.These few episodes really shone above and beyond the rest of the anime and showed an alarming insight that quickly was buried and abandoned for more filler. The problem is for every convincing chrarcter and plot development, we have a bunch of hormone-ridden fluff to distract us and kill the pacing. Add that with the inexplicable introduction of a Tamao, Nagisa's roommate, was clearly meant to create tension between Nagisa and Shizuma as she has no other role and the show falls apart again.Watching the entire series is totally redeemed by the incredibly absurd and entertaining ending which is the most bizarre parody of the Graduate wedding scene since Grampa Simpson ran off with Marge's mother. It almost makes me think different people wrote different arcs, and they all hated each other and finally settled on the most pointless resolution to their conflict. on Shizuma and Nagisa's budding relationship and I'm left scratching my head AS TO WHY, since the reason is delayed in presentation.

Everything was hand-drawn and it kind of legitimacized itself with that.  The character models were all original and they were all fricken'kawaii.  The only flaw I could find in the art style was that the legs of the characters were ridiculouslysmall; they were like tooth picks.  That being said, how the original artist draws their characters is totally up to them...and it is completely my opinion that the legs were to thin other than that, bravo!  I absolutely loved the art style.  I will give art a 9.2.Sound - The soundtrack for this series was the best iv'e ever heard from an anime.... period.  I can't even explain what I went through with this soundtrack, but I will try.  I started out absolutely hating the soundtrack and I even thought it was the worst soundtrack I have ever heard but boy was I wrong.  The soundtrack round-housed me in the face and I was fully realizing that it was the best soundtrack I have ever heard.  It fitted in to the story PERFECTLY and at times I firmly believe that the music made the story even more awesome than it already was.  All I have to say is just listen to the OST, it's perfect 100/10.  GO LISTEN TO IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!   Please ; )3.Character - Now, I couldn't say that I liked the characters or didn't like them.  What I mean by that is this.  The characters all had unique personalities and the way they acted was very likable.  Some of the characters were super girly but then some of the characters were more mature.  On the other hand, almost none of the characters in the anime had NO backstory and I would not have minded if the backstory took up some more episodes.  Because of these factors, I can only give Strawberry Panic a 7 for character.4.Story -  Well, here goes for the story.  It was not that bad or good.  Of coarse the romance in this anime was top-notch but I wasn’t surprised by that because it is known to be a good romance.  It was a very sad story and a lot of times e was very emotionally attached to this show, it had me saying “dang this show is way to good”.  That being said, The story did have a lot of holes in it’s plot and it wasn’t the best plot to start with but it is the best yuri I have ever seen.  I’ll give the story a 7.5.Enjoyment - Well this anime was a roller coaster of emotions for me.  I’ll have to tell you the truth, when I first watched this anime I dropped because I wasn’t enjoying it.  A while ago I rediscovered it and it has now become one of my favorite animus.  It is definitely the best yuri anime I have watched and I loved it so much that I am bold enough to say it is one of the best romance anime of all time.  You need to go and watch it right now because it is like nothing else you will ever watch.  I couldn’t quite call it a masterpiece but it is up there in my anime list of over 70 animes.  I enjoyed it at a resounding 10/10!This anime is an overall 9.*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.Caution:!Keep in mind this anime has nudity. and it is completely my opinion that the legs were to thin other than that, bravo!

While the anime isn't something that I'd consider to be a masterpiece, it was enjoyable.The MAL synopsis gives you a good idea of what the anime is about, so I'd recommend reading it.STORY: 8. Overall, the story is pretty realistic in the sense that there aren't crazy plot twists or random events that shift the story of the anime. The pace of the anime is very drawn out for 26 episodes. I felt that the pace wasn't too slow, though others might...disagree. Aoi Nagisa transfers to a new school, and drama stirs up over time around the characters because, girls liking girls. However, there wasn't any parts of the anime that really caught my attention, but the story is very solid and there wasn't any fillers in any of the 26 episodes, which is a huge plus for me.ART: 8. For an anime that is in 2006, the art wasn't bad at all. Can't really comment too much because we're talking about an anime released 9 years back from the time this is written.SOUND: 9. The music was on point. Can't really complain about that. I liked how they used a lot of instrumentals and piano, which matches each and every scene's mood.CHARACTER: 8. There wasn't any character that stood out to me. Lots of nice girls here and there, and some standard personalities that you could find in many animes. On the flip side, there wasn't any character that I could say that I really hated, so I'd say an 8 is good.ENJOYMENT: 8. Somehow I managed to watch bursts of episodes. There wasn't fillers, which would be something that a 24-26 episode anime could have, so I'm happy about that. The characters were kawaii overall, and with the yuri aspect, it wasn't overdone.OVERALL: 8. If you are watching this for the yuri, just know that it isn't huge on girl on girl action compared to ecchi/hentai anime. If you are put off from this anime because it was released in 2006, I would reconsider... it's a pretty good watch. The romance was there, and so was the drama.

Strawberry Panic is, in essence, the OP to Elfen Lied. Nothing more.The overall ambiance of the series is dreadfully mundane. The generic animation, however, goes hand in hand with the god-awful Victorian music, which is played throughout the series.If Strawberry Panic removed every scene where the characters are either staring into space while public domain Bach music plays, the series would be a good 12 episodes long.If you\'re not a fan of Jane Eyre, Little Women, or Sense and Sensibility, don\'t waste your time on...this shoddy yuri. this shoddy yuri.', ""I have just completed watching it for the 3rd time and I am still very much in love with this story. I will continue to watch this.I am however a bit disappointed in the ending. I'm not a very big fan of open endings, and even though the story's ending was very much complete, it still felt like an open ending leaving us with much unanswered questions which I would very much have liked to be answered. Also for the fact that it doesn't seem that a second season will be released or made.My heart bleeds for Tamao who was 'left at the altar' if...I can put it in such a way. I think we all agree that Nagisa might have made a better choice staying with Tamao, BUT we also know that Shizuma and Nagisa was meant to be together. Even though Shizuma hurt Nagisa a lot of times. But we all get caught up in the past and struggle to let go of one or two things. So i don't blame Shizuma that much.I just found Shizuma's character very attractive, mysterious appealing (hope I am using the correct words). Makes you want to get in her mind at some stage.I also had a bit of a problem with the effortless victory Amane and Hikari had on becoming Etoiles. I do agree that the ending was a bit rushed and that an extra episode would have done the whole story much justice. Or at least they should have made it an extra long finale.It bothers me that they left us with so many questions. I do not want to figure the rest out for myself as it would have been better to leave us with a decent ending like what will happen to Shizuma and Nagisa once Shizuma graduated, will Tamao and Nagisa still be friends in the end, will Yaya and Tsugoma get together, who will live happily ever after, will Tamao and Nagisa get a chance, what awaits Miyuki and Shizuma in the open world etc etc etc. I would have been happy with at least one or two more answers.I do think that Shizuma will make Nagisa very happy and they both will have a great and loving relationship even though Shizuma graduates the next year.But all in all I rate this 11 out of 10. It will stay my favorite anime series of all time. I do hope however that the creators eventually decide to continue with a second series and make all the fans happy. I can put it in such a way.

The main characters are great and funny, and I liked the other romantic side-stories of characters from other schools.It's not really about plot as much as relationships, but it did manage to have a sweet story by the end. It's also not ridiculously long, which I preferred. There are obviously a few unnecessary episodes, but they're funny enough that you probably won't mind.I like stories with large casts of likeable characters, and that's really what I remember about Strawberry Panic....Everything about it is just so sweet, I absolutely love it.

The couples put together in the show were very cute also.I also liked how there were a FEW sexual scenes, but it wasn't filled with nudity or anything.

Girl goes to an all-girl school, meets one special person, discovers she's in love with her, etc. It sort of sounds like fanfiction that a 12-year-old could come up with, right? Not to mention the main character is a total Mary Sue. Everyone is in love with Nagisa, and the only times she messes up is when her seme Shizuma comes to rescue her. Character development is absolutely terrible. I mean, EVERY SINGLE GIRL in that school is a lesbian? That seems highly unrealistic to me... And of course, the short, shy girls are...ukes where the tall, robust girls are semes. And the girls of focus in this anime (Nagisa and Hikari, respectively) both of their roommates are in love with them, and they're in love with generic semes. It seems like the stories of the characters are copying off of each other, even though they're in the same anime... It just all seems so unoriginal, all the girls in the schools seem the same! We have the ~*kawaii*~ uke and main character that everyone loves: Nagisa, the silent semes that also everyone loves: Shizuma and Amane, the one-sided loving best friends: Tamao and Yaya, the chibi quiet girls: Hikari and Chiyo, the antagonists: Momomi and Kaname, and the tsundere: Tsubomi. It's all so unoriginal, but I guess if that's what you were looking for, then you'll enjoy this anime very well. ukes where the tall, robust girls are semes.

It's from Madhouse and Imagin and based off of a light novel. I will say that this is one of those series I'm re-watching to review since it came out around the time I was first getting really into anime and I did watch it back then. I remember enjoying it at the time but we'll see if it holds up.Story:The narrative is set in Astraea Hill, a place where three different girls' schools all make their homes and share certain facilities like dormitories. Which seems like an odd arrangement. Anyway, Aoi Nagisa...is a recent transfer student to Miator. As soon as she arrives she catches the eye of the Etoile, Hanazono Shizuma. Shizuma happens to be notorious for toying with cute girls but she feels a greater connection towards Nagisa.Let's start with my problems with the series. The first is that some of the girls get outright rapey with the girls they're pursuing and, for the most part, the series has no consequences for it. They get stopped before they can go too far and they leave it at that. There's one exception where we see more extreme consequences and actual remorse. And it's probably the most mild example where one girl kisses another without permission, touches some boob, quickly gets pushed away and immediately backs off.Another issue I have with the storytelling is that the tone is a bit awkward. It's not nearly as bad as some of the anime I've reviewed but there are some slightly melodramatic scenes that are interspersed with a lot of silly moments. It reminds me of the American cartoon, Jem & the Holograms. Which has similar, albeit more extreme shifts.With that out the way, there are a lot of things to appreciate about the writing. When the series gets properly serious delving into Shizuma's tragic past it's actually really well done and legitimately sad. I also really appreciate the romance between Hikari and Amane. I think it's very strongly written. The series also has a lot of endearing and cute moments.Characters:I mostly like the characters. The cast is fun and they have a lot of well written relationships. My favourite students are probably Chikaru and her Lulim group. Simply because they largely stay out of the melodrama and probably have the funniest scenes. I'm not completely sold on Shizuma as one of the lead romantic characters but I do think she has a strong back story and demonstrates a lot of growth throughout the series. So I don't really mind it.The main issue I have is with the antagonistic characters Kaname and Momomi. My issue with them is this. For most of the series the pair of them are basically portrayed as terrible, selfish and destructive people. They cause a lot of problems for the people around them. Kaname tries to force herself on Hikari a lot, just to get to Amane. But then near the end they have some scenes that are meant to humanise and justify the pair of them. Not by them showing any remorse or suffering any consequences for their actions, but by giving them some motivations that are pretty weak when you compare them to what they've done.Art:The artwork and animation are largely pretty good. The nature backgrounds have a lot of detail. The character designs are nicely done. My one complaint is that it can get too fan-servicey at times. A lot of unnecessary nudity. Especially when you consider that these are under-aged girls.Sound:The acting is really good. Shimizu Ai, Fukui Yukari, Nakajima Saki, Matsuki Miyu, Kaida Yuuko, Nakahara Mai, Nabatame Hitomi and the rest of the cast all do very well. The music is great. The series is good at using Hikari and Yaya's choir experience for impact at important times. Misato Aki, Nakahara Mai & Shimizu Ai sing the theme tunes very well too.Ho-yay:There's a lot. Some of it is unrequited and used for dramatic impact. Some of it is very much mutual. And none of the major or supporting characters are straight.Areas of Improvement:1. The series could definitely benefit from having more separation betwixt the melodramatic moments and the more fun, comedic moments.2. When one character corners another in a room and tries to forcibly remove her clothes, you need some kind of comeuppance for that.3. When you want to humanise and redeem a formerly antagonistic character, you need to put in effort that's proportionate to how bad their actions were. You also need to have them show remorse and, depending on how bad their actions were, possibly take responsibility. You can't give us an attempted rapist and then wave away their actions with a simple explanation of their motivation.Final Thoughts:Overall, I still enjoyed this series. I think it has some pretty significant problems but it also has heart and offers a lot of endearing characters and entertaining moments. It might be slightly generous, but I'm giving it a 7/10. is a recent transfer student to Miator. As soon as she arrives she catches the eye of the Etoile, Hanazono Shizuma.

The story is written in a way that it builds up tension, so at the end it's very satisfying. There's multiple relationships to follow in this anime as well, so it makes it more interesting. Their own plots and side-stories make this anime really worth watching. It makes you want to binge watch it to see what's going to happen next. There's a good mix of masculine energy and feminine energy happening within the characters. There's enough drama in it, and it's not overwhelming.The art is also really well done and doesn't use...any cheesy looking 3D art. any cheesy looking 3D art."", ""Spoilers present, but no spoiler on key details of the plot.ABSTRACT: Among Yuri anime, Strawberry Panic is one of the most well-known titles, and is actually one of the better ones, though in no ways a masterpiece. While it appears that people's attitude towards it is mostly polarised, and that people's attitude largely depends on whether they like the canon pairings.When it comes to reviewing, this is one case where it's inappropriate to make a completely rational approach.First of all, is the anime Strawberry Panic a parody or overkill?My opinion is that although it's likely meant to be a parody, it comes out as more...overkill than parody. Thus, we're still going to view SP as more of a serious anime than a clichestorm parody.-- Section 1: A Brief View of the Plot --Strawberry Panic takes place in 3 affiliated all-girls(lesbians??) Catholic schools. Since the main cast is full of lesbians, one could easily imagine love triangles going around.One of the main characters (Nagisa, the MC1) enters the school to be drawn to the 'goddess' of the school, while her roommate also develops a crush on her.Now that I've said that...The main focus of the plot is the 2 love triangles in the anime, which are quite blatantly shown early on in the anime.Both have many similarities and can be described in the following formula: (Note: Some characters display improperly on MAL. {== means a pointed arrow i.e. unrequited love)G == MC {== Rm (G for goddess, MC for main character, Rm for roommate)And while in both cases, the relationships between MCs and the respective 'goddesses' are those of consensual love, both pairings have their own reasons for people to dislike them.Besides the 2 love triangles, there are quite a lot of slice-of-life elements in the plot, which are quite fun to watch, and the SoL parts even have some awesome moments which put other pure SoL anime to shame.Personally speaking though, some of the SoL parts are not as funny/awesome compared to other SoL parts, and if the story had better pacing, the drama part could have been done better.Now, since the focus of the anime are the love triangles, we will have to focus on...-- Section 2: Characters, and Ship to Ship Combat --First let's talk about the 2 love triangles. Though they share similarities, they're not exactly identical.Ship combat 1: Nagisa x Shizuma VS Nagisa x TamaoThe 3 characters involved respectively have these traits:Aoi Nagisa: Innocent and kind-hearted, but sometimes simply too innocent(this trait becomes more annoying later on, particularly in the Drama Festival part).Suzumi Tamao: One who is always willing to offer her love and kindness -- regardless of whether she gets rewarded.Hanazono Shizuma: I don't think in the inside she's bad, but still she's one emotionally hurt and in turn goes after many girls, very likely hurting them in the process. Shizuma is one who leans on pushing her own demands.This ship combat is the harder one to review.If you view it from 'the process of falling in love', this part is very questionable. Sure, love isn't exactly a reasonable thing so we can't blame Nagisa for being drawn to Shizuma, but still, why is Nagisa drawn to Shizuma? Only because Shizuma is beautiful, and is idolised by other students. This qualifies as some bad scriptwriting.What makes up for it though, is the backstory and the character development of Shizuma. Though some may question if Shizuma's character development is significant and/or thorough, 'the power of love makes people undergo character development' is one thing that's not so properly portrayed by most yuri anime, so plus on SP for this.Still though, the reason that Shizuma undergoes all the character development is rather like Shizuma is, in fact, so... dependent underneath. So we can only hope that she doesn't get emotionally hurt once more. (Note: To keep the amount of spoilers low, I'm not going to further discuss about it)Now, is this love triangle forced? Personally speaking, it is not nearly as forced as the other love triangle, but still it seems as if a girl like Tamao can't get the love she desires ever since Nagisa is drawn to Shizuma. That's rather sad.Ship combat 2: Hikari x Amane VS Hikari x YayaThe 3 characters involved respectively have these traits:Konohana Hikari: She is drawn to Amane and that's mostly it, some of her traits are shown but come out as not memorable.Nanto Yaya: Like Tamao, she is always willing to offer her love and kindness, but she is not that satisfied with what she is rewarded with.Ohtori Amane: As unmemorable as Hikari: she appears indifferent towards many things in life, until the ending. Her appearance is that of a very masculine appearance.Have you heard of a fairy tale called Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? In the story, Prince Charming rides his horse to save Snow White, and that is called an act of true love.This is essentially the same thing that happens with this love triangle. Amane rides her horse to win Hikari's affection, while later she rides her horse to save Hikari. Can this be more cliche? It is so cliche that it's boring.And plus, almost the ONLY depictions of love between Hikari and Amane are the 'Amane saves Hikari from the bad guys' events and a certain typical Korean soap opera event later on.To summarise it, this part is so forced and cliched that the only way to interpret it is some parody on the stereotypical masculine 'Prince Charming' type of female. But even then, it's not interesting to watch (subjective opinion).Other characters:Kaname & Momomi: Not the 'big bads' but still the villains in this anime. The main question about them, do they get more likable in the end? My answer is, they do to a lesser degree.Rokujou Miyuki: This is where I should make an explanation. Unlike Tamao's feelings for Nagisa, Miyuki's feelings for Shizuma is not really in the territory of unrequited love (probably borders on it but friendship dominates the relationship), and the relationship between Miyuki and Shizuma is that of close friends who know each other well. (For this part, it's a plus for the anime.)Side characters: Aside from Chikaru, most side characters are your normal diabetes-inducing moe characters, which are commonplace in other anime, and come out as unmemorable. Chikaru though, stands out from all of them.Now, I'll end this section with some personal thoughts on one question: Why are opinions among the audience mostly polarised?I suggest that it's partly because some people stop caring for a character when she has left a bad first impression on them, and thus the impressions the character leaves on them remain largely unchanged.-- Section 3: What ideas does the story convey to us? --The point that makes Strawberry Panic unique compared to other yuri anime, is that it's focused on the question:>> What kind of relationship is more than friendship?However unfortunately, the answer the anime gives to the question is not really satisfying.As already discussed, the Hikari & Amane arc is too cliched to be treated seriously. (The problems in this arc are still present, of course)In the Nagisa & Shizuma arc, although eventually Nagisa & Shizuma turns out to be an acceptable couple (personal opinion), what about Tamao's efforts then? Though we can't say love is a 100% reasonable thing, the anime seems to be deliberately trying to make Tamao act as kind and helpful as possible, while rewarding her with just 'I'm sorry, but let's just be friends.' Seriously, Strawberry Panic... What are you trying to tell us then?This is basically the single unique point the story conveys to us. The point 'what it means to be an Etoile' is not dug into deeply.Love development part is fairly good, but not the best it can offer.Story: 5.5/10Characters: 5/10Minor aspects:Animation & Art: 7.5/10The art style is somewhere between a distinct shounen/seinen and a distinct shoujo art style. It's closer to a seinen style as I see. Visually, the art is attractive.Sound: 6.5/10Most tracks are quite well done, but allow me to introduce you to the biggest exception: The 2nd ED.This ED is the ending theme for the latter half of the anime (except Ep26), which is when the story heads into a serious direction. ED02, however, is not just of mediocre quality: It's too happy and upbeat! Make sure not to miss every moment of dissonance caused by this ED.Besides ED02, the tracks fit the atmosphere very well, although none of them really stand out. I have made 8-bit covers of OP01, ED01, OP02, and the track Kinchou.Enjoyment value: 6/10Rather subjective opinion here.It seems as if many people enjoy this due to 'guilty pleasure', but this doesn't work for me. If not for the sake of this review, I would really have skipped all the Hikari & Amane parts, as those cliched scenes are simply a pain to watch.Other than that, it's fairly enjoyable.Overall: 5.5/10 (probably 6.5/10 in MAL scales)Summary:Trying to poke fun at the yuri genre while still keeping a decent serious love story isn't an easy job.Strawberry Panic does an overall above-average job with these material.But its major flaw is that, since the show turns out to be that of more overkill than parody, the fact that some girls would offer all their love only to be rewarded by rejections, is rather depressing to watch.'Okaerinasai...

If you read the manga or the light novel(I'm reading this now) it is completely different. over all its a very good series. i do believe it could have been longer and there are some random filler episodes. but my favorite amongst the best. "", ""(updated 9/20/18 for format and slight content revision)Hi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, the synopsis is your friend, as I'm going to deal in the broader strokes. MINOR SPOILERS may appear, though I do try to keep those to an absolute minimum. Strawberry Panic is loved by some, and hated by others, because it's really basically just an anime soap opera. It is over the top, often cheesy, and if you don't think too much, really, really fun. This was my first full blown yuri anime, and it's not nostalgia colored, this review. As always, the crew will not earn a...spot on the RTLR wall for rose colored glasses either. I've seen so many more, so much more beautifully done (Aoi Hana comes to mind) but I still cannot back off the fact I had fun watching this anime!Story: 7The setup with Nagisa is a bit cliche if you ask me, though SP turns it up with Shizuma's sudden, intense interest in her. This anime lets you know right up front what it going to be going down. I found the story of cat fights, senpai worship, and unrequited love to start out mundane, but yet well enough done to hold my interest. There are several relationships, and hints of relationships that are interesting enough to watch and learn about. Love triangles, loving someone who loves someone else, and even the evil girls trying to use rape at worst to sexual assault at best to sway someone's heart is enough action to keep the mind from wandering. There is also more than one 'couple' that matter in the show, a trend most anime avoids. We have at least 3 pairings and a possibly of a few more by the end that all get fair amounts of screen time. And that ending! I'm American, and I prefer stories to go out on a bang, and boy does this one ever! No muted 'maybe' endings here!Art: 9I love the way the series is drawn. I love Shizuma's hair, I love the expressive eyes, I love the gothic lolita uniforms, and even the other two schools uniforms. The lines tend more to 'clean' than detailed, but the whole package comes together very nicely and in a very fitting way.Sound 8:My only sound gripe: those birds! Often when opening a scene they show the outside of the building, with birds chirping as they are known to do. For some reason those chirps are 3 times louder than the dialog or even music in the show! I almost developed a Hitchcockian fear of birds! Otherwise though, the sound was really good. Shizuma's voice actress nailed it, as did Nagisa's. The ending song is good, but weird in being live action. The second ending song is also live action but a bit out of place. Otherwise, no complaints.Character: 9This is where the drama comes in and the shine begins. We have a girl who begins basically as a total slut, and as the series progresses, we learn that she is in fact in great pain and acting out in a way we might find inappropriate but makes sense in the overall scheme of things. The only problem with her arc is that the writers didn't seem to think it through and tossed in a plot twist out of the blue just to facilitate the situation that leads to the trauma. There is also a mannish girl who is called a 'prince' of her school who falls for a beautiful girly girl, giving us a 'traditional' lesbian relationship. The evil girls have a twisted, manipulative lesbian relationship that is just utterly incomprehensible at times. The cast is quite large, with the 'club always looking for what club to be' and the younger children on the way up in the school, along with the stern Student Council president, and her contemporaries from the other two schools. There's a lot of people to keep up with, but it becomes fairly easy quickly, as you develop a favorite couple, and gasp and gawk as they turn the drama to 11.Enjoyment: 9I really liked this because I did watch things like Days of Our Lives with my mom as a kid. I don't mind the overblown drama. If you can't see past that, then you should for sure take a pass on this anime. I loved seeing what event was on the verge of destroying the precious relationships, and cheering when they made it through against all odds. Is it cheap, cheesy, corny, silly, and over the top? Yes to all those things. Does that mean it isn't fun? Not in the least, long as you go in with your eyes open. It's high school lesbian drama, not Shakespeare!In closing, if you want to just veg out and check out an anime that doesn't require much thought and don't mind the titillating nature of the show, this is one to watch. This is firmly yuri, with implied (and a few scenes of literally being between the sheets!) sexual scenes in places, and it makes no bones about who's with who as a couple. It's a ton of fun if you turn your brain off and just let the soap bubble. Strawberry Panic rates one pic of Shizuma and Nagisa intently staring in each others' eyes as well as one of Amane and Hikari in the same pose on the wide RTLR wall. Feel bad for Tamoe-chan though. This is one high school worth visiting! spot on the RTLR wall for rose colored glasses either. I've seen so many more, so much more beautifully done (Aoi Hana comes to mind) but I still cannot back off the fact I had fun watching this anime!Story: 7The setup with Nagisa is a bit cliche if you ask me, though SP turns it up with Shizuma's sudden, intense interest in her. This anime lets you know right up front what it going to be going down. I found the story of cat fights, senpai worship, and unrequited love to start out mundane, but yet well enough done to hold my interest. There are several relationships, and hints of relationships that are interesting enough to watch and learn about. Love triangles, loving someone who loves someone else, and even the evil girls trying to use rape at worst to sexual assault at best to sway someone's heart is enough action to keep the mind from wandering. There is also more than one 'couple' that matter in the show, a trend most anime avoids. We have at least 3 pairings and a possibly of a few more by the end that all get fair amounts of screen time. And that ending! I'm American, and I prefer stories to go out on a bang, and boy does this one ever! No muted 'maybe' endings here!Art: 9I love the way the series is drawn. I love Shizuma's hair, I love the expressive eyes, I love the gothic lolita uniforms, and even the other two schools uniforms. The lines tend more to 'clean' than detailed, but the whole package comes together very nicely and in a very fitting way.Sound 8:My only sound gripe: those birds! Often when opening a scene they show the outside of the building, with birds chirping as they are known to do. For some reason those chirps are 3 times louder than the dialog or even music in the show! I almost developed a Hitchcockian fear of birds! Otherwise though, the sound was really good. Shizuma's voice actress nailed it, as did Nagisa's. The ending song is good, but weird in being live action. The second ending song is also live action but a bit out of place. Otherwise, no complaints.Character: 9This is where the drama comes in and the shine begins. We have a girl who begins basically as a total slut, and as the series progresses, we learn that she is in fact in great pain and acting out in a way we might find inappropriate but makes sense in the overall scheme of things. The only problem with her arc is that the writers didn't seem to think it through and tossed in a plot twist out of the blue just to facilitate the situation that leads to the trauma. There is also a mannish girl who is called a 'prince' of her school who falls for a beautiful girly girl, giving us a 'traditional' lesbian relationship. The evil girls have a twisted, manipulative lesbian relationship that is just utterly incomprehensible at times. The cast is quite large, with the 'club always looking for what club to be' and the younger children on the way up in the school, along with the stern Student Council president, and her contemporaries from the other two schools. There's a lot of people to keep up with, but it becomes fairly easy quickly, as you develop a favorite couple, and gasp and gawk as they turn the drama to 11.Enjoyment: 9I really liked this because I did watch things like Days of Our Lives with my mom as a kid.

If you're new to Yuri then this is a must see. I love all the different and dramatic relationships between the characters. The anime gives you all the different kind of relationships you want. You don't ever get bored. Not to mention the theme song is great too. Over all this is probably one of my favorite anime. I really have nothing bad to say. "", 'first of all,i\'d like to apologize to yuri fans out there for any offends i may caused in this review. Second,i\'ll tell y\'all first that this review isn\'t mainly about how the series goes because i think u can see how it goes clearly on the synopsis,this review is more likely how i enjoy the show and how i feel towards the story,characters and others aspect which built this anime up to the surface. Third,i\'d like for everyone knows that i\'m straight so i may can\'t bring up a good reviews as everyone has expected to read but don\'t worry,even though i\'m straight i enjoy...this anime quite a lot to the point where i want to do a review which i rarely do beforeall of u may be wondering now , ""why a straight like her watched a yuri anime and even made a review of it ?? is she mocking us ?? is she making fun of us? is she demeaning us ??seriously wth is she thinking ?"" and ecti\'ll tell u right before hand that i\'m not here to mocking u nor making fun of u. actually,idk why am i watching this anime myself,maybe i\'m just lost and want to know myself more whether i\'m still straight or not..well,u can say i\'m a straight that trying to peek on yuri\'s lion holeok then here we go reviewing~~~1.STORY & ART~~i don\'t have any particular problems with both. Instead,i\'d say that the art is nicely done and the story plot twists is quite interesting,so i\'ll give it both 7/102.CHARACTERS~~one elements which make me stick on to this anime until last episode is the characters which is quite interesting to be watched also,i can\'t help but to think shizuma as bishounen and amane as oji-sama(prince) and they made me realize that i\'m still straight,so i\'m quite grateful to them. With that in mind,i continue on to the last episode and i\'m glad i did,it was totally worth it and so,i give it 8/10well,overall,this is a great show,just watch it and u\'ll know wht are the good points of it later or soonerok now this is about my comments and complaints on the show so don\'t take it to heart,just take this as a sobbing from a lil child ;)i don\'t reallly understand about the etoile things,at first it looks like a normal model-for-students-like election. but,if it is really like that then why is almost everyone make a fuss over it ?? then at some points,it turns out to be a wedding-like ceremonial and at last episode,shizuma looks as she is a guy who snatched the bride-chan away from a wedding..ughh,i really can\'t understand it well *sigh*now i\'ve said it,i felt much better this anime quite a lot to the point where i want to do a review which i rarely do beforeall of u may be wondering now , ""why a straight like her watched a yuri anime and even made a review of it ?? is she mocking us ?? is she making fun of us? is she demeaning us ??seriously wth is she thinking ?"" and ecti\'ll tell u right before hand that i\'m not here to mocking u nor making fun of u. actually,idk why am i watching this anime myself,maybe i\'m just lost and want to know myself more whether i\'m still straight or not..well,u can say i\'m a straight that trying to peek on yuri\'s lion holeok then here we go reviewing~~~1.STORY & ART~~i don\'t have any particular problems with both.

This being said, once the initial episodes were over, I relised that I was watching my first yuri (is that the right word??)  What was the first thing that I did when I discovered what I had uncovered??  Looked at the DVD rating of course.  PG-13.  That to me meant 26 episodes of cutsy girls and no skin.  This made me sad.I wanted to dislike it.  I wanted to turn it off....But the series quickly grew on me.The plot was simple.  A transfer student starts her first day at St. Miator\'s All-Girl High School and goes through the trials and tribulations that accompany high school life.  She embraces love, friendship, heartbreak, and adventure with a virgin outlook towards it all.  If this was the entire plot however, it would have been near impossible to stretch it out to a full 26 episode series.  Inter-twining Nagisa\'s (our lead characters) story, are numerous (and dreadfully wonderful) sub plots involving dozens of secondary and tertiary characters.  I believe that its these plots and situations that keeps the audience craving more, even if they don\'t want to.The girls get up to the usual young Japanese girl adventures: tea parties, school clubs, autumn walks through cherry blossom leaves.  Some excel through academics, others through athletics.  They fall in love.  Some find the girl of their dreams, others will have their hearts crushed.  It\'s high school.  It\'s elegently destructive.  It\'s horrendously addictive.One of the most appealing points to this series are the characters.  Comprised entirely of girls, (and I do mean ENTIRELY) they range from very cute to absolutely breathtaking.  Most have a completely unique look so the viewer has no hestitation in the recognition of their favorite girls.  Many of the main characters are dotted with colorful hair and often times, a costume other then the standard school uniform, both helping in differentiating betwwen the large cast.The personalities vary as immensely as the girls themselves.  For the most part, all the girls have your standard giddy, naive, super cutsy, attitute.  But all have ""that one thing"" that makes that person stand out among the others; be it an obsession, a unique voice, they way they carry themselves.  On top of that, the entire lead cast is very different from the standard, high school drama.And if the girls themselves are constructed with perfection in mind, so were the backdrops and scenery surrounding it all.  No detail is overlooked in the animation for this series, and it is vividly appearent throughout (incuding the OP and ED credits).  Exquisite shading and lighting truly brought every scene to an almost magical feel.All this being said however, there is still something about it (especially in the beginning) that I truely disliked.  Perhaps it was the strong use of dull shades, prominant primarily in the character design,  Perhaps it was the overused storyline.  Regardless, whatever the reason, the series needed some time to grow on me, I was not immediatly enthralled.But if you are into yuri, then this title is a must see.  If you are in to romance, this is a must see.  If you are into beautiful animation, this is a must see.  Honestly, if you willing to overlook a few minor defects and embrace what this series has to offer, you will embark on a worthwhile journey. But the series quickly grew on me.The plot was simple.

"", 'When people talk about Yuri anime, Strawberry Panic! is the name you mostly hear them refering.You could say it is the Mainstream thing of Yuri, most people that watch Yuri anime, watched this anime, becaming the anime, almost like a rite of passage to the Yuri world.The first yuri I seen was a OVA, so to a extent, I could also say Strawberry Panic is my first Yuri anime. Was it worth of my time? Definitly, but not without its flaws.The story is very preditable (cliches), and while I managed to enjoy it (there were some highlights, like Shizuma past), the pacing was not...always the best with some episodes being boring, while others keep the viewer focused the whole time.The conclusion satisfied me, but ultimately it depends on the characters pairs you ""ship"". It also seemed a bit rushed, I would had prefered if they had given more time to showcase it, ""isntead of it happening so late"". A epilogue would also add value but well....Decent story, just dont expect much from it.In terms of sound, I m impressed, both OP\'s are great and catchy, I still want to go back and rewatch both, but both ED\'s really sucked for me, with the those japonese girls appearing and getting all lovey-dovey, it was just weird for me. The voice acting is great, and the song tracks felt in place with the scenes.The art is lovely, most characters can be extremely cute to watch, and those mushy mushy moments are some of the highlights of the anime, no doubt, nothing negative to report.This is a light Yuri, there is non hentai content here. So for it to be enjoyable, the characters have to be so, the romance between is a key feature!Nagisa, Tamao and Shizuma(the main three) are the center stage, there are some episodes manly dedicated those some more secondary pairs/""groups"", and those characters are decent, but they felt a bit too shallow in terms of development, when faced to these 3. And with some exceptions like the extremely enjoyable and energetic Chikaru (which should had have more screentime because she is really that likeable), the majority of the cast is merely there to support the rest, which means that the main three, have to be interesting enough for you to fully enjoy your time with the series. For me they are!Nagisa can be a bit shallow and too cheerful at times, but inside the genre, she felt natural for me, for the most part, I liked her alot. Her relation with Shizuma (that is at first a playboy feminine version, slowly developing her feelings for nagisa), it the spotlight of Strawberry, the reason I enjoy the anime so much, there were downtimes, but when those two got to the work, doing what a (light) yuri anime is supposed to do (leave it to your interpretation), I loved it, it was soo cozy and heart-warming. Tamao is also extremely likeable and IMO the best friend a girl could have.Most of the enjoyment I got from SP!, is because I liked the main characters alot, the way they related to each other. The OPs also fit the mood of the anime alot! They couldnt be better.Anoter key factor to enjoy the anime is accepting girls to girls relationship, if you dont, it will be a major negative in play, since there is never a male soul, or voice in the anime, so the romance is all between girls.The romance was indeed slow paced, which also made the story have its downs and ups, but by the end I apreciated the development put on the characters. Maybe it wasnt a truly happy ending, not for everyone, but it is the happiest ending possible for me, and I can conclude that Yuri romance well done, is just great!A dramatic and romantic anime, with some more light toned cheerful moments.Everything added, if you are a Yuri fan, and didnt watch Strawberry Panic, you have, it is like a classic for its genre. Probably one of the best yuri conceived. I reccomend it!If it is your first time with Yuri content, just keep in mind, what a Yuri is about, be more free minded, give it a try, and like me you may came to see Yuri potential for romance at a new light.Panic, dunno, but for the Strawberry part, it surely present me a sweet experience. :3 always the best with some episodes being boring, while others keep the viewer focused the whole time.The conclusion satisfied me, but ultimately it depends on the characters pairs you ""ship"".

But enjoyable does not translate into genius.Story: The story is interesting, especially if you're into lesbians. And as a yuri genre anime, what else would you expect? The show is not episodic, but the episodes don't segue well to each other. The story is about a girl that's new to the school, and her first day there she meets the Etoile, kinda like the Queen (sorta) of the school and there is an immediate attraction between the two. One of the faults of...this anime is that it was extremely predictable (at least i thought so). One of the guidelines to write a review is try not to reveal spoilers, and I won't have to, you'll probably figure it out as you watch.Art: The girls were drawn in a typical shoujo type of art, tall looking thin girls with large breasts, and huge eyes (but not too big...the eyes). The animation is consistent throughout, though not amazing. Even though the art was fine, one of the things that i noticed was that almost all of the girls' faces look alike, the only difference being the difference in eye shape (some of them). The only other way to really tell them apart without listening to them is by their hairstyle and uniform.Sound: The soundtrack of the anime was fine, but nothing impressed me. One of the biggest deciding factors for a good grade on sound for me is a good OP/ED, but neither caught my attention enough for me to look for the OST. The background music is okay, but i think they use the same one for many &quot;dramatic&quot; situations, making it old (unless i can't tell the difference, and they weren't the same)Character: Pretty much what you see is what you get with your characters. They don't really progress, personality wise, but there are lots of changes in relationships. Again predictability plays a factor here, and what you expect the character to do, they'll most likely do. The characters are unique and don't have overlapping counterparts, but there are lots of the same character relationships, and example being... love triangle with one unrequited lover that loves the lower level characer, one upper level character that loves a lower level character, and that lower level character admires/loves the upper level characterEnjoyment: I enjoyed this show, not a lot, because i noticed some of its faults, but enough for me that i could watch it again and not consider it a waste of time. This is far from a masterpiece, but it might be good fun to watch, especially if you're in a &quot;i don't want to watch yaoi/shonen-ai anime dangit, let's watch some yuri/shojo-ai&quot; moodOverall: It was a good anime, and it could've done better in my opinion if the story had been a bit more compelling, and not so predictable. And though this is personal opinion, i was kind of disappointed at the ending (though i expected it), with none of my characters matching up with who i wanted. :( this anime is that it was extremely predictable (at least i thought so).

In my though "" what the heck is that, you can be etoile even if you doesnt love her just do your job and graduate, you god wont angry with you even if you have lover beside your etoile partner"" hahahabasically i love the story, it give you a feeling of curiosity and wanted more and more , complex , compilcated, and enjoyable to watch ,with you realize or not sometimes love can hurts othersthe biggest nonsense of this anime is the etoile system, why they should pick lover in the first place to representative them beside its only 3 years , its not a engagement or marriage which everything should be sacred. on episode 23 nagisa ""rejected to become etoile"" because she still love shizuma and accept it when try to get over her.

The characters and the place where it takes and the overall plot is the same but the execution for it all is much different. But it is enjoyable in its own way. If you like Yuri or are interested then this is a good anime to introduce you to the genre. It is the anime that worms your hart but you also don't want your parents to walk in at the wrong moment. There are a lot of characters to remember so that might be hard but it's fun and should be watched with...friends. friends."", ""This is basically the first review I've done, not to mention the first yuri I've ever seen But I really enjoyed this anime, and it made me more interested in yuri so if your a yuri lover and you've never seen this one yet, I highly recommend it. Even with the amount of fan service, it was really touching. Especially the ending.The story was alright. There were a lot of parts where I just lost interest because it was quite boring. Usually the parts that don't revolve around Nagisa or Shizuma because those were in my opinion, the most favourable characters. There were many couples...who had different problems and the plot drifted from one to another and a lot of random crap I didn't care about happened but it was still pretty interesting.I liked the art work because all the characters looked gorge haha. You might think differ but that depends what your taste is but I'm so glad they didn't give the girls over larged breasts because that ruins it for me. I think the colors complimented each other and the uniforms were quite pleasurable as-well.The characters were enjoyable. They all had different personalities and you could get attached to them easily. Not to mention they were easy to understand.

You might think differ but that depends what your taste is but I'm so glad they didn't give the girls over larged breasts because that ruins it for me. I think the colors complimented each other and the uniforms were quite pleasurable as-well.The characters were enjoyable.

The characters are flat, the plot nonsensical, and it suffers from several tragic flaws.The largest of these is that Shizuma comes off as very rapist like. Nagisa doesn't exactly resist her advances, but it's still really creepy.The other really big flaw is that the show's beta couple is unbelievably dull. You don't care about them and want them to go away whenever they are on screen.Now, I did say it was not /objectively/ good, and this is because Strawberry Panic is one of my absolute favourites because it's unambiguously Yuri. Lots of kissing and a fair amount...of sex, too.Strawberry Panic's saving grace is actually it's best kept secret; It's SUPPOSED to be bad.It satirizes anime like Marimite by turning all of the tropes up to eleven and then playing them with a completely straight face.

I say complex because there is quite a bit of character development in the 26 episodes. There are many secrets. There are many romances. But there is a sense of progress and it rarely feels like filler. It's very character driven and for the most part, I felt myself caring about the characters. The...show can get very dark at times, but at the same time, there is plenty of humour, romance, and lightheartedness. I've felt confused quite a few times while watching and some themes they brush upon are not very comfortable, but at the same time, there was a sense of comfort and hope. The show is earnest and quite seriously set on telling a decent romantic story if you let it. Character interactions and development were mostly well done, although some choices and situations were rather strange and did not penetrate my disbelief. Ultimately, it's a good romance story because the show convinced that me that the feelings were real and that I should care about these characters. Although it's a conclusive story, I do wish to see more.Art and Score:  The art style is consistent and well done. It's an older show, but the style is pretty and doesn't distract. As far as the score, it's not quite up there with Clannad or Sakura Trick, but there are a couple memorable scores, and it's nice that they incorporated some music into the character development via playing the piano. We all know that pianos add +1 to romance.Yuri/Ecchi/Lewd:  This is a bit of a mixed bag. The show isn't shy about sexual themes, but at times, it goes a little too far. There is no actual nudity, but there are definitely themes of sexual relationships between certain characters. The Yuri theme is present throughout pretty much the whole show, mostly in forms of romance. There are a few kisses, but it's not on level of Sakura Trick. Though I will say that there are a few much deserved kisses and moments of intimacy that feel like a real payoff. Simply because of the subject matter and fairly strong sexual themes, I would say that this is for mature audiences. I know it says PG13 and for the most part, it is, but those few moments make it quite questionable. I'm sure most teens can handle it, but I wouldn't be comfortable showing this to someone under 16.If you're looking for ecchi, this isn't really that great of a show for it because it's relatively scarce. If you're a fan of romance and yuri romance in particular, I think the story is compelling and ultimately worth watching. It's by no means a perfect show, but I think it's up there with Yuru Yuri and Sakura Trick in terms of Yuri because it provides something neither of those shows really do and that is deep romance. show can get very dark at times, but at the same time, there is plenty of humour, romance, and lightheartedness.

Strawberry Panic. I don\'t know exactly why I sat through this entire series... Maybe I felt that it was a yuri rite of passage, that I had to see the most cliche catholic school girl yuri. The first half of the series I gave my full attention to, meanwhile the second half I doodled to. However, the first half of the series seemed to drag by with lots of fillers and such, while the second half went by pretty quickly.So first thing is things about this anime that I really love: Their outfits, and the architectural designs in the anime are really great. They...did give some thought to the character development of Shizuka.Aaaaaand... That\'s about it... I\'d say.I mean don\'t get me wrong... It wasn\'t unbearable to watch. I enjoyed certain parts, and I needed something cliche and bad to destress from my dumb life. But alas, this is a review, so I will now go ahead and say everything WRONG with this anime.So first off, I do believe they derail completely from the plot of the actual manga (I own the first volume), which I know many anime do, so that\'s not the problem... But... WHY IS KAORI\'S DESIGN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN THE ANIME THAN IN THE MANGA? It\'s weird, and there doesn\'t seem to be any reason for it. Did they just want to make her cuter? The anime is also completely missing a bunch of characters that the manga had, and I could be wrong, but I believe they also added characters to the anime that weren\'t in the manga.Okay, okay, this is going to sound crazily picky, but I can\'t stand how from the back of Nagisa\'s head all you can see is her pony tail... That\'s not how ponytails work!The animation... Don\'t even get me started... That animation was SO BAD. SO. BAD. \'nuff said.Okay so this type of story (drama and romance) heavily relies on character depth and development, right? Well, guess what this story is lacking!Nagisa\'s backstory story is unimportant, because her purpose is mainly for girls to be able to ""plug themselves in"" as the character. I did get invested in her and Shizuka\'s romance, but the passion was sometimes just not there, from both sides. Perhaps this was just a budgeting problem, and they couldn\'t animate the characters doing more than the minimal amount possible.

It's a classic and popular shoujo-ai/yuri type anime and please take note I don't recall a single male character in the series (Which is fine). It is not as deep as Mari-Mite as it maintains some school-age wit and a faster storyline. It follows a normal high school storyline routine however it does get quite slow in the second half of the series. It makes balance of color contrasts well and its accompanied with a couple...of violin and piano sonatas. The antagonists stand out and the characters are written so that you may feel enough sympathy so by the final episodes you wonder how the love triangles will conclude. Overall it was enjoyable to watch from beginning to end and it is best for those whom love to follow character's relationships.

I love yuri, and I really wanted to live this show. I think in many ways it's well-written.However, it is very slow-paced, and I do not believe the writer uses this pacing to his or her advantage. The mood is also serious, sometimes even depressing rather than lighthearted like most yuri shows, and that's fine, but if the writer wanted to make a slow-paced, character-driven, occasionally tragic show, I would've liked more details. I realized upon finishing the show that I knew little about the characters' backgrounds and future hopes. I...didn't know anything about the setting, like the time period either, I can only guess. Only the main characters are really fleshed-out. I feel in one episode, I don't really learn much about the characters nor does the plot advance quickly. Much of many episodes have long, drawn-out scenes, and I realize it's an old anime which often have those scenes, but that's still my opinion.(Spoilers)Personally, I found the show to be a little depressing as well because there are more people with unrequited love than happy pairing by the end, as well as the overall atmosphere made by the music and voice acting on top of the genuinely tragic elements there on purpose.Finally, there is a couple in a flashback that if I am translating their class years into American school grades correctly, (since I live in America,) the younger girl is just way too young to be involved in a romantic let alone sexual relationship. didn't know anything about the setting, like the time period either, I can only guess.

I told myself (and my mild OCD) again and again that I would eventually finish it this way, and that I would never have to watch it a second time.Let\'s start with the biggest problem this anime has: the characters.  Namely that it doesn\'t have any characters.  Instead it has numerous cardboard cutouts walking around that occasionally behave as though they were mindless, arrogant,...manipulative and/or abusive human beings.  If someone had claimed these \'characters\' were taken from the work of a first time fan-fiction author, I wouldn\'t disbelieve them for a second.The second biggest problem this anime has is the plot.  Again, it doesn\'t have one.  A plot is a *meaningful* series of events in which the characters act (or react) in such a way to build toward the climax of the story.  In this story, that lacks any real characters, there was no possible way the handful of (almost random) events could ever build toward a climax that\'s supposed to be about the \'characters\'.  There are numerous attempts by the anime to sell the viewer that love triangles abound in the boarding school that functions as its setting; but all of the attempts are doomed from the start as (once again) there are no actual characters to take part in a love triangle.  There are some story elements about being ""The Etoile"" and the climax of the story focuses on who is going to be elected the next Etoile; but at no point in the anime is a reason given as to why anyone (let alone these particular cardboard puppets) would want the title.  The few described aspects of this position seem to include watering some plants in a greenhouse and a lot of unexplained paperwork.The third (and least bothersome) problem is with the animation and art style.  The art style was fairly typical for a 90s anime; which is too bad, as this anime came out in 2008 (a contemporary of shows like Haruhi and Index).  The animation was more disappointing - many (perhaps even most) of the shots involved little to no movement of the character models, outside of the lip flaps that are necessary to convey who is speaking.  When the story required more than just standing around, repeated walk cycles (or similar types of movement) were very much the norm.I\'ve glanced over the dozens of positive reviews this anime has generated - they are either written by aliens (unfamiliar with what a human being is and how one speaks/acts) or people who mistakenly watched some other anime then left a review here.  There is no way that a thinking/feeling person could watch this show and evaluate it as anything but the lowest of trash. manipulative and/or abusive human beings.  If someone had claimed these \'characters\' were taken from the work of a first time fan-fiction author, I wouldn\'t disbelieve them for a second.The second biggest problem this anime has is the plot.

There are some story elements about being ""The Etoile"" and the climax of the story focuses on who is going to be elected the next Etoile; but at no point in the anime is a reason given as to why anyone (let alone these particular cardboard puppets) would want the title.  The few described aspects of this position seem to include watering some plants in a greenhouse and a lot of unexplained paperwork.The third (and least bothersome) problem is with the animation and art style.  The art style was fairly typical for a 90s anime; which is too bad, as this anime came out in 2008 (a contemporary of shows like Haruhi and Index).  The animation was more disappointing - many (perhaps even most) of the shots involved little to no movement of the character models, outside of the lip flaps that are necessary to convey who is speaking.  When the story required more than just standing around, repeated walk cycles (or similar types of movement) were very much the norm.I\'ve glanced over the dozens of positive reviews this anime has generated - they are either written by aliens (unfamiliar with what a human being is and how one speaks/acts) or people who mistakenly watched some other anime then left a review here.  There is no way that a thinking/feeling person could watch this show and evaluate it as anything but the lowest of trash.', 'This Anime has left me in shambles.Watching this show I went through all the feels from going ""awwwww"" out loud in my room during the first episodes, laughing at the girls antics, cheering for their successes and suffering with their harships. All while tearing up from either happieness or sadness during almost every Episode.This Animes Storyline in my book is one of the best ever written and throughout the show I always found elements that have been adapted in so many other shows in the 16 years this show has been available. The whole Story just goes to show how messed up this entire concept...we humans have of this feeling called love really is.Talking about the Characters I like to keep in mind that this show came out when there wasn\'t tons of competition in the same genre which means it didn\'t have to have the most complex Characters and the most shocking twists. Still I felt like this show had some of the most complex, relateable and likeable Characters among any Romance Anime I have ever seen.Many people recommend this show as one of the ""yuri"" Greats, which is why i wanted to watch it. However after completing it i realised, the whole girls love aspect at least for me really quickly became irrelevant cause it was just well written romance regardless of the Characters being female or male.Please give this show a shot. This show transforms a lot as it goes on from a lighthearted almost comedy like show with cute girls doing cute stuff to a jawdropping Drama that will leave you in tears before you even notice.If you have any care for romance Animes,  this one is a must watch. we humans have of this feeling called love really is.Talking about the Characters I like to keep in mind that this show came out when there wasn\'t tons of competition in the same genre which means it didn\'t have to have the most complex Characters and the most shocking twists.

But not only does Strawberry Panic tell some decent stories, it does so while being one of the really early girl-love anime to jump onto the scene.Story & Characters: Strawberry Panic takes place at St. Miator\'s Girls Academy, where Nagisa Aoi transfers to, due to her parents suddenly needing to work overseas.  It\'s at the academy that she meets a large number of students who are drawn to her peppy personality, not the least of which is Shizuma Hanazono.  Nagisa gets...lost and sees Shizuma near a tree, that seems to have some significance to her.  Unbeknownst to Nagisa, Shizuma is actually the Etoile of this academy, which essentially means that she acts as the student body president of the three schools that exist on campus.  However, behind this love-at-first-sight interaction are multiple stories behind our large cast of characters can be pretty dramatic, but won\'t always hit with all audiences.The start of this series is one that I felt was really slow.  One of the problems with using an academy of this scale as your setting is that the author feels the need to explain the entire hierarchy to the viewers.  This, unfortunately, takes multiple episodes and it really doesn\'t start the story off on the right foot.  Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m okay with getting to know our surroundings, but the way they went about it almost made me drop the series.  If you can get past those first few episodes, the story get much more enjoyable.Nagisa is one that everyone feels attracted to.  She has such a happy-go-lucky attitude and always seeks to present the best of herself to her classmates.  She is what ties many of our characters together, and even if her personality starts to crumble at certain parts in the series, you do appreciate that those around her have her back at the worst of times.  Her roommate, Tamao Suzumi, was another very strong addition to our story.  Like Nagisa, she looks out for others and is happy to act upon for those that she cares about.  She was excellent and probably the most likable character here.  She ends up falling in love with someone, which becomes more apparent as the series goes on, and you can seriously see why.  I loved that progression because she keeps doing her best, despite the other not really reciprocating.  Shizuma has a past that none of us would be proud of, and her cold attitude kind of hints that she\'s hiding something from us.  While I appreciate what they were going for with her character, I didn\'t love her, despite some very strong back-story telling near the end of the series.  She feels unnecessarily pouty at times, when we\'re not in the middle of some of the strong storytelling around her.Side characters are plentiful and most are either very strong, or the very least, add enough to some of the episodes that make them enjoyable.  Hikari might be my favourite side character because she develops a crush very early on for Amane, and she has to go through up and down hurdles to try and get noticed by her.  One of those hurdles is that Amane is pretty popular, so she isn\'t confident that she can stick out from the rest.  Their storylines were really solid, outside of the minor plot twist near the end, which I felt was way more dramatic than it needed to be, and I wouldn\'t have missed it had they not included it.  Kaname\'s popularity, or lack there of, will likely be divided between audiences, as she is pegged as the most antagonistic out of all our characters.  She deliberately takes actions that are often seen as stark, and it results in our crew either needing to take action, or dispel unnecessary drama.  I\'m torn on her, but I do like that she adds a different element to the series.  She reminds me a lot of Sachiko from the Maria Watches Over Us, with the key difference of how their character ends up at the conclusion.After getting by the slow start, Strawberry Panic seems to like to jump around episodes that focus on different characters at a time.  Once started, they complete those mini-arcs, until they need to be brought up again.  While this is somewhat weird, I feel it works well enough because of how they end each mini-arc off each time.  Some arcs are better than others, specifically making some overdramatic, and others fall to very typical anime tropes.  However, the series moved along with its characters reacting reasonably to the situations around them.  Nagisa is proof of this because she goes through some pretty dramatic highs and lows.Speaking of drama, this series actually introduces two love triangles that fascinated me, and even if the result may sour on some audiences, I thought they mostly dealt with them in a reasonable way.  All that being said, I really gotta be honest, I didn\'t love the way they ended this series off.  It leaves one of our characters, likely, emotionally hurt, and I feel like they should have produced an episode to address it.  It doesn\'t necessarily ruin the experience, but the series feels like it reads one way, then bounced back to another for no other reason than one of our characters going, ""I realized something"".  (Story: 7/10, Characters: 8/10)Art: Strawberry Panic is old, but the way they approached the animation should be commended.  Madhouse is obviously a pretty big name these days, so it doesn\'t come as any surprise the quality of their animation.  It holds up decently well to today\'s standards, even if some of the random fan-service pops up in weird ways.  I\'m not sure if this is on purpose, but I feel like they show Shizuma to look quite frail at certain parts.  An oddity for sure, as none of the other characters showed up like this.  One little touch that I loved was that the endings played out like actual music videos in that we get to watch the singers, the Japanese VAs for Nagisa and Tamao, sing in a non-anime setting.  I really wish anime did this nowadays.  (7/10)Sound: I really didn\'t like the OST.  I didn\'t feel like they meshed with the story, especially at points where something dramatic was going on.  However, the OPs were both pretty fantastic.  The voice acting was fine, as I didn\'t feel there were any flaws throughout.  (6/10)Overall Enjoyment: Strawberry Panic was an enjoyable watch, despite the slow start and possible overreliance on typical tropes.  It has fantastic characters who act in mostly realistic ways, and the constantly moving plot prevents it from feeling too slow at important parts.  Yes, there are likely better girl-love anime out there now, but I still could recommend this to an audience looking for more.

(7/10)', 'Right this is my first review, this week i watched all the episodes for the first time and i really enjoyd it but it had a few kinks that i didnt quite like.This does contain some spoilers.. you have been warned!Im sure not many will agree with me here but the charectar i liked the least was Shizuma i thought she was very egoistic (and imo not very interesting), but the rest of the cast i liked. they had unique  personalities and looks. well except for Amane she was preatty bland and honsetly she looked a little to much like a boy, there...were moments in the anime when i had to remind myself that she was indeed female.the art considering its from 2006 i thought was okay and the scenery was actually preatty well done.Now the biggest grudge i had with this anime was the ending, when Shizuma came and interupted the ceremony alot maybe thought ""oh how heart warming she came to confess her love"" and the onlt thing i could think at that moment is how bad i felt for Tamao, you get erlier in the anime see how much Tamao cares for Nagisa (and atleast in my eyes Tamao loved Nagisa), so when Shizuma came in there and stole Nagisa away i got the feeling that Tamaos feelings were pushed to the side and wasent important.Because of the ending what would have been an 8 or 9/10 was bumped down to a 6/10, now if there would have been a season 2 that would have finished some of the story archs that the first 26 episodes left open i probably would have given this a higer score.The anime is really good and i would recomend it if you like Shuojo ai/yuri. were moments in the anime when i had to remind myself that she was indeed female.the art considering its from 2006 i thought was okay and the scenery was actually preatty well done.Now the biggest grudge i had with this anime was the ending, when Shizuma came and interupted the ceremony alot maybe thought ""oh how heart warming she came to confess her love"" and the onlt thing i could think at that moment is how bad i felt for Tamao, you get erlier in the anime see how much Tamao cares for Nagisa (and atleast in my eyes Tamao loved Nagisa), so when Shizuma came in there and stole Nagisa away i got the feeling that Tamaos feelings were pushed to the side and wasent important.Because of the ending what would have been an 8 or 9/10 was bumped down to a 6/10, now if there would have been a season 2 that would have finished some of the story archs that the first 26 episodes left open i probably would have given this a higer score.The anime is really good and i would recomend it if you like Shuojo ai/yuri.', ""Strawberry Panic is a hard one for me to review.I always trying to be more or less objective on everything that I rate. And despite being my favorite anime, I aware of severe problems that it's have. But I'm still closing my eyes on them, ignoring the fact of how bad in some aspects this anime is.If you're not a huge fan of shoujo-ai, its objective score is 7/10. Story is fine, but have some dumb moments. Art is great, it's really good looking anime. Characters overall good. It's average anime with severe plot problems. It's not like, you should or shouldn't watch it, but...if you looking for good shoujo-ai anime, like Citrus or Bloom Into You, it's definitely cost your attention and worth to be watched.That's it for objective summary, now if you're into a shoujo-ai genre, like myself, welcome to my review for Strawberry Panic. With spoilers, of course.Let's start from problems.First not large issue with Strawberry Panic is some details, that later will be forgotten. For example, Shizuma in first 2 episodes were kissing some random girl, and Aoi have seen them. Oh you thought it will end up in some drama? Nah, let's just forget it was. Or a strict rules of academy, about which we were told in the first episodes. Bruh, later girls will do whatever they want, like rules weren't there in a first place. And that not all, there will be more some of the familiar issues later on.Second huge problem is Aoi behavior in 18-20 episodes. Honestly, I'll never understand, why Aoi did what she did. It was so unreasonable that later the authors didn't even try to explain what hurt Nagisa so much in Shizuma's truth later.And last vast problem is the finale. From a standard, but solemn elections of Etoiles, they made a fu**ing lesbian wedding, where gay couples compete in whos the biggest gay of the academy. Remember the strict rules and teachers, which are, surprise, actually exist, because IT IS A SCHOOL, and this show become laughable in bad way. I'm truly hate the finale of Strawberry Panic because of that and because they took from my BEST GIRL Tamao her uncorrupted Aoi.From bad to good, why I still love this stupid anime.First of all objective good things like art and sound, I was saying about it previously.Secondary, The Characters. Characters are really good. Aoi before 18 episodes is a great protagonist, kind and soft, cute and nice, slightly dumb but it's OK. Tamao is a perfect best friend, that truly love and care about her friends. Shizuma despite being a b*tch is a good charismatic character. Secondary characters like Chikaru, Yaya, Hikari and Amane are still great. And even sort of antagonists of anime Kaname and Momomi are reasonably good. I don't know whos is saying that they don't believe in characters feelings, for me, here is no problem. I believe why one character loves another, IMHO, the authors did a great job in explaining feeling between each girl.  I can easily explain why and for what I love every of the these characters, but I won't do it here and because the review will be too long.And my favorite thing about this anime is story telling. Don't get me wrong, last 6 episodes are trash and don't count. This anime is one of the best slice of life with linear narrative. It's like in Persona, but without supernatural staff. That's why I called Aoi FeMC. and also because her hairstyle is quite familiar with Kotone's. The protagonist is making friends, helps them out and just attending school, like in normal slice of life anime. Later, when Nagisa becomes severely depressed, her friends, whom she made during this time, will help her get back on her feet. That's all so nice and cute, I love it. Also I like how they did parallel ark with Yaya, Hikari and Amane. We're not fixated on the same arc with the main characters, the authors diluted it well with a secondary arc. And there also some small arcs in some episodes, that are going parallel these two. Anime is not boring to watch, there is quite enough interesting and in some way unique characters.Overall, I love nearly everything about this anime until episode 18, when the finale starts. The finale ruining my beloved Nagisa and turn down my lovely Tamao. I'm really trying to hate this anime for this, but I can't. Too much good things I can say about it.My personal score is 10/10. If don't count finale 12/10. It's the best drama based shoujo-ai anime for now, in my opinion. if you looking for good shoujo-ai anime, like Citrus or Bloom Into You, it's definitely cost your attention and worth to be watched.That's it for objective summary, now if you're into a shoujo-ai genre, like myself, welcome to my review for Strawberry Panic.

Suzumi is my favorite little spoiler in episode one: I love Suzumi a bit more because one reason way she's like a pretty maid roomate she measured Aoi's body to get her a uniform and wrote down the data and kept it forever it was cute I wish I could set her as my favorite character but I have 10 but I...might, Hanazono is cool I like her. And Byakudan I love her as much as I love Suzumi. And yes I do kin Suzumi a bit.This anime was made in 2006 I believe now the art is pretty if you watch Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, or even Tokyo Mew Mew, or even Circus you would maybe like this plus the art is also similar. The sound is not bad at all I like the song for the opening! The characters are nice and I did enjoy this it was just so pretty. I started watching this in my room on 5/21/2022 on a website called AsainCrush but I think you can watch this on Tubi  I think, I still have no idea why this really is 26 episodes? But as I got more into it I started to get used to Aoi and like Hanazono a bit more and a bit more and a little more :))) love dearest honey senpai, But I'm not gonna lie it is a little boring and a bit hard to watch sometimes I skiped 10 seconds three times. But with Aoi it's her daily life like for expamle I liked episodes 4,5. and 6 but they were a bit hard to watch. And if I didn't say this I watched it in sub but episode 7 is 0-0 a little something love dearest honey senpaiI also drank some tea while watching I liove tea but not when it gets all over usa-chan :(( might, Hanazono is cool I like her.

Tiger Mask,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3009/Tiger_Mask,"[""first i'll start telling why I consider it a masterpiece( i'll keep it brief), this the show that introduced into anime, I mean it isn't easy to tell you how amazing this classic masterpiece is. And i still can't believe that nobody wrote a review for it yet, Tiger mask is a story about wrestling, this will be your first impression when you watch it for the first time but believe me its about so much more, and I don't want to keep you detailed about the story. my advice just keep watching it. And also a small note if you're a fan of wrestling...you better check out this anime, cuz i have one word and it's Awesomeness.Story: As I said earlier the story evolves about wrestling and a famous wrestler who's loved by everyone and tries so hard to keep his identity secret. I don't want to give you a summary about the story, but as you keep watching you'll be interested in some of the characters stories, especially the protagonist ( Naoto Date).Art: Well the art was the typical 70's anime, but what really makes it exceptional is the amazing fight scenes it's just there is also fluid action in it, and also the character's design most of them are very well detailed, especially when they show emotions, I mean the art of this is just amazing for me.P.S. my most favorite thing in this anime is tiger mask's special moce sequence I won't spoil it for you but it's just amazing how he jumps around the ring.Sound: Well the sound effects is sometimes is good and the other times is a let down. But the first i watched this show it was dubbed on my language (Arabic) and believe me the voice acting was amazing in my language, but then I also watched couple of episodes in Japanese and it was also good.Character: This is maybe the strongest point in this series, I mean there is so much variety between the characters, especially the wrestler villains I mean you won't find anyone with the same style and characteristics. Also what I like about the protagonist ( Naoto Date) is how he changes his personality between the courageous, tough and loved by everybody tiger mask into a lazy, eccentric and a bit of a joker reporter ( that's his real identity).Enjoyment: Anybody who loves watching wrestling but with a lot of bloody and broken noses, a lot of character development, and also a bit of comedy, This show is for you.Overall: My opinion this show can't stop being so amazing, and it's a definitely a must-watch anime, even if you're not a fan of wrestling you'll love this show........ you better check out this anime, cuz i have one word and it's Awesomeness.Story: As I said earlier the story evolves about wrestling and a famous wrestler who's loved by everyone and tries so hard to keep his identity secret. I don't want to give you a summary about the story, but as you keep watching you'll be interested in some of the characters stories, especially the protagonist ( Naoto Date).Art: Well the art was the typical 70's anime, but what really makes it exceptional is the amazing fight scenes it's just there is also fluid action in it, and also the character's design most of them are very well detailed, especially when they show emotions, I mean the art of this is just amazing for me.P.S. my most favorite thing in this anime is tiger mask's special moce sequence I won't spoil it for you but it's just amazing how he jumps around the ring.Sound: Well the sound effects is sometimes is good and the other times is a let down.

Decent mix of sad and energetic melodies, that perfectly complement the images on screen.This is an highly suggested anime to watch, because of his simply and yet engaging story, even if you don't care much about wrestling.The animation is pretty rough at times, but it's like a nice time capsule from the 60s, but it gets better the further you go with the episodes.I'm currently subbing the italian version of the show in english.If you're interested,...you can write me at zurgoide800@gmail.com you can write me at zurgoide800@gmail.com""]"
Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38999/Watashi_ni_Tenshi_ga_Maiorita_Special,"[""As a big fan of this genre of animes I've been waiting for this special chapter since it was announced.This review may contain few spoilers btwLike the previous chapters, WataTen bring us the story of Mya-nee and her sister's friends having day-to-day experiences. The classic beach episode could not be missed and the same with the halloween's one. Is truly enjoyable see this girls having fun, I'll really miss them (specially the opening and the MYA NEE screams).There is not too much to say about this, if you watch the original anime this could be good for you. Enjoy! "", 'All around great except for the fact that I got cucked out of seeing mya-nee swimsuit so minus points for that.The ova was decently good with a good amount of cuteness. But the lifevest had to ruin it.I now have an emptiness in my heart from not seeing mya nee swimsuit. So sad this could have been a great ova ; (.Anyways as teh rest of the series the art was great as expected. And the sound was great too. Not too much character development in this episode, and the story was divided into 3 parts, not too interesting. ', ""The special contains 4 short stories, with time-skips between them, rather than a more cohesive storyline the standard episodes provided. It also overdoes flashbacks a little bit, making the whole thing feel a bit half-baked, like a compilation of skits that didn't make it into the main show, diluted with some filler content.Other than that, it's still more Wataten, so if you like the formula it's worth checking out. The gags are pretty creative and amazingly enough, the show still steers away from the fanservice these extra episodes so often are about. It underlines the positive surprise I had discovering that it might be a...show about a lolicon, but not one for lolicons – which is a subtle distinction that makes all the difference. ;p show about a lolicon, but not one for lolicons – which is a subtle distinction that makes all the difference. ;p""]"
Xie Wang Zhui Qi 3: Shen Nu Guilai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48962/Xie_Wang_Zhui_Qi_3__Shen_Nu_Guilai,"[""From start (Season 1) to finish this is one of the most impressive Chinese romance anime's (dongwha?) that I've come across thus far. I was also told that this will be getting a fourth season! (I hope that's true, I'm super excited!)I'm usually not a fan of super convoluted storylines but this one does such a good job of weaving over existing gradual discoveries to make the main characters and the world they inhabit more developed and complex. Su Luo definitely gets the most attention, but Liuyun also gets his fair share of moments.I love the witty commentary and quippy lover's playfight banter that goes...on between the two of them, that highlights the tension but also the not-so-subtle interest they each have in each other. The cute romantic moments are HIGHLY enjoyable the way they are presented here than in almost anything else I've watched in the romance genre.**potentially spoilery comments past this point**I think the biggest thing that truly captured my heart was the fact that prince Liuyun was a flawed individual, which made him highly relatable. He had a somewhat flare-able temper, he would act brashly at times or speak a few harsh words, but he always strove to treat Su Luo with the most respect out of everyone, which ends up generating the most love between characters. The fact that even when he's in the crossfire of several situations he would always tell her to follow her heart, and that he trusted her or believed in her. He would tell her that he was there for her, but he would give her space and let go of her hand and wouldn't white knight her involuntarily unless she rarely needed the help. I think that's a very rare romantic dynamic that's underrated.Their codependence on each other's special circumstances creates an explosion of romantic tension (mostly blatantly imposed by Liuyun comedically) that leads to both of them to confronting each other's pasts together to form a stronger bond as they face even more ominous hardships moving forward. It really outlines and displays the essence of what a healthy romantic relationship development is, with its relatable ups and downs, and its learning moments. Watching this felt like multiple different allegories for relatable real life experiences and trauma and moving forward as an individual and as a couple. on between the two of them, that highlights the tension but also the not-so-subtle interest they each have in each other.

Season 1 was weak but the series keeps getting better. I have my doubts about Season 4's story, I feel like they are going in a cliche direction (that I'm very tired of). I'm sure it will be good, I'm just not sure if I'll continue watching it.  The last episode of this season was a little weak.  This season our heroine received many powerups.IMHO, this is a must see Chinese animation, especially if you like Isekai or world traveling, divine pets, inner spaces etc. ""]"
A3! Season Autumn & Winter,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40272/A3_Season_Autumn___Winter,"[""I've already made a review for the 1st Cour (Spring & Summer), so refer to that if this is the 1st time you're seeing A3! as a whole. For the hopefuls, if you are wondering what the 2nd Cour has in store: no surprise, TL;DR, everything stays the same.Except for some things that made the 2nd Cour better: an overhaul of staff:- Director Masayuki Sakoi taking over full directorial duties- Chief animation director replacing Mariko Komatsu- Art director Kohei Honda replacing Hiroko Tanabe (both from Kusanagi)- Color designer Manami Sasa replacing Yuko Tsumori- Editing-in-charge Hidemitsu Koi joined by Go Sadamatsu (Golden Kamuy, SAO Alternative: GGO)In...a nutshell, everything looks cleaner than the 1st Cour (except the facial designs which still look off, but not as bad as before).A different repertoire of songs, but I'd have to say that I liked Spring & Summer's OP more than Autumn & Winter's OP, but both are really solid songs. As always, the seasonal Troupe EDs are also really good, I'd like Autumn & Winter's more than Spring & Summer. Regardless though for A3! fans, you're well blessed with great music.As a whole, A3! the Animation (if you count all 4 seasonal Troupes together) is a must-watch for diehard A3! fans, but for anime-onlys (like myself), I can understand why it doesn't appeal to people that don't recognize the franchise outside of Japan. a nutshell, everything looks cleaner than the 1st Cour (except the facial designs which still look off, but not as bad as before).A different repertoire of songs, but I'd have to say that I liked Spring & Summer's OP more than Autumn & Winter's OP, but both are really solid songs.

Season Autumn & Winter is just as enjoyable as Spring and Summer. The two new troupes are diverse in age and personality. Though they mostly stray to certain archetypes, the characters are likeable. The plays are just as engaging as the past. The stakes in this season is relatively higher than the previous as the final performances will make or break the Mankai Theater. Furthermore, they have an enemy troupe against them called the God Troupe who will do what they can to take them down.I have some minor nitpicks about this season. The morally gray nuance the characters have in the previous...season is not really there at this point. The characters' new rival God Troupe has a god complex who seem cartoonishly evil. They seem more like enemies than rivals because they are so into destroying Mankai by any means necessary for no good reason. The God Troupe is a weird bunch.Production quality is more or less the same as Spring and Summer. The character designs are nice and I like the way lighting is used in this season. That being said, I began to notice its limitations in animation, namely when the characters nearly got to a fist fight. Characters would seem stiff, and while the performances still made the plays fun, the animation held them back a little bit. At least their faces look okay.Overall, this is a fun addition to A3 and I recommend it if you already seen Spring and Summer. season is not really there at this point.

The choice of plays for each group suits eachgroups' personality and the plays themselves are quite fun. Sometimes the interaction between characters are slightly on the boring side, and sometimes the conflicts slows the pace of the show so much so that I skim through much of the episode. I'll say this though, the entire show is easily digestible for anime only watchers while leaving hints and sweet kisses to those who play the games as well. My gripe would have to be how...former troupes are used fairly unsuccessfully  within the current arc. There are exceptions to the rule, but it feels like at the end of every 6 episode , new game plus.

The time spent on the seasonal troupes is evenly divided, so you get six episodes with each of them. The show starts off with recruiting mostly theater newbies and watching them learn how to act. Then, six episodes later, the show throws them to the side to focus on finding five new guys, who you watch learn how to act, get tossed aside, and repeat. And repeat is the keyword. The whole show is just watching some bumbling idiots learn how to act four times in row. Most of the characters don't get enough screentime to...differentiate themselves from the cast of 20 boys, so instead they have to fall back on one-trick pony gimmicks to have any memorability. There's occasionally some decent drama, though nothing unique, and most episodes end up quite boring.The second cour is at least marginally better than the first. You have a solid character dynamic between two boys in the Autumn troupe who start out hating each other but end up forming some grudging respect for each other. The Winter troupe is where the show decides to introduce some supernatural elements for the first time 19 episodes in, including getting the boys stuck in a literal time loop. It's too little too late to really recommend, but hey, if you've made it this far, you might as well finish it out. differentiate themselves from the cast of 20 boys, so instead they have to fall back on one-trick pony gimmicks to have any memorability.

It is not without fault, as goes into the supernatural into the Winter Troupe portion and it adds things that do not need to be there to help get the plot across in an anime having to do with acting/theater overall. A majority of the characters either are new to acting, have a bit of acting experience, or just asked to join the specific season troupe without anything else. Personally, in this viewers opinion I think A3 could have been a bit more serviceable with a few changes....No, I did not play the game that this anime is based on. Here is where this anime has missed the mark in an array of aspects. Now, this is coming from someone who has watched a fair amount of idol animes in the past, so this is just my overall opinion on what I would have done a bit differently. For starters I do agree on keeping the concept of having stage actors who have some acting experience around. My first change would be a handful of the characters let's say about three of them in total where all part of the entertainment industry is in a different capacity. One of them was a male idol since childhood, and was a part of a group that had been around for more than a decade. The idol group ended, and the members went their separate ways. But this one character still wanted to be a part of the entertainment industry, but not many takers wanted him. So, he searches for a new way to find and entertains others and comes across the Makkai Company. The other two would be former people who left the entertainment industry behind who never got those big breaks and ended up being typecast. One because of being a child actor and getting older was a detriment that he was getting bit parts in roles as a result, and left acting behind for a handful of years and got back into it after seeing the stage plays. Lastly, number three was always the supporting role but never got those important lead roles that he trained hard for, and left things behind for many years and only came back to show people that they made a mistake on him by not giving his big chance.Overall, A3! is a good watch but it leaves a lot to be desired in a lot of potential areas that bring off growth. The same process over and over for each troupe gets exhausting, Some of the characters you can look at, dislike, and will sometimes just get annoyed with after their shtick is repetitive after a while. While the Spring and Summer one can deliver to be a solid 7 out of 10, Autumn and Winter falls into a solid 6 out of 10. No, I did not play the game that this anime is based on.

I understand that lolicon’s are far from a rare occurrence; in fact, they are fairly standard in the medium, but presenting the lolicon-infatuation as the focal point of the entire series is just loathsome.  In fact, the entire first episode of Wataten! An Angel Flew Down to Me was about Mayako’s fanaticism in capturing Hana Shirosaki (who’s in elementary school) in adorable outfits from a variety of advantageous angles.  It’s no wonder Mayako has no friends, as the other young-adults must have realized her freakish proclivities and decided...to stay clear of this future felon.“But it’s so cute!!!”O reary?

Schwing!).  Consequently for Noa, Mayako’s favored treasure — my PRECIOUS!!! — is forever Hana, as her exhilaration heightened when Hana wore the same outfit as Noa.  Then, during a board game constructed by the three girls, Mayako revealed her inability to “smile and say hello,” giving further insight into her gauche personality.  But it wasn’t shocking when you consider that Mayako wears a track suit like she’s vying for a role in the Sopranos’ (weird-o!).The writing staff attempted to use Mayako’s maladroit behavior, along with the girls’ cuteness to generate situations that would elicit laughter; however, they failed miserably.  The jokes are as non-existent as Mayako’s personality, and with Wataten! being a one-trick pony (i.e. relying on the “cuteness” factor) it dampens the engagement for the audience.

But it wasn’t shocking when you consider that Mayako wears a track suit like she’s vying for a role in the Sopranos’ (weird-o!).The writing staff attempted to use Mayako’s maladroit behavior, along with the girls’ cuteness to generate situations that would elicit laughter; however, they failed miserably.  The jokes are as non-existent as Mayako’s personality, and with Wataten! being a one-trick pony (i.e. relying on the “cuteness” factor) it dampens the engagement for the audience.  This is the type of anime that you’ll be asking yourself: “what the f—k am I doing with my life?”  But at least you’re not the guy forced himself to watch four episodes to write a review about said anime (because that would suck!).', ""What do you do if an angel suddenly comes to your house? sorry, forget about that, I'm just joking. Well, regarding this series, I really like the stories they offer are full of jokes and laughter. Even though this series seems simple, it is very good at carrying the theme, no doubt after asking from various friends, I conclude that an anime does not have to be wide need a variety of packaging to make a masterpiece.The art they offer is also very good, but I really like the character design, they can make the characters more attractive and funny, especially when compared to the...matching voice makes me fall in love with the characters. The opening and closing themes they stretch are also right and fit to arouse a sense of enthusiasm, I really enjoyed this one show a simple storyline that made the audience carried away by the flow of the story. matching voice makes me fall in love with the characters. The opening and closing themes they stretch are also right and fit to arouse a sense of enthusiasm, I really enjoyed this one show a simple storyline that made the audience carried away by the flow of the story."", 'From the makers of Uchi no maid, Doga kobo presents another loli fest Wata ten.But compared to Uchi no maid, this is much more softer in terms of lolicon parody and to be honest more enjoying ina heartwarming delightful manner.The story revolves around our main characters Miyako and Hana.One day Miyakos sister Hinata (Best girl btw) brings her classmate Hina to her house, and introducesher to Miyako and voila, Miyako is instant smitten by this lovely little ""angel"" looking girl.Love at first sight, ok quite the cliche moving on.Now we learn a bit about miyako, she is well quite the introvert university student who...is into fashion designing.Not only she is a great cook, a good designer but also a responsible sister.Ideal waifu material? sure But here comes the fun part.Her favorite hobby and pastime? of course making up cosplay clothes for little girls. Also after meeting hana and falling forher little angelic beauty, hana has become the prime model for her cosplay fantasies.Now Hana, inspite of her being young,quite the sensible and matured girl,but as always there will always be a weakness.and the weakness is.... *Drum rolls*, she is a hard core glutton or lets just say foody. She literally is a food hooker.and i meant it in a good way. She will do anything as long as she is fed good food.So miyako being a good cook, with her fantasies of dressing up Hana in her cospaly clothes, what else could be the perfect god made setting?In spite of Hana noticing Miyakos side of lolicon and dressin up fetishes and even kind of repulsing a bit at it, as long as the tasty foodis made by miyako, all is well.Next of the main loli trio, we have Hinata. Absolutely 100% the best girl of the show.This fanged loli is the burst of her energy of smiles and happiness.Her obsessive, cute love for her miyako, especially of her famous trademark name for Miyako ""Mya nee!!"", which she says so many times throughout the series,(in a non annoying way that too).Her world literally revolves around miyako,praising her, wanting to be around and receving mental and physical affections from her just adorable. siscon over 9000.She just uplifts and supports all characters in a really sweet way and manages to just make the show more enjoyable for viewers in every way with her smile and antics.Finally we have Noa, who moved next to miyakos house and well one day caught Miyako cosplaying and quite smugly blackmailed her so that she could wear miyakos hand made dresses.Noa is well another matured and sensible girl of her age, she has a high sense of fashion and likes to compete with hana on the cosplay dressing scenes,to prove that she is cute and get attention from miyako in the process, but most of the times unfortunately Hana as she is the prized cute gem for miyako wins.She is also a quite sweet addition to the trio, she helps miyako at times while dealing in situations with hana and hinataAlso she is quite fond of Hinata especially, and harbors a quite platonic love for her.Other side characters are also quite interesting and enjoyable to watch,The other two classmates of Hinata, Koyori and Kanon.They both are the Class reps of the class, while Koyori tries to be the dominant,dependable class rep,its actually kanon whom the class looks up to, as she actually is the most matured, sensible,responsible, calm and sweet matured as Koyori is clumsyand usualy clutters and makes a mess of her work.But both of them have a real good friendship and can be seen hanging out together often where kanon usually takes care of koyori. Really sweet and heartwarming.Finally we have Matsumoto. The downgraded version of Midori of uchi no maid.She was once in the same class as miyako, once saw her sewing in economics room with dedicationand instantly became smitten and attracted to her,Whatever may come, she is obsessed with miyako, and stalks her since high school, with her weird fetishes like popping out of nowhere in front of miyako,making dresses for miyako where she knows her measurementwithout ever measuring her, making miyako like dolls,a more of scary and weird dialogues relating to miyako which are all but for comic purposes.She has a normal, sweet little sister who likes playing acting role with her dog, still oblivious to her big sisters weird habits.With all these likable characters, their antics and personalities, it makes up of for a sweet, great comedy and a heartwarming series.The best feature i find is apart from the all the normal fun stuff, after Mikoyan\'s introduction and daily interaction with these girls slowly makes her open up a bit more and express herself more,and improve upon her introvert and NEET nature, which is really enjoyable and pleasant to watch.Something rare to watch.As for animation Doga Kobo did a great job once again with giving us nice light pastel colors and simple art design with really great animation, especially for a series like this.Brings out the cute and adorable aspect of the show along with bit of comedy drama parts instilled in between scenes.Sound wise,no complains there as well.The OST are relaxing and pleasant to listen to while watching the anime.Also The Opening and ED are well made.I liked the ED especially, the Little girls singing ""Happy Happy Friends"" joyfullyat the top of their voices, gives a great delight to end the show on a happy high note. Love it.Another nice slice of Life, Shoujo Ai. If you wanna layback relax and watch a bunch of cute girls do some sweet stuff with a nice glaze of fun comedy and Yuri,then please go ahead and give it a watch.

Really well made, Enjoyable and recommended.', 'When you see this show, 2 things come to mind: The feelings of Yuru Yuri once again (since this is mainly a Shoujo Ai series), and the one of the veteran studios of CGDCT-based anime adaptations, Doga Kobo, back at it again from the similar but decent UzaMaid last season. That doesn\'t mean that this has the same quality and presentation as UzaMaid, but it is definitely leaps better. And props to director Daisuke Hiramaki for his debut (overall) directing of Wataten.You know it when it\'s a 4-koma adaptation, so don\'t expect any kind of streamlined story or plot, or rather, plot points *mmm*. The...lesbian ""romance"" starts off with the main lead, university/college student Miyako Hoshino. Being a shut-in for most of her life, she is the equivalent of a NEET, just taking into consideration for her growing-up years of chuunibyou-esque habits of cosplay, and avoid human contact as much as she can. Once the 5 elementary students drop at her sights one-by-one, her life gets better and better, with a bombarding effect. And no, before you ask, she\'s not a pedo, just a pure lolicon.We start off with the loli. Hana Shirosaki, the ""angel"" to Miyako, introduced by her younger sister Hinata. You know the expression ""Love at First Sight""? That\'s how fast Hana is sold towards Miyako\'s sight (or Mya-nee as Hinata nicknames), free to exploit for her insane pleasures of cosplay. Surprisingly, for an elementary school girl, Hana is rather smart and mature for her age, unlike the other girls (plus Hinata) that we\'ll see later. But like any other school girls her age, even she is not spared from sweet stuff, as Mya-nee also knows how to entice her with her cooking! So an exchange made for Mya-nee\'s cooking against Hana\'s (and occasionally with the other girls) tolerance for Miyako to do her ""petting love"" stuff. Tit for tat, perhaps! Hinata on the other hand, like any sibling would love their own, is always attached to Mya-nee, in the most of energetic ways. What a powerful young siscon.Next, the trio of Noa Himesaka, and class reps Koyori Tanemura and Kanon Konomori! Noa reminds me much of Gabriel DropOut\'s Satania, in terms of incompetent ""superiority"" issues, other than her constant call for attention towards Miyako to see her ""superior"" beauty in comparison to Hana (but of course you know who wins, each and everytime). Moving into the residence beside both Hinata and Miyako\'s home, the first impressions always hit the hardest, and her self-cosplay immediately attracts her blackmailing call, oh wow. On the other hand, it is a regret that both Koyori and Kanon only get a small amount of mentions and screentime (due to their involvement in the OP) as the trio\'s (Hinata, Hana and Noa) classmates, and speaking of short appearances, the mothers of Hinata-Miyako, Noa and Koko.Speaking of Koko (or Matsumoto as we know her better), she was once together with Miyako in the same class in high school, but for some reason, due to her NEET-like status, she doesn\'t remember her much. Despite all odds, she literally is constantly fixing her sights onto Miyako like a stalker since high school (the same way UzaMaid portrays Midori\'s obsessions towards Kamoi after their time in the JASDF). Scary much, but luckily it\'s all for comic relief.Overall, a great use of character cast to flesh out their personalities and also dat sweet, sweet build of relationship bridges. The seiyuu cast for the 5 girls are great, with both veterans and newbies alike. Olivia from Asobi Asobase comes back to voice Mya-nee\'s younger sister, not to mention that the main girl Hana is voiced by a newbie (Maria Sashide) as her debut role! Absolutely impressive VA, and hope to hear more from her too.Since it is Doga Kobo, it is no surprise that I don\'t feel the need to mention how good the art and animation looks like in here. Pastel-coloured-like art and simple buPlt excellent animation all around. The character design (I feel) is one of the best traits to remember this anime, as it is done by Hiromi Nakagawa, who was the chief animation director for the original Umaru-chan and Rewrite Season 2. This is his first attempt at character designing, and I dare say he pulled off an impressive job just taking the 4-koma manga as references and displaying in pure animation.On the music side, I can\'t say it impresses as it is very minimal, even factoring in the OST. Sure the OP and ED sounds good and looks fine, but when compared to UzaMaid, it has the same degree of energy and generic feel. But good points given for trying to portray the OP with the eventual reveal of the entire character cast (except Matsumoto of course).While this season isn\'t a haven for CGDCT based series (Endro~! and this series), I\'d still agree that if you need a relaxing watch to satisfy your loli hunger, this is one series that I can wholeheartedly recommend, not just for the Yuri relations, but just for enjoyment alone. With that said, this anime had a lot of firsts for the production staff, so I\'d say a job well done, and we\'re anticipating more. lesbian ""romance"" starts off with the main lead, university/college student Miyako Hoshino.

Even more so when one considers that the most recent version before this was just a season before and also was done by the same studio. But while many of the other age gap shows play up the creepiness of the actions either for horror or humor, Wataten is able to take a more nuanced take on what is happening.First things first, I can understand why it can be somewhat uncomfortable for audiences to watch the main character so obviously have a crush on...a girl who is much younger than her, as well as see the ways that she expresses that love, but I would also implore them to hear the show out and top watch the whole think before coming to a quick judgement. While some of the actions that Miyako takes are sketchy, I don't think that is a fully accurate description of her character. While the maid in UzaMaid had her sole purpose defined by loving lolis, Miyako doesn't. Not only is Hana her first love, which hit her like a truck hits a poor helpless soon to be isekai protagonist, but she also exhibits other passions mainly clothing and fashion design, along with more okatu like interests. Her interest in Hana is just one piece of the puzzle, and one part of her whole character.She also is a sufferer of social anxiety and has troubles being in crowds, going outside, or interacting with those that are outside of her comfort zone. In a way her smittenness with Hana is able to override that fear and is able to get her to reach out for once, which is ultimately good for her growing as a character. The show does a good job of showing her condition and how much it ends up effecting her. The ability to just interact with others is a struggle for her and it's clear just watching her through out the 12 episodes. With desires, flaws and all Miyako is a complete character, and is a quite developed one at that. She manages to grow throughout the season and is able to be more than just an age gap joke. And that's what I think is so important. As unsavorable as it may be to some, often times love happens out of nowhere for reasons that are hard to understand. And it hits Miyako herself. But Miyako is more than that. She is a real person with real struggles and desires and all of that. She is able to provide the nuance that is needed by being a complete character. I also have to add that despite some of Hana's more weird quirks Miyako is willing to accept them and enjoy Hana for who she is rather than protecting the image of an angel onto her. She isn't there just for that image, but rather for Hana herself.Furthemore while some of her actions are suspect, there are a lot of her actions that are wonderful. She is a great sister to Hinata, and even before Hana was in the picture she doted on her and gave her all the love that one can really hope from their big sister. Even with Hana and the other girls in the picture, she acts like a big sister to all of them. She bonds with them, she plays with them, and often she tries to help them with whatever they're trying to do. And as the show goes on, the more things she does to try to help them out. She is a good sister to them and she is a good friend. And it may seem weird to some, friends don't have to be age restricted. Despite the difference in age there is a true bond there which is very enjoyable to see.I talked a lot about Miyako which makes sense given her focus in the show, however she is far from the only great character in the show. The main cast is a lot of joy to watch and each of them have their own interesting quirks. While Hana can be quite angelic in her appearance and demeanor, she has her own weird quirks and odd things she likes that makes her interesting and goes against that grain. Noa loves herself and attention but actually despite that she is a really good friend and is the most aware of what is going on out of the whole cast, even Miyako at times. And while she is not afraid to use what she knows to her advantage, she also uses what she knows to try to make the rest of the cast happier and get them to the conclusion that they wouldn't be able to get to without pushing. Hinata is a genki-girl that loves her sister a whole lot, and to be fair she is the simplest of the cast. She basically tries to make everyone happy while also trying to be with her big sister as much as she can.As one may expect from a Dogo Kobo show the art style is fantastic and really brings out the cuteness of the show. The animation is great and the music is also quite nice. While there can be a few corners cut here and there the general art style is so strong and cute that it is able to more than make up for it.Overall these good production values along with the wonderful characters and the growth they have both as people as towards each other makes this a great enjoyable watch, and one that provides the nuance that I hoped to see in it. And while it is able to hit all of the things that one would hope for a CGDCT I'm glad that it was able to use it's premise and unique traits well to separate it from the pack. It's not my favorite CGDCT but is a welcome addition to the list of CGDCT that I really enjoyed and would heartily recommend. a girl who is much younger than her, as well as see the ways that she expresses that love, but I would also implore them to hear the show out and top watch the whole think before coming to a quick judgement.

Miyako isn't a pedofile.2. This show isn't anything like Uzamaid. Uzamaid's MC foams at the mouth at the sight of any underaged girl.Hana is the only girl that Miyako fawns over, not all girls. Yet they've slept in the same bed with no problems. Miyako doesn't attempt to peek when Hana is in the bath. Miyako couldn't care less when Hana wore a school swimsuit. Miyako was actually the one avoiding Hana when Hana got to close when they in the closet together. They are also able to talk to each other normally.Does...any of this sound like a crazy pedofile? Not even close.Now that I say that, the first episode is really weird, there's a disconnect which might throw off viewers watching the show for the first time. During the first episode Miyako is forbidden from taking a picture from a down below angle. That's where people start getting the pedofile vibes but it was really out of character for her to do that because all of her other actions suggests that Miyako has ZERO sexual interests in Hana. She just sees Hana as super cute like a dog or a cat.This show is also a hit or miss for people but if you can ignore all of the loli stuff you can enjoy Miyako trying to slowly progress towards being a functional member of society. The show really shines when the story revolves around her.All things aside, Reina Ueda is absolutely fantastic. As a fan, my ears have enjoyed this series. any of this sound like a crazy pedofile?

This isn’t a criticism on the people who have made the show and the people who liked the show as people. I am not saying that any person that has anything to do with this show, whether it is watching it or making it, is a pedophile BECAUSE of this show. This is a criticism on the show, not people.There, let’s get into it)I don’t think I have seen a show that I would call pedophilic. You know, you have shows that have some weird...scenes with characters that look like children. I.e Dragon maid, Bakemonogatari (I haven’t seen the show, but I know there’s a loli in there) etc. But I wouldn’t call any of those shows pedophilic even though pedophiles can enjoy those shows sexually.The only scenes with Kanna that could be sexually suggestive are scenes where the two characters have the same age, and (as far as I am aware) Shinobu doesn’t take part in sex with an adult.But I think Wataten is the closest to loli hentai that I have seen.The synopsis of “Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me” is that Miyako, a socially anxious college student, meets her little sisters new friend Hana, who she is instantly amazed by. Through Miyako’s fantastic baking, she makes Hana do cosplays while Miyako takes pictures of it.Miyako basically falls in love with a child, and makes her do suggestive photoshoots (From my point of view anyway).Now, you could say that Miyako just found Hana to be extremely cute. There isn’t any sexual situations in the show. it isn’t a hentai or an ecchi show. But even though it is never stated that Miyako fell in love with Hana, looking at some of the scenes really point at it.Now, this is the worst part of the show. every episode I was waiting for Miyako to break and just rape the girl. Doing that would actually be like a really shocking turn of events. Doing a madoka magica and make everything dark as fuck.Now that’s what I would’ve wanted, but what I got was Miyako and her baby harem going around town doing all sorts of stuff.They reference the fact that Miyako is really creepy, and the fact that they could call the police. And while that’s probably the best part of the show, where it is a little self aware of what it is, the problem is that they say it so many times, but they never do it. The perfect ending would’ve been Hana finally calling the police and then a shot with Hiyako in jail. But again, it doesn’t happen. Hana definitely knows that what Miyako is doing is wrong, but she never does anything. In the end, Hana-chan seems to be comfortable with Miyako, but she should be scared out of her mind. Miyako, an adult, has been using a child to do photoshoots.When the Hana’s parents hear what Miyako has been doing with their daughter, their not worried, their not angry. they were excited…And I just want to say. The concept of having the main character being a pedophile isn’t bad in nature. You can do some really interesting stuff with that, like showing that even though someones a pedophile, they can resist their urge to fuck children. You can convey a message that I have NEVER seen in any medium ever (Though, I would be surprised if it hasn’t been done before).But what Miyako does, it doesn’t show that. What Miyako does is inexcusable. She isn’t worthy of all the attention and respect that she gets.There is one episode where Miyako is revealed to have her birthday on that very day. None of the girls in her harem know this, and therefore comes up with a gift. This gift is a ticket to do whatever she wants with one of the girls. And when Miyako understands that Hana is one of the people that she can make do whatever she wants, she does This face. Can you honestly say that that face doesn’t have the intentions of fucking Hana.Ok, you can probably tell that I’m getting quite a bit annoyed while writing about this show. But I have to say, there were things to enjoy. The lineart and coloring were both pretty solid, it was a fairly cute show when Miyako wasn’t being a creepy and there were actual scenes that I didn’t want to die from believe it or not.But I can’t give excuses to this shit. I can forgive one-sided characters. I can forgive on-the-nose dialogue. I can even forgive trash visuals if everything else is fine.But I cannot say that the fact that we were supposed to relate to and empathize with an active pedophile didn’t bother me.Ultimately, I think this is a shit show, but manages to be harmless. I know I’ve talked about it’s pedophilic themes a lot, but the show doesn’t say that it’s okay being attracted to children. Miyako is repeatedly shown as a creep. And this is fine message-wise, but not writing-wise.2/10 scenes with characters that look like children.

And the show left pretty clear they complement each other very well, one has terrible fashion sense and it's essentially useless at homechores while the other has big social anxiety issues, and they motivate each other to work on these flaws, depending more and more on each other while the show goes on, their dynamic getting better while at the same time growing together.It was proven why the art direction and sound were 10/10 thanks to the final episode, but everything else was 10/10 thanks to our main couple.There are all kinds of couples in media, couples with a strong bond that weren't shown how they got so close but still leave a big impression like Kanon x Koyori, couples that are pure concentrated sugar that depend on fluff more than on substance like Noa x Hinata, and couples that we see grow from nothing into something big with the biggest focus and evolution of their romantic feelings like Miyako x Hana. the whole thing at the start, on the contrary even though the older girl was really shy and lovestruck like a pure maiden, the young one still had a hard time even trusting the cosplaymaker.But like the human characters they are, there was character development, things didn't stay static, progress was made and the characters grew, both as a person and to each other.

Like this is a college-aged ADULT who has a crush on a fifth-grade CHILD. There\'s no excusing it, and it\'s creepy as fuck.I wish they would make shoujo-ai targeted towards queer women instead of creepy men because this is how we fucking get shit like this. I\'m tired of people describing children as ""lolis"" in...these types of shows, it really downplays how weird this is.

The cute relationship between Miya-san and Hana-chan was really nice to see after watching UzaMaid the previous season.The absolutely adorable sisterly relationship between Miya-san and Hinata was one of the huge sellers for me of this series which is beautiful as we don't see many anime that focus on sisters.The absolute wholesomeness of the series is adorable all the way throughout particularly the last episode of the series which...is one of the most beautiful episodes I've ever watched in anime and an amazing way to end the series. I cant stress enough how adorable this series is.The Music in the anime OP and ED sung by the main characters also adds to the adorableness and makes the characters even cuter than they already are. Also some of the insert songs towards the end of the series are so beautifully moe its breathtaking.The characters are absolutely lovable to watch and there's never a boring moment in the series or a time your being killed by cuteness. Miyako's shy personality leads to some hilarious moments and some adorable reactions as well as the other characters tease her.Overall Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! is the moe anime to go to if you want cute girls doing cute things I highly recommend it if you like your cute slice of life. Also if your a yuri fan you'll definitely love this series as well.Score 10/10 absolutely loved it and will guarantee re-watch it very soon. is one of the most beautiful episodes I've ever watched in anime and an amazing way to end the series.

Or so the saying goes.The CGDCT genre has never been particularly original for the simple reason that it doesn\'t have to be. It\'s a stable concept, and as long as it has likeable characters it\'s bound to be enjoyable pretty much by itself. Nevertheless, I\'m not sure I\'ve come across a case of the same anime studio (in this case Doga Kobo) making almost the same anime two seasons in a row. However, that is more or less the case here with Uzamaid from last season and now Wataten from this one.Now that is not to necessarily say...that is a bad thing. In fact I think both these shows are quite good, but the similarities are undeniable. They\'re both CGDCT anime about a girl in her twenties fawning over a certain elementary schoolgirl to an unhealthy degree, as well as the various hijinks that play out between them and the other kids around them. As if that wasn\'t enough, in both series we also get a secondary adult female character introduced about halfway through the show who takes the role of an even more obsessive and stalker-like person who is gunning for the main girl instead. I\'m not sure what caused Doga Kobo to be so damn sold on an idea for a CGDCT shows that they decided to book in two nigh-identical premises on their schedule two seasons in a row, but alright then.That being said there are certainly some notable differences between the two though. In Wataten\'s case this becomes more apparent after a couple episodes when more characters are introduced from the elementary school. From this point onwards it starts feeling more like a traditional moe comedy as there is more focus on the lolis and not quite as much about Miyako\'s obsessiveness as it is in the first few episodes. You could argue the show becomes less original from that point onwards but I still think it became better in the process. The typical CGDCT formula has survived this long for a reason after all: it just works.The characters are quite likeable in general. Other than the reserved closet otaku Miyako with her slight lolicon tendencies who stars as the anime\'s MC, we\'ve also got her cheerful but airheaded little sister Hinata, the sweets addict Hana (who\'s the target of Miyako\'s affections), as well as the ego-centric mood maker Noa making up the core of Wataten\'s cast. They have a lot of chemistry between them which is probably the biggest charm point of the show, and in my opinion Noa is the one who stands out the most and carries the show to a decent extent. Her straightforward and smug attitude is always a joy to watch. There are also some side characters that enter the show a bit later as mentioned previously, but they don\'t stand out as much on their own, instead they help to transition the general structure and theme of the anime as a whole, but it is only for the better.Overall, Wataten is not a particularly unorthodox anime in the end. It really is just another CGDCT show really, but the convenient thing is that… well, being ""just another CGDCT"" is kind of a good thing, so it\'s totally worth watching anyway. Just try not to replicate too many of Miyako\'s fantasies after watching it or you might find the police knocking on your door one day.PS: It also ends on an absolute high with one of the best single episodes you\'ll see in a moe show, so it\'s kinda worth watching just for that if nothing else. that is a bad thing.

The anime itself isn\'t even really pervy in anyways and the worse it got was that Hana and the rest of the cast gets to dress up in non fanservicey costumes for the majority of the anime. Hell Hana finds ways to utilize and even manipulate Miyako in order to get snacks and food from her as her family doesn\'t allow Hana to eat those kinds of things and by the end of it, Miyako and Hana\'s friendship is just that a mutual friendship with no romantic vibes at all.Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!\'s characters are ok but falls under the clicheness with certain characters having a running gag here and there. Of course Miyako and Hana has them too. Miyako for her cosplaying the rest of the cast, Hana\'s obsession with junk food, Miyako\'s younger sister  Hinata voiced by Rika Nagae is the hyper genki character that clings onto Miyako, Noa Himesaka voiced by Akari Kito being the semi-narcissistic kid and wanting everyone to call her cute, a conflict in which Hana trumps Miyako\'s eyes and Noa get annoyed by. This for the mos tpart is the basis of the comedy in Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! just with some different settings and situations here and there and it has  a mark of repetition at times with it\'s characters as a result.The minor characters do come in here and there, like Koyori Yanemura voiced by Hitomi Ohwada, a friend of Hana and Hinata who thinks she\'s a great leader and can do everything but fails and her best friend Kanon Konomori voiced by Naomi Oozora who\'s the polar opposite and is extremely reliable and that\'s their entire gag. There is one other character to note and that\'s Koko Matsumoto voiced by Lynn who\'s is actually the perceived ""Miyako"" as she stalks, takes picture and finds EVERYTHING about Miyako and yeah that\'s her entire gag as well.The animation done by Doga Kobo is expected moe and this is no different right down to the character designs and background work. LA REALLY doesn\'t have much to talk with the animation it\'s really is boilerplate Doga Kobo with their quality and expected moeness.Voice acting, well seeing Reina Ueda as Miyako was kinda half-expected decent as the recluse yet slightly shy genki character to be honest, with Rika Nagae as her hypergenki clingy younger sister and Maria Sashide as the stoic almost deadpan Hana rounding the chemistry between these three seiyuu\'s working off nicely oddly enough. The voice cast was ok..maybe too moe at times...but just ok.And that\'s the word LA will leave off with Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!, it\'s just ""ok"", the comedy is there with a few laughs but some of the running gags implemented towards the main cast does make the punchline easier to figure out or just cliche in the situations the cast goes through and no even for a show like this, the moe doesn\'t help if the comedy is this repetitive and predictable. Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! may seem alienating ESPECIALLY it\'s first episode but even going through the entire anime, it was harmless as a result but it\'s comedy needed some work with the premise it was given to us, but in saying that...can you?.

However the first episode had a strange interaction between the main character, Miyako, and Hana, a small girl. I brushed it aside as thinking a young girl was cute much in the same way you might find a puppy or other small animal cute. However, incidents like this continued to happen throughout the show. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but upon completion of the show as well as the ova I find it very hard to believe that Miyako, the protagonist, is not a pedophile and/or groomer. There are multiple instances...that deeply concern me, and the lack of some authority figure in the show preventing the creepy gatherings from happening is more concerning. I like to look at anime as being unrealistic, and therefore unrealistic things happen, but I cannot find a reason to defend a grown woman being in love with an elementary school girl, and coercing her into wearing cosplay clothing by making her sweets. This is so fucking creepy on so many levels, and I say that after giving it the benefit of the doubt. The main character's social anxiety, her clothing-making hobby, and whatever else cannot be used as a defense for what goes on in the show. At least the obsessive stalker character is focused on a girl that is her own age. that deeply concern me, and the lack of some authority figure in the show preventing the creepy gatherings from happening is more concerning.

No, absolutely not and any counterargument that bashes this series for that reason should be ignored. In fact, this series has a total of zero scenes that suggest any innuendos, which includes the first episode\'s infamous ""yamate,"" scene, which has no perverted intentions on Miyako\'s part and is a comedic juxtaposition from Hana\'s side. Obviously there are scenes that will make an average viewer raise their eyebrow, but you...have to realize it\'s not intended to be some pedo-yuri garbage, but more about how Miyako\'s actions are not normal and how she may not be aware. I could talk about specific scenes that are polarizing, however, I don\'t want to spoil anything for any new watchers.While this is a slice-of-life with no substantive plot, this entire series deals with the subject of Miyako being a shut-in and her bizarre methods of coping with social anxiety. I love the fact that throughout the whole series, Hinata and her friends are trying their hardest to coax Miyako out of her shell. This isn\'t me trying to provide a stretch to find of a plotline for this series. You definitely don\'t need a thinking cap for this series, but it\'s a little beyond just a typical cute, moe slice of life and provides substance when it branches off in to Miyako\'s social issues.This anime isn\'t perfect by any means, because at the end of the day it\'s still a slice-of-life, however, it makes up with the memorable scenes, lovable characters (Hinata, Kanon and Hana are probably my top three), the great art style, the music, and the overall enjoyment of the series.The only episode that fell short for me in terms of pacing was episode four. My favorite episodes, by far, were five, six, eight and nine. This anime is great in my opinion. Don\'t let the negative reviews deter you from picking this up. It\'s a heartwarming show, just try to look past the half-handed, negative lolicon, woke overtones that critics try to paint this show with. It\'s nothing extravagant, but it\'s a wholesome show that doesn\'t deserve the hate it\'s getting.I\'ll leave it at that. I enjoyed the hell out of this and I hope we get a second term.

UzaMaid focused about how Misha development (the loli). In this anime it focused in Miyako which the lolicon. This make a different approach in story.The story that very light and entertaining. But I think most of you thing, ""Is she lolicon? Why is she not just say or admit it?"". As I said early, this anime focused on Miyako, not the loli(s). To make story continued means need more development, not end to end. So yes it can\'t be that easy to say ""Hey I\'m lesbian lolicon,...marry me please!"" and thanks to not this straight I want to watch another episode to see the development.For art, I think good enough for \'daily live anime\'. But nothing special in the moe-moe. But the art really describe character on this anime. Like Hinata has little fang (make me think she\'s so energetic and easy going), Hana has a flat angelic face (typically mature) but some time can be sparkle (interested with something), and many more.Sound.. well.. I love this kind of anime so I really enjoy lolis sound (please do not call FBI).All of it make me really can enjoy this anime, and that\'s the point of this anime for sure. But this only personal reference. Cuz if you do not like \'every day\' anime, you can\'t enjoy it.

(WATATEN for the friends) is an anime released in 2019 by studio ""Doga Kobo"".This series is the maximum expression of comedy and slice of life that you can look for in animation. Funny, relaxing, MOE and not boring at all, in a nutshell, a home cure for sadness and depression.Story: 8.5Miyako is shy, a NEET, chubby, clumsy and she has no friends. Hana, a friend of her little sister, Hinata, one day finds herself at her home and literally becomes a miracle for our protagonist in suit. Miyako literally falls in love with Hana at first sight and and that...day marks the beginning of her change.The story is a classic Slice of life, so it does not present anything special in terms of narration. It\'s simple, but very enjoyable.Art: 9Doga Kobo is a guarantee in animations. The design is very different from the manga, but literally better and cute. The animations are accurate, the characters\' faces and bodies are well proportioned and an excellent color calibration is used, perfect in this context.Sound: 8Opening and Ending present very melodic,funny and context-appropriate songs.OSTs in general are very well appreciated and enjoyable during the episode.Character: 8+WATATEN presents a wide range of characters. The main characters present very well-characterized and different personalities: Miyako, Hinata, Hana and Noa will succeed in impressing us in the same way, without leaving a character back respect to another.Excellent work also in dubbing, which manages to interpret the characters in an excellent way.Enjoyment: 10As I said earlier, this series is a cure for sadness. The first episode was probably one of the most fun I\'ve ever seen. The other episodes also have a high level of entertainment, going from hilarious moments to some small tear-jerking moments like the last episode. Each character managed to get me a smile and different emotions in the various moments of the episodes and the story, although very simple, has a noticeable impact.Overall: 8.5Wataten is certainly one of the flagship series of the ""Doga Kobo"" studio. A very funny anime, relaxing and without any pretense, but that manages to keep you glued on the screen for all 24 minutes, guaranteeing you different laughs and hilarious moments.Highly recommended for lovers of this genre and of this animation studio. day marks the beginning of her change.The story is a classic Slice of life, so it does not present anything special in terms of narration.

Your typical hikkikomori. That by itself it\'s pretty plain but as the show progresses you can see how by meeting this Hana girl and the rest of the cast she slowly but surely grows up and she becomes... a little bit less awkward.Now then, why I...think it\'s great.In most shows the hikki character is made fun of and it\'s a perv, an idiot, a trash of a human being. There\'s some of that kind of humor here but here it\'s handled completely different. The characters accept Miyako and they understand her in a lot of ways. Ofc they try to take her out of her shell but whether or not they succeed at it it\'s up to debate.Taking from my personal experiences and my own personality I understand Miyako and you should try to do it too.I just love how she\'s treated overall, they don\' force her to come out, she just get little pushes here and there but most of the work is done by Miyako herself.This show isn\'t about ""Let\'s fix the Hikki""or ""let\'s make fun of the hikki"" and more about ""Let\'s have fun with the Hikki"" ""Let\'s love the hikki"". It actually shows you how you can be friends with a person and even tough she\'s weird or whatever she\'s genuinely a great person/character. It\'s just heart-warming most of the time.This show it seems like started a discussion on ""real life"" related subjects but hey, if a show can make us think about serious stuff way after it\'s finished and tackles such complicated subjects in such graceful way I think it deserves some attention.Finally I think it\'s good to remember that this is an anime. It will have a lot of exaggeration but if you look at it it\'s a beautiful story about understanding and... it\'s just plain fun you know. I didn\'t feel like they forced the humor or the romance or any of the subjects, everything was handled pretty smoothly.So, get yourself confortable and keep an open mind. Give it a watch, I bet there will be something you will find enjoyable.==========================================================================Now for everybody\'s favorite subject. Pedophilia. This is a personal opinion or whatever so be warned (is not like ppl ain\'t throwing opinions here). If you don\'t want to read this is ok, that\'s why I separated this from the rest of the text but I\'d like you to give it a read since I feel like it\'s closely related to the plot of the whole series and the several subjects it tackles.So, she\'s like 10 years older than Hana-chan but I think we are forgetting something, we are not her. Most of us will never understand her situation and we should at least try to understand not just her, any person in her situation (Hikkikomori).What if you haven\'t got any friends at all until you are 18-20yrs old? Is not like ppl just threw you away and you grew resented to the world, no, you just can\'t fit in and up to a certain point you don\'t really want to fit in. Then, someday you meet somebody who makes you feel all weird and tingly?Is not like ""she\'s a pervert and a pedophile"" is more like she doesn\'t know what life or love is.Seriously, when you get to feel that weird sensation called love a lot of times, even as adults, we have no idea what to do with that feeling, it just hits you hard like a truck and you have zero control of what it will trigger it.An older person perhaps? a childhood friend, a little girl, somebody the same sex, it doesn\'t matter.Shall we seriously hate on somebody just because it feels like that? No.Most importantly, she does nothing that would hurt anybody, not even the little girl she fell in love with and she does acknowledge there must be something wrong with her, she does suffer from her own feelings.Sure. she\'s a little creppy sometimes but we get to see that she tries her best to go against it.Now, let\'s suppose they indeed fall in love with each other and they want to be together, well it\'s Illegal for sure but I\'d argue that if they manage to stay together until Hana turns 18 and they can legally marry everything will be ok and besides, 8 or more years of Miyako waiting and both of them still feeling in love with each other after the teenage years is something you don\'t see anywhere.A lot of ppl would feel disgusted by the mere tought of this idea but... Miyako is such a good girl... I wouldn\'t mind somebody like her to be around my daughter cuz I\'m sure she will treat her better than anyone else.I\'m not an expert on this or relationships, I am pretty awkard myself and I\'m not the best when it comes to ""love"" stuff but if two beings find each other, fall in love and treat each other with love and respect, who I am to judge?I know this is a touchy subject and I am aware that there\'s a lot of crime with this out there but I dunno, I can\'t just think all of the pedophiles are the same and they are all monsters. I feel like a lot of them are just misunderstood and have to live their whole lives feeling like trash, having to hide and being demonized by all parts of society. Maybe is it because they never found anything close to love with the people around them and when it finally comes it isn\'t fair to just take it away from them. Or maybe they are just confused, again, is not like they choose to feel like that.Some of these ppl can\'t cope with society and just like Miyako here they found out that being friends with kids just comes naturally, most of the time they won\'t judge you.I\'ve work with children myself a few years and I can say without a doubt that children for the most part don\'t want to destroy you cuz you are different, they will try to understand you first and after that they will either accept you or just move on, they have no need to stay and mock you.We as adults tend to judge everything and we try to destroy the things we don\'t like and are different.I feel like, way before we judge somebody, we must first try and remove the hate or anger we might have on our hearts, give a step back and try to understand the situation and most importantly the ppl involved in it.It\'s just an anime people, a work of fiction, there\'s no need to get angry and start throwing hate around, it\'s an opportunity to think about the subject and since a lot of times we grow attached to these characters this brings us a completely different point of view than any psychology or news report. think it\'s great.In most shows the hikki character is made fun of and it\'s a perv, an idiot, a trash of a human being.

Instead they captured the naivety of primary school kids and make the experience comfortable.Like the title suggest, this anime is about how the kids, like angels, ""descend"" around Miyako, a university student with social disorder. With the help of Hinata, Hana and Noa, Miyako\'s life brightened and coloured, filled with the love of kids.It\'s arguable whether this show is a trashy fantasy show for otakus to dream that their weird acts can be accepted by the surroundings (especially the lolis living nearby). Well,...yes it is. But Miyako paid something to get friendship from the kids. Miyako cooks snacks for Hana, who likes snacks; Miyako plays with Hinata, who likes Miyako; Miyako makes clothes for Noa (although she mainly made that for Hana), who likes herself\'s cuteness (I agree that she is cute). While Miyako\'s lewdness towards Hana can be disturbing, it is also this lewdness that triggers Miyako to move forward and leave her comfort zone. Moreover, the kids also form interesting relationships with each other. Ah, that Yuru Yuri vibe.Anyways, this is the anime if you want to forget how miserable your single lonely life is.

Uzamaid and Wataten, both remarkably similar in concept, and yet are both miracles nonetheless. Join me in prayer, my brethren, as we thank the Gods for this bounty, delivered upon us by Angels.Bless us, O Doga Kobo, and these, Thy anime, which we are about to receive from Thy weekly televised screenings. Through Yurihime, our Lord. Amen.Wataten is at its core a healing yuri comedy. What truly makes it stand out are its characters. Characters are likable and have actual development without coming across as one-dimensional. They have depth and...chemistry with one another. You could bundle any two characters together and have a good time watching them work on each other's characteristics and relationships. It's good stuff. Everyone is just so cute and adorable. The innocence of childhood is portrayed exceptionally well in this, and at times it makes you long for the days of your own childhood. Indeed, it is a band-aid for the hole inside one's heart. (Though tragically a band-aid is not a permanent remedy for the hole in your heart).Like with Uzamaid, the series really kicks into high gear with the introduction of the psycho-lesbian-stalker-pervert-yandere around the halfway point of the series. This new character shakeup is exactly what keeps both series so engaging and fresh even after the halfway point. The recontextualization of some prior scenes as well as the addition of another chaotic element into the mix of character interactions is very much welcomed in this show.What I appreciate about Doga Kobo's adaptations is how they sometimes take liberties with the source material they are adapting. This in turn allows for better pacing and allows the show to progress more naturally than if it had adapted the manga more strictly. (The original was a pretty short 4koma series after all.). To put things into perspective, the finale of the series essentially turns what was originally a single-panel page into an incredible 15-minute long musical masterpiece. The musical alone had moved me emotionally moreso than the entirety of Manaria Friends. That's a testament to the excellent direction and composition of the adaptation.The show is just very easy on the eyes. The manga's slightly pointy character designs got chubbier and rounder designs, with the soft color palette compounding the relaxing atmosphere of the whole show. While the background OST isn't too great or memorable (it's the standard Doga Kobo comedy track you've grown accustomed to all these years ever since Yuru Yuri), it works and doesn't get in the way too often.Consistently funny, yet poignant at times, Wataten truly is a blessing upon us by the Angels above.We give Thee thanks, Almighty Goda Kobo, for all thy anime, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

The innocence of childhood is portrayed exceptionally well in this, and at times it makes you long for the days of your own childhood. Indeed, it is a band-aid for the hole inside one's heart. (Though tragically a band-aid is not a permanent remedy for the hole in your heart).Like with Uzamaid, the series really kicks into high gear with the introduction of the psycho-lesbian-stalker-pervert-yandere around the halfway point of the series. This new character shakeup is exactly what keeps both series so engaging and fresh even after the halfway point. The recontextualization of some prior scenes as well as the addition of another chaotic element into the mix of character interactions is very much welcomed in this show.What I appreciate about Doga Kobo's adaptations is how they sometimes take liberties with the source material they are adapting. This in turn allows for better pacing and allows the show to progress more naturally than if it had adapted the manga more strictly. (The original was a pretty short 4koma series after all.). To put things into perspective, the finale of the series essentially turns what was originally a single-panel page into an incredible 15-minute long musical masterpiece. The musical alone had moved me emotionally moreso than the entirety of Manaria Friends. That's a testament to the excellent direction and composition of the adaptation.The show is just very easy on the eyes. The manga's slightly pointy character designs got chubbier and rounder designs, with the soft color palette compounding the relaxing atmosphere of the whole show. While the background OST isn't too great or memorable (it's the standard Doga Kobo comedy track you've grown accustomed to all these years ever since Yuru Yuri), it works and doesn't get in the way too often.Consistently funny, yet poignant at times, Wataten truly is a blessing upon us by the Angels above.We give Thee thanks, Almighty Goda Kobo, for all thy anime, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

So before the FBI nabs me, let me explain why this show is worth the risk.This is the type of story that is a taboo no matter where you go. It’s a challenge to get people to invest their time in a show where the main selling point is adult women being attracted to lolis. Yet the story never makes it overly creepy. Instead it’s actually pretty funny. The good kind of comedy to where you don’t feel bad about it. The story itself...can be summed up as cute girls doing cute things but the way it’s handled works out. The characters especially the older one has some cringe moments but the funny moments come in fast enough that we ignore it. The rest of the cast is just that cute girls doing cute things. The art and animation is what needs to be mentioned. Usually moe blob doesn’t do it for me but the art is the perfect way to offset the subject material. Sound is alright. Has that cutesy vibe to it. So overall don’t feel bad about watching this. Yes the premise sounds creepy, but in reality it’s pretty funny and worth a watch. can be summed up as cute girls doing cute things but the way it’s handled works out.

People only overlook this alarming facet due to the disarmingly ‘kawaii’ aesthetic the show exudes. The basic premise is that a disturbed young adult develops an unhinged attraction to her toddler little sister’s friend. It’s played for laughs when the situation is anything but. Miyako gives off the energy of someone who would be part of the deranged MAPS community.

More often than not, the first episode in any anime does not always represent what you will be getting for the rest of the show. In recent years, anime studios would have the idea of making the first episode the most eye-catching or batshit crazy one of the rest. Then the rest of the episodes come off tepid or dull compared to the first one. Watashi...ni Tenshi ga Maiorita, shortened as WATATEN, fits as an example of this, although from a different result. It gets more fun and enjoyable from beginning to end.One word to describe WATATEN is adorable. Seriously, if you don’t like moe or cuteness in anime and are one of those that think it is a blight to anime as an art form, this would be their antichrist. This is one of the most cutesy, moe anime shows I have seen in a long, long time. Not just from the character design perspective, but the voice acting in the episodic stories. There were moments when I would go crazy from the cuteness displayed by all the cute little girls. So this is just a fair warning for those who may not be prepared for something like this. Then again, look at the poster, and you can probably already guess what is in store here.In the first episode, we are introduced to the main heroine, Miyako, or Mya-nee. She is introduced as someone infatuated with one of her little sister’s friends, Hana-chan. Many have interpreted Mya-nee to be a pedophile based on how she shows her affection from the first episode. That episode is probably the most “creepy” interaction Mya-nee shows in the entire series. Again, this is sort of a thing with many writers these days to make the first episode absurd and crazy to entice people to keep watching. However, as WATATEN goes on, Mya-nee’s antics do not go far into pedo territory as it comes off more as that adult that can’t help but love how cute a child is and would want to protect it. Wanting to dress Hana-chan in cute cosplay clothes makes Mya-nee have a hilarious charm to her that never struck me as creepy. Maybe it’s the fact that the show has a shoujo-ai tag to it that might throw some people off, but it never comes across as too lovey-dovey like other anime of that genre.Mya-nee herself gets better as a character that is adorable and hilarious to see in what she does and says to the girls. We learn more about her as a character, making her less two-dimensional than what you would expect of a protagonist in these types of anime. The interactions with her little sister, Hinata-chan, are hysterical, and a few of them almost feel real to how I know some friends with little sisters interact. What gives Mya-nee her adorable charm is Reina Ueda's performance as her. She sells this character from her frantic embarrassed voice and how wacky she inflects her voice whenever Mya-nee goes crazy.The rest of the girls that make up the quintessential cuties (Hinata, Hana, Noa, Kanon, Koyori) all have their unique personalities that brighten up the show. Hinata is the energetic little sister that you both love and hate if you were her sibling, just like every other little sister. Hana is Hinata's best friend that Miya-nee loves unconditionally of how cute she is. Her calm/stoic demeanor does change ever so slightly when she sees something sweet or eats pudding; that way, she won’t seem like a one-note character. Nao is the funny, energetic blonde child who always gets perturbed whenever Miya-nee doesn’t think she is the cutest, resulting in hilarious moments. Kanon and Koyori do have their moments, but they barely get enough screentime for me to remember much about them. That is not to say they are bad; they just could’ve added more scenes with them, including garnering any memorable ones, unlike the previous three.Many people compare this to UzaMaid because another little girl character is in a platonic onee-chan relationship with the female protagonist. However, unlike that anime, WATATEN does not feel as tedious with its jokes about Mya-nee being all lovey-dovey with Hana-chan. They don’t just involve one girl to another but preferably multiple ones. On top of that, they aren’t just the same joke pulled repeatedly from every episode. Each episode goes into different scenarios where all the girls go through a different situation and don’t feel tact on. The cuteness factor only goes up all the way through, which made me feel giddy with anticipation every time I start an episode.With a studio like Doga Koba, you know you will be into a visual treat of cute goodness with titles like Himouto-chan, New Game, and Gabriel DropOut under their belt. While WATATEN does not stand too far off from its comfort zone, its art style has a pastel color scheme to the backgrounds and the character designs that give it its distinctive look. Unlike the previous anime I’ve mentioned, WATATEN‘s designs look more fluid and less conservative in the line drawings. It makes everything look a little elegant. The OPs and EDs fit the anime perfectly with its lively singing in your usual cutesy tone. However, they’re nothing too substantial for me to download on my PC, unfortunatelyThis anime was the season’s palate cleanser. In other words, something that you can watch without thinking too hard about it. If I were to make a comparison, it would be Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka. Something to make your heart warm and fuzzy, nothing else. We all need at least one or two in every anime season and hope they are good at their craft. Maybe not another one where there might be contention to debate whether the protagonist might be a pedo.

This review will cover up why I think it's a good piece to give it a shot, and of course, all of this without any major spoilers.Story: 7The story is about an university student called Miyako Hoshino who can't communicate, or rather, can't properly socialize with other people. She tends to spend most of their time home, making customes for cosplay (tho she doesn't put them on... on public). One day, her little sister, Hinata Hoshino, brings a college friend to her house,...that one being Hana Shirosaki. When Miyako made eye contact with her, the first thought that came to her mind was that 'she was an angel that flew down to her'.Now, back to my point, the story is rather simple. From their encounter, Miyako tries to be Hana's friend, even if she lacks the social skills to do so. As each episode comes, new people come into the cast -and Miyako also evolves as a character. Besides that, the flow of the show focus on the daily life of both Miyako and her new friends. In short: it's just a fluffy slice of life, and what makes it good are mostly the characters, artstyle (which both will be covered soon) and the MC evolution from a basically weeb who doesn't come out of her house to a more open character.Art: 7Artstyle is just decent. It goes for the simple shapes and proportions rather than the realism, and the animation is pretty good sometimes (to put an example without spoilers, let me just say this words: loli bang, it's all I needed to see). It has some flaws at times, like the proportions being a bit inaccurate compared to other characters, mostly seen in the special episode. However, and for the most part, it's quite enjoyable.Sound: 6Leaving aside opening and ending, the only time where I liked a music track was the final episode, and I think this is a problem right here. While I'm not one person who focus solely on the OST, the fact that no other background music made an impact is a bit worrying. On the other hand, the voice acting I find it pretty fitting. The children voices aren't that much high pitched as you could expect from these kind of anime, so I give it its deserved props. Miyako's 'creep' scenes are also pretty well made, as well as many other characters with their personalities.Characters: 8Each character has its unique aura, but most of them, not including adults, has something in common: they act like children. They are mostly innocent souls that doesn't understand some of the creepy Miyako vibes -without, of course, a few exceptions. This is why I consider it's worth giving it a try, as this 'innocent' theme gives the show more wholesomeness.Enjoyment: 8As someone who doesn't have the time to properly watch anime and also has to deal with real life stuff, I found WataTen very entertaining. While the cough pedophile connotations are present in some parts, it's not that much and it's rather funny than disturbing.Overall: 7TL;DR: WataTen is a fluffy slice of life anime that I would recommend to anyone having a rough time on its life. It shouldn't be overlooked by its first episode, as the MC progress on 'meeting new people' will truly make up for the first impressions. that one being Hana Shirosaki.

Can you even imagine the same story, if she was a guy?It all started with some innocent ""ah, my heart beats so fast when I see Hana"" - and ok, I can live with it. Love is blind, but keep it to yourself.But no, then it escalates into ""I want to touch her"", ""I want to dress her up"", ""I want to take a picture of her underskirt""... wait... what?The only thing I can say in defense of this anime is - the author knows how creepy it is. There are constantly situations when the viewer is reminded of it.And so, Hana... (spoilers, you can skip to the next paragraph if you don\'t want any at all)Hana is a smart girl. She actually fights Miyako\'s attempts, slaps Miyako when she tries to touch her, even wanted to call the police at one point. And after the first interaction, she even didn\'t want to come back to the house with this ""creepy lady"" (her words).But that is of course until Miyako promised to give her sweets, after which Hana decided to allow her to do anything with her... like... seriously... how is this cute? This is creepy as f...Fine. Enough about this. Let\'s actually talk about something good. And don\'t get me wrong, there\'s a lot this anime does right. It\'s not nearly as bad as, say Boku no Pico which, to be fair, had a VERY similar premise.I really loved the way Wataten looks. It\'s stylized to look like it was hand drawn. The pastel colors are beautiful. The character design is really-really cute. And the animation itself is pleasingly smooth. It is probably one of the prettiest anime I\'ve seen this year.The music... was there. I\'ll admit, I didn\'t pay attention to it, it was just a background. I only remembered that it existed when it stopped playing for comedic effect. So at the very least it wasn\'t annoying or distracting. Just not something to stand out.The ending was really fun though. Not my type of music, but I loved the video. A cute dance by cute characters? Yes, please! Always.I\'m also pleasantly surprised by the voices (original). The actresses were, for the most part, fairly unknown. Hana was even the first role for the girl that voiced her. And she was great. None of them were bad. They were all charismatic and sounded good both when they talked and when they had to sing. Great job.Now, all the pedophilia, and thus, Miyako, aside, every other character is insanely cute.Although, I also can relate to Miyako a bit. I also hate when consultants in the stores talk to me -_-And again, to Miyako\'s defense - Hana is indeed amazing. Her deadpan face, calculating mind and realistic view of the world always made me happy.Hinata is charmingly obsessed with her sister. She\'s energetic, brave, generous. And she is a very big liar, but even this is cute, because she believes her lies herself. Plus, girls with fangs are always cute. In anime that is. In real life it\'s just gross. Still, Hinata is awesome.If there is a reincarnation, in the next life I want to be born as Noa. Aside from the moments when Hana and Miyako give her existential crisis, she is the most happy, positive, resilient and of course, cute person. You could mistake her for being self-centered and narcissistic, but surprisingly, she\'s probably the most reliable and selfless character in this show. She saved Miyako countless times. I love her.Yori and Kanon - OTP. Now THAT\'S an adorable relationship. I love that Kanon never lies when she says that she relies on Yori. She doesn\'t just say it to humor her, she really thinks that. This is the relationship I actually want to see evolve.Matsumoto is a fantastic karma, since she makes Miyako feel as uncomfortable, as Hana feels about Miyako. But other than that, she\'s also terrifying.The story is... kinda non-existent. It\'s a slice of life comedy, what do you expect? The comedy part is pretty good though. There were quite a few times when I was laughing out loud.And ignoring Miyako\'s creepiness, everything in this anime is very cute and relaxing. Every other relationship is adorable. And when Miyako dials down her creepiness, even her relationship with Hana doesn\'t look THAT bad. But you really have to try hard to ignore how disturbing it is.In conclusion:This is a very light, positive and beautiful anime. So overall, it\'s a decent recommendation if you want to relax and watch something cute. Of course, if you can ignore the pedophilia part.The last episode had a fantastic first half of it. Even if you don\'t want to watch everything else, I can at least recommend you watch that part - you don\'t need context and it is a great, albeit a little cliche, story. - A 19 y.o. girl trying to get under a 10 y.o child\'s skirtIn-depth:Why, anime? Why do you have to be like... this...Wataten is an anime about a 19 year old antisocial girl, Miyako, falling in love with her sister\'s friend, Hana. She begins, like any hikki, to awkwardly hit on her. Become friends, occasionally touch her etc. It\'s mostly very innocent, gentle, made in cute pastel colors - everything for a viewer to feel good. And it would be a nice story, except for one fact.Hana is 10 years old.Suddenly, it\'s not cute, it\'s ""WTF?

If your looking for anime that has cute and funny moments then this one is just for you.Second thing is the art. That is what made me watch it. I really do like this art style. I don't find a flaw with the art. The art style made all the characters look adorable and made the scenery look beautiful.I would give this anime a 7/10 "", 'This is a weird series, not due to its ""Uzamaid"" style concept, but in its execution of its concept. To put it bluntly, very early on there\'s some heavy lolicon bait and huge implications that the main protagonist is into kids. This direction is dropped later on and the show gets reworked into a cute girls doing cute things show where one of the girls happens to just be a kind of NEET older sister.Story 4/10:So little sister brings friend home one day and cosplay outfit making NEET older sister gets infatuated with her cuteness and wants to make her wear the outfits she makes....She lures her in with sweets and gets a squirmy feeling in her chest whenever the child is too close or too nice to her. A shift in theme later happens that kind of confuses me as to who the target audience for this series was, as the relationship between the MC and child takes a back seat and it turns into a series about kids helping the protagonist deal with her social anxiety and mature a little bit.Art 7/10:Always consistent art from this studio. Character designs generally uninspired but there are a lot of great animation sequences mostly around the little sister character.Sound 6/10:Literally the only reason sound is getting a 6/10 for me is because of the ""Mya-nee"" sound byte that it will drill into your head throughout the series. The only adjective these girls know is ""cute"". The music is nothing memorable.Character 6/10:The MC is kind of not all there. She\'s into this kid, she\'s manipulative, she\'s lazy, and she tries her best not to leave the house because she can\'t handle having a normal conversation without fumbling over her words. She\'s only redeemed in the eyes of the child protagonists because she is really talented at making sweets. Top tier waifu /sThe child protagonist kind of plays the straight man to all the other characters, is generally either stoic or creeped out, but has moments where she\'s really perceptive and can read the situation well.The little sister is the best character in the series. She loves her family to the ends of the earth and in her eyes her older sister is the brightest, coolest, most special person in the world and can not be swayed otherwise.Lastly, the character that rounds out the main cast just happens to be their neighbor that has the goal of being the cutest she can be. She\'s the social butterfly, the big dreamer, and she has every intention to let you know that.Enjoyment 5/10:Overall 6/10:This series is just okay. It takes the cute girls doing cute things concept and tosses in a taboo almost as bait (which I assume was used mainly to get people talking about it when it aired), this taboo and the themes it presents never go anywhere and towards the end of the series is just left as a loose thread for a cast of otherwise interesting characters.

I heard about this show back when it released and I never planned on watching it till I heard from word of mouth, just how awful and ""pedo-like"" it is. Which is why I wanted to watch it. To see if it\'s a similar situation to how twitter reacted to Uzaki-Chan or something. But before we go...into the problems. Lets address it\'s strong points. Which it has a few.The art style is absolutely great. Combining that with the smooth animation gives the viewer a very colorful and soft picture. I love it. I rarely see animation in anime to be as smooth as it has been with this show. It likes the difference between 30fps to 60. It\'s night and day. Odd to see from a show like this. Onto the story. The concept I don\'t think is bad. It falls in line with being a cutesy SOL. (I know haha laugh at me for talking about a slice of life story.) I got Yuru Yuri vibes, ""kinda,"" from the plot and the characters which is a compliment since I found Yuru Yuri to be really good. It does land into the space of being a moe show.However, we can\'t go on any further discussing this show until we address the elephant in the room... Hoshino, Miyako. To summarize her character, she\'s the older sister of Hinata and basically is the main character. As the description of the show says, she is absolutely socially inept and can\'t even say a single word to ANYBODY without stuttering or straight up shutting down. Through various encounters Hinatas friends show up and they all start hanging out. Basic stuff. But MAN. Miyakos character is a massive problem. You\'re telling me, she can\'t go up to the fucking McDonalds cashier and ask for no pickles on her burger, yet she can literally splooge in her pants in front of these elementary schoolers all day. She tries to get the group of children to wear the clothes she makes (primarily dresses or maid outfits, that kinda stuff) and look up their skirts, WITH A CAMERA. One of the girls even gets disgusted with her behavior and is like ""Yo... Can you please not do this in front of us?"" AND WHAT DOES MIYAKO DO??? Bribe them with sweets... and it works... There was a scene where a police officer even stops her because she\'s hiding in the shadows just taking screenshot after screenshot of these girls without their knowledge or consent. Another scene, one of the girls gets scared during a sleepover and asks her to walk her to the restroom and she even OFFERS TO FUCKING HELP HER IN THE BATHROOM WHILE SQUIRMING HER FINGERS.Miyako has a lot to her character if you push her weird fascination with kids out of the way. She\'s a very reliable person and when she puts her mind to it. She can actually do something useful for her friends and family. There are actually parts in the show where you can see her becoming more comfortable with showing who she is and I acknowledge that. I wanted to like Miyako because I feel like she COULD be a good character if every second of the show wasn\'t her fantasizing how to get jiggy with these girls.Brushing that aside, the slice of life genre can actually be a really interesting theme for an anime when done correctly. Examples of this being K-on (though I didn\'t personally enjoy it too much), Gabriel Dropout, and Gakkougurashi. Some of the many things I\'m tired of hearing is the ""BRO DID THE GROCERY STORE ARC HIT DIFFERENT????"" or the ""HAHA 12 EPISODES OF THEM DOING FUCKING NOTHING SLICE OF LIFE IS BORING GO WATCH THIS BASIC ASS SEASONAL SHOUNEN THAT\'LL ONLY BE AROUND FOR 2 SEASONS MAX."" Like most genres, as long as you can make it entertaining and have it fit the genre it\'s suppose to be, then it should be alright. Sadly, this show seems to run out of ideas a lot. It\'s repetitive at best and annoying at worst. I understand they\'re just kids so they don\'t have the means of doing a One Piece type adventure and it\'s suppose to be a ""feel good"" show. But I don\'t think that should deflect criticism. To be frank, I\'m bothered at how most of the episodes just revolve around them eating and dressing up for Miyakos fetish sessions.I don\'t know about this show. I know I compared it to Yuru Yuri, but EVEN THEN. I don\'t think most people who do enjoy SOL or cute girls doing cute things would like this too much. I rated it a 3 but if they just didn\'t make Miyako who she is, then I would give this a solid 6 maybe a light 7. into the problems. Lets address it\'s strong points.

I\'ve seen a few reviews under this show saying to avoid it, because it\'s like, ""Creepy Degenerate Media."" Or something. And I think that\'s kind of pointless, considering the fact that anyone who actively wants to watch this show is, more likely than not, watching it for that reason alone, and I don\'t think weird transgressive media shouldn\'t exist because people find it unsettling.Anyway...I think Wataten is an incredibly cute slice of life anime, that fans of yuri might get a lot out of (Yuri might be...a stretch, since a lot of people who watched this show don\'t really think Miyako\'s crush on Hana-chan is Like That, but if you watch it, it\'s so blatantly obvious that I don\'t know what else to call it.)Now, there isn\'t really any over-arching story, nor does the """"""Romance?"""""" really progress past a one-sided obsession, so don\'t go into it expecting Miyako and Hana to like, kiss or get married or whatever, or else you\'ll be a bit disappointed. The premise of this show is that Miyako is a total freak and Hana is mostly only in it for material gain (Candy, Sweets, Etc.)However, there *are* scenes that give you a little more on the side of affection where they grow just a *little* closer that make you blush and giggle.Now besides that aspect of the show, the rest of the girls have distinct personalities that make the scenes where they\'re all together pretty cute and engaging to watch- especially the relationship they all have towards Miyako.Wataten is pretty easy to watch and get through in a couple days if you take it easy. It\'s not difficult to parse, on account of being a Moe Slice Of Life Anime a-la Lucky Star. For that same reason, it\'s not particularly revolutionary or like, a masterpiece... but for what it is, I think it\'s worth a watch if you enjoy cute girls being cute girls and you don\'t have any reservations when it comes to somewhat ""Problematic"" media. a stretch, since a lot of people who watched this show don\'t really think Miyako\'s crush on Hana-chan is Like That, but if you watch it, it\'s so blatantly obvious that I don\'t know what else to call it.)Now, there isn\'t really any over-arching story, nor does the """"""Romance?"""""" really progress past a one-sided obsession, so don\'t go into it expecting Miyako and Hana to like, kiss or get married or whatever, or else you\'ll be a bit disappointed.

I mean, it's fiction right? No one is actually being this creepy, and I don't really think anyone is going to become a pedophile after watching a show like this, so it's ok in my book. If it was real life, I would have a problem with it, but it's not. I've also watched uzamaid, but that show was worse in the pedophile department and I did have a few problems with how the characters acted. That said, I liked that show too, but not...as much as this one. This show starts out pretty creepy (as in lesbian pedophile creepy), but then the more you watch the less creepy and the more wholesome it becomes. It's really cute, one of the more cute moe shows that I've watched, it's decently funny, the animation is surprisingly good, and I really enjoyed it.

She’s the younger sister of Miyako and loves her sister a lot! Ironically, Hinata is quite different from Miyako. Hinata is easygoing, sociable and fun while Miyako is a NEET, a shut-in and is extremely anti-social. It’s extremely cute to see these two ‘opposite’ sisters love each other so much and get along so well helping each other overcome their flaws at times too!When I think about Hinata and Miyako it’s just so adorable and lovely!Hinata is a cute little girl with orange hair, similar to Miyako with a very cute face and an even cuter voice, good job Uede Reina for the absolutely amazing kawaii voice acting!I have to say, all the Seiyuu in this anime were really cute and managed to build and maintain a certain aura around their characters to make their characters more relatable and loveable! It’s awesome to be able to relate to the characters coming from the universe of Wataten to be honest! The characters in Wataten are literally the cutest characteristics anyone can think of all added into one anime!Hana, one of Hinata’s closest friends and the girl that might caused many misconceptions of Miyako’s true nature. Hana is an extremely adorable yet mature girl. Hana has this mature, self-composed, proud and straightforward characteristic all added into a young cute little girl. She’s like an innocent mature child and is so precious!The relationship between Miyako and Hana is cute and all but somehow it feels wrong on so many levels, it brings in a lot of cringe moments but somehow for me I enjoyed it a lot!I mean, a University female student getting ‘weird’ feelings and emotions towards an elementary schoolgirl is just not that right...Same-gender love but with large age gaps isn’t very ‘right’However, I still enjoyed Miyako getting flustered by the many years younger, Hana. It’s adorable yet weird but it doesn’t matter as long as it’s cute!Miyako is an introvert and a complete shut-in. It’s hilarious to watch Miyako’s interactions with everyone especially her Mother whom disapproves of many of her actions and knows her daughter very well!The entire anime is just super cute, it took a nice, well-paced episodic approach introducing new characters slowly and steadily! The ending (last episode) was just so heartwarming and satisfying as well! Each episode has at least one funny scene to get you to burst out laughing or smile as well which is great!Overall I’d give an 8/10 Mya-Nees for this anime and a huge recommendation for those that want a light, comedic and satisfying anime to watch!P.S the only male in the entire anime is Higero.Take note that this review may be outdated. Always check my profile for my latest rating, I may have changed my rating due to various reasons. is the older sister of Hinata-chan and everyone calls Miyako by her alias ‘Mya’ which is extremely adorable!Hinata calls Miyako, Mya-nee and that is pure blessing to my ears, Hinata is a cute little girl with a tom-boyish attitude but still has feminine traits which is just super cute!

The characters in Wataten are literally the cutest characteristics anyone can think of all added into one anime!Hana, one of Hinata’s closest friends and the girl that might caused many misconceptions of Miyako’s true nature. Hana is an extremely adorable yet mature girl. Hana has this mature, self-composed, proud and straightforward characteristic all added into a young cute little girl. She’s like an innocent mature child and is so precious!The relationship between Miyako and Hana is cute and all but somehow it feels wrong on so many levels, it brings in a lot of cringe moments but somehow for me I enjoyed it a lot!I mean, a University female student getting ‘weird’ feelings and emotions towards an elementary schoolgirl is just not that right...Same-gender love but with large age gaps isn’t very ‘right’However, I still enjoyed Miyako getting flustered by the many years younger, Hana. It’s adorable yet weird but it doesn’t matter as long as it’s cute!Miyako is an introvert and a complete shut-in. It’s hilarious to watch Miyako’s interactions with everyone especially her Mother whom disapproves of many of her actions and knows her daughter very well!The entire anime is just super cute, it took a nice, well-paced episodic approach introducing new characters slowly and steadily! The ending (last episode) was just so heartwarming and satisfying as well! Each episode has at least one funny scene to get you to burst out laughing or smile as well which is great!Overall I’d give an 8/10 Mya-Nees for this anime and a huge recommendation for those that want a light, comedic and satisfying anime to watch!P.S the only male in the entire anime is Higero.Take note that this review may be outdated. Always check my profile for my latest rating, I may have changed my rating due to various reasons.', ""Honestly I don't know what the appeal to this show is at all. I usually don't mind cute girls doing cute stuff if you seen some of my watchlist but this was just hard to watch. I was trying to find a reason not to drop it so I gave it a few more episodes but I just couldn't find anything about it that makes me want to know what happen next.I'm not even gonna talk about if she's a pedophile or not, because that wasn't the reason I dropped it. I just found the characters... or I should say lack of characters. There's...really nothing to like about the characters, they just come off as annoying and I don't think I can sit and deal with that for 13 episodes. Episode 1 right away was horrible and it didn't go anywhere from there.How this has such a high rating? I honestly don't know what to say and hate me all you want for this review but I think apart from just the cute character design, there's nothing cute about this at all. I only even gave it a watch because it was recommended and it had a good score but boy I was disappointed. really nothing to like about the characters, they just come off as annoying and I don't think I can sit and deal with that for 13 episodes.

For most of the anime community, it seems like this anime is either complete utter trash or some god tier shoujo ai-easque, slice of life. It is in fact neither, simply due to one reason, opinions. Because of the widespread use of the internet and access to so much information at your fingertips, people\'s minds run wild and send people on polar opposites of the spectrum and make them unable to objectively look at an idea without misconstruing it. Maybe I have too much faith in the better of people, maybe I don\'t want...to acknowledge the stupidity of today\'s society. Whatever it is doesn\'t matter, all you need to know is that this anime is enjoyable and worth a watch with a light heart.Wataten plays heavily on specific tropes, but it really brings the characters to life beyond their tropes to have some great anime humor. It\'s enjoyable to watch because there are really cute moments alongside really stupidly funny moments. It makes you feel really comfy inside watching the girls interact and watching Miyako grow into a better person outside of her comfort zone. It makes you giggle over nonsense because you get to watch a complete social dunce trying to interact with other people, only to spectacularly fail.Story: 5/10The story is styled in your typical slice of life anime, you get to live alongside multiple events in the main characters\' life. There\'s no grand plot, it is nice and simple. But this isn\'t a good thing though, and it has some big flaws. This style of writing often leads to a loss of interest over time, because there is no goal you are working towards. Another problem is that it hurts character development because it often including small time skipping to reach the next subplot.Art: 8/10The art is done wonderfully, and there are really no problems. The change of art style for different emotions really brings the characters to light to show what they are thinking. This silliness of this really is the highlight of the anime, as it really feels like you are alongside the characters in their antics.Sound: 8/10I think this is also another high point for the anime. The VAs really helps the characters come to life and they each are really fitting. They do extremely well portraying emotion in their voice alone. Both the opening and ending are highly enjoyable for such a silly anime, its really brings fun into the anime without being a big part. Especially the opening, it just makes you want to get up and jam.Character: 7/10While significantly better than the story, it\'s nothing worth writing home about. This is mainly due to the grounded nature of the anime. It is simple and doesn\'t try anything spectacular, so its characters will only go so far. They develop well over the anime, and your really get to see significant growth in all of the MCs which is rare for a slice of life anime. At the end of the day you can\'t help but smile at the end result of the anime, despite having no real conclusion. Each character becomes something special despite starting heavily on a trope, and that alone is commendable.Enjoyment: 7/10I don\'t love this anime, but I don\'t hate it. For what it is, its great. It\'s well worth a watch just for fun. I had plenty of laughs and enjoyed the fuzziness of all the cute innocence of Hinata especially.Overall: 7.0/10You can\'t be too serious with this anime, but you can\'t drop your standards so low that its suddenly a ""9/10 amazing anime"" either. It\'s simply, and its entertaining. And that\'s all that really matters really.Anyone ranting that Miyako is a true lolicon are the real perverts because the entire joke is that Miyako is an awkward mess for most of the anime. If they think Miyako is a lolicon, that is because they are letting their mind run wild, and that alone tells your what their thoughts are filled of. The line is very clearly drawn by the writer, Miyako doesn\'t attempt anything perverted in the slight. Any innuendos are there as a joke, and if you can\'t pick up on that then you shouldn\'t be watching this. It is bright as day, and yet so many people rant about this ""lesbian pedophile.""

In fact, Koko Mtsumoto is the real big pervert but no one seems to bat an eye at her.', ""Wataten accomplishes its goal of a funny, slice of life anime but its so called gimmick within this ever increasing genre of cute girls doing cute things (cgdct) is where I find the show struggles the most.The story involves the protagonist Miyako as she falls in love with a friend her little sister, Hinata, brings home named Hana. The comedic situations within the show are very well done and I had a few moments of laughing fits throughout the show. The comedy is pretty typical for this genre so don't expect anything out of the norm but its pretty good within the confines these shows...have set for themselves. I did find myself rather bored with some of the situations the characters got throw into as it felt like instead of playing to the show's strengths in its character relationships, it just hit the typical cgdct story beats (character gets sick, movie date, cultural festival, etc.). However, when the situations do work, the episode where they are in the mall for example, the show really shines in its effectiveness. It fully delivers on the cute factor as well you want from this sort of show and really emphasizes the cuteness from the main cast of girls. Then, there is the gimmick with the show that I unfortunately have many problems with. The show is not formatted to work with this lewd theme they are going for so the few scenes with Miyako and Hinata where some love progression could be made comes off as incredibly awkward for more reasons than just the age gap. The show does have effective comedy and cute factor, exactly what this show is going for, but struggles whenever it goes off the course into typical cgdct story beats or trying to use its gimmick effectively.The art in the show I think is generally one of the strong points of the show with no huge complaints outside of three: background art, some character design issues, and lazy direction. The background art in this show is some of the most flat and lifeless background art I have ever seen in anime, period. It feels like the characters are running around a green screen at times and really kills the vibe for me in otherwise great scenes. The character designs are usually on point and cute, especially the designs for all of the mother characters who carry this cute but mature style that I absolutely adore, but the necks on their models look so thin compared to their blob-like heads that it can be off putting for me at points. The lazy direction in this show can really kill the comedy of some scenes in this show as the director constantly cuts back to the same shots for emphasis on a joke and it comes off so outstandingly cheap that it hurts. For example, a character would say a joke and then cut to a different character for a second and then back to the exact same frame from the previous joke just to emphasize the joke AGAIN. I generally enjoy the art with its clean and overtly cute style but those few bumps can really affect my overall enjoyment of an otherwise great moment within the greater show.The sound design in this show is probably the worst part and it stems from more lazy direction, I think. The character's vocal range seem fixed to one style and hardly move from that style even when they are expressing different emotions. In one scene a character that expresses an overly energetic attitude is sad and doesn't sound that much different from her usual voice. The VA's are definitely good for their roles and fit fine but needed better direction on where to take their voices. The music in the show is incredibly boring and I found maybe one background track in episode two I thought was good but other than that, incredibly bland. I didn't even get a good op or ed for this show with just more boring cliques with the main cast singing the op with boring backing animation and a stiltedly animated ed that is supposed to come off as cute and quirky but instead reeks of familiar territory.The characters in this show I think are an overall strong point and they really play well off of each other. I really enjoyed the sisterly relationship between Miyako and Hinata and thought it was incredibly heart warming as they went through their fun and tribulations together. The main children characters also play well off of each other and lead to many of the most comedic moments and heart attack inducing cute moments in the show by far. I really enjoyed the mother characters little group together as they support their kids and show a real relationship with their kids. The stand-out characters for me were the class reps and Hinata: the class reps had pretty good chemistry and their interactions of the mature one who can be relied on and the one who wants to be relied on and tries her best is super cute and Hinata is just a ball of energy and her love for her sister made me think of my little sister when she was her age which pulled on my heart strings at some points. Unfortunately the main gimmick of the show is again not good and really brings down the relationship between Hinata and Miyako when they're on screen together, which is most of the show.Overall, I had quite a few problems with the show but the characters and overall comedy and cute factor really brought this show up for me. I recommend this one if you're in the market for another cgdgt show because this one will deliver on that front. For shows like this I'd take a look at Gakuen Babysitters which is another slice of life show like this with toddlers instead of fifth graders or Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru which has a similar gimmick to this show if you enjoyed that aspect of the show unlike me. have set for themselves.

The main adult figure ""Mya-nee"" had...a stalker that knows everything about her down to her specific measurements and personal info and the they brush it off and simple say oh and move on and the pedophilia also involves ""Mya-nee"" who has a deep attraction to an elementary student (witch google says is 10 to 11 for japan) and even goes as far as to basically proposes to her in the 10th ep by saying if Hana stays with her she will keep providing sweets and candy no mater the Hana\'s age and the story basically says stuff along the lines that would be very fishy and Hana herself says she doesn\'t like it but really likes the sweets and candy and it\'s OK even tho Mya-nee is kinda creepy even going as far as to pretend to call the police. If you can overlook this and watch it as a simply cutesy story then it\'s an ok story and very linear narrative despite Mya-nee being very creepy especially to Hana and it\'s not even trying to be subtle about it, plenty of scenes have it front and center. a stalker that knows everything about her down to her specific measurements and personal info and the they brush it off and simple say oh and move on and the pedophilia also involves ""Mya-nee"" who has a deep attraction to an elementary student (witch google says is 10 to 11 for japan) and even goes as far as to basically proposes to her in the 10th ep by saying if Hana stays with her she will keep providing sweets and candy no mater the Hana\'s age and the story basically says stuff along the lines that would be very fishy and Hana herself says she doesn\'t like it but really likes the sweets and candy and it\'s OK even tho Mya-nee is kinda creepy even going as far as to pretend to call the police.

(Beach type / Camping type / School Carnival type etc). So if you consider that to be a spoiler, consider yourself warned.  If you, like me, do not, than proceed.On the surface this is a cute sweet slice of life about a mostly shut-in shy college student, her sister, and her sisters friend she thinks is cute and wants to dress up on cosplay outfits.ON THE SURFACE.If you\'re a child watching it that\'s probably all you get.  If you...scratch JUST beneath that surface you pick up STRONG pedo vibes from the girl as she gets warm fuzzies and heart poundies looking at the ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT.  She makes her a large focus of her life and will basically do anything for her approval.

The music is great and I would heartily recommend the musical (children stage production style of musical) episode 11.  The voice acting is on point, at times scarily so.  It\'s a ""little"" weird though that not a SINGLE person in the show, any of the young kids, the 2 older ones, or anyone, seems to have a father.  Males just do not exist in the show.

Fellow students, fathers, whatever, they just don\'t exist.I take that back, 4 were cosplaying as ninjas for a theatre troop for about 15 seconds. I\'m ASSUMING they were male from build.

But I had to seriously keep mind-wiping myself of how just down-right CREEPY the mind-set of the Main Character was.

It was ""ooh she\'s cute, I\'m getting heart poundies and want to hug and squeeze and do things with her"" vibes. Just ..

Before that though, I\'d like to discuss the most jarring aspect of the series, that is apparent even 3 episodes for anyone who is thinking of jumping into it - how...the female MC, a college (!!) student behaves in front of a pre-teen child. She is, for the lack of a better word, lustful for Hana. That is simply inappropriate in my book. I don\'t know why the story was not animated from another angle, take for example Gakuen Babysisters or Gochuumon. The other characteristics of Miyako such as how she\'s socially anxious, shy, likes to cosplay, make clothes are all fine characteristics but how her behaviors/reactions to Hana are extremely off putting especially because she is putting Hana at a discomfort with her excessive ""adoration"". It\'s not simply a wow Hana looks cute but rather in a oh god look at this young adult keeping a bunch of photos of a child in whatever weird fetish she has and masking it off by saying that it\'s cute!!1!1! I reacted the same way as Hana did and I really want to give Miyako a slap. What on earth man. Miyako\'s giving me goosebumps. I mean yea fine, the labels are there, it is a shoujo ai for a reason but as a fellow person in my 20s, I fail to understand her feelings and am pretty disgusted if I were to be honest. She\'s exactly how a pedo behaves and I do not think that it is alright.But okay, putting ""that"" aside, although it is pretty major, if you\'ve read this far and knew what you were signing up for, this series has its merits. The characters aside for Miyako are adorable and it is a lighthearted watch. The comedic moments are a hit or miss (so far) and I do find myself looking forward to moments without Miyako although it is ultimately inevitable. I would finish the series before editing this review properly however, god, Miyako\'s excessive fawning is seriously not ok and don\'t just ""accept that"".Edit: To make it worse, I see that somehow Miyako\'s behaviors have became a running gag. Why? It is not funny. She obviously shouldn\'t be taking photos of the kids secretly especially if she knows that Hana wouldn\'t like it. Yes, in real life you\'d actually face consequences but for some reason it is all fine in this anime. It actually irks me because man, just imagine how much greater this anime could have been if she got rid of this character disposition. Enter a new character who stalks Miyako as another ""gag"". There are some serious problems with the comedy in this anime.The anime continues to portray Miyako x Hana moments till the end. This ship just ain\'t working out for me man. It\'d be cute and all if Miyako was just an onee-san but romance is a little pushing it. Episode 12\'s play is pretty nice but otherwise, throughout the anime, the constant portrayal of ""creepy"" traits in the characters make it less enjoyable. the female MC, a college (!!) student behaves in front of a pre-teen child.

It\'d be cute and all if Miyako was just an onee-san but romance is a little pushing it. Episode 12\'s play is pretty nice but otherwise, throughout the anime, the constant portrayal of ""creepy"" traits in the characters make it less enjoyable.', ""If you like odd duck characters like Tsukimi in Kuragehime and Tomoko in WataMote, then you'll definitely enjoy Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!. This show is centered around Miyako, a social phobia ridden, cosplayer obsessed,  deviant university student. She skips class as much as she can (I assume so, we only see her going to school once), hates going out,  can't go to stores because she can't handle eye contact with the cashier and to make matters worse, she becomes very infatuated with Hana, an 11 years old student, a friend of her young sister, Hinata. Don't worry though, this is one of...those pure and wholesome Shoujo Ai shows.We get to follow Miyako, Hinata and friends as they go around the house playing games, cooking and dressing cosplays made by Miyako. There are very funny moments in there but this is one of those feel-good shows more than it is a comedy. The feeling of progression and story is presented through Miyako trying to (more like being pushed to) become an adult while getting incredibly insightful help ans support from a bunch of kids. Hana in particular is very much an adult despite being in a kid's body. Well, at least when it comes to anything else that is not sweets. Give her a cookie and her brain shuts down.The balance between Miyako weirdness and the moe characters is a great combo. It keeps everything interesting and going forward. This is the perfect anime for people who kinda like moe but can't take too much sweetness without a break. Miyako offers perfectly embarrassing moments to keep you interested. She goes from bribing kids with cookies to almost getting arrested by acting like a complete creep during the summer festival. It's all good though, the kids vouch for her and she's let go. I'm sure it's a memory that will come back to torment her from time to time for all eternity.It's nice to see how Miyako slowly improves thanks to her sister and friends. She even starts to get popular... not in university of course, but the elementary school students from Hinata's class are convinced she must be the best person ever! I'm not sure about the best ever but you can see she has the potential to become a very sensible, dependable adult. Sometime soon. For now she's pretty much a wreck though, which is fun and cringy to watch. And that's why you would sit through this in the first place.All the characters are very colorful and bubbly, which is perfect for the tone of the show. Music is nice and equally bubbly. I hope they make a second season soon. those pure and wholesome Shoujo Ai shows.We get to follow Miyako, Hinata and friends as they go around the house playing games, cooking and dressing cosplays made by Miyako.

It\'s just that... this one personally felt so weird to watch.I\'d like to preface this by saying that everything else in this show is great. The characters (mostly), the design, and the soundtrack are all adorable. They all worked together to create an adorable concept about...the lives of some middle schoolers. I found it quite hard to continue after a while, and it all boiled down to the character that\'s come under the most scrutiny: Miyako.I\'m not going to come out, guns ablaze, whining about how she\'s a pedophile. I don\'t believe she is, but I personally saw it as a bit odd to see her desperately trying to befriend Hana. Trust me, I\'ve seen people over her age that befriend young children with quite the different approach, one that doesn\'t include bartering with snacks for the child to wear costumes. The way I saw it was, ""Oh, she\'s a shut-in otaku. She probably doesn\'t have a whole lot of social skills,"" and I would truly like to keep it that way in my head.I gave this anime four other chances with its other episodes, and eventually gave up. I couldn\'t force myself to watch it, not because of the age gap between the friendship, but because of the way it was shown. I would have loved this series if it was about little kids hanging out and living their own lives. Unfortunately, it wasn\'t, and I was turned off by that.TL;DR. Miyako\'s a little weird. If you like age gaps between people or you like ""loli"" characters (none of my business), you\'d probably get a kick out of this show.

Hell, I don\'t even understand why ""girls love"" is even a tag on here. There isn\'t any sort of ""love"" whatsoever, unless you count friends loving each other because, well, they\'re friends.I kind of understand why Miyako could be seen as a creep, but honestly it seems more like she\'s so socially awkward and self-isolated most of the time she doesn\'t exactly know how and how not to act in public, so her behavior might come off as sketchy to others. For example, when the girls go...to the summer festival, Miyako tries to snap a picture of Hana in her kimono, which she doesn\'t really realize is creepy in a public setting, where onlookers are unaware of the context between Miyako and the other girls.I genuinely believe this is just a lighthearted show about a NEET and a few innocent kids doing wholesome things (this is CGDCT, of course) and nothing more.If there is a need to blame someone for being creepy, it has to be Matsumoto.

On the flipside though, the...show itself is not in any way lolicon fodder, keeping everything related to the girls cute and innocent, and always comedically pointing out the creepiness of the protagonist\'s obsession. There\'s also very subtle romantic subtext between some of the girls, but once more, extremely mild and age-appropriate.Beyond the weirdness, the show surprised me positively in a few ways. It\'s a 4-koma adaptation, so the humour is full of quick, situational gags and witty dialogue and while the jokes threatened to become stale mid-season, the episodes stayed varied and creative enough to never become boring. The character quirks of the main girls stayed consistently fun and the protagonist\'s social anxiety and awkward otaku fascinations were always balanced out with her positive qualities.

Bai Yao Pu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41224/Bai_Yao_Pu,"['This donghua was quite the surprise. It\'s not a show you can light-heartily watch, because each episode does its best to wring on the audience\'s heart strings. And this is exactly what this season is about: unraveling all the colors of the human heart:""Who will break the deadlock,Hard to heal the mind, at least there is the heart"" - (from the opening)A powerful yet mysterious bell.A name that makes spirit hope for salvation or run away in fear.We follow the wandering about of a young girl called Táo Yāo (桃=peach; 夭= die young). She is a doctor,...but she only treats spirits and not humans. However, through each episode we learn more about human emotions and behaviors.The English title of the show is: ""Manual of Hundred Demons"". It tells us a lot about the story. Although we don\'t know a lot about this mysterious book, there is one certainty: Bai Yao Pu doesn\'t focus on the main character, but on the Demons. Every couple of episodes tells a self-contained story. They are the beautiful stories of the demon-patients, their memories of the mortal realm.Every episode touches the strings of the tragic and the comic of life. The latter is expressed through the relationship between Tao Yao and her companions, while the first one is represented by the stories of the demons.Their memories are told through flashbacks and direct narration and have a ""tragic"" dimension in the sense of classical tragedy: emotion and struggle against fate, which can be life or the limits of one\'s existence. Laughs, first times, tears, joy, pain all come together as the story of each character develops. The power of the narrations in each episode makes Tao Yao almost disappear; she is, in fact, the ""glue"" that works as a bridge between each episode and, on another level, as the bridge between the outside and the conscience of the patient.She is the bridge between us and the ""xin"" (to use the Chinese word for heart that also indicates the mind, so the ""heart-mind""). She is a psychoanalytic device that can bring to the outside the problems that involve the ""inside"". That\'s what she does: through the power of the bell, she finds the string of the heart that contains the illness, which means she cures the root of the emotional and physical crisis (which is understandable also because ancient Chinese thinkers believed in a powerful relation between the heart-mind and the body).But, even though demons are the ones to be cured, at the end of each episode they seem to have unraveled a new aspect of human mind-heart and morals. They say there\'s no better way to understand one\'s reality than understanding the reality of others, this show proves this idiom is right. Demons try to understand humans and us humans can have a cathartic realization of what makes us humans:""The true meaning of great love is dedication"" (-from the opening)All the stories are not banal and therefore are plenty of details that make them ""particular"" (special and peculiar, unique); but at the end of the day they underline all the ways in which human relations are given and show all the types of love and dedication. All these things have the right to be heard. Emotions overcome the ideas of ""right and wrong"":""Unwilling to listen to others/the wind blows. We walk through the snowtogether/Good will bloom/Forget the pain/Blame the bell/Couldn\'t wake upthe indistinguishable soul/ Wait till dawn /Clear black and white / Gods aredumb during the showdown between justice and evil/ Forget sorrow and joy/Pawns in the game correlates with right and wrong/ Who will break thedeadlock."" (- from the opening)Tao Yao seems also to have a story to tell and a deadlock to break in the future of the series...In conclusion, this is a story about demons. But at the end this ends up to be the most natural expression of humanity and the of meaning of being human, of the meaning of being alive and have a dedication. For a show that is set in a world of gods and spirits, everything screams ""MORTAL"" and death.""There are hundreds of fairiesAll can distinguish good from evilHumans only have one heartBut it\'s unpredictable"" (-from the ending)What happens when a ""mind"" that can only see black and white meets a heart that is blinded by the shades of grey?

Overall, it is a good show with interesting characters that you begin to connect with and it portrayed situations that really tug on your heart strings. Sorry if that sounds cheesy.

However, there was few new animation (I guess it was even none).For people who have already seen season 1, it is a great reminder, and surely a quick one, while still being respectful of the best scenes from season 1.To conclude on all this : I think it is a pretty good episode to get yourself in the mood before watcing season 2. However, as it required...only editing to prepare this episode, I'll only rate 8, which is my overall feeling about My hero academia season 1, minus 1 point. only editing to prepare this episode, I'll only rate 8, which is my overall feeling about My hero academia season 1, minus 1 point."", '*Disclaimer*Just personal scratch.Advised, possible spoilers.Opinion & InformalNote #1: I prefer to rate things concerning their ""type."" So for example, I gave this a 6/10 for the art and animation areas because I feel that they did more than the average for a **recap episode** in those areas when compared to other recap episodes.Art: 6/10 The artwork was the same. It\'s a recap so it was an entire episode of strewn-together clips. This was pretty much an average recap piece but the reason I\'m giving this a 6, above a 5, is because this recap actually included new ""animation"" as well as made...an effort to be a bit more than your average recap episode. For example, during the episode\'s segment I (I as in Irvine) there was actually a very brief moment where it was going over Izuku\'s hero notebook. This wasn\'t the only example but there were still shots with very slight animation to it in which it was showcasing hero profiles. Those very specific shots and details of those hero profiles weren\'t in the original anime or manga as far as I remember. Another specific example from this is when it was showing how Izuku was initially making his hero notebook. There was a short sequence showing the individual previous notebooks and how they eventually lead up to his 13th notebook; that wasn\'t in the original anime either. The last example of new animation that set this recap episode apart from your average recap episode was the ED. The ED was new and actually looked nice for something that was supposed to be low effort. It had new animations. I\'m basically giving this area a 6 because this recap episode did more than what the average recap episode does. That is, it had more than one instance of new art and animation.Animation: 6/10 Most of what I wanted to say is expressed in the above area so please refer to that so that I save time and space. Basically: a few new bits of art and animation. This wasn\'t simply a slide show of clips. This recap episode actually added extra bits such as new art, animation, and things like those character names that appear when introducing someone.Characters: 5/10 Recaps all the main characters, main side characters and villains. Nothing special done here. Can\'t talk about character development or design since this is a recap.Plot: 5/10 Same idea here as with the characters area.Development: 6/10 This recap episode did noticeably well in this area. Yes, this recap episode was pretty much a slideshow of the original anime\'s clips but the transitions, flow, and brand new narration was what made this above-average. The transitions were somewhat more thoughtful and the overall recap did what it was supposed to with the least amount of questions.Music: 5/10 No new music, bgm, or soundboard. Sound design not applicable.Conclusion: 6/10 Same song for the ED but new animation here. The ED animation was simple but looked nice. This is a plus.Overall: 6/10 This was an above-average **recap episode** pretty much. This recap episode clearly did more than what your standard recap episode does. It had new art, new animations, and was thoughtfully recapped. It actually had editing.

But this time was exception.As a recap of 1st season, I could say it was quite well made with most important events put in just one episode.....Also, liked idea of including Deku's hero notes with cute drawings. Always wondered what exactly he writes in his notes and how does he describes heroes in them, because in the main show series a viewer could only get a glimpse of it.Although, I wonder how his classmates...would react seeing themselves in Deku's notebook :D would react seeing themselves in Deku's notebook :D"", ""Although it was just a filler episode meant to recap the season 1 and is somehow not even included in the Netflix release, My Hero Academia: Hero Notebook is actually pretty good and manages to summarize the first season decently for those who've watched it but want to recall what went down without going through each and every episode.The presentation is apt, and as expected from a recap episode, it manages to highlight the key moments of the first season pretty well. It could've been boring since we all know what this was going to be about, but I found myself totally gripped from start...to finish, and felt it was very much like a (short) movie adaptation of the series. I can't really recommend it to those who haven't watched the first season, because while the summarizing is good, a lot of points might not be understood properly without having watched the first 13 episodes.Other than that, it does what a filler is meant to do and that is all one should expect. It doesn't contribute anything to the plot, but is worth checking out also out of the curiosity regarding how much of 13 episodes can be summarized in one single episode. to finish, and felt it was very much like a (short) movie adaptation of the series.

It\'s nothing but I appreciate the efforts to, at least, understand the depth of basketball (don\'t practice this sport lol).Art : 6/10As always in the first episode the animation is good, have been bait by this, but globally it\'s VERY average animation even during a match which is a pity. Unfortunately it didn\'t got the same budget as Kuroko no Basket. But well expect a way better animation in important matches.Sound : 6/10Not a fan of the OP and ED.In the seiyuu part, even if I am a fan of Kaji Yuki, his dubbing is ""okay-ish"" not spectacular as Eren or Silver Mask (Arslan Senki) where he push his voice to the limit but his character don\'t give the oppurtunity to express himself so I feel a bit disappointed (not his fault but well, I\'m conflicted).For the other it\'s good, the voice match with the characters (yeah I minimize the others unlike Kaji Yuki... :X ).Character : 7/10As I wrote earlier, the character\'s background is interesting. The motivation to push them to play and train is coherent and understable (for the key players I precise).As a whole they don\'t have any default, except some stereotypes but well I\'ll give a pass because it\'s not really annoying.Enjoyment : 9/10My shonen spirit who was more or less dead, because of the disappereance of good shonen have burst with this anime. I repeat nothing spectacular and because I starve some shonen energy I overestimate this anime but I am really enjoying watching this anime.I have followed the last season around 10 animes (more at the beginning but dropped some in the way) and this one, was my most awaited each week.Overall : 8/10I give a 8 because of the story, the consistency of the characters and the shohen spirit (totally subjective point).Cant give an higher score because of the weak point inherent of the animation which is low.So I recommend it if you\'re neutral or like sport and the animation is not a mandatory point for you.

With the hundreds of anime I've watched i can honestly say without a shadow of a doubt this anime is in my top 10.I love the story and the characters. My god the characters i love each and everyone of them like the friends i've never had. i have not found a cast that was anymore compelling to me not One piece, Naruto, SAO or...AOT. Even when i went through a dry spell due to studying for the SAT and dropped ever other currently coming out anime this one specifically is the only one i didn't drop. I can't say that there are more than 3 other anime out there that i could do that for.To those who had problems with the art style and animation as far as art style goes that is the most subjective thing you can judge on especially since this is based of a manga from 2003 (which i haven't read btw) and as far as animation goes there been very few anime that have given me problems with animation and i can proudly say this is not one.All in all i could sing this anime's praises for months but i can say that this will be hit or miss for some people if art style is a  problem for you don't watch it but i can proudly say i love it.

Hopefully, that helped. Thanks for reading this review if you do.Ahiru no Sora truly wanted to be something. Ahiru no Sora had the story, the characters, but with most Shounen anime, high episode count = bad. You know, the Toei Animation disease.The problem with high episode counts is that there is too much room, way too much room. So much room that episodes get drawn out to add suspense for, well, “DON’T MISS OUT ON NEXT WEEK’S EPISODE”. With so much room you would probably expect a magnitude of plot devices here and there to keep the story somewhat...entertaining, but instead, anime like so just stick to their ground with overdrawn development and action. It is almost as if the writers understood that there was no conceivable way to make a story out of something so very long to the point where they just gave a middle finger to the story and began writing a product rather than something that can even be considered a decent story. It happens all the time, DBZ, One Piece, Bleach, Black Clover too. They’re all just massive let downs because they decided that it would be best to continue as some over winded product rather than just let up and end the story where it is at. I really don’t think the future for long-running anime is looking too good in terms of pulling the best stories anyone has seen, it is just a curse at this point in which all long-running anime will inevitably fall in the same circle of continuously going through the same thing over and over again with writing slipped conveniently at the right moments to create the illusion of a grand journey. It is a big deception device that people will fall into since it sells well as a product rather than something with the intention of being a true story.Story - 6:Pacing. With a count of 50 episodes, do I need to say more? In all fairness though, while the pacing is so bad that you can literally forget what happened the episode right before even during a binge-watch. There is an actual narrative Ahiru no Sora has to show, and that narrative is actually pretty good. It all boils down to the story of the immense training of working towards your dream, via loss, and while this isn’t original, the grand scheme of the story is actually somewhat enjoyable to experience.  While the story has a good narrative, the pacing suffers so much that it harms the story way too much. Honestly, one match takes up about 8 episodes, who the hell is gonna remember anything?Art/Visuals - 5:Zero effort. You can tell that someone was there at the studio going like: Still shot, add dash effect, opacity = 10%, pan camera. Over and over again. There was little animation half the time that it is not even funny, I genuinely think someone looked at Ahiru no Sora and thought, “Yeah bro, you give us this literal trash, so we are not even going to try anymore”, and when there was it would ironically be used for the most irrelevant parts and less for the basketball matches where people want to see some class tricks happening here and there. I don’t know what the logic is there but someone either couldn’t be bothered, or the studio had the same situation with Sonic The Hedgehog movie where someone looked at the design and thought, “Yeah, this is good”. 3D animation for the ball too, it wasn’t ugly, but it wasn’t good either, though, I would rather have the 3D animation kept in place than some “attempted” 2D animation of a literal basketball. I don’t know how Diomedea rolls especially how this is their only work that I have seen, but I am sure that they aren’t as bad as what they have given to the audience of this anime.Character designs, however, were pretty good, it isn’t something that you see every day which gave it its unique style, however, it isn’t groundbreakingly good either. It has style but lacks power, the power to be successful as a standalone design.Sound/Audio - 6:Very basic sounds, used “in the moment” too, though, with 50 episodes to watch from, the OST easily because very easy to remember, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it was because the OST was good, there were merely just lots of space to throw in an OST whenever a match was played. The 4 OPs and EDs were pretty good but they were box standard in the realm of shounen anime. Nothing else to add onto that.With VCs, Yuki Kaji on job with Sora and he did a good job at voicing Sora’s personality. Other characters had a good sense of character through VCs too, in that, this is an anime featuring delinquents. So the aggressive attitudes and voices conveyed that well.Characters - 7:The characters are the only thing I respect about the show, unlike the story which had horrible pacing, the characters did have some solid development, whilst it was slow, it still existed, and what made it better was that there was a sense of believable growth to these characters. People don’t just change overnight, and ironically, an incredibly prolonged story made for the best way to prove that statement. Through training, hardships, and dumbass mistakes, these characters went from zero and are still growing to this moment in time. In saying this, however, the only characters who get this kind of development were Sora, Kenji, Momoharu and Kaname (to some extent). That isn’t to say the other characters were just left out because why not, rather, they weren’t focused on much, yeah, there was visible development on them, but in something as long as Ahiru no Sora, you would think that there would be a good 20 mins dedicated for each particular character. Yeah. That doesn’t happen. I really think that the writers forgot half the characters in the show and couldn’t be bothered to do any more work to write them back in.Enjoyment - 4:Instead of writing why enjoyment was bad. I will leave you with a (rhetorical) question.Would you really enjoy what is essentially 3/4 of a show being poorly animated basketball matches, with 4 developing characters and a slow story that gets worked on whenever the writers want to work on it?Overall - 5.6 (6)TLDR Review:Story - 6: Good narrative, but horrible pacing.Art - 5: Just panned shots with some effects whenever a basketball match plays, otherwise, decent in betweenSound - 6: Very basic OST.Characters - 7: Actual good characters, but not all of them are developed.Enjoyment - 4: Too long to enjoy.Overall - 5.6 (6)As someone who has never read the manga, I still have every intention to do so but Ahiru no Sora further emphasises that long shounen anime is not good. I know this isn’t battle shounen but these are just becoming products for people in the shounen demographic to just be like: “Yo, I’m gonna start playing basketball now to get as cool as these characters” or “Yo, I’m gonna starting fighting like some that hero so I can get really strong.” And does it work? Yeah. Sometimes I find myself in the position, but that doesn’t excuse that the fact that in anime, there are some genuine stories to be told and I simply cannot place Ahiru no Sora on a level like them as so. entertaining, but instead, anime like so just stick to their ground with overdrawn development and action.

Basketball is the vehicle used to drive these characters forward and plays an important role in these characters finding a way to be...reborn, but what the series emphasizes is a need for introspection in order to do something you truly love and can push you forward enough to give you a purpose in life, regardless of the mistakes one might do or the pain that lies further down the road. It handles all this with an exceptional amount of nuance and subtlety, never genuinely shoving these themes down the viewer's throat and instead expects the audience to pick up on hints given throughout much of the first act of the series - covering around the first 33 episodes. This in and of itself is a problem; in sharp contrast to series like Haikyuu and Kuroko, which act more as hypebeasts trying to drag viewers in with gorgeous visuals and adrenaline pumping matches, whereas viewers watching Ahiru no Sora will be treated to lengthy comedy sequences as well as slice of life segments involving the main cast, which due to being very slow paced and often with mixed comedic timing don't endear the show to a wider audience.While in and of itself neither lengthy comedy sequences nor slice of life segments need to necessarily be a problem, the show ruins this with its dragged out, stretched pacing - a quick distinction from its manga counterpart, where dialogue often flowed naturally and games happened at a quick enough pace to not be dragged out. This made stretches of the show often a drag to watch, and while the slice of life segments don't suffer much from this, the comedy and games proper often do - this is probably why critical reception to the show was considerably worse than much of its recent long-running contemporaries like Haikyuu, Ace of Diamond or Kuroko, which all are comparatively high budget adaptations created by Production IG. By comparison, Ahiru no Sora was done by Diomedea studio, a studio with a prominent reputation for low budget production values and pacing issues with many adaptations they've done; while parts of the series are wonderfully directed, these parts come in-between stretches of very strangely paced episodes. On the flipside, the soundtracks is pretty great, with many standout tracks salvaging many games, and a particular mention needing to go to the various OPs/EDs in the series, with the fourth opening and third ending being my personal favorites. That said, none of the OPs or EDs are particularly bad and all of them are fantastic, which isn't something that can be said for every series with a multitude of OPs/EDs like this one.Sora's character arc about his complex for his height is greatly expanded on over the course of the series; much about his character seems typical for the standard sports lead, but the distinction is in Sora's nuance. Sora often recklessly challenges delinquents - something used for comic relief - but this disguises a character often insecure about his own height and masculinity in a sport where both are associated with being a better player, with this being contrasted with his mom's upbringing of him which turned that very short stature into a strength instead of a weakness. This largely is what drives Sora forward as a character despite his poor treatment both by his would-be classmates and general student body, with his perseverance standing out in the ocean of apathy that is his school and driving the group of delinquents that largely comprise the rest of the team. However, his character arc is more about how he often defines himself by his mom's upbringing - and how this in return leaves him helpless to find guidance for himself, whose role Madoka fills up as the series continues, acting as the closest thing in the cast to an emotional voice of reason. A combination of his dynamic with Madoka as well as his own desire for independence mean that by the end of the series and after a fair few twists and turns, Sora has begun the steps to attaining his own self-defined independence, with his willingness to turn a certain lie into the truth and take responsibility for his own actions being a driving force.Momoharu and Chiaki act as another contrast in this regard both to Sora as well as each other, with Chiaki's more extrospective personality concealing a cynical yet realist mind on the team and chances for success, while Momoharu acts introspectively yet concealing a certain hot-bloodedness that drives him to improve further. The two are brothers, growing up taking inspiration from iconic sports manga only to have that idealism crushed when facing odds that are against them, leading to Chiaki being disinterested due to associating his love for the sport with his odds for victory, and Momoharu slowly following by drowning in his own apathy, being discriminated against due to his appearance as well as attitude. Both brothers grow gradually over the course of the series, with Chiaki slowly understanding that he needs to broaden his horizons and reach for the stars rather than simply ground himself in seemingly objective expectations, while Momoharu's impulsiveness leads him to make several mistakes that lead to him slowly taking his passion for basketball seriously and discovering a love for the sport that has seemingly long been lost. Much of their characterization in this adaptation happens in the second half of the anime, but much of their negative traits (overplayed and emphasized as they are) fade the longer the series goes on.Tobi acts as the closest thing the series has to a veteran player, being cocky and highly individualistic - which betrays a deep resentment of not just his school but most people around him in general, driven by a cynicism of being judged both due to his appearance as well as his estrangement from his broken family life, with his sister acting as the closest thing he has to a bond. He's cocky, arrogant and full of himself, yet these same negative traits conceal a jaded person whose life experiences have driven him to apathy to the point where he'd shun people away. And yet through his experiences joining the team, he realizes that there are players who have undergone troubling experiences yet come out smiling on the other side and being better than he is, pushing him not only to remain loyal to the team but often acting more and more selflessly the longer the series goes on. Much of Tobi's characterization is gradual yet consistent, with his negative traits not detracting from his likability as a character; it's beyond refreshing in a cast filled of delinquents to have a character that only very slowly defrosts over time, and Tobi - partially due to his growing dynamic with Sora but also his immediately sympathetic reason for both playing the sport and remaining loyal to the team - is my favorite character in the series, and I can't wait for more of his progression over the course of the manga.Kaname is the final central character introduced over the course of the series, with his character arc acting as a foil to Sora's - being one where instead of being discriminated for his shortiness as is the case with Sora, instead being constantly pushed into a sport he grows to apparently dislike due to his height, with his teammates constantly ridiculing him for his low stamina and poor health. His character arc is partially about rediscovering his love for basketball independently of the very factors that pushed him to fall out of love with it, with the cast encouraging him to play to his strengths and be more assertive about his interests while also being conscious about his health. Also relevant is Kaname's subplot with a side character, and how he uses as a motivation his feelings for her in order to drive him forward to improve as a player and win games - making him increasingly become a more prominent player as the series goes on despite his physical weaknesses. Kaname's interactions with Sora are worthy of note due to the contrast between both characters, but there's a surprising amount of nuance and even a thematic point made in the series that what one of them possess the other lacks and vice versa, which grants credence to their friendship as well as their dynamic on the court.Various side characters are also worthy of note; Sora's mom is a moral support who I loved from the moment she showed up on screen, acting as a kind yet firm voice to guide Sora forward despite her own health. Nanao is an unbelievably likable character whose main flaw is her self-centeredness in taking responsibility for the team's failings when she's the de facto manager upon herself, and yet grows stronger as she realizes that regardless of her tactical prowess, there's only so much she can do alone. Madoka's dynamic with Sora is my favorite in the series, with her acting increasingly as moral support yet due to her own awkwardness in approaching sensitive subjects - a weakness that backfires on her later on in the series - is often easily dismissed in-setting as shallow, when her introspective nature reveals she's anything but that; she bonds with Sora's family, growing ever closer to Sora as she understands his weaknesses and strengths, and grows to become a personal crutch to him as the series goes on due to her own caring for him, even if her consideration for his feelings often stand in the way (even if understandable in-context) from further emotional intimacy. Much of my favorite slice of life segments came from Madoka's interactions with Sora, with their dynamic growing naturally over the course of the series. Many, many characters can be laid out here; Shinichi, Chiba, Fuwa, Satsuki and Yozan all being noteworthy characters that grow over the course of the series.Ahiru no Sora is a really damn good sports series that has gone under the radar due to various issues I mentioned earlier and understandably so; unfortunately, this means that the manga remains the optimal version to experience Ahiru no Sora's story. What is being adapted, however, is still really good, just marred by all these production problems for those that are willing to give this series a fair chance and are unwilling to read manga for the optimal experience. There's much to love about this series, and considering material that comes later on, I certainly hope for a season 2 to come somewhere down the line, albeit admittedly I certainly wouldn't mind a considerably better production.Nonetheless, I highly recommend this series and especially in manga format for those that are looking for a damn good sport series, and I don't speak that kind of praise lightly.Thank you very much for reading. reborn, but what the series emphasizes is a need for introspection in order to do something you truly love and can push you forward enough to give you a purpose in life, regardless of the mistakes one might do or the pain that lies further down the road.

When you meet athletes you will notice that most of them are very positive people and the reason why is simple, sports are hard.I know it might seem easy to some, seeing people just playing a game, but honestly, when I was playing I was having two practices per day with my team plus at least one or two more, I was a bench warmer at best....To make it in basketball you need a lot of skill, a lot of heart, and a lot of luck. But let's get to the anime(whoever wants to know more about basketball write me).The anime is your standard basketball anime, with a bunch of differently skilled guys who band together to form a team. What makes it a bit stand out is the comparison to birds. It's the first time I read or watched that players are compared to birds.We see them face difficult challenges in their own lifes, as in the sport they love. Which for me makes it really realistic. I love kuruko no basket, and it does a great job portraying basketball as a realistic sport, but, some of the moves and things are really like magic, a bit too much emphasised.Her we have pure basketball, with the pain of being short, the pain of lossing and the joy of being a team.It really motivated me, and I must say, it is a fun show to watch, to see the other side that people don't often show for athletes, THE SACRIFICES!Long practices in the night, putting aside games, fun adventures and other things for the sake of basketball and the team your on, a lot of those things aren't shown in most animes, while this one creates a great balance between the reward and the sacrifices/hard work that was invested for it.In general this is a great anime for anime sports fans, for those who love motivating stories, and for those who enjoy watching someone overcome big hurdles and break the sterotypes.  And it's not only the team we follow, but it seems like we get to see a bit more of struggle and happiness from the other teams. Unlike in other basketball animes, this is not focused 98% only on basketball, but on the life of them outside of it.While Kuruko No Basket was mostly like pro high school players, this one is the underdog.Ahiru no Sora is a great watch, and I hope you'll give it a shot.

So, I don’t know how this show in particular compares to kurokos basket which I dropped mid-way due to the absurd superpowers in the show. Given this, the review will cover this show on how well it performed  in regards to story, art an animation, along with characters, compared to other sports anime and how well it performed in comparison to notable drama series, the review will not compare Ahiru no Sora to other basketball anime.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSStory: 5The...anime revives around a rather tryhard short kid who wants to form a serious basketball team and play as a starter. His mom was a top tier female basketball player who inspired him to become the best he could be despite lacking the greatest asset in basketball, height. The first half of the story actually has very little basketball, its about a boy winning over a bunch of violent thugs at his highschool who at one point played basketball for fun. Sora, our protagonist, challenges various thugs to dueling him in basketball and tried to win them over with his skills, this was rather cringe and hard to watch but the show managed to get through this without making me drop it. Besides the cringe, the start of the series had a very meandering pace, although its important to develop the characters for most of the start of the series the show clearly did not know what to focus on. We had a mixture of perverted antics of Chiaki, random fist fights involving Momoharu, a number of side stories that genuinely had nothing to do with basketball, and an entire arc about a pair of basketball shoes. This helped develop the characters a bit, however it went on far too long and wasted nearly half the episodes the series had before any real game even occurred.After spending many episodes forming his team, there was a rather lengthy training arc, lengthy might even be understating it. Nearly 5 episodes were spent just on a skirmish game with a girl’s team and then the characters realizing they have no chemistry so they need to become a team in spirit before they get on the court for a match. After the first skirmish match there was another against a male team that lasted nearly 10 episodes, mostly due to poor pacing and the usual cliffhangers to generate interest which sort of failed as it dragged on for what like forever. During this training period the characters definitely worked hard and it made it believable that this new team might actually perform decently despite having limited basketball talent and low levels of initial practice. The series also stays genuine to this ideal later on by not giving Kuzu highschool any easy wins, really, they got no wins at all in the entire show.As noted earlier however, the lackluster games, the endless dragged on side stories, and the overall poor execution of a sports anime this series was leads to it getting a relatively low score for story.Art: 3Now if the story was weak but the basketball games were well choreographed and animated, I would give this show a pass, sadly this is not the case. One thing I will give Kuroko’s basket is that unlike Ahiru no Sora the games actually had impact and were not a series of power point slides and slow motion drives. From the general aesthetics of the backgrounds and the characters, to the many still scenes, to extremely boring and poorly choregraphed games, this series has some of the worst art and production value out of any sports anime series.Early on there were more fluid moments, specifically when Sora watched the girls play basketball and when Tobi was doing drives on a street court, however the show steadily declined. This is likely due to the strained production schedule from having to air dozens of episodes back to back during a pandemic, so it makes sense to cut them some slack. However, due to even the highlight moments sucking and the endless reuse of backgrounds, the art rating just cannot be salvaged.The sound: 5The second opening was actually really good however for the most part the OST and the sound effects in this show were fairly mediocre. This especially hurts in a series that is supposed to be exciting and pumped during games, the OST just did not generate the hype it should have, the basketball sound effects were passable and decent for immersion but overall, they weren’t outstanding either. The best aspect of the soundtrack outside of the OP would be character voice acting, however this review will consider the voice acting to be part of the characters section.Characters: 8Characters are this show’s saving grace, every member of the main cast and even some side members are thoroughly fleshed out with back stories, interesting motivations and character quirks, they all have very real personalities that reflect stupid highschool boys. Yes the show is meandering, yes the arcs are random, yes the games sucked for the most part, but the characters that were developed through this snail paced bleak shit show, shine as bright as the morning sun, guess you really do need pressure to make diamonds.Sora himself constantly strives to the best but remains levelheaded regardless of how much effort he puts in or how well he performs during a game, he never looks down on his teammates, and he remains optimistic regardless of whatever disasters occur. Sora is the perfect sports anime protagonist and he especially complements the rest of the cast in this series has the other characters start off either rough or dismissive, but he wins them over and is central to most of their character arcs. Every other guy also has a full on story either solo or in a group setting explaining why they decided to get into basketball, what they were doing with their lives, and their reasons for trying so hard to improve on a makeshift team with barely enough members to have a bench. Tobi’s family, Momoharu’s past as a basketball player, the delinquent trio wanting to do something interesting and new, everyone had a unique interesting reason but they call came onto court with their end goals aligned. Overall the development of the boys from rough thugs, dismissive guys, and guys who thought they were to good for the team, to becoming a part of something bigger and making friends along the way was enjoyable to watch.On the other hand, the girls in the show got some focus as well. Madoka, who clearly stole the name of the magical girl, made for a pretty interesting side character as a girl who also played basketball and gives the team pointers, defends them when possible, and even falls in love with a character on the team. She also has a life outside of the guys and we get to see her interact with Sora’s grandma and with another group of guys along with her own team. The amount of attention a side character who doesn’t even play in the games got, was quite great, and really added to the well-rounded cast of the show. Nao, unlike Madoka, doesn’t get as much investment outside of the team, but her development as their advisor, her no nonsense never give up attitude, and the effort she puts into making them better were all excellent highlights of her character.The same can be said of the teacher who advises their team, he has a pretty thorough personality, and his own reasons to coaching the team. Nothing particularly negative to the rival characters either, most of them had interesting backstories, and in the case of the official competition Kuzu highschool actually played a team that was far more sympathetic than them and much more hard working which was a nice change of pace from the average sports anime.Overall, the show is a 7/10, as long as we treat this series like a highschool drama instead of a sports anime, its actually pretty tolerable. However, this show is not little busters and the sport aspect is heavily focused on and the sport aspect is quite weak and due to this the show, itself is barely average. Worth noting that if you really care about the sports aspect your enjoyment of this show will probably drop to a low 6 or 5, as its very bad at delivering its core attraction. anime revives around a rather tryhard short kid who wants to form a serious basketball team and play as a starter.

Every other guy also has a full on story either solo or in a group setting explaining why they decided to get into basketball, what they were doing with their lives, and their reasons for trying so hard to improve on a makeshift team with barely enough members to have a bench. Tobi’s family, Momoharu’s past as a basketball player, the delinquent trio wanting to do something interesting and new, everyone had a unique interesting reason but they call came onto court with their end goals aligned. Overall the development of the boys from rough thugs, dismissive guys, and guys who thought they were to good for the team, to becoming a part of something bigger and making friends along the way was enjoyable to watch.On the other hand, the girls in the show got some focus as well. Madoka, who clearly stole the name of the magical girl, made for a pretty interesting side character as a girl who also played basketball and gives the team pointers, defends them when possible, and even falls in love with a character on the team. She also has a life outside of the guys and we get to see her interact with Sora’s grandma and with another group of guys along with her own team. The amount of attention a side character who doesn’t even play in the games got, was quite great, and really added to the well-rounded cast of the show. Nao, unlike Madoka, doesn’t get as much investment outside of the team, but her development as their advisor, her no nonsense never give up attitude, and the effort she puts into making them better were all excellent highlights of her character.The same can be said of the teacher who advises their team, he has a pretty thorough personality, and his own reasons to coaching the team. Nothing particularly negative to the rival characters either, most of them had interesting backstories, and in the case of the official competition Kuzu highschool actually played a team that was far more sympathetic than them and much more hard working which was a nice change of pace from the average sports anime.Overall, the show is a 7/10, as long as we treat this series like a highschool drama instead of a sports anime, its actually pretty tolerable. However, this show is not little busters and the sport aspect is heavily focused on and the sport aspect is quite weak and due to this the show, itself is barely average. Worth noting that if you really care about the sports aspect your enjoyment of this show will probably drop to a low 6 or 5, as its very bad at delivering its core attraction.', ""I have hardly posted any forums posts in my time on this site, but I had to vent my frustrations with this anime.So far this has been one of the most boring experiences I've had in awhile watching a show, and it really is a shame, seeing that I love both the sport of basketball and the sports anime genre. I came into this anime with decent hopes and expectations, hoping it could one-up the completely unrealistic Kuroko no Basket, but after 18 long, drawn out episodes, I've been boringly let down.It's realistic, don't get me wrong, but it's realism is so strong to the...point that its boring and drags the show down. It interjects formation after formation that a brand new team has no business running, and boringly explains each one. The characters are passable, but no single character really sticks out and makes me interested in the show. Compared to the previously mentioned Kuroko no Basket, those characters, however cliche and overpowered they were, at least interested me.Lastly, the thing that bugs me and bores me the most, is the animation. I can't stress this enough, the animation is god awful. If you are going to make a sports anime, you almost certainly need some at least decent animation. Kuroko no Basket had amazing animation to keep its audience interested, and to compare it to other sports anime, Haikyuu and even Free! had great animation to back up their flaws. I'd be able to excuse this glaring flaw if they had covered their asses with the previous points I have mentioned so far, but literally everything about this show has been poorly executed in terms of a sports anime.You can excuse the lack of a good art style or decent animation quality to studio or budget, but I really don't care to. Like I said, this show has done nothing but give me reasons to dislike it, Maybe if i got a decent backstory or two, or maybe a cool scoring sequence I could rewatch on youtube later, then i would care, but for now, 18 episodes in, I'll remain this way.I really hate to be that one anime fan complaining about a show online, but man this show just isn't good, and i needed to see if there was anime sharing my opinions. I'll probably continue watching for one or two more episodes to close out this arc, but after that there is really no point. I'd rather watch the shit show Kuroko no Basket all over again. point that its boring and drags the show down.

Just straight up pure basketball.Please give this show a chance before you pass it up. People have been complaining about it\'s pacing but it\'s fine in my opinion. The anime takes time to actually develop all of the characters. Matches span over multiple episodes but everything is explained to the viewers. Every single quarter. Everything put in the show is intentional, none of it being filler. Every episode either moves the plot forward, or explores a character further.**I have watched a ton of sports anime before, and am currently...up to the most recent episode (33) as of 5.31.20.Story:Very generic.

Why? Because this anime has something that other 2 don't, it's defeat. First basketball anime where you do not win without hard training, where non of people played basketball in highschool level. That is my argument why it is underrated.Story - 10: It starts with new 1 year student joining basketball club, well if you can call it like that, because no...one playes basketball there and there are only punks who don't want to do anything.  He talks them at least try to do so and starts to assemble team. They have a friendly match with few top teams in region. Later on basketball season starts and in first match they suffer a defeat. Basketball season ends there, but not for the basketball team. They start to improve their performance for next season. It's more realistic than other two basektball anime, here is more story buidling and character development which gives this anime 10 points from me. At first i didn't realy like it. Because it looked not so serious more like a comedy type, but the development with every episode was just too great.Art - 6: It's fine i guess. But studio realy went cheap and created every character similar.Sound - 9: It gives realy nice wibe when you're watching it, something like boosting your morale to do something yourself.Character - 10: Every character has it's build-up. They aren not getting better with every episode, but more like in the long run. Motivation to play basketball is growing for them, motivation to get better. It's not like in Kuroku no basket that you instantly become way better than opponents when you encounter stronger opponents. NO! You lose, because you're not reay yet. They face harsh reality and have to overcome it by themselfs. That's why i give it 10 points. It's not fantasty that you will always win, but it's more like reality where you will more fall than rise.Enjoyment - 10. Since it's most realistic basketball game it feels like i'm here with those people over the screen playing it. It gives me motivation to improve my own game. 10 because the enjoyment which it gives to me makes me want to play it myself. Improve and overcome something which is waiting for me in the future. It inserts me into their game.Overall - 9. Why it's only 9 when i realy like this anime? Well, it's simple, it's math.10,6,9,10,10,9=9 So i can't give it higher score even if enjoyment is something out of this world. one playes basketball there and there are only punks who don't want to do anything.

I don't mind that since I dig that genre but since I watch them so frequently this show kind of disappoints me.At first I was hooked, liked the premise of the small main character in a sport where height is key like in Haikyuu!!. Nothing special but gets you the feeling of cheering for the underdog.The art of the series is the absolute biggest low of the show. In games the movement is lacking fluidity. The pacing in those basketball games feels so weird it's hard to enjoy the matches.The game always stops after one move happened and...gives us the the mental reaction of all the characters.And if that wasn't enough the ball falling into the hoop is so unnatural with the weak 3D mechanic.The characters are fine but the MC kinda falls flat after a while. He isn't as interesting as Hinata of Haikyuu!Since the games are the bread and butter of sports anime this show is at best mediocre. It has no flow, bad animations and a weird power balance. In one move one character appears to be a god and in the next scene he's lower than basic.

The protagonists do not win any game during all 50 episodes. The weight of the practically certain defeats, of the changes that the characters suffer, of the early elimination at the beginning of the championship, all the disappointment experienced by the characters who fail to achieve small conquests is always reflected to the public through a dramatic formality in small details.The anime during matches gives a very significant importance to some more dramatic devices than the...occasional one. There are several things happening at the same time in small details. The anime frames the scoreboard with a distressing relationship. Each basket has a very significant weight, whether the point is for or against the characters, or if they are winning or losing a match.The result of these formal choices is never related only to the match being played. These small details are very well suited to this dramatic relationship that is very well developed and correlated with Basketball. The main characters already have a relationship linked to defeats and personal problems, or caused by themselves. Instead of the anime victimizing these actions and difficulties, it recognizes and uses them as a means for them to overcome and be able to move on.Even though the dramatic development is sensational, the way it ends in a few moments disappointed me a little. The truth is that anime most of the time works with this in a very subtle way, and even manages to finish it in the same way in some moments, but in others it does it in a very glaring way, which ends up sounding very appealing. occasional one.

I don't know, I have no clue. Anyway, the reason I'm writing this review is because I'm seeing a lot of people comparing this to Kuroko no Basket, rightfully so, they are both basketball anime. And there seems to be this idea that Ahiru no Sora is so much more realistic compared to Kuroko no basket. Well, I'm here to tell you the opposite.1. Basketball is a fast-paced game, where as the anime doesn't seem to understand this. Characters repeatedly stop during a game to talk and discuss stuff, they are...wasting time. No one playing basketball competitively is having a conversation while playing. And they take forever to get from one side of the court to another. It should take like 4 seconds max. Basketball courts are small.2. Sora's shooting mechanics are absolutely dreadful, terrible, what is he doing. In real his percentage would be much lower.3. High schoolers playing like middle schoolers. They're garbage, where is the pick and roll?4. Not enough switching and screening. Pass quicker, they 24 seconds in a shot clock. Why are they taking their time.5. Not enough offensse, sora is spending too much time chasing down what his name when he should be shooting off the pick and roll6.

At first glance, Ahiru no Sora does seem a bit plain and cliche, judging by its synopsis. The main protagonist, Sora Kuramatani lacks height and nevertheless loves playing basketball, how simple. We've seen this countless times in sports genre. However, I've learned my lesson to never judge a book by its cover, hence I decided to watch it regardless.Well, let's get straight to the point. Scew you to every single one of you who think Ahiru no Sora is good. You say Ahiru no Sora is good,...you know what I say? Your fucking opinion is shit, Ahiru no Sora is by far the worse basketball anime I've seen, period. And if you say otherwise, I hope you get killed by Kono Dio Da!!!

This show has had 3 basketball games in the course of 36 episodes and the drama in the show has been full on bait-y the entire time.  It's actually infuriating, as I want to like the show, but you really just can't enjoy it.  They set up characters specifically for them to not exist or be important in the following episode.  Every game takes roughly 8-10 episodes, with some episodes covering less than 2 minutes of game time only to show the background...story of a character that will literally never be seen after that episode.  A sad moment?  Good thing they basically told you it was gonna happen 10 episodes earlier and just slowly teased that it was about to happen for all 10 episodes so that when you finally get there, you just don't care anymore.  Love interests?  Yeah, those are complete bait and switches.  If you see two characters with chemistry that seem like they are clearly into each other, the girl will just randomly confess to being into a character that they've had no interaction with.  It's like they are purposefully making you not care about what happens each episode.  I have not watched a less satisfying and more infuriatingly unenjoyable show in my life.

As a basketball player that has played for 1st Grade basketball in Australian high schools, which is considered the highest level of high school basketball, with reps/clubs following. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime so far.Now, this anime is bound to be compared with Kuroko no Basuke,...but I will try to refrain from that as much as possible.Story: 8/10So far while watching this anime, it has made me feel that basketball is only a small part of the entire story. The real story to me is how each character changes throughout the course of high school and most importantly, it is about relationships between the characters as we watch a team mature altogether. To me, it\'s almost like a coming to age story.The whole conception of a ""short guy can\'t play basketball"" (I\'m 190 cm myself) is executed well in my opinion. But in real life basketball, a player that is 150 cm tall can be shut down easily. Every shot he would take would be blocked in high school basketball. Due to this, I do believe there is some bias towards him. With the introduction of Yozan from Yokohama Taiei, it would be interesting to see how things play out.One thing I liked in particular was that this anime went into quite a lot of detail about basketball plays, formations etc. Prior to watching this anime, I did not actually know what a ""box and 1"" formation was and learning it was quite interesting to me.The major flaw of this story was the pacing in my opinion, it was extremely inconsistent and made me scratch my head at how the story was progressing. The most tiresome part was when Kuruzyu High had the prelimination game against Shinjotawa I think it was, and that game went on for what felt like 12 episodes; which is commonly the length of some newer anime that are releasing. During these episodes of endless self soliloquy\'s by the characters, I sometimes just wanted to go watch something else. However, I feel that they captured the thrill of sport pretty well and in the end, I still sat through all of it.Art: 6/10Personally, I feel that the art and animation in this anime is their biggest flaw. They sometimes use still images and animations look relatively choppy. Characters have this weird, hard to describe face; nose is kinda big and their mouth is drawn awkwardly...Kuroko no Basuke has a LOT of basketball games and every move is animated out, shooting form, driving to the basket etc. However, in Ahiru no Sora, not much of the basketball action is animated. I don\'t often see players dribbling or any action animated out. There\'s the occasional shooting form and pass, but thats about it.In my opinion, if they animated scenes like this better, the enjoyment factor for many viewers would increase drastically.Sound: 9/10Now, hear me out here. All 4 openings for Ahiru no Sora have been FIRE!!! My personal favourite is Humming Bird... like DAAAMMMNNNN BROO!!Background music is pretty good as well.Voice acting is okay, I think the actors capture their characters pretty well and it also represents the thrill during actual basketball games.Characters: 7/10Characters are mediocre at best. Why, you ask?They\'re all really similar, in that they all have some sort of ridiculous face they pull when another character says something stupid - or they deliver punchlines yelling. But, despite that, the characters get real when they have to. The comedy is repetitive, but I don\'t mind it. There isn\'t much character development in this anime, other than maybe Chucky, Nabe and Yasuhara realising how cool the sport is.When I\'m watching a high school anime, or an anime with protagonists around my age. I tend to think, could I get on well with these characters in real life? Or, how will these characters be like in real life? It sounds ridiculous I know, but this is how I analyse characters and rate their likeability.Speaking of likeability, none of the characters in this show are too obnoxious. Except for Taro maybe, stop fawning over Nanao she\'s your cousin bro move to Alabama for that jesus... Oh yeah and Kite needs to stop being a jackass and work with his team.Enjoyment: 10/10Overall, I quite enjoyed this anime, but not purely from that perspective. I think the main reason to why I kept on watching this show was because of my own passion for basketball. Similarly, I have quite a few friends that play volleyball and yes, they like Haikyuu. When you\'re passionate about something, you want to consume more of it. On a rainy day where I can\'t go out to play, the latest episode of this show would do it for me. Now, you can say that I am biased because of that. You know what? You\'re right, but then again this is my review and all reviews are biased in some way.This anime made its way into my favourites, but maybe not for the best reasons. I probably like basketball so much, anything basketball related just becomes a favourite of mine LMAOOverall: 8/10This was just the average of all the other sections LOLI strongly recommend this anime if you\'re into basketball, or sports anime in general. But be prepared for a ridiculously long basketball arc and repetitive comedy.Thank you so much for reading my first review! I hope it was somewhat helpful (I doubt it) and I hope you\'ll have a great day/night whatever it is for you. but I will try to refrain from that as much as possible.Story: 8/10So far while watching this anime, it has made me feel that basketball is only a small part of the entire story.

To me, it\'s almost like a coming to age story.The whole conception of a ""short guy can\'t play basketball"" (I\'m 190 cm myself) is executed well in my opinion. But in real life basketball, a player that is 150 cm tall can be shut down easily. Every shot he would take would be blocked in high school basketball. Due to this, I do believe there is some bias towards him. With the introduction of Yozan from Yokohama Taiei, it would be interesting to see how things play out.One thing I liked in particular was that this anime went into quite a lot of detail about basketball plays, formations etc. Prior to watching this anime, I did not actually know what a ""box and 1"" formation was and learning it was quite interesting to me.The major flaw of this story was the pacing in my opinion, it was extremely inconsistent and made me scratch my head at how the story was progressing. The most tiresome part was when Kuruzyu High had the prelimination game against Shinjotawa I think it was, and that game went on for what felt like 12 episodes; which is commonly the length of some newer anime that are releasing. During these episodes of endless self soliloquy\'s by the characters, I sometimes just wanted to go watch something else. However, I feel that they captured the thrill of sport pretty well and in the end, I still sat through all of it.Art: 6/10Personally, I feel that the art and animation in this anime is their biggest flaw. They sometimes use still images and animations look relatively choppy. Characters have this weird, hard to describe face; nose is kinda big and their mouth is drawn awkwardly...Kuroko no Basuke has a LOT of basketball games and every move is animated out, shooting form, driving to the basket etc. However, in Ahiru no Sora, not much of the basketball action is animated. I don\'t often see players dribbling or any action animated out. There\'s the occasional shooting form and pass, but thats about it.In my opinion, if they animated scenes like this better, the enjoyment factor for many viewers would increase drastically.Sound: 9/10Now, hear me out here. All 4 openings for Ahiru no Sora have been FIRE!!! My personal favourite is Humming Bird... like DAAAMMMNNNN BROO!!Background music is pretty good as well.Voice acting is okay, I think the actors capture their characters pretty well and it also represents the thrill during actual basketball games.Characters: 7/10Characters are mediocre at best. Why, you ask?They\'re all really similar, in that they all have some sort of ridiculous face they pull when another character says something stupid - or they deliver punchlines yelling. But, despite that, the characters get real when they have to. The comedy is repetitive, but I don\'t mind it. There isn\'t much character development in this anime, other than maybe Chucky, Nabe and Yasuhara realising how cool the sport is.When I\'m watching a high school anime, or an anime with protagonists around my age. I tend to think, could I get on well with these characters in real life? Or, how will these characters be like in real life? It sounds ridiculous I know, but this is how I analyse characters and rate their likeability.Speaking of likeability, none of the characters in this show are too obnoxious. Except for Taro maybe, stop fawning over Nanao she\'s your cousin bro move to Alabama for that jesus... Oh yeah and Kite needs to stop being a jackass and work with his team.Enjoyment: 10/10Overall, I quite enjoyed this anime, but not purely from that perspective. I think the main reason to why I kept on watching this show was because of my own passion for basketball. Similarly, I have quite a few friends that play volleyball and yes, they like Haikyuu. When you\'re passionate about something, you want to consume more of it. On a rainy day where I can\'t go out to play, the latest episode of this show would do it for me. Now, you can say that I am biased because of that. You know what? You\'re right, but then again this is my review and all reviews are biased in some way.This anime made its way into my favourites, but maybe not for the best reasons. I probably like basketball so much, anything basketball related just becomes a favourite of mine LMAOOverall: 8/10This was just the average of all the other sections LOLI strongly recommend this anime if you\'re into basketball, or sports anime in general. But be prepared for a ridiculously long basketball arc and repetitive comedy.Thank you so much for reading my first review! I hope it was somewhat helpful (I doubt it) and I hope you\'ll have a great day/night whatever it is for you.', ""As a basketball player myself, these series are a big disappointment from a basketball point of view. Clearly creator doesn't know a thing about a game, probably just googled some information before hand. I suggest to talk with someone who's actually playing the game to know how it works.Characters are blunt, conversations are beyond stupid, animation is lazy. When you doing a sport anime series and all the action is just a one image. I have no idea how these series getting that high of a score (probably just because people that watch doesn't know anything about basketball as well, so they thing they...are getting good information) Trying to finish series just because I started it. are getting good information) Trying to finish series just because I started it."", ""The show starts out really well. All the characters are introduced one after the other and all of them are great. The starting few matches are really great as well. Most of Kuzuryu's players are inexperienced and hence they lose a lot of their starting few matches which makes sense. The players from the other teams like Konishi, Chiba san, Tokiwa and Nanao's cousin are all really lovable characters. After playing a few practice matches and gathering a full team, they finally get to an official match. I really liked the fact that they gave some history to the opposition they faced in the official...match. But this is where the anime starts its downward spiral. Kuzuryu plays really well creating a substantial point difference between themselves and the opponents. At this point the Kuzuryu players start to get tired. Although this makes sense for the others, it doesn't for specifically Tobi and Sora. Sora is shown to have amazing stamina running 10 kms everyday, attending practice and classes and then doing 1000 3 pointer shoots. Tobi was someone who was a regular in his middle school team and hence had played many matches before. This didn't make any sense to me. Regardless Kuzuryu soldiered on. There were 3 seconds remaining on the clock. Nanao is able to accurately predict who is going to receive the pass after the rebound. Sora goes to block him from making a shoot or even receiving the pass in the first place. Moreover the player was not adept at making 3 pointers as he had failed until now. I though that the victory was in the bag but suddenly we cut to Sora's mom dying. I liked her but this abrupt cut made me really angry. Sora tells her that they won the match and I feel great but then we find out that they actually lost. I calmed myself and moved on but they burnt down their club building to force character development and romance. That angered me even further. Not only that they did that through a cigarette which fell along with juice and chips packets. This means that the cigarette fell on a damp floor away from inflammable objects and set the whole building on fire. Next Nabe accepts a practice match invitation from the best team in their area. We already know that they are going to lose terribly yet that match is extremely long and boring. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone past the official match. match.

It\'s not the action that I enjoy but the relationships between the characters and their motivations to achieve a common goal that gets to me. Ahiru no Sora does it really well and in my opinion rivals other notable sports anime like Haikyuu and Ping Pong the Animation. I\'ll run through a few categories like the story and characterization to elaborate on my opinions.For the story, it\'s not intense like Kuroko no Basuke in terms of action but it does specialize in emotional breadth. There isn\'t a villain/rival that threatens the main...cast or gorgeous animated combat scenes to excite the viewer. This anime in contrast provokes sympathy for the characters when they meet an obstacle they can\'t overcome with the usual sports anime kit. That kit being a new special move they\'ve been working on, or a latent talent suddenly sprouting in the heat of battle.Instead, the newly formed basketball team of delinquents takes what they have (some raw talent/interest in the sport) and puts it all on the grind stone. Whether their efforts will bear fruit is never certain. The power they draw from their ambitions is transient and as fragile as real life (they\'re only high school students). The MC has a genuine love of the sport and lights a fire in the other members to join him, but basketball quickly proves to test everyone\'s mental and physical strength. Watching the cast bond and develop a network of trust during those slumps was inspiring for me.Leading into the characterization, this is where I feel that it really shines. The Kuzuryu basketball team\'s small roster is held together by that network of trust and proves that it can accomplish some incredible feats. When those inevitable bumps in the road hit hard, the show explores the psychological state of the cast in meaningful ways that deepened my emotional investment.When it dives in, you find that each character\'s reasoning for playing is its own separate arc and is all tied together through the MC. He\'s like the open sky that the others watch in awe; that boundless resilience of his serves as a platform for each of them to soar up and above to find what they\'re seeking in life. The threat of falling out of that sky and plummeting back down is terrifying, but man; if that ain\'t life. The maturity and growth gained from those experiences is what it\'s all about.The life lessons this anime offers are valuable in my opinion. I find it incredibly enjoyable, so much so that hearing the beginning of the third OP, ""Hummingbird"" by Blue Encount, makes me cry instantaneously. I\'m a big softie and this show is what I\'ve looked forward to most each week. I\'m elated that it\'s getting 50 episodes and will dearly miss it when it finishes airing. Highly recommended for viewers with patience and life experience. cast or gorgeous animated combat scenes to excite the viewer.

Highly recommended for viewers with patience and life experience.', 'I do not know how anyone can honestly give this anime above anything above a five. This anime is 50 episodes of useless flashbacks. Flashbacks being overused like this probably can work in a manga, but watching a five minute flashback of nothingness while someone is mid jumpshot or layup is absurd. Towards the end of the anime random characters were getting their own flashbacks and monologues. This would be okay if this anime had interesting characters- which it does not. I will review each of the main characters; the starting five to be specific.1. Sora (PG/SG) - The main protagonist. He is short, about...5 ft even which is straight up unrealistic for even high school basketball. Sora is absurdly boring. Absolutely no development as a character even after something tragic happens to him. it doesn\'t really change him. He is the exact same character from episode one all the way up to episode 50. His basketball skills are very poor besides his shooting (his good shooting doesn\'t make up for all the other shortcomings), he doesn\'t have any real positive traits like being smart or anything. He\'s as boring of a protagonist as Gon from HxH.2. Momoharu (PF/C) - The team captain...who can\'t play a lick of basketball. I watched 50 episodes of this guy being a complete moron. I will admit he did change from through the season for the better- sort of. He is still an idiot academically and his basketball skills did not improve at all through out the 50 episodes. He was one of the characters that made this anime hard to watch. He is so bad at basketball. I think 50 episodes is more than enough to show improvement of a character\'s skill. Even Hanamichi (Slam Dunk) showed improvement faster, but Hanamichi was the only garbage basketball player on his team.3. Chaiki (PG/SF/C) - Easily my favorite character. I don\'t exactly know what the writer(s) were trying to do with Chaiki. He was already naturally good at basketball having great point guard skills and the ability to score. He made this anime somewhat watchable. He didn\'t make me groan whenever he got screen time.4. Tobi (Natsume) (SF/SG) - This fake Allen Iverson wannabe made the anime so irritating. This is one of the worst generic character types to have in an anime. The ""too cool"" arrogant jerk. At one point I would consider him the best player on the team but I\'d honestly say Chaiki is better than him just for being more useful on the court. Tobi is easily just a merchandise seller. The most random thing about Tobi is that towards the end his basketball skills completely vanish. He played like garbage.5. Shigeyoshi (C/PF) - Honestly I don\'t have much to say about him. He isn\'t terrible at basketball, he has his flaws like his poor stamina and anxiety, but he was not infuriating to see on the screen. He came in pretty late in the anime so he didn\'t get a fair chance to grow imo.Save yourself the time and trouble and just watch Kuroko No Basket or Slam Dunk. If you seen both of those, skip this one. It is boring. This anime tried to steer away from being like the other basketball anime, but does it so poorly. I\'d rather a knock off of Slam Dunk or KnB than this mess. Why would anyone want to watch a sports anime where the roster is terrible at the sport? Even so, the characters aren\'t even interesting! It would be okay if the characters were interesting, but just bad at the sport. Slam Dunk is about 25 years older than this anime, and does everything so much better. We actually watch Hanamichi grow from some degenerate thug into a hard working athlete. I know some people will either tell me to read the manga or wait for the next season, but that is not acceptable. 50 episodes are more than enough to tell a story. This anime can be summed up as poor writing and pacing. I knew this anime was a going to get a 3-4 from me around the 30th episode mark. 5 ft even which is straight up unrealistic for even high school basketball. Sora is absurdly boring.

It does start to pick up the pace after a few episodes tho. One thing that you have to keep in mind if you choose to watch this is that the source material for this was released in 2003.

I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in real quick.The sports anime is usually not the genre I get into but I like the MC in this one so I stuck with it. He is a generally likable and has a good attitude. But of course he is likable because he is the underdog of the show. He is the little guy with a a lot of fight in him and his goal is to win the inter high basketball tournament like his mom.The other characters are where I have a problem. They have barely any...skill yet are a bunch of ne'er do wells who for some reason hang out in the basketball club. Now I get we are to watch them grow but their skills are so unbelievably bad. Here is an example: Momoharu is incapable of scoring a single basket EVEN WHEN HE GOES FOR A DUNK! I know I have no place on a court but even I can at least get 2 or 3 baskets in out of maybe 10 shots, but this dude is like cursed to NEVER make a single basket even when it is handed to him. I can't say much about the others because even though it has been 12 episodes there hasn't really been any growth or time to get to know them and their strengths all that much.The art and sound is pretty good, especially the sound because it does a good job at mimicking the sounds I would here at a real basketball game. All in all, a solid basketball anime but I think Kuroko no Basket is still better skill yet are a bunch of ne'er do wells who for some reason hang out in the basketball club.

I can't say much about the others because even though it has been 12 episodes there hasn't really been any growth or time to get to know them and their strengths all that much.The art and sound is pretty good, especially the sound because it does a good job at mimicking the sounds I would here at a real basketball game. All in all, a solid basketball anime but I think Kuroko no Basket is still better"", ""“These are my wings.” - Sora KurumataniWell, with the first season nearing its close. Ahiru no Sora was in my eyes... fairly decent, there was just a lot of flaws that Diomedea themselves can fix on in the second season if it does get renewed.Now, let's get on to my ratings of the show.Story: 6/10I wouldn't say it's a generic plot, there isn't many that sports animes that at first glance the player looks trash but turns out to be a good player for the team; there's only three I can pick out that have the same some sort of plot:- Kuroko no Basket:...Kuroko didn't have the strength or even body qualifications for a basketball player, he is not good at dribbling with the ball but then turned out to be a good addition to Seirin High School's basketball team with his incredible passing technique.- Haikyuu!!: I do not watch Haikyuu, but all I know that at first glance Hinata didn't look like a good addition to the Karasuno High volleyball team but then he has the ability jump high.Then this anime, Ahiru no Sora where the MC is incredibly small and has a passion for basketball despite him being a short ass but pretty much has the ability to sink three pointers at any time and any place.I would give this a seven, but the thing is the pacing of the series is shockingly slow; the date I wrote this is on the 16th of September (2020) and I'm pretty much up to date; the match between Kuzuryu and Yokohama Taiei take up the space of 4 episodes when you can barely cram it into two whole episodes, which isn't that hard!Art: 5/10I am not a fan of the huge, huge lips. At some points the art looks a little bit dodgy, I pause to get something to eat then I just see a frame that looks quite dodgy. At points their faces look really tiny too; the art is slightly mediocre.Sound: 6/10The fourth ending sounds quite good, the rest sound alright. I didn't like the first opening, same with the endings. They were alright too.The character's voices really link to their characteristics which I really like, at the start of the series Momoharu's personality was lazy and he acted like a douchebag; and his voice in the series linked to his douchebag and lazy personality which I really liked. Sora's voice was pretty alright too, the voice actor for Sora was Yuki Kaji, who voice acted in Black Butler, High School DxD and many other shows; the sound effects were okay as well, 6/10 on my end though.Character: 7/10Character development wise, I sort of liked it. Unlike others, they didn't like the fact that the character development is as slow as the pacing of matches in the episodes; but I sort of enjoyed the backstory of some characters!Enjoyment: 8/10So far, I am enjoying the series to it's fullest. My schedule is all over the place when it comes to watching anime, but when an episode comes out I'll probably watch the whole 20 minutes of an episode.Overall: 7/10I physically can't put it higher than a seven, a seven is probably the pinnacle it can go when it comes to rating in this show and some people will agree on that note. Some people will go lower than a seven, which I can sort of understand.There are just some parts in the show that they could animate instead of just putting a still image as the frame, which blows my mind. Some of these frames animated would make the show more better. About a basketball game (anime or in real life) is about the action and the intensity, there is no action in a basketball anime with just still images as a frame.Overall, a 7/10; the show was quite decent, and I'll probably give the second season a watch if they renew it for a second season. For now, I'll just wait and see.

The story revolves around our main boi Sora who loves to play basketball but he's so smol AF. Entering Kuzu High and starting a basketball career is not an easy task to do not because of his short stature but because of the unique characters that he will be meeting. The unique side of this anime ( and the main reason why i love this anime) is all of the character have nothing special in them and they are treated as failures...because they are delinquents. At first am really not liking this anime but the story itself is really realistic for a sports anime and how sports can actually discipline people! The story revolves around all of the character trying to do their best not to improve in the sport of basketball but to improve their own self as well.But the biggest downside of Ahiru no Sora is the animation itself. So i understand why many people will drop this anime. During important scenes or episode that they having a match with another team. Animation will become lazy af i dont know the reason maybe because of low budget. You just watching Freezed panel with sounds. It's like reading manga with sound lmao. It's really dissapointing. It is the only donwfall of this anime but damn boi, that's the biggest reason why you would watch an anime right? specially if it was adopted from a manga. and it's a fucking sports anime.Fortunately sounds in the anime is amazing. OP and ED really made me LSS for a long period of time. I really love them and i really love good OP with good animation in it to make you hype a little for the anime itself. Sometimes i was confused why the OP have much better animation than the actual anime itself XDD Character background and determination is really good also. The story will greatly focus on each individual backstory of the main team but not so much for the other team (maybe a little but not much like haikyuu and such) but this anime really is enjoyable because of the characters itself.

Plus I might get angry because I am not a fan of cancellations of anime series.Anyway, waiting for Season 2.Of course, reading the manga is another option, but I like seeing it animated and all.

For anyone that is a big basketball fan more so anyone that plays it will really appreciate this show.The main down falls is the overall pacing in some sections is very slow and if i was not watching this in a weekly basis it would be more of an issue. The other issue is that the art is pretty basic and music scores are just okay, i...feel that this is more of an issue with the budget but there is not much that can be done about that other than to hope they can continue the show and improve it.Overall this could be a top tier show but is just missing a couple things feel that this is more of an issue with the budget but there is not much that can be done about that other than to hope they can continue the show and improve it.Overall this could be a top tier show but is just missing a couple things', ""STORY (6/10): The story itself isn't bad, but the way that anime presents with that slow paced show, make it look worse. All the emotional parts was truly good for the development of the characters, but as I say before, the rhythm wasn't collaborating wtih what the story suggests. The major problem of the story is the pace.ART (7/10): Some say that the art isn't good but for me, for what they purposed. This anime is NOT a sports anime, it's a drama anime surrounded by a sport background. Just see that even a single time the anime focus on the moves, but yet...on the story of which character. The art is for a drama-comedy anime with a sports direction on the plot. That's why the art is good, because they clearly complete for what they purpose.SOUND (6/10): The sound is very good when it comes to music. But sound itself it's different from music, and that's the problem. The anime doesn't have a good sound design when it comes off the story, in the matches for example. So it wasn't good but also it wasn't complete trash, I would say as the rate says: fairCHARACTER (8/10): The very best part of the anime is how they develop the emotional part of very each character, and how they use that emotional part into others and into the sport itself. I mean, Momoharu was the best character so far in the anime by the things that he say and felt, not because of him at the basketball match.ENJOYMENT (7/10): I really appreciate the anime, but the slow pace at the story and plot, really got on my nerves. I understand it is a narrative style remembering the old sports animes and manga (80s/90s style to be more accurate). So, about this, they could step further a little faster considering that the story that they tell, wasn't so necessary to spend that much time on the games, because the characters are evolving, not the match itself.OVERALL (7/10): It's an unfair comparision to Kuroko no Basket for example, because Kuroko is bad. Kuroko is a shonen with no character development and good animation so stop do this. If you want to compare with an anime we have the old good classic Slam Dunk and the underappreciate Dear Boys (good old times from animax here at my country). Both this animes use the basket, the sport, to tell a story and not the otherside as happens in Kuroko. The drama and characters evolve with the narrative construction alongside with the games. I truly recommend Ahiru no Sora and Dear Boys as equal, because they are truly similar. And if not watch Slam Dunk, give your a life a good reason and never watch Kuroko again. on the story of which character. The art is for a drama-comedy anime with a sports direction on the plot.

This series will be either a hit or miss for you.This series starts with a pretty generic protagonist, combating an equally generic struggle surrounding the sport he loves: he's always been benched. Sora's your average underdog story, a guy who loves the game, plays well, but has never been given the chance to fulfill his full potential due to his height. As with most sports anime, we meet some colorful characters on his team, and uncover their own difficulties and inspirations involving basketball, too.Regarding the anime, the art isn't my favorite, as the characters are a little too doughy and...soft.  Kuroko no Basket has a firmness to their characters, with sharp lines, vivid colors and shadows, which helps really bring the characters' athletic bodies and abilities into view. Ahiru no Sora has an art style that resembles popular shoujo, like NANA and Paradise Kiss, having all characters, male or female, with full lips, wide focused eyes, and other soft features. However, I will say that in contrast to KNB, the characters look like actual high schoolers, as opposed to the former, which where most of the players already look college aged.The opening and ending music is really good so far. You can't go wrong with the Pillows, and it makes for an opening that gets you pumped and ready to, as a sport's anime should.What really makes this series shine is the commitment to the explanations of basketball. KNB would often sprinkle game plays and moves here and there when a questioning character asked, but Ahiru no Sora is thorough, and very well spoken when it comes to describing the techniques, positions and dynamics of basketball. I was really surprised to see such a great detail added to the show! It makes watching even more fun when you know exactly what they're referring to.The animation is decent, lacking some luster, but the characters are fun and the humor is there on the rebound. I'm a sucker for delinquent characters, and to have an entire basketball team full of them is a dream come true. There's also a great emphasis on the female characters, a detail I loved in KNB with the coaches/managers.I watch the dub and the sub, and for the dub watchers out there: almost half the Haikyuu cast is voicing this series. It's really distracting, when a lot of the same voice actors from another sports anime are on your screen again, in different forms. Good performances, just distracting.Not a revolutionary series, nor is the animation something you'll marvel at, but a fun ride nonetheless, with a batch of kids you're sure to love.

After I started noticing how many stand-alone frames they used it just killed the anime atmosfere.The music/OSTs are cheap and mediocre, barely enough ""hype"" for the scenes.The character development after the initial ones from the fake basket club is at best mediocre. All...personal problems are just solved out of nowhere.They focus way too much on the matches. When you have such low quality animation the best you could to would be focus more on the background stories (ex. sora\'s mother, madoka\'s relation with sora, Tobi\'s family problems. It could have a decent story development even with this low quality produced anime. Instead, they just focus on the mediocre basket matches and the backstories are almost forgotten after a couple of minutes they are shown.I started with a 7.5 in this show but I\'m forced to lower it to 6 at best and if the Climax of the anime don\'t get this better I\'ll give it a 4, the only thing making me stick to watching it is that I already invested so many episodes into this show and it\'s a weekly show, as for now this show has almost 0 value of watching if anyone want to watch it after the season is over2nd score: 6Update: 28/50 epsmore than the avarage episodes for 1 season\'s anime have passed and I still don\'t care about most of the characters, the story between the tobi\'s sister and sora\'s mother still makes me interessed but the producers still seem to not care about it. this anime is getting less enjoyable every week, its always the same thing, no more character development, same jokes, same boring games3rd score: 4/5Update: ep 35In the last episodes the show really started being better, the animation is still garbage and the first half of this show was bad as i said above. This said, it was worth watching until now for this last episodes, it wont fix any of the problems it had before and with this quality the max i would give would be a 8 if everything else was perfect, but it\'s not. either way I will jump my score to a 64th score: 6 personal problems are just solved out of nowhere.They focus way too much on the matches.

Characters tho, kind of lacking. It also lost its hype over time.The whole basketball team kinda had the same personality, making it hard for me to find a real favorite I'd be invested in. Which a show like Haikyuu does really well as they all are so very different. In Ahiru no sora, that just wasn't the case. They all had this delinquent kind of personality like they were in the hood or something. I mean if you like that, go for this anime. At first, I thought...these mean dudes trying to work together and learn basketball was kind of cute. But after 14 episodes of it, it got boring. Now, I may be a little harsh to say they were all the same, they were in fact different people. Some were calm but mean and others were funny but mean, etc. But they all just had this, as I said before, delinquent kind of feel which I personally got bored of.Right, enough about the character! I'll keep the rest short! The jokes! I must say were amazing. On-point and kind of unpredictable. I know I dissed the delinquent personalities but there came some nice jokes out of it. Maybe if they had mixed the delinquents with some other personalities I might have liked it more.The overall hype for the anime was great at first. An underdog story with wholesome motives. But after a while the hype kind of died out to me. There was too much backstory and not enough action with matches etc. Maybe If I had stuck to it 5 more episodes it might have gotten better but I didn't feel like staying to find out.Finally, should you give this a watch? Sure, if you like delinquents trying to learn basketball. If you don't like that, I'd say give it a shot for the humor and wholesomeness. But if you have to have more variety in characters and action-packed, fast phased story, this isn't for you. these mean dudes trying to work together and learn basketball was kind of cute.

In fact, it honestly barely even qualifies as good.  For a shounen sports anime, it’s distractingly lacking in its visuals, the character designs are rather ugly, and on most technical details it’s unremarkable at best.  If any of the above sound like dealbreakers to you, then give this one a pass.  If you’re more interested in the journey only a long shounen can offer, however, read on.  This show may be exactly what you’re looking for.  As an aside, I have not read the manga, this is my anime-only opinion.The show’s strongest aspect...is how it nails its premise, one which is unique by shounen standards (though considering the age of the genre I’m probably wrong on that).  Kurumatani Sora is a skilled high school basketball player who is hampered by his short height.  OK, so maybe it’s not all unique in our world with Haikyuu, but what’s more interesting is that his high school’s basketball team consists of a bunch of hoodlums who don’t actually care about basketball and are only members since the school requires every student to join a sports team.  The plot, rather than angling at Sora ejecting the punks and replacing them with different students who want to play basketball, takes the more interesting path as a redemption story.Watching just how much these kids change from the anime’s beginning to its end is one of the most satisfying experiences I’ve had watching an anime in the past year.  The transition these punks go through is incredibly seamless and natural.  They don’t just become radically different characters between episodes, though of course some episodes create more change than others.  I honestly can’t stress enough just how well done these characters’ evolution is, it’s absolutely the handsomest peacock feather in this anime’s cap.The characters are enjoyable outside of just their development, too.  They’re all actually written like people, and as a result I had no trouble remembering all of their names, no mean feat in a genre as saturated as sports.  One set of characters I particularly want to draw attention to are, ironically enough, the team’s benchwarmers.  Usually benchwarmers in sports shows are a bit on the dull side, even with more critically acclaimed shows like Kuroko no Basket and Haikyuu.  But between how there are fewer of them then your average show and the shows’ character focus, the benchwarmers are as memorable as the rest of the cast.  While this normally would be something I would point to as a negative, here it’s instead a testament to just how great this cast is.Also good is all the show’s OPs and EDs.  The songs are all enjoyable listens and the openings and endings themselves are very well put together.  They’re more memorable than the show itself in some ways.  You’d hope the first one, Happy Go Ducky, would be anyway, because that one’s from The Pillows of FL;CL fame.  I know right?Unfortunately, nothing else about the show is anything more than average.  Your average episode is standard outside of the overarching story; just normal, sometimes goofy shounen stuff.  Animation is adequate, but obviously cheaply made, which is harder to forgive when you’re a sports show and your main drawing point is supposed to be killer action shots.  Lined up next to other stuff airing during this show’s run, the characters look rather distractingly ugly.  Usually this isn’t something I pay attention to, and even in this case I didn’t particularly mind, but if even I’m noticing it then I can definitely see this being a deal-breaker for some people.In every episode there’s a scene where a cool basketball scene action, and in every episode I failed to follow where the hell the ball was moving during these scenes.  One moment the ball is in basketball man’s hands, the next moment it cuts away to basketball man doing some cool basketball-related technique in a dimension with no background, and then it cuts again to show basketball going into the net.  It’s all really silly and tacky, and I don’t think that’s what the show’s staff had in mind as they were making this.  It’s enough to communicate the point, but not much else.Perhaps worse of all for me was that the writing beyond the main story line simply isn’t all that great.  The jokes occasionally elicited a chuckle or so out of me, and the side stories could be heartwarming at times, but overall nothing really stood out.  And that’s really the show’s biggest problem, nothing stands out, it’s just an average shounen that just so happened to nail its premise to such a degree that I could get through the whole thing.  I honestly don’t have any regrets about watching it the whole way through, but it’s hard for me to recommend this to someone unless they’re looking for this particular kind of redemption story.If you’re looking for a good redemption story with memorable characters and the visual aspect of anime is less important to you, this may just be what you’re looking for.  Even if you just can’t get past how bad the show can look at times, I’d say it’s definitely worth checking out the manga at the very least if anything I’ve written here has persuaded you.

Great premise, poor writing. Dialogue is repetitive and offensive to the ears. Cliche and repeat phrases litter each and every episode so much so, you could use this anime as the basis for a drinking game. However beware you might come away with some alcohol...poisoning.Next art and animation...no budget here or what? Oh sorry, they blew it all on stupidly paced and over exaggerated fifty episodes. Twice the time, half the story. Stills overused, sloppy animation and terrible character designs reign supreme. Who in their right minds draws characters that look like they just had their jaw jacked and their lips fattening up due to the impact?Characters, yep dull lifeless and boring. Most you could give two Shit$ less about because well you know, more cliches. Half of them were irrelevent to the story except being used for garbage plot devices.

Nope, kind of felt like I paid $200 for a hamburger and only got a pickle slice. Will you enjoy it? Probably not if your wanting to see a sports anime where the little guy overcomes all obstacles to fulfill his desires. But if your into crappy interpersonal type slice of life because your life sucks and you want to watch other peoples life's suck, yep, 100%.In closing....those lips?!?

because I want to say my opinions on this anime, and I am gonna make this as short as possible.First, the Story - I like the story so far, I can confidently say that it has the most simple story. but it doesn't mean it's bad, it just means that you can't really do anything about it being simple because it's a sports anime in highschool setting. these story you can definitely connect to because of how realistic it can be. that said, the realism aspect of it might bore some people because it's not exciting enough for them...to continue watching it.  so with that in mind, I gave the story a 7/10. it's a good story with believable characters and simple (and hard) dream. which is to make it to inter-high.Art - I like the artstyle, especially the Openings. the animation of the openings is amazing, it's like they spend the most of their budget in it. why did I say that? because the animation is bad, like when I watch this anime, I feel like watching a slideshow with a little animation just to say it's an Anime. so as much as I want to give it a higher score, a solid 6/10 would be the right thing to score it.Sound - the sound is fair, and it's actually because of the animation that also ruined the sound, like some sounds it doesn't fit the animation because it just wasn't given enough information as to what sound it should play. so 6/10Character - I'd say they are good, but they are not great. i don't know what else to say here, so I'd give it a 6/10and the score that only matters, my Personal Enjoymentwell, So far I am enjoying this anime because I know that this is like Slam dunk of my generation, and that It's rare to see a good basketball anime. I have been a fan of Sports Anime for years now and some of them are just not that good. this one has potential to be great but the studio that handling it (Diomedea) aren't doing a great job at it (So far) but I have been hook because the story is good and it interest me. so yeah.thank you for reading it up until here, If you have some comebacks regarding some of my points, you can message me directly here on MAL and I'd like to hear your opinions.THANKS!!!! to continue watching it.  so with that in mind, I gave the story a 7/10. it's a good story with believable characters and simple (and hard) dream. which is to make it to inter-high.Art - I like the artstyle, especially the Openings. the animation of the openings is amazing, it's like they spend the most of their budget in it. why did I say that? because the animation is bad, like when I watch this anime, I feel like watching a slideshow with a little animation just to say it's an Anime. so as much as I want to give it a higher score, a solid 6/10 would be the right thing to score it.Sound - the sound is fair, and it's actually because of the animation that also ruined the sound, like some sounds it doesn't fit the animation because it just wasn't given enough information as to what sound it should play. so 6/10Character - I'd say they are good, but they are not great. i don't know what else to say here, so I'd give it a 6/10and the score that only matters, my Personal Enjoymentwell, So far I am enjoying this anime because I know that this is like Slam dunk of my generation, and that It's rare to see a good basketball anime.

Many unnecessary episodes(ex. ep 38, a whole episode wasted on looking for Madoka's lost earring)Characters-4Then there's the characters, most of them are annoying, i'm still wondering why Madoka is even a (MAIN) character . Like how? Seriously I thought this was a sport anime surrounded around the development of the team, Nanao's not even a main character.

Many unnecessary episodes(ex. ep 38, a whole episode wasted on looking for Madoka's lost earring)Characters-4Then there's the characters, most of them are annoying, i'm still wondering why Madoka is even a (MAIN) character . Like how? Seriously I thought this was a sport anime surrounded around the development of the team, Nanao's not even a main character.

Art & background music were fine.  i wished they played real matches more than practice. Also i don't get why every PRACTICE  match had to be about 10 episodes long.If it gets another season i hope they play more real matches.But i liked the emotional part & comedy part of the anime. To put it simply, if one wants to watch this anime, they shouldn't place more expectations like that of kuroko no baske.Another good point of this anime is that the amateur basketball players like me can relate plays...& mistakes in this anime. & mistakes in this anime."", ""A good spokon, if it has a second season it will break your heart.

Why did he choose this school? Well it was to be closer to his mom who we then learn was hospitalized, that’s basically the sum of it. However I will say later on in the story they really just drag the episode which gets annoying.Art-5It’s pretty ugly not going to lie but why a 5 you may ask? Simply for the fact that I can tell if it’s a character from this series by how it’s drawn...this different to say the least.Sound-6They had maybe two decent good ops ,but what I really liked was the endings they had emotion every time you finished a episode if you get what I mean voice acting was good I’d say not the best but not bad but the swish the ball would make when they scored was amazing.Characters-9Cmon now, CMON NOW what can I say the character development in this series was amazing first we have natsume he went from this “thug” always fighting to being way more controlling over himself for his little sister, he has the same goal as SORA does with trying to take his team to the top, and always gets better when he looses, so his sister can be proud of him and see him succeed. Momoharu, dam he really did grow up a lot to say the least he went from always fighting arguing to being a decent team captain, being way more serious at basketball then we was before, getting better at basketball, he basically just grew up. He had a better understanding of life after the whole incident.  Chiaki he’s just doing his thing I guess nothing to crazy going on with him. Shigeyoshi nothing to crazy bout him as well he just trying way more and finally found the love for basketball he once has when he was younger. Shinichi separated from his two friends and grew a lot into this person that didn’t know a single thing about basketball to someone somewhat reliable at least way more then he was before. Nabe and Chuckie, wow just wow it really wasn’t much but I liked the side story (kinda) of how those kids wanted to play basketball but the older kids wouldn’t let them so Nabe and Chuckie tried to help (after quitting/leaving the team) ,and after they got wiped buy these middle schoolers or elementary I forgot, they both asked how they lost, to which the kids responded about how they wanted to be the best at what they do and want no one to stop them. This opened their Eyes and found a new respect for the game then they came back the same not better at all but with a new mentality for the game. Satsuki sensei, wow as well what I can I say about him, he struck with the team even tho it looked like the team was going nowhere because he saw hope, and you can really tell he loved this team even missing his unborn child’s birth to watch the deciding game even though they where bound to loose. Madoka was eh just eh may be kind of salty because she chose momoharu, but it doesn’t even end there she was kinda how do I say this... messing around with other guys after momoharu said no and I don’t mean in a you know.... anyways, next person. Nao, just yes, really. She is the coach for the team, and wow (sorry for saying wow so much) she really brought a uncoordinated team to become a serious threat in due time, she’s really smart for her age and what she does it’s just amazing, but how did this amazing coach become their coach? She met sora, sora taught her that height doesn’t define what you can do, all you have to do is try. I also like the little romance that’s kinda happening, but after this last episode I feel like there’s way more to her so I want to see how she develops. Sora, just amazing before we even begin the majority of why all these characters changed( not all but had at least somewhat part in them) was because of him, he was their light to see everything a new way. Now let’s begin this first season we didn’t see much development from him he started off as a already amazing basketball player, that shocked a lot of people because of how short he was. He did change however after he lost in the prelims he tried even harder, but it hit him different because of what happened (to much of a big spoiler) not a lot of character development ,but slight I feel like the next season will focus more on that well at least I hope.

Overall I really wanted to like this show but some stuff was just not up to par, maybe its because I got spoiled by Haikyuu and expect all sports anime to be that good.Story - The story is pretty good for the most part but when the first real game starts the pace is just really slow and it gets kind of boring because nothing new really happens, each individual point drags on forever.Art - Everyone in this show has serious duck pout face all the time, and the basketball scenes are...pretty janky and are like a slideshow sometimes. The basketball scenes are supposed to be the peak of the shows where the use most of the animation budget but they just seem kind of badSound - The soundtrack was actually the best part of the show, they have a lot of really nice alt rock and punk tracks that fit the whole idea of a group of misfits making a basketball teamCharacter - I think all the characters backstories and how everyone interacts is all pretty good, but I feel like Sora is so short its not remotely realistic. If he was at least 5'4 then it would be realistic. And I don't like that Chiaki has to be pervy because for some reason some anime include a perv for no reasonEnjoyment - I think the buildup in the first 7-8 episodes was good but once I started watching the basketball game thats what really hurt my enjoyment, they built up all the emotions and camaraderie between the characters to use it on a pretty lame basketball game that drags on a lot pretty janky and are like a slideshow sometimes.

Its pretty generic but its alright.Tobi is the only thing that is enjoyable in this anime. An awesome character that is stuck in this shitty anime when he could have his own anime with a good team. Sora is annoying as fuck,...Momoharu is alright I guess.But the worst character for me is CHIAKI. I liked him ate the beginning because he was funny but I got tired of everyone EVERY SINGLE EPISODE saying he is a genius!!! Can you show me that ? Instead of just keep telll me he is a genius.Compared to Tobi he does NOTHING. He did like 3/4 good passes and he is a genius ?? Like cmon can you show me more.Tobi  is literally the best player they have always pushing the team and Chiaki does one good pass and WOW everyone saying Chiaki is a genius. My god f**k off. If he really is a genius Show me that. Jesus. What a wasted potencial.I wish Tobi left the team and the rest of the story was we watching Tobi in another team playing with actually good people.

Watching all 50 of these episodes has made me realize what it’s like to be on an opposing team in a sports anime like Haikyuu. You have players who are amazing and strive to get better and continue to fail and fail until the end. It’s as if this was the unneeded prequel to an actual sports anime.Story: 5/10First of all, excruciatingly slow. The story is relatively simple which allows it to be easily followed. However, there were certain occurrences throughout that just threw me off. Perhaps they have meaning eventually, but it feels like fodder in an already stretched out story. One of these is Madoka and the random dude (what I can remember off of the top of my head). I get that adding depth to characters is important, but that whole side of the story felt unnecessary and unrelated to the actual events of the anime. I have not read the source material, but parts of the plot just felt abysmal. I will talk about my disappointment in the constant losing in the enjoyment section. Even though it somewhat adds to the story with “wow they’re so determined” with how they get up and up again, it is frustrating seeing huge losses followed by small wins. Be warned.Art: 6/10The art was nothing amazing. Considering the anime completed 50 episodes in one cour, it’s not surprising that the animation was typical. I honestly would also say there weren\'t any scenes that really stood out either in terms of animation quality. Similarly, there wasn\'t any noticeable ""bad""/lazy art.Sound: 7/10Ahiru no Sora had a pretty decent soundtrack. I personally enjoyed the opening and endings. Songs throughout were sort of repetitive, but nothing stood out like a sore thumb for being played in the wrong situation. Nothing really made an impact in an impressive way either. The sound quality was nice though. I did not have to adjust the volume due to parts being too loud or too quiet. Overall, everything sound related flowed quite smoothly.Character: 5/10I respect this anime for being able to show such detailed character growth and development between various relationships. I want more, but this could have been done with less. There is just too much. I get that every character has a backstory, forms relationships and so on, but a lot of meaning in the main story gets sort of muffled. This comes from the example previously stated in the story section with Madoka and the random dude. There was so much time spent on that connection, but it is then dissolved in an unsatisfactory way then used to progress the main story (at least this is what I got from watching it)? I wish we got to see more of Sora’s and the other’s on the team stories. I can see there is a lot of effort put into the characters, but one can easily see that effort is poorly directed.Enjoyment: 4/10My main reason for writing this review. The exact feelings I have towards this anime is written in the first sentence of the actual review. It pains me to see a potentially amazing anime fail as bad as the Kuzuryuu High School basketball team. I would say that I definitely was expecting this to be similar in some ways to other shounen sport stories where the main character’s team does well or struggles then does well. But no. This anime is literally 50 episodes of a scuffed team with individually strong players. Perhaps they will get better in the future. WELL THEN WHAT’S THE POINT OF THIS? I’m sure wins later on will be sooo satisfactory, but yeah, you need to miserably watch 50 episodes of suffering before you get to see the results. Or maybe they just never get better and the story is meant to be different from the standard of always winning. If drama was a focal point, I would expect games between schools to be less drawn out and a story similar to Hoshiai no Sora. An anime that does wins/losses well is Diamond no Ace. You can actually see progress after the team faces defeat rather than continuous losing. This comes along with the realism of being a beatable team which doesn\'t win every game.Overall: 5.4/10 (rounded up to 6/10)Pain. The two words I would use to describe this anime is “peak edging”.

However, it is hard to compare this with ""Koroko no basket"" due to the fact that the characters in this anime do not have any supernatural powers/skills like the characters in ""Koroko no Basket"" have.The anime started strong and gradually became abysmal. I had a hard time scoring this anime, since I wanted to give it good marks for the first part and the worst possible score for the latter parts. I seriously tried to endure through the horrific character build-up...and horrendous basketball animation, hoping it will get better, til I could no longer take it. I had to drop it.StoryIt was interesting during the beginning and I had high hopes for this anime (8/10). Then story development was too slow,few and/or shallow developments, and all over the place. In the latter part (2/10).Ex: I lasted 44 episodes with no established romantic relationship for the main character. Only bits and pieces, here and there, but nothing concrete - after ""44"" episodes! If your not going to establish one, then don\'t even bother hinting on romance in the first place.ArtMy main complaint is the basketball scene animations. definitely not the production teams strong point.They used a lot of still images - too much and too little. ""SlamDunk"" used some still images during basketball scenes, but it showed viewers what happens. This anime did not do that - poor story telling with still image use.I wonder if COVID-19 had a part in anime degradation during basketball scenes.

I\'m a big fan of basketball and loved KnB as well as other sports anime like Diamond no Ace, Haikyuu!! and Free!. I was excited to see another basketball anime hit the scene and while I really enjoyed the over-the-top theatrics of KnB, I was looking forward to the seemingly more ""realistic"" portrayal of the sport. However, Ahiru no Sora has failed my expectations. Not a failure in presenting the realities of basketball, but a failure in capturing the thrill and excitement that exist in the game when stripped of all the...""super saiyan"" stuff.Art: N/AI don\'t typically judge an anime for it\'s art style. It\'s a very subjective category and I liked the style in Ahiru no Sora. Were the mouths bigger than I\'m used to seeing? Sure, but it was a non-issue and I thought it gave some distinction to their looks.Animation: SlideshowThat being said, I do have trouble accommodating lackluster animation. I wasn\'t expecting KnB levels of in your face action but when I sit through 8 minutes of a static image talking only to be rewarded with a close up of two bodies bumping resulting in an And-1 opportunity, I feel disrespected. This is one of my largest quips about the anime. The first few episode gave me hope but it quickly tapered away. I can even get by poor animations of the ball being passed or going through the hoop/air but the amount of still frames in this first practice match is seriously killing me.Sound: 4Not much to say for the sound here. I tend to be a guy who will always let the OP play through (and ED if I like it) as it gets me hyped for the episode but Ahiru no Sora just wasn\'t uprooting any emotion like that for me. All other use of music goes unnoticed. With the exception of backstories or those ""feel"" inducing moments. Those were well executed.Characters: 5Ahiru no Sora is centered on Sora, the short basketball player. Nothing controversial here. I don\'t dislike that. In fact, I quite liked Sora when he was introduced. Each character introduction was exciting and their backstories did well to give them further depth. But like with many things in this anime, the interest of the character diminished with time. Even at this point, Sora feels like bland secondary lead himself.  Both Kite and Nao I continue to find myself invested enough in but everyone else have begun to felt uninspired and ""basic"" so to speak.Story: 5The story itself isn\'t bad.  I don\'t mind that its pacing is slow but in exchange of that I expected better animation. I find it\'s accurate in depicting the challenges and struggles and experiences that players encounter with the sport be they complete rookies or seasoned vets or somewhere in between. There are a lot of moments where they take time to explain the rules or tactics of the game but perhaps too much to a point where the viewer feels patronized (at least for me). The comedy is silly and is right up my alley but when it comes to the actual game of basketball, whether the players are in a game or working out strategy, or doing a montage at training camp, it feels a bit...elementary. Some detail and emphasis is missed and that hurts any effort to build suspense in a given moment. Just seems like some missed opportunities. ""super saiyan"" stuff.Art: N/AI don\'t typically judge an anime for it\'s art style. It\'s a very subjective category and I liked the style in Ahiru no Sora. Were the mouths bigger than I\'m used to seeing? Sure, but it was a non-issue and I thought it gave some distinction to their looks.Animation: SlideshowThat being said, I do have trouble accommodating lackluster animation. I wasn\'t expecting KnB levels of in your face action but when I sit through 8 minutes of a static image talking only to be rewarded with a close up of two bodies bumping resulting in an And-1 opportunity, I feel disrespected. This is one of my largest quips about the anime. The first few episode gave me hope but it quickly tapered away. I can even get by poor animations of the ball being passed or going through the hoop/air but the amount of still frames in this first practice match is seriously killing me.Sound: 4Not much to say for the sound here. I tend to be a guy who will always let the OP play through (and ED if I like it) as it gets me hyped for the episode but Ahiru no Sora just wasn\'t uprooting any emotion like that for me.

New kid in school that wanted to join sport club, and amaze everyone with their ""unique"" perk.Early episode got me hooked up, but later on it\'s just not excite me anymore.-Very slow pacing, the anime tried to show realism in anime, which ended up feels unrealistic/fail in its own case.- Reason people watch sport anime...is for the action-fast paced sport feeling in sense of anime and conflict/drama in between sport matches. Ahiru no Sora fail to be strong in any of those points. the pacing is so slow in matches that you don\'t feel the adrenaline, and drama fall short after characters arc (usually early-on before joining) but some backstory is great.- Mediocre art and animation. I think it\'s okay, but most viewers would expect higher animation than this. lots of pauses animation during matches. we expect more \'action\' in the animation.Even if you didn\'t want to include super power in the anime, take the Haikyuu!! approach with the friendship/training drama or just straight up focus in the matches action like KnB or Eyeshield21after watched Ahiru no Sora, I can\'t describe how I miss show like Kuroko no Basket or Eyeshield21, at least those are entertaining and actually works. is for the action-fast paced sport feeling in sense of anime and conflict/drama in between sport matches.

However, when they got into their first official match against Shinjo Towa Academy it really took a dive for me.From a watcher's perspective, Sora was a lot better previously compared to this game, it felt like while everyone else got better, the training that they went through made him worse somehow. I don't mind the fact that they lost either but like he didn't use any techniques he'd previously used in other matches.Don't get me wrong it's still a great anime but...this is the only reason I wasn't able to give it a higher grade. this is the only reason I wasn't able to give it a higher grade."", 'The concept of a delinquent gang being converted into a basketball team by a single passionate player is pretty cool, even if it might\'ve been done before, but the series just doesn\'t do enough to live up to the premise. The animation and plot just lack oomph, no single movement feels powerful, not even dunks, and it feels like the characters are just letting the story happen around them with no real personal stake or will the MC is also wildly inconsistent in his behavior, and just isn\'t likable. The ""fanservice"" is also disgusting, they keep shoving sexual situations without ever considering what the characters...are actually doing to other people and how they\'d react.

I really connected with the story of Sora Kurumatani, who never gave up on his dream of playing basketball. The characters felt real and relatable, and I cared about what happened to them.The basketball games were exciting to watch, but sometimes the show felt slow and the animation wasn\'t always great. While there were moments that made me feel inspired, the show didn\'t always keep up that feeling. The storytelling was nice, but it could have been more surprising and meaningful. Even though it had flaws, ""Ahiru no Sora"" is still...a show that I remember fondly because of its characters and touching moments.

But still, and maybe because of, following the general formula too closely, it managed to remain very mediocre.I'm really struggling to write something unique about it or something I liked, but nothing just hits, which should tell you a lot about it in itself. I will say though, that the technical part of basketball is quite well explored, which I appreciated.Also, I don't really understand the point of Madoka? She never really did anything throughout...the series, and nothing would have changed if she wasn't there.The anime has the team losing every single time, which I'll admit is realistic.

Usually we don't see protagonists in sports animes lose so often but in Ahiru no Sora we see it happen quite often giving us some nice character development. It is truly a really beautiful anime and the only complaint I have against it would be the animation, while the characters...are drawn out almost identical to the manga, the animation and execution of the plays isn't done that well, reasons being are quite obvious since the anime was airing out episodes each week barely even taking a break.

You can feel in the story how much he loves the game, how much he tries, how good he is at it, and...the relationship with his beloved mother through basketball.His effort to create a basket team with some classmates, that turn out to be the school ""thugs"". is hilariuos, and  I dont know I just feel that permament challenge: all that emotions of ""Im going to show you""...

The show slaps you across the face.I know reality is harsh but come on. Every time you think the show is going to payoff all the buildup it spits in your face. Especially the season finale. The animation is fine, but considering I have low standards as long as the story is good...my opinion is a little off. Until the season finale I had this show at about a 7.5 I was quite happy watching it. Until the final episode of the season, the show takes all your hopes out back and puts them down like Old Yeller with a rifle bullet to the brain. I will not spoil but damn its rough.

You should watch it.First, I had no basketball knowledge, but as someone who plays sports, I really enjoyed the anime. The 50 episodes helped in developing the characters and story plot. The games may seem long to some people, but you can really get into it and root for the characters. The introduction of characters was well done and gave their background; this allows you to relate. That aspect was one of my favorite things about this anime since some sports anime's don't provide that background info.

Ahiru no Sora is going to struggle to gain fans when Kuroko is probably a better show due to the more over the top nature of it.Ahiru No Sora, is a much more grounded in reality show, in terms of everything. Which to me, makes it an enjoyable show to watch. No one on the team is really overpowered in terms of basketball skill. Yes, some characters do have they own specialised skill. But its not in the same realm as Kuroko with the 3 point shooting from anywhere on court, the incredible passing finesse or diverting attention so you seem to go invisible.For the most part the characters on the team are either completely new to the game or haven't played in some time. Which gets shown throughout the show, just how out of depth, the team as a whole is. This makes Ahiru no Sora very different. You're not watching an above average team become a super team. Its more like you're watching a team of nobodies with they lack of skill trying to become something. The characters have a real struggle to overcome the odds that are against them.With the show being 50 episodes long in total, I would say that its building towards something. But honestly the 50 episodes, I'm expecting it to be the ground work for a future season. Hopefully not another season of 50 episodes, because that would be too long. But something along the lines of 13 episode season long arcs would be more ideal. The 50 episodes are hard to summarise in terms of pace. Its not slow, nor fast, or perfect, but it feels like the show could've had less episodes or be done over several smaller seasons to cover the storyline arcs. It's just a tough ask to get people to watch a 50 episode show when its not split up into seasons, which is going to a downside for a lot of people. Even more so when a sequel isn't certain to happen.In the end, if you want a more realistic Basketball anime compared to Kuroko no Basket and don't mind having 50 episodes to watch.

While Kuroko no Basket has overpowered characters with superhuman abilities, this anime is much more realistic and...down to earth, more about the team building, basketball overall, tactics, rough starts, etc. For people that enjoy anime for being this ridiculous amazing unnatural abilities, this anime might feel slow, boring later on, or even early on, but to those who enjoy sports, or just don\'t mind anime being more realistic, you will for sure enjoy this.STORY is an 8 for me, for simple reasons really. The story starts focusing on Sora, the short basketball player showing the basketball team on his high school why they should start playing basketball, we get introduced to other great characters and so on, but later on in the story it feels like it starts to focus on a different character, Kite, who is this amazing prodigy apparently, talking about him like he is the best out there, and while that might be true, it just feels really weird, that another character is ""outshining"" the main character, that\'s name is in the title even... Another character that just makes me, personally angry, is the other short player that arrives late in the story (i already forgot his name). That learned how to play basketball by Sora\'s mother, and the anime makes him look, and mentions him like he is ""very similar"" to Sora\'s mother, which just seems really stupid, considering Sora had his mother for years with him, while the other small dude saw her like once or twice, and now he is her clone all of a sudden, and is much better than Sora, despite being in the same situation as him, i\'d say even worse? What?.And to end it all, Madoka...... From the start of the anime, Madoka seems alright and just a good ""romance"" character for Sora etc. But later on in the anime, she just becomes this completely pointless, stupid character that makes no sense and only makes the anime longer. Which just ruins the story.But, the story overall is great! The characters (for the most part) are well written, have their moments and feel really ""real"" so to speak.ART is alright, for the year 2019 i feel it could be less static at moments, and i feel like the characters could\'ve been done ""better"" maybe, but that\'s just my personal taste, and for me, the art is a solid 7.SOUND is a 9! Thankfully. I think it\'s important for anime, and especially sports ones, to have good sound, and it just does. simple as that.CHARACTERS are easily a 9! Apart from the 2 shit ones i mentioned above, that just make me annoyed for even existing, all the characters have their own personalities, traits and cons , they all are different in their own right and make them super great, their personalities are just bright (or interesting) and you can see the development, and how they mature slowly throughout the show (or at least some of them).MY PERSONAL ENJOYMENT is a strong 9. Again, the two characters made me enjoy the slow end to this anime less, so much so i had to skip some scenes to not lose my mind. But take that out of it and this one is incredible. I was surprised it only has a rating of 7, but not everyone is into this kind of..realistic, slow, anime about basketball especially. But i loved it. Realistic, funny but serious if need be, bright different characters from different schools and lovely start and middle of the story, the matches last throughout multiple episodes and it really has you on edge at times, which is what you want from sport. Being nervous for a team. You see all the feelings and aftermath after every failed shot, dribble, lost match, everything, the detail into how real basketball can feel and really any sport can be is incredible. I couldn\'t stop watching even though everytime i see an anime with 40+ episodes i just feel like it\'s going to eat away my time more than anything, this was an exception and i couldn\'t be happier.OVERALL 9. As i explained earlier, i feel like this anime deserves more spotlight, more people looking into it and not giving up after afew episodes. And while yes, towards the end this anime starts to be annoying af, it is still worth to watch until the end and i bet you, you will love it. Its real, its entertaining, its funny, its serious, it has interesting characters, all you can ask from a sports anime. While many sports anime make characters overpowered and feel like they have some sort of cheats on, this one just shows you how the real life is (kinda) by showing you how people have to work hard, how they fail and have cons they have to work on. Noone is perfect, but with practice you can get better, there is no cutting corners and talent can only carry you so far, especially in a team game like basketball.Basically, if you want to see an anime that feels and seems real, without any (well, some...) Overpowered moves where they just seem to have godlike speed, or can score from the whole court, or they can do something godlike, this anime is for you. Amazing. Simply amazing. down to earth, more about the team building, basketball overall, tactics, rough starts, etc. For people that enjoy anime for being this ridiculous amazing unnatural abilities, this anime might feel slow, boring later on, or even early on, but to those who enjoy sports, or just don\'t mind anime being more realistic, you will for sure enjoy this.STORY is an 8 for me, for simple reasons really.

Realistic, funny but serious if need be, bright different characters from different schools and lovely start and middle of the story, the matches last throughout multiple episodes and it really has you on edge at times, which is what you want from sport. Being nervous for a team. You see all the feelings and aftermath after every failed shot, dribble, lost match, everything, the detail into how real basketball can feel and really any sport can be is incredible. I couldn\'t stop watching even though everytime i see an anime with 40+ episodes i just feel like it\'s going to eat away my time more than anything, this was an exception and i couldn\'t be happier.OVERALL 9. As i explained earlier, i feel like this anime deserves more spotlight, more people looking into it and not giving up after afew episodes. And while yes, towards the end this anime starts to be annoying af, it is still worth to watch until the end and i bet you, you will love it. Its real, its entertaining, its funny, its serious, it has interesting characters, all you can ask from a sports anime. While many sports anime make characters overpowered and feel like they have some sort of cheats on, this one just shows you how the real life is (kinda) by showing you how people have to work hard, how they fail and have cons they have to work on. Noone is perfect, but with practice you can get better, there is no cutting corners and talent can only carry you so far, especially in a team game like basketball.Basically, if you want to see an anime that feels and seems real, without any (well, some...) Overpowered moves where they just seem to have godlike speed, or can score from the whole court, or they can do something godlike, this anime is for you. Amazing. Simply amazing.', ""Nothing really stands out about Ahiru no Sora. At the immediate surface level, the animation never really goes beyond perfunctory in the basketball games, with many scenes being obvious manga panel stills embellished with some sliding motions in the foreground. As is rather infamous, the animation team tries to ape Kuroko's Basketball in conveying how fast the characters are moving, but without the polish of Kuroko's production it just looks comical. Game flow massively suffers as a result, so it's hard to get invested in games when it's often unclear what plays are happening.Storywise though, I have to give the show props for not being...a cookie cutter underdog narrative. We start with the basketball team as a complete sham and front for a delinquents' hangout brought about by the school's mandatory club rules. So when the team does get dragged into trying to play a game, they suck. A lot. They never win any of their practice games. They lose their first match in the tournament prelims. In fact, in the show's 50-episode run, the team plays five games and wins exactly zero of them.The basketball games aren't really what's important in the show though. They're simply the medium for carrying the real meat of the show: the character arcs. You've got the usual spiel with the kids about finding a passion and working hard to achieve something even if you fail, but I find the advisor to be the most compelling character as the representation of the primary conflict of the series. Because of their reputation, the basketball team commands not an iota of respect from the school, neither from the faculty or the other students. The advisor comes in only because he is told to by the principal, and he immediately lays it out that he is not invested in the future of the team and would really have it be disbanded as soon as possible. He is convinced that people don't fundamentally change, but the team's earnest efforts to get better and make up for their mistakes slowly wins him over. They might cause trouble and get into fights, but they're ultimately just kids, and kids need to be nurtured and encouraged, not abandoned.It's a sweet sentiment, but it's a bit undermined by how much of this show is its very lame treatment of its female characters. We get a scene early on with one of the main characters trying to peep on the girls' locker room and then steal their underwear, and that pretty much sets the tone for the entire show. The most egregious instance is when they play a practice game against the girls' basketball team. When the coach brings it up, the boys scoff at the idea that any game with such a lopsided physical advantage could possibly be worth going through, and one of them cheekily suggests that maybe they'll be motivated if the girls all strip naked if they lose. This turns into the captain of the girls' team getting stuck as the sole victim of the losing condition, and absolutely none of the boys even try protesting this despite the show presenting some of them elsewhere as good-natured and nice people. I've never been a high school boy, so perhaps having uncontrollably horny urges is simply accurate to real life, but I'd rather not see it in my media.Ahiru no Sora is basically a melodrama in disguise, complete with a obviously dying mom for the protagonist, and to that effect it's pretty good. Worth a look if you can ignore the lackluster animation, somewhat slow pacing, and questionable characterization, but there's no doubt in my mind that the manga is the better format for the series. a cookie cutter underdog narrative.

So when I heard that Ahiru No Sora was going to be 50 I immediately swore to myself that I would see the entire thing through to the end. Was it worth it? I think so, I’m a huge fan of character-driven anime especially when they relate to sports (Run With The Wind being my #1 favorite sports anime). It’s a little long but I honestly love that about that show, this way they can cram as many “TOP 10 AHIRU NO SORA SHOTS” into...one episode as they want.Tl;dr: The show is long, the pacing is relatively slow, the art isn’t the focal point but if these things don’t really matter to you you are going to have a hell of a good time. This show focuses on character and story.Story:8 Not exactly the most original but there’s a slight twist to itThere’s a lot I want to talk about with Ahiru No Sora but like 90% of it are massive spoilers so I’ll just say that this show focuses on character development. We really zoom in on a group of people who, for one reason or another, either get into basketball or resume their basketball career. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and it's really fun to see them grow as a team, to get better, and to become better friends. You don’t have to even know the rules to enjoy the show either, it explains any niche rules immediately so you’re not lost for too long eitherArt 6: I’ma keep it 100% with you, the art is probably the lowest part of the showThe art actually started out pretty nice, a lot of work clearly went into the show. Character design was significantly different from almost anything I’ve ever seen and there was a sense of uniqueness while watching it. Animation, however, started to dip towards the middle and dropped every couple of episodes. That being said, this was on average and there were a couple of moments when the animation went up which was a little jarring towards the end because you’d have like 4-5 panning shots before someone does some crazy crossover move at around 60 frames per second.Sound 9: I liked all the openings and endingsThere really isn’t too much for me to talk about here, the openings were great, the endings were great, the… basketball sounded great. I never know what to put in the sound section because you never really run into an anime that sounds BAD.Character 10: Character was, of course, the focal point of this anime.Of course, I’m going to give the character section a “10” on a character-focused anime. Everyone in the show had their spotlight and was fleshed out. You can really see the group chemistry change within the group every episode either for better or for worse and everyone goes through their own character arc which was nice to see. You also see their improvements in each game after they go through their own trial. All around a good time.Enjoyment: 7 Now this is where the 50 episode count really starts to take its tollWhen it comes to the overall enjoyment, 50 episodes really starts to drag on. That being said, not being able to watch this show after watching it every week for almost a year is really a punch in the gut. I don’t know what it would be like to binge-watch it but I’m definitely going to miss this show.Overall: 8 Loved every second of it.One last thing, if you’re expecting a lot of anime… well don’t because there isn’t one episode as they want.Tl;dr: The show is long, the pacing is relatively slow, the art isn’t the focal point but if these things don’t really matter to you you are going to have a hell of a good time.

I beg you to take your time, because the pay off is huge. Enormous and glorious. This show really picks up after episode 33 (I say this without irony, please please please stick with it).This show has some themes I try to avoid while picking an anime: delinquents, fights, bullying. Also there are cliches, such as over the top presentation of physical strength and masculinity and a sport that endorses them. But I didn't regret sticking with it.It starts slow and you...don't know where it will go. Eventually, it coherently tackles all the things one by one, without excessive drama or moralizing. And it surprises you with how detailed and aware the script is about all things that are wrong. Basketball is just a wrapping, common goal for the characters to unpack those things.It's realistic in that it gives no easy solutions. It has conflicts that aren't fully resolved or perfectly resolved. Characters do not magically improve on every account, despite wanting to change. Sometimes there is a blow after a blow and no certainty about the future.This anime really shines at illustrating the idea of redemption and taking responsibility. It's about becoming a little more decent human in some aspects of life. Giving second and third chances. I would praise this anime for being very aware of what it is, where and when it is, without repeating after popular sports anime. So in the end watching 50 episodes doesn't feel like a waste of time at all.8/10 don't know where it will go.

(I will not specifically go into all the characters) but it presents as a highschool sports anime well since it shows the development of children who are not the greatest, who are not magically gifted....But a group of children who have worked hard and used there talent as best they can to be basketball players.It might be a little slow is a issue with this. personally I dont mind but for people coming from haikyuu or blue lock where it was faster paced and a little more too the point of showing how good the players are this is a slow burned or character development and how varying circumstance can effect growth.I really reccomend this too sport anime fans, it may not be the greatest but it is a good watch and covers interesting themes most sport anime I have seen don't really cover as much.

cover as much."", 'Was this dogshit? no, was this good? absolutely not.A basketball anime that is a tad bit more realistic then the other ones that its compared to and has a lot of shortcomings in other aspects because of that.Story 4/10Let me start with the fact that the story isn\'t garbage, its actually fine, the big problem comes from all the unnecessary ""mini stories"", the weird outlooks and pacing.A lot of the times i just wondered ""why the fuck do i need to know this"" when they showed the stories of characters from different teams that are obviously not important, like the one game they had in...the inter-high and we got a whole bunch of backstory for the other team, okay it showed us why its important for them to win, but it wasn\'t necessary at all.After that there was a lot of action for Madoka on her love life for some reason, somehow she had more character development then Nabe and Chucky even though she was practically irrelevant later on, and while I am on the topic of Nabe and Chucky, after all that training and being with the team and all the practice sessions they still suck ass and play as bad as they did at their first games.Lastly the pacing, a lot of the times they whooshed past important parts and then proceeded to dedicate 2-5 episodes to complete trivial topics, the only good reason would be to let the manga continue but the manga was written in 2003 so there was literally no reason for that.Art 7/10Oddly enough, the art is pretty good throughout all the episodes, my only complaint is the countless still shots and blank backgrounds.Besides the shortcomings on the art i did like a couple of things like the amazingly smooth animation on the net of the basket and I actually kind of liked the ""odd"" design of the characters lips and face characteristics.Sound 5/10Sadly this anime didn\'t have any noticeably good soundtracks and the openings/endings weren\'t anything to boast about, other then the music there was always some repeated sounds when they stole, caught, or threw the ball and I somehow didn\'t get annoyed by them even after hearing them so much.Character 6/10They were fine, nothing else to really say.Some got the spotlight way more then others but that\'s not really surprising, they were all pretty likeable and I didn\'t hate or dislike any of them but the main character really is a little bland,  Sora is mostly carried by his background story and what happened to him but he really is a shounen character.Enjoyment 6/10It was like a wobbly line in term of enjoyment, sometimes I did get a little excited and really wanted to see what happens next but most of the time I had to pull myself towards the next episode, just so I can finally finish this arc/story and just move on.Overall 6/10Not bad and not good, it did make me appreciate other sports anime like Haikyuu and Kurkoko no basket as they actually had some excitement in them. the inter-high and we got a whole bunch of backstory for the other

I don't know what to say a year later. I loved it, there's no doubt about that, but I don't know how to explain why. I will say this: Ahiru no Sora had moments where it did all of its elements perfectly and moments where those same elements felt boring or overdone. I'd say it did its elements perfectly 85% of the time, though, so that's pretty good.Of these elements, I'm gonna talk about the...games, the characters, and the story. Starting with the games, I enjoyed that Ahiru no Sora wasn't like Kuroko no Basuke. I mean, Kuroko no Basuke is one of my favorite anime, but I didn't realize how much I would love something that was totally opposite how Kuroko presented basketball. Ahiru no Sora was very mundane in all aspects of its storytelling, but the mundanity in the games the characters played was really nice. There weren't any super complicated moves or characters that had ridiculous skill--it wasn't supposed to be surreal like Kuroko no Basuke, and the fact that you just got to see good basketball games was awesome.That being said, sometimes the games drug out. The animation and art style in Ahiru no Sora was something I wasn't immediately attracted to, but now I like it a lot. Many people complained that this series is kind of like a slideshow because a lot of the episodes had part of the episode as still frames of the characters that the camera would pan across rather than having scenes with motion all the time. This didn't really bother me while I was watching, though, because I still found myself feeling the impact of cool plays or intense moments. My issue with the games was how many episodes they took up. Some of them, the length was fine, but others felt like the entire anime had always been this one game. Honestly, if I were to binge this series, it wouldn't matter. The content of the episodes was normally enough to keep me interested regardless of how long it went, but watching it week-to-week did feel a bit draining sometimes.The characters also felt like two sides of the same coin at times. Honestly, 95% of the time, the characters and their development was awesome. There was a lot of care put into the characters and how they changed over time, especially in regards to their personal stories. Not only that, but they were all very complicated. They wouldn't always have expected reactions to events in the story, and in fact, probably reacted unusually more often than not because they were shown to have muddied perceptions and thought processes. They felt like real people. That being said, there was one specific character (people who have seen this will know who I'm talking about) who started going downhill and kept going downhill. They started as a character that meant something to the story and ended in a way that makes me wonder why they were written into the story in the first place. I imagine there's more to that character that gets revealed later, but their story in the last part of this anime felt totally unneeded.So, now the story. It, like everything else, felt really mundane and really realistic. It felt like real events with real people. It didn't focus on just basketball or what was happening to the characters real-time or how basketball was changing the characters but also how their pasts affect who they are and how they operate within their team. Beyond that, many of the elements of the story were just beautifully written. The motivations provided to the characters were oftentimes very moving to watch, and it wasn't just for the main character. The story you get through the characters' pasts and their relationships to each other builds such a rich experience for the audience to partake in. The flip side of this is that there were a few episodes that delved into unnecessary stuff, but in the grand scheme, the story was the closest element in Ahiru no Sora to reach perfection.All in all, I loved this anime. If you take the episodes individually (especially toward the beginning) they don't all reach 100%, but the impression I was left with after a year of watching this was that I can't wait to see what happens to these characters with all the hardship and happiness and tragedy and camaraderie they've build up. It may take a bit to get into, but I'd absolutely recommend this anime to anyone who thinks they might like it. It's got a lot to love. games, the characters, and the story.

This OVA was released at a questionable state, with 6 months of time between the two episodes.The OVA discards whatever the series had of “plot”, leaving you only with a couple of wholesome episodes that provide more of the fan-service and comedy level. It steers the current on the fandom ships quite hard, leaving none disappointed.It is the type of OVA that leaves you wanting though. A season 3 might not be enough by...this point, heck, have it serialize on a weekly basis, and no one is complaining. this point, heck, have it serialize on a weekly basis, and no one is complaining.', '""Supplementary Material""Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai OVA centers on offbeat episodes from the second season, well you know the basic plot by the synopsis up top so with this...The first half of the first OVA centers around Nariyuki and Asumi faking a date on the beach which leads into Nariyuki stumbling upon finding Kirisu losing her bikini top. For the most part the first episode gives us a bit of screentime towards Asumi and Kirisu which LA didn\'t mind either way and even better it being a beach episode!. Asumi gets to open herself up with Nariyuki ""surprising her"" as it were while ""fake"" being...her boyfriend, the ""becoming the mask"" for her as it were. As for Kirisu, her situation gives us the classic Kirisu being tsundere ditzy and her realizing how many times Nariyuki helped her and especially with this situation again like Asumi\'s opening up to Nariyuki. Both these situations with Asumi and Kirisu was great as non sequiturs isolated episodes it is ESPECIALLY if your in the Asumi and/or Kirisu camp.The second and last OVA is a ""wedding"" OVA, the majority of this episode centers on each of the girls fantasizing or getting *ahem* cozy with Nariyuki under certain situations with Nariyuki before the rehearsal wedding ceremony. All of this concocted due to Nariyuki\'s mother\'s boss wanted teenagers to help with a wedding photoshoot. The first OVA was beach fanservice with Asumi and Kirisu. THIS episode was pretty much giving us the harem in some tame yet spicy situations with Nariyuki with a HUGE wedding fanservice at the end. Of course thanks to this being Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai, coincidentally Kirisu finds a way to also get involved and yes she like the rest of the harem gets afflicted to the wedding fanservice and BOY if you like wedding costume fanservice, then yea...satisfied to say the least.The production value and the voice cast really doesn\'t need to said, same animation studio, same voice cast from the anime series but if you need details then LA\'s second season review would cover this the same way.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai OVA was expected for an OVA, from the slightly spicy fanservice with the entire harem one way or another as well as the expected teasing of each of the girls with Nariyuki. If you wanted a bit more *ahem* ""supplementary material"" from the Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai anime, then this is for you...Kirisu still best girl... her boyfriend, the ""becoming the mask"" for her as it were. As for Kirisu, her situation gives us the classic Kirisu being tsundere ditzy and her realizing how many times Nariyuki helped her and especially with this situation again like Asumi\'s opening up to Nariyuki. Both these situations with Asumi and Kirisu was great as non sequiturs isolated episodes it is ESPECIALLY if your in the Asumi and/or Kirisu camp.The second and last OVA is a ""wedding"" OVA, the majority of this episode centers on each of the girls fantasizing or getting *ahem* cozy with Nariyuki under certain situations with Nariyuki before the rehearsal wedding ceremony.

This following firstly with the beach episode which was very funny and comical. I liked how they got other characters there by not just chance but from being there in the first place already.The second one was slightly unexpected in the wedding scenario. I did enjoy how they played it out to make it all the less serious. It was great to see the respective girls in the outfits and the funny scenarios they had to undertake. I really liked the sister's reactions at the end.The art was...consistent like before in the show.Sound still has a great soundtrack with the OP and ED being enjoyable.Characters appear to develop but then they don't. It is more about solidifying the already known things about characters in better context. These are not meant to be deep and meaningful I don't think.It was very enjoyable and if you liked the main show this will be very much up your alley. It is nice to watch after season 2, especially if you were not 100% on the series outcome thus far. consistent like before in the show.Sound still has a great soundtrack with the OP and ED being enjoyable.Characters appear to develop but then they don't.

Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14967/Boku_wa_Tomodachi_ga_Sukunai_Next,"['First of all, I\'d like to say that I\'ll be giving a normal review this time, no more weird ass insights and comments.HELL WHO AM I KIDDING, here we go, so Boku wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai NEXT, or I Don\'t Have Many Friends. From the name alone you\'d think, damn is this some weird ass anime about finding friends? Well, it is, for the most part anyway. For those that haven\'t read the damn synopsis - lazy bastards, Haganai NEXT is about our good friends from the neighbors club, namely Sena, Yozora, Rika, Yukimura and the only guy - Kodaka, who think they...don\'t have friends (or so they believe) so they stick together and ""practice"" things that normal buddies would do -they totally have no friends. Now that I\'ve got that out of my way, ONTO THE REVIEW!Story: 9/10So like, Kodaka, as you should already know is part of the Neighbors Club, they\'re always embarking on funny -and sometimes extremely weird adventures with each other. The story itself seems pretty normal, but the way it\'s shown is NOT, it has enough comedy in it to keep me entertained the whole time, laughing my ass off, yet enough plot to keep me hooked on the damn show - something a lot of animes fail at. Horse Heads, Blonde Wigs, Meat, Bald Wig-thingy, and even a Mayo Chiki! references are all included in this anime, I\'d say that with all of these things it really, REALLY deserves a 9/10In Short: Great laughs all around but enough plot to keep a viewer hooked.Art: 10/10What can I say, I loved the first season, and the second season\'s art is even better. No shit I\'d give it a 10, the colors provide for a vivid and enjoyable anime watching experience, they blend well and really show the character\'s personality off. Just viewing it makes my eyes feel nice, it\'s eyecandy bro.In Short: Shit dude, just read the actual Art rating, it\'s pretty short - Vivid and Enjoyable.Sound: 9/10This is probably because I\'ve grown too used to the voice actors, but I\'d say they make the characters sound the same as they look. The chatter between characters is a pretty big thing here, and the voices of the characters really play a large role in the comedic scenes, like ""voice imitations"" and sound effects. I don\'t skip the intro, meaning it\'s pretty good. I would have given it a 10/10, but I feel that it\'s lacking something, so for now the best I can do is a 9.In Short: The voice actors were chosen well and the sound effects really aid in comedic scenes.Character: 10/10Now, for me, there are a lot of things that make a comedy better, one would be perverts. They\'re the butter (bread and butter, it\'s the butter) of comedy, whether it be Nikaidou Arashi from OniAi, or Kirche from Zero no Tsukaima, they always provide for a lot of laughs, that\'s where our resident perv-I mean scientist comes in. Boobs, would then be the bread, allowing jokes to be made about how large the characters mea- I mean breasts are, or how small and neglected they look. Obviously, we\'re missing an integral part of a harem - the childhood friend, but have no fear, because Yozora appears! Yozora, (one of my favorite) the weirdest of the club, is also Kodaka\'s childhood buddy (Season 1), and also creates most of the jokes/parodies that appear in the anime. Being the only guy, Kodaka would obviously be the center of attention - A.K.A. the harem boy, and as usual he doesn\'t even notice (lucky asshole). Lastly, what would a comedy be without theunsure-gender-person Yukimura!, (well it gets solved but whatever). The large amount of \xa0comedic potential in these characters are MASSIVE, and they\'re, well in my opinion used properly, not just throwing in excess characters that would usually make things funnier, but actually make things worse.In Short: All the characters you would expect from a Harem-Comedy anime, the perv, the boobs, the guy, the childhood friend and the gender bender, but used to their maximum potential.Enjoyment: 10/10Friday, friday gotta go home on fridays. Extremely\xa0hilarious, amazing characters, there was never any doubt that I would give it a 10 in enjoyment was there, I mean I did mention how funny I found this anime, didn\'t I? Finishing each new episode leaves me craving for more, what\'s the new skit? what\'s happening next?In Short: wake me up when the next episode airsOverall: 10/10Now, before you go on blabbering about how it doesn\'t deserve a 10, I\'d like to say that THIS IS A REVIEW, by ME, not by YOU, god damn it people. Boku wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai NEXT, overall is an amazing show, it may have some minor errors here and there, but it\'s still an enjoyable watch.

Boku wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai NEXT, overall is an amazing show, it may have some minor errors here and there, but it\'s still an enjoyable watch. I recommend you pick this series up and follow it as it goes. cheers', ""Édit: Honestly I don't like this show that much like I used to, But I leave my thoughts on how I liked it back then.Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga sukunai NEXT or Haganai Next,  abbreviated, is one of those anticipated sequels almost everyone who saw the last season was waiting. After the amusing and fun time at the Neighbors Club we get a new season full of laughter, emotions, confessions and more. In which really I wasn't expecting to be more developed in that way than last season. which it is one of the main parts that are going to be analyzed here.STORY =...8The story continues were the first season left. A new year at the Neighbor's Club in which we see the 7 members of the club sharing and spending time together trying to make friends. The story in this season is very developed in the way that the characters seem to mature more. At the beginning we encounter the sillyness in which the first season characterized the show, DOING ACTIVITIES AS A GROUP! But as we get going with the show we see that the characters are trying to fullfill the purpose of the club and trying to actually be friends and not just being a group of people in a school room.The story, to describe it, is not that epic or amusing. Yet it is very intense with the truths and face to face confrontations in which everyone gets into. Also to add that it is more realistic to demostrate the feelings towards each other. Instead of only making fun of them and doing this great use of innuendo, sexual jokes and harrasment in which  the first season showed A LOT.  Also that the story really progresses and doesn't stay as an episodic anime as it was demostrated last year. It is fun and you can get caught into it. Making it  very easy to absorb.ART = 9The art is admirable. The touches of bright colors give great effect in the series' presentation. It gives the impression that is alive and vivid seeming almost real. Specially the touch for the design of the characters, the main parts. For example the eyes of every character specially Sena, Maria, Rika. It feels that they can watch into your soul. Also the hair  color for Kodaka, Kobato and Yozora make the reflection is given to their hair. Plus the color for the characters' skin, cloth and every trait that they have, it is outstanding. But also the important fact of where is taking, the scenario. The scenarios are a real portrait of the real live theme parks, parks, schools and even the room seem to be taking with exact detail to be animated. It is really gorgeous.SOUND = 5The instrumental pieces are not that good for me. Starting with the opening and ending. Both I found them very childish and just really annoying. Making it sound very irritating to the ear. But if we see the series of how it is, they are well incorporated to story that they want to tell.The Ost isn't also that outstanding. It is very common for a series and doesn't have any instrumental piece that I could be hearing over and over to remember that it is from Haganai. It is very standard. Maybe the only exception would be the ''YOU GOT MAIL'' Ringtone of Kodaka's phone. But the rest of it is just average.The voice acting is incredible. The actors give real life portrait to the characters and match with their personalities very well. Specially Sena and Rika whose voice actresses talk and they bring them to live. The one that I hate is Maria's actress which is very stressful with that pitch voice.CHARACTER = 9This is the part that admire the most of Haganai Next.The characters are very well developed in this season. They give them something that was left in the first series and it was character and personality. Because on the first series they were very cliche characters and fight against each other for that reason. But here they have grown up and try to make their desire and club purpose together.Starting with Kodaka Hasegawa, the  often mistaken delinquent. It is very conservative, serious and easy going. One of the founders of the club. Here, he continues with the same characteristics but he develops himself very well, until the end of the series. Because of this he doesn't confront anyone but for this trait he loses a lot with their mates, because it turns himself into a coward and running away from others. This character I find him just normal and very average, it doesn't add something but with some series like this, there must be a guy.Then we have Yozora Mikazuki. She has changed in many ways first with their hair and then with the discovery of her childhood friend. She is very aggresive and a tomboy. This character is very complete and she'll give the spectator good reasons to laugh and follow her track. This character I found her very well done characterized  by the producers. Because with the discovery of his friend she tries to keep going althought at the same time being inmature for only that reason.Sena Kashiwazaki has to be my favorite character of the series. She isn't just your typical stereotype of Blond and Giant boobs that almost every anime contains. She is a character with  intelligence, rich and mature girl. She  portraits her desires to be strong and be together with everyone, except Yozora. This character is of my taste because is determinated to accomplish her goals with courage and hard work. In this series we see how her father is very influential in her life and a daddy's girl. But what I love most of her is her ''AHO'' yelling to Yozora in their fight without a doubt. Without both of them the show is nothing.Rika Shiguma. She is one of  the characters that outcast the most. Her development is very rich. Also she doesn't stay as the nerdgeekfreak of sexual thoughts and yaoi mind. She is self-centered in the things that she has to do and also she focus to find friends among herself. She is very distinguished in this series because she changes her clothes and uses a different look in every situation not like most characters in series.Then our Male/Female character Yukimura. Very Cooperative and Loyal to Kodaka. (I use ''it'' for the review because I know what gender is) It is another character whose real self will be discovered but will keep the same affection to its room mates. It is a flat character with almost the same expression and voice tone to everyone.And finally our two lolis, Maria and Kobato, the fight of good and evil, well not exactly. But those almost make my day with their Heaven vs Demon's Brawl and fight for whose belief is better. They are very entertaining and sometimse they demostrate their cuteness. ~ku ku ku~ENJOYMENT = 8Haganai Next is very entertaining against its prequel. It simply grows up as a show. Taking away the overuse fan service that almost make me puke and don't watch this one. But here I enjoyed it because I laugh with cute sillyness and not dirty mind and double sense jokes like its predecessor.The confrontations of the characters give  good drama going. Plus reveals and puts us on the characters shoes and we feel their empathy.Also with the inclusion of the characters such as Kate and Aoi give a nice touch to the series.The only bad parts that I found are the characters' past not yet shown. Just Yozora-Kodaka childhood but others not. Like why Yukimura is like that? or what did Yozora did after she left in her childhood? Those answers that are unknown. The other one the ending of the series is just very abrupt the ending for the way it is. But I hope and pray for a 3rd season to come out to clear this up as soon as possible. This 2 things are what I have problems with, the rest is enjoyable. Although I don't see it that strong to be classified R+.OVERALL = 8I recommend it, if you survived the first season as I did. It is funny, dramatic with a good presentation, very well animated with great voice acting, and story. So you will really enjoy it if you are looking for a short show.Thanks a lot for those who have read this review and sorry if I had  grammar issues.

It's time to once again see what the Neighbor's Club like to do during their every day lives.And I know that there are a lot of ways people like to enjoy during their leisure time.

It's called the Neighbors Club.Yes, it's back! It's season 2 of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (also known as Haganai)  This is the direct sequel of the original season that debuted in Fall of 2011. It's been over a year and here it is once again with the Neighbors Club. The series is based on the light novel of the same name written by Yomi Hirasaka. The series details the activities of the Neighbors Club and how they live their every day boring lives. They don't have friends but they do have themselves and each other. With that, let their days of fun begin.First of all, what is the Neighbor's Club?Generally, the Neighbor's Club is a group of people founded with the purpose of making friends at St. Chronica's Academy. The academy is located at Catholic School and many of the students there views the main male protagonist as a foreigner, a delinquent, and generally someone who seems to be a troublemaker. Of course, this is a misconception and misjudgement. In fact, Kodaka isn't there to make trouble. He's there to make friends and with the Neighbor's Club, it makes the purpose of just that.The series retains its small cast of main characters who are all members of the Neighbor's Club. Besides Kodaka, the main male protagonist of the series, there is Yozora Mikazuki. She is seen as a girl who is egoistic, bitter, and a degenerate who seems to enjoy the idea of bullying. With her cold blooded personality, she lacks friends. It is not until she meets Kodaka and the other members of the Neighbor's Club that she decides to open herself more. Yet of course, she retains not only her shorter hair (from the first season) but also that dangerous and manipulate personality of her's. As a matter of fact, she is able to twist events, dialogues, and certain circumstances to fit within her liking. This is especially true to Sena, Maria, and most of the other members of the club.Speaking of which, Sena retains her personality as well. Although not seen as manipulative or cruel as Yozora, her arrogant attitude makes it difficult for Sena to make true friends. And of course, that's why she's a member of the Neighbor's Club! Nicknamed as “meat” by Yozora, Sena continues to enjoy the habit of playing ero games (sometimes with others). Her rivalry with Yozora still retains its amusement as the duo often battles it out in many outrageous contests that has mixed results. (usually in Yozora's favor)Among other members of the club includes the lovely self-proclaimed mad scientist Rika. Her physical appearance takes a delightful change for fans but behind that lab coat is still a girl of the same personality. Rika's love for eroticism and her own perverseness often gets her into many strange circumstances. In fact, her strange personality even becomes an hassle for Yozora to handle at many occasions. Odd one out, she's the most peculiar member of the club.Then of course, there's Yukimura who acts like a girl, behaves like a girl, and is... a member of the Neighbor's Club who adorably addresses Kodaka as “aniki”. Yukimura plays the role of a very feminine person, one who wishes to bring out the womanly side with the help of the Neighbor's Club. It's quite amusing to watch especially as Yukimura seems to be the most ordinary member of the group as well.The remaining two members of the club makes their appearances occasionally but every chance they encounter each other turns into a war of debate and argument. On one side, there's Kobato (Kodaka's younger sister) who often co-splays as a vampire with heterochromia. Then on the other hand, there's Maria who portrays the role of a nun at the very Catholic School the club is founded in. That's about as clear as oil mixed with water. In fact, the duo never seems to get along and gets into countless brawls. Yet at times, they seem to enjoy the fun of the Neighbor's Club because what do you know..they're also there to make some friends. Hopefully.The series follows its traditional episodic format. In fact, some of the episodes have two different stories that are divided between each other. Nonetheless, the story maintains its lighthearted atmosphere and what it's like to have fun with the daily activities. Some of the activities in the show is portrayed to bring out comedy and laughter while others seems to bring the club members closer together. Among some of these activities often includes some sort of way a member can manipulate events and strategically allow them to reach certain desired outcomes. Of course though, there are also fun activities the group enjoys altogether and hopefully get some of the same feelings of hanging out with 'friends'.Unfortunately, the series still suffers various problems. The characters themselves may be seen as fun and interactive to watch but lacks any sort of real development. In fact, there is not much development at all. The continued repetitive gags and rivalry between some of the characters also becomes a bit bothersome to watch. Then, there's that whole debate among fans on which girl is the “best”. Otherwise, the series seems to continue to avoid some serious drama related to events from the past regarding Yozora. In fact, at times, it seems the series just wants to have fun rather than extending the reality of story. Well, the series isn't realistic anyways since the show itself is based on this Neighbor's Club with such events in real life that makes it seem impossible for a group of students to hang around like that. The gap between fiction and reality here is just too large to fill. Among other problems, the series seems to have this unsettling mood involving many of the overused tropes. It takes its main theme of 'making friends' and turns it into a way that lacks real development. At times, the mood of the series becomes serious while other times immediately shifts to its typical mood. Although Kodaka and Rika received decent personalities from this sequel from my point of view, the rest of the cast also seemed a bit off balance.The animation retains its original cutting edges and presentation. There's not many change except for a few twists involving the physical appearances of the club members. In fact, one of the club members isn't the gender who you may originally predicted. AIC (Anime International Company) does their job at mediocre for this sequel, the same way they have done for some its other works involving the school life theme.As for soundtrack, the series makes it balance with the lighthearted rhythms. Tom-H@ck who demonstrates some of its skills makes the series' music in a way that is fun. Yet at times, the music is almost like a child's play for viewers' ears because of its repetition and stereotypes. The way the OP song plays the lyrics “Be my Friend” is a parody of the club as none of the members seems to be actual friends. Rather, it seems that they are just there to make their miserable lives a little better. However, I will say that it is quite catchy. BE MY FRIEND. Three words that can sum up the major theme of the series.Overall, this anime is an amusing watch although there are many times when things don't connect together. For now, I'll give the score of a “8”. With the weak plot progress as well as characters' development, this sequel seems to sway away some of the audience. Despite this though, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT still has its fun touches. Of course, in real life, having fun with your friends is one of the most enjoyable moments youths will experience. Whether at school or at home, friends are treasures that are valuable. It is this series that gives them a fun meaning and seeing the club members of the Neighbor's Club does that. At many other circumstances, the Neighbor's Club gets into those bitter arguments that makes its member seem more like enemies rather than friends. Well are they actually friends deep down by heart? Hmm, I hope so. to discover a new hobby. Some people likes to hang out with friends. Some people likes to go travel. Then, then are some people who lacks friends and wants to make some in order to live out their short and miserable lives It's especially not easy to make friends when the look on your face represents one that looks like a delinquent. It feels like you're the new kid at the block and everyone holds some sort of aversion towards you. Luckily though, there's this club that can remedy your alienation.

In less than 24 hours since the subbed version was uploaded to the site. Episode 11 received more than 100 fan comments on the page, AND almost 200,000 views, all in LESS THAN 24 hours from 1 SINGLE anime streaming site.That is simply the most number of views I had ever seen happen on an anime that quickly....For the haters of harem comedy, I really hope they can check this vastly popular anime out.-----------------------------Story (10/10)---------------------------------""Next"" is the 2nd season of the ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"" anime series, not only is it way better than the 1st season, it is the BEST harem anime I have seen to date. Story continues from the first season as Kodaka carries on the day to day adventures with his friends from the neighbour\'s club in school. However through brillant writing and character development every single day of the neighbour\'s club is a absolute riot to watch. You\'ll always be laughing and giggling at the characters conversations, happenings and adventures.-----------------------------Characters (10/10)---------------------------------A HUGE charm factor of this anime has to be the female cast, especially in this 2nd season. Not only is there a new addition of a charming sister in Kate. The hairstyle changes to two characters, Yozora and Rika. As well as constant costume changes to Yozora, Rika and Yukimura, bring out so much appeal and ""moe"" to the screen that it is almost impossible not to get dumbstruck each time one of their new ""looks"" debuts on screen.Part of the charm of the female cast this season also came from the deeper connections that the male lead (Kodaka) develops with the girls. Like in any harem anime, the girls start to discover that they love the main guy character. And since the guy is trying to be oblivious to their feelings, each of the girls try to appeal to him with cuter outfits and more feminine gestures to get his attention. You get shy wayward glances, tsundere type embarassed denials, extended eye contact with puppy eyes, everything that can make a guy gulp and hold his breath in his throat. So much romantic tension builds up throughout this anime that even his own younger sister gets swept up into the flow.-----------------------------Art (9/10)---------------------------------Part of the ""moeness"" of this anime comes from the amazing animation work done on the female characters. The new costumes, hairstyle and colours look absolutely stunning on the girls. With the standout example being Rika, changing into yet another breathtaking look almost every episode.-----------------------------Enjoyment (10/10)------------------------------What are you waiting for? ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT"" is a masterpiece of a harem anime that cannot be missed. Millions of viewers around the internet are waiting eagerly every week to catch the latest subbed version of this anime. Saying this anime is simply popular would be a HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT. I highly doubt there will be many viewers who remain not entertained after watching all 12 episodes of this anime :) For the haters of harem comedy, I really hope they can check this vastly popular anime out.-----------------------------Story (10/10)---------------------------------""Next"" is the 2nd season of the ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"" anime series, not only is it way better than the 1st season, it is the BEST harem anime I have seen to date.

Every-time i watch this show it gets funnier and funnier.Genres: Comedy, Ecchi, Harem, Romance, school lifeStory: the story pretty much takes place right after the first season.Everyone is in a club called the Neighbor's Club, and its were they try to make new friends and hang out with each other and learn social life skills. Kodaka ( a main character) still goes there to meet his four other club members to start there day and have new adventures everyday.Art: the animation are really good the characters really look nice with great art work.Sound: the...opening and ending song are nice. they did really well on the sound effects.Characters: Kodaka Hasegawa, Sena Kashiwazaki, Yozora Mikazuki , who are mostly the main characters with 4 more supporting charactersThis anime is great and funny cant wait to finish it off... for the people who haven't seen it I really recommend this one. Like always if this review help please like and let me know how i can make my reviews better. opening and ending song are nice. they did really well on the sound effects.Characters: Kodaka Hasegawa, Sena Kashiwazaki, Yozora Mikazuki , who are mostly the main characters with 4 more supporting charactersThis anime is great and funny cant wait to finish it off... for the people who haven't seen it I really recommend this one. Like always if this review help please like and let me know how i can make my reviews better."", 'Be My Friend Shiranai furi shitatteBe My Side Zenbu kidzui teta yoHaganai NEXT......Finished, frankly I don\'t know what to say about this anime\'s last episode and it was quite a disappointing that it ended in a cliffhanger, ok, so no more beating around the bush, how do I rate this anime, well, here\'s how:Story: Good 7.Since this was the continuation of the previous season, it still follows the same plot but with a couple of revelations along the way. Except of course with the romance genre, things are starting to heat up as the members of the ""Neighbor\'s Club"" are now competing for...the guy\'s affection be it directly or indirectly, which btw studio AIC Build has left us wondering as to what happens next, now that 2 new competition has arrive in the anime........ a little bit late that is.Art: Good 7.Ok, for the most part, there seems to have been some changes with the character\'s illustrations, ok so Yozura\'s hair is short given that she had it cut from the previous season. But, the changes I see has something to do with the uniforms, from the previous season the girls wore the a matching green skirt and green blazer, now they don a plait skirt and cardigans , well for the main cast the this. It would have been nice if this anime\'s illustrator be consistent, since the girls do go to St. Chronica Academy, instead of cardigans, maybe they should\'ve wore the school\'s standard green blazer and it would have been nice for once to see Kobato in her compete middle school uniform, also, I don\'t dig as to why Yukimura now that she was confirmed to be girl would still be in a boy\'s uniform. The consolation here is that we get to see Rika in a whole new different  form from a geeky girl to a hot babe and we also get to see Yozura\'s more hotter in plain clothes, only to change into wearing a track suit. But what make this anime\'s art good was the seemly part where the female cast are going commando.Oh, I still hate the way how Kodaka was illustrated, pretty obvious that illustrator  Shōichi Taguchi has no idea what a typical western delinquent would look like. Frankly, Kodaka looks more like a dork than a bad boy.Sound: fair 6.I simply like the opening theme, but for Kate\'s voice doesn\'t seem to match her character, since according to info she\'s 15, but her seiyu sounded like 20, in that case director Toru Kitahata should\'ve cast her as a twenty something adult, instead of a teenager which make it difficult to understand why someone in her age is a nun.Character and enjoyment: Good 7.The characters still maintains their usual roles except that we don\'t get to see anymore of Sena do the usual Parting Shot Fit....you know where she would say ""AHO, AHO, YOZURA, AHO, BAKA , BAKA WAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!"" and then she dashes out, you have to admit it was very funny, in fact episode 8, I\'ve wish that Yozura would have done the same thing when she dashes out of the room and saying ""AHO, AHO, SENA AHO, BAKA, BAKA, WAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!."" Also, it was very funny that Yozura get her share of getting grilled and we see that Sena was getting the upper-hand and that\'s what makes it enjoyable.Overall: Fair 6.Thought for the most part, this anime did provide the laughs and the gags, though I would have like to give this anime a 7, was the fact that it has an open ending it left us audience hanged and wondering if there will be another season or does writer Yomi Hirasaka and Misaki Harukawa  wants us to focus on the manga, either way it is up to us audience to wait and see. the guy\'s affection be it directly or indirectly, which btw studio AIC Build has left us wondering as to what happens next, now that 2 new competition has arrive in the anime........ a little bit late that is.Art: Good 7.Ok, for the most part, there seems to have been some changes with the character\'s illustrations, ok so Yozura\'s hair is short given that she had it cut from the previous season.

After the first season I thought that it's going in the right direction, but it's not. As to plot, in the first season there was SOME plot and overall end goal, but now it's all gone. It's basically series of random events, themes, cliché stuff based on other chinese cartoons, put together for the sole sake of finding friends. And dude, it's not even funny anymore. Characters are as flat as it's possible just like the plot. As to art and sound they are on a very decent level. To keep this short I'll just add that I don't know how...could I go through 6 eps doing my best no to fast forward them all the time. There are many better shows to watch, but I guess it's watchable if you find yourself having lots of spare time. could I go through 6 eps doing my best no to fast forward them all the time.

So.. uh.. here goes.I've watched the first season and the second season today. (Well, I became addicted with the series actually.) Haganai NEXT stands as the improvement of the first season, but the ending of the season wasn't really what I had in mind... and pretty much, for those who watched this.The storyline was going so well for me, and I hate it when the episodes I watch buffer. However, the thing that stood out was the ending. Like I said, it wasn't the best ending. Abrupt, so I'm expecting a third season right around the corner. I...could've given a 9 to the story, but the ending was a downer. Positively, a harem romantic comedy where the main character is dense. That isn't new in anime. But, he changed at the end. He ain't the Taka everyone once knew, and I liked it.The characters were the standouts of the this season. At the first season, I haven't seen the potential of the characters. This season, we see the evolution of the Good Neighbors Club. The bond is stronger, and a harem formed in this season. Last season, it was more of just Sena and Sora. Yukimura, from the maid to being a butler (guess the reference), and Rika finally brings Taka to his senses (no more dense MC). The standouts of this season were Rika and Sena.I enjoyed the series. I stopped watching the first season because I found another anime that stood out (Nisekoi). After watching, I tried other anime such as Mayo Chiki, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and other kinds of Romantic Comedic anime. I watched the first episode of the first season, and after about 10 hours, I finished watching both seasons. I hate it when the video buffers and there were laughs, especially during their amusement park ride. There were happy and sad moments, but it never failed to enjoy me.Overall, I liked it. Like the first season, the anime had an abrupt ending. Haganai Next is the improvement and evolution of not only the characters but the series as well. Since it ended that way, hopefully, we see the 3rd season. A lot of questions are already on my mind regarding what will happen with the club and I'm looking forward to the day the next season will be released. I hope the anime improves more, and so far, it has been one of the best harem series I've seen. That's a plus. could've given a 9 to the story, but the ending was a downer.

A lot of questions are already on my mind regarding what will happen with the club and I'm looking forward to the day the next season will be released. I hope the anime improves more, and so far, it has been one of the best harem series I've seen. That's a plus."", ""Who would of thought making friends is hard? Other than that, there's a club for that! Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next also known as Haganai Next is the second season of Haganai. For those who haven't seen Haganai, you should consider it. Haganai is a great rom-com. Haganai focuses more on comedy rather than romance, but the two mix very well. A brief summary for those who wants a recap without spoilers: Kodaka just wanted to make friends during his high school year, but he struggles to make friends in his first few month in school.  What can Kodaka possibly face? There is...no problem when there is supposedly one guy and a bunch of girls together in a club right!Another great year for The Neighbor's Club! Would Kodaka ever achieve his goal? Forget that, The Neighbor's Club will fix that. The Neighbor's Club started small, but it grew into a big active club. Kodaka is surprisingly popular with the girls! He is the only guy in the club with six other girls. As everybody in the group wants to make friends, the girls started to have feelings for Kodaka.The shift from season one to season two made Haganai enjoyable. There are more spotlight of other characters rather than Sena and Yozora. We still have the same comedy, but this time around, there will be more of romance. What I like the most from Haganai is the jokes they use. They may be common, but the staff put the jokes in perfect timing with the scenario. A good example would be... instead of explaining it in words, have a picture: http://imgur.com/a/25P25 . Other than that, I wonder who would win in this harem genre?The art style is pretty. I may be biased, but I do love characters that are well drawn with beautiful eyes. Anime has changed throughout the years, and I have to say that I prefer the art style now (modern times). The colors they used is thoughtful too (http://i.imgur.com/0GAJfBH.gif). Each character is unique in terms of art style. You have Kodaka, a dirty blonde hair color. In Japan, a boy with that hair style would be shown as a delinquent. It gives insight rather than having those out of color hairstyles like pink, blue or green (not saying that I hate them, but I do love pink hair). There are also characters that are lolis and moe is definitely included (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fsHFTZLxYM).The opening and ending is pretty good. They have a catchy tone to it. The opening is significant because it foreshadows what is going to happen in season two. The ending is what I enjoy the most. I watched it during when the anime was airing, and I just had to watch the ending and then the preview. I just couldn't skip it. The ending is just cute or kawaii in it's own way. Other than the OP/ED, I didn't enjoy the audio too much. The OST isn't amazing. If I were to compare it to Shingeki no Kyojin, their OST is better by far.The character are all likeable. People just have strong grounds to have a best girl. My favorite would be Kobato because she is the best. There is no need trying to argue over me. Just kidding; everybody have their own personal preferences. The character development from season one to season two got better. It shows more of who the character is and their objective in the anime. There are also gags in the anime which is pretty good considering that Yozora and Sena are rivals. Sena has the attitude of being the best, but Yozora tries to confront that attitude. Other than the main characters, the other club members are Rika, Maria, Kobato and Yukimura. Kobato and Maria are the lolis of the show. Rika is the mad scientist and Yukimura is the loyal servant. Rika wants to make friends at the club, while Yukimura wants to fulfill the samurai's code.To end this review, I have enjoyed the anime and believe other people should watch Haganai. There are many other great rom-com, but Haganai is somewhere in the top 50. The enjoyment throughout this anime is pretty good. I watched it straight away once it got subbed. The jokes that were used were clever. I would recommend watching Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (or known as OreGairu) and Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (or known as Oreshura). These anime are all similar as having a guy in a club full of girls. Other than that, there are clever jokes in each anime. All of them also have a romance feel to it.

Yes he didnt have any friends at first, but now i dont know if i can call this as friends or in harem mode, but he is oblivious to relationship anyways. Will make my review short.Story 7/10: It's funny as usual, far better than season 1. Swear words are back, some indecent scenes are shown, wow. But what brings me down is the last episode, what a cliffhanger ending.Art 8/10: I say it's acceptable to the viewers.Sound 8/10 : What? I just like the OP. It's so catchy though everyone might not agree on this. OP song composed by Tom-H@ck...who also composed on K-on!Character 7/10: If you watch this series, you will know how they behave.Enjoyment 10/10 : Watch after you watch some sad,feels anime series, this will brighten your mood fast like me. Well maybe recommended to those who already watch season 1.Recommended: Those who love fanservices and bigboobs and harem ;)Not Recommended: Opposite as what i stated aboveOverall: 8/10 who also composed on K-on!Character 7/10: If you watch this series, you will know how they behave.Enjoyment 10/10 : Watch after you watch some sad,feels anime series, this will brighten your mood fast like me. Well maybe recommended to those who already watch season 1.Recommended: Those who love fanservices and bigboobs and harem ;)Not Recommended: Opposite as what i stated aboveOverall: 8/10"", 'So let me start off by saying that I really enjoyed the first season of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai and came to this season with roughly the same expectations. I\'m sad to say it but this second season was a real disappointment. For those that have already watched the first season already and are continuing to the second, I won\'t tell you not to watch it, just remember to keep your expectations low.Story (5/10)Well the story was never really a main point for the series anyways. The goal of the club was to make friends yet it\'s obvious that they aren\'t even trying to...accomplish that. What usually happens in every episode is they\'ll ""try out things that popular people would do"" as practice for real life situations. While I was never really interested in the story, I\'m glad that this season still retains its bits of comedy which really sold the first season for me. One of the annoying points of the story was the fact everyone in the club refused to acknowledge each other as friends. Kodaka repeatedly brings up the fact he ""has no friends"" throughout the series. Seriously? After all you\'ve been through in the club, you don\'t consider them your friends?Art (8/10)Nothing to complain about from me here. The art is still of the same quality as last season.Sound (8/10)So I really liked the opening and ending songs enough that I listened to them most of the time and wouldn\'t skip them, which is what I usually do when I watch anime. Not sure why I liked them so much, but they\'re really catchy and upbeat. It feels like they compliment with the feelings the show brings out.Characters (5/10)This is where a lot of my problems lie so I\'ll start off with the positive points first. The three new characters introduced didn\'t get much time in the series but I thought they were all likeable. Kate plays the part of Maria\'s overly protective and siscon older sister. Aoi is Sena\'s class rival who always comes 2nd to her in exams and she is extremely jealous of Sena but Sena never notices her. Hinata is the kindhearted and popular class president who Yozura despises for being the epitome of a popular person. Yukimura is still Yukimura, as devoted and likeable as ever. As usual Maria and Kobato fight with each other like little kids which can get kind of annoying at times, but towards the end of the series you can see that they really like each other.There were quite a few negative points to the characters as well. Rika constantly making passes at Kodaka and getting rejected gets pretty overdone and bland as the series goes on. Sena and Yozura\'s fighting continues throughout the entire season and every time they fight one of them ends up almost crying. I can kind of tell that Sena doesn\'t really hate Yozura all that much but Yozura seems like she\'s driven out of pure malice. Kodaka continues to blatantly ignore anyone in the club that tries to ask him out because he doesn\'t want things to get awkward in the club. While I can sympathize for him, I feel he should just flat out tell them his feelings cause ignoring all of them isn\'t gonna work forever (as you\'ll see). Overall its obvious that there was hardly any character development and they act the almost the same way to each other as they did in season one.Enjoyment (5/10)So I had a hard time enjoying this season for reasons given above. It feels like in every episode the characters just repeat the same arguments and actions over and over again. While there were bits of comedy mixed in that added some enjoyment to the show it couldn\'t make up for how annoying the story and character interactions were. If I hadn\'t watched the first season of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai then I certainly wouldn\'t have had it in me to finish this season since it was so painful to watch.Overall (6/10)So I\'m not happy about it but I\'d have to give this season a 6. The story picked up straight from season one but it just wasn\'t able to give me the same level of enjoyment that I experienced from its first season. The character interactions got to be really annoying to the point I want to scream at them to just shut up and get along with each other. While the Art and Sound were of the same quality as the last season, the Story and Characters just fell flat and left me seriously disappointed.

If you haven\'t seen season 1 yet, don\'t read this, will probably spoil alot of season 1.What Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next does, is really just speed up the tempo of the series. It\'s in depth a harem series, but it\'s also depicting the more sad part about the harem series genre. The fact how the boy in the series, is eventually burdened with being forced to break up his group of friends, to make a choice. Who do he choose?Do he choose the totally beatiful Kashiwazaki Sena, who brings his family greater...respect, who has been a friend even from a very young age. With her strange interesting hobby\'s, and her skill of using her powerful family name to break enemies.Do he choose his best known childhood friend Mikazuki Yozora, who he has had hard time adapting to as a potential love interest, but still give him some moments where he truly see\'s her beauty.Do he choose Higuma Rika, the nutty professor, with all her charming quirks and obsession with boy\'s love. Cause hello, who doesn\'t think she is perverted in such a way, that you just can\'t laugh.Do he choose Kusunoki Yukimura, the boy, girl, something, that just begs for his recognisition. For him to be her, ""samurai master"" or husband if you prefer.This is what makes me love ga Sukunai. It\'s so hard to tell who to choose, and that makes it exciting all the way until the end.In general not a must watch per se, but if you want a harem anime. Then it\'s a must watch.Thanks for reading my short synopsis. respect, who has been a friend even from a very young age.

My Girl Friend and myself watched both the first and second season of this show and we loved it.  I am a much more serious business man, and she a nurse.  Her favorite thing in life is a good laugh, which can stop so many fights.  Sadly I have never been one for humor, I take everything and break it down logically.  Even with that when we watched this together I was on the ground laughing.  If you or your significant other are big...into humor and you want a cute date night anime this serious is amazing.  My only real complaint is the ending.  It does end in a cliff hanger, and like so many other anime that end in cliff hangers I had to start suffering a couple episodes before the end because I started to tally up all the things they needed to wrap up and realized their was not enough time.  Not only do they not wrap up those things but throw a lot more questions on top as they end.  A pretty big one 15 seconds before the end too.  But I would still give it a 9/10 because of how damn funny watching these was, even to the end it still had some funny parts when it got serious. into humor and you want a cute date night anime this serious is amazing.

I think that, in and of itself, speaks volumes about the problem with Haganai NEXT and it's final episodes.  I'm not exactly sure why they decided to completely change the format they had going from the first season and first half of NEXT, but it was a big mistake.Haganai, at its best, was wildly hilarious.  It managed to blend the typical harem anime with some really solid humor, with a slight touch of raunchiness...to it.  The characters were also very likable, outside of Yozora.  I didn't hate Yozora, but I didn't like her all that much, either.  Everyone else, however, I really enjoyed.  Even the straight man MC Kodaka, which is rarely the case.But, for some reason, they sucked almost all of the humor out of the anime in the second half.  Haganai NEXT suddenly tries to get serious in the second half, and it completely fails for a multitude of reasons.  The biggest of which is the paradigm shift the characters suffer.  Yozora goes from being Tsundere to just being a total jerk.  Rika shifts from being an irredeemable pervert to some kind of a emotionally wise sage.  Sena bizarrely goes from being a spoiled goof ball who is the butt of the jokes, to pretty much just staying glued to her games, until it's time for the finale.  The others, including my two favorite girls, Maria and Yukimura both see their lines dramatically reduced.But, worst of all, was the finale.  It's bad and unsatisfying. The entire build up to the finale was weak. What should have been the most intriguing episodes turned out to be the most droll and meandering storyline wise.Overall, I feel like I could've just dropped this anime instead of keeping it around to watch later for the last 4 years.

The characters are pretty defined and they all have their own story and distinct personality. I loved the jokes, the artstyle, the fanservice without it being too much or too obvious, good stuff.One thing to get off my chest though, I'm really tired of the whole *girl mumbles something* *guy asks what she said 'what was that? what did you say?'* *girl says 'nothing, never mind!'* bit. Especially in this second season, the girls always say stuff that clearly show their interest in Kodaka, and he NEVER hears their mumbling and they always make up excuses as soon as they realize he...didn't hear them.It's fine once or twice, but this happened all the freaking time. As usual, the guy is completely and utterly oblivious to the advances of the girls. I guess the bit before a relationship is always more interesting, and the plot of the show is making friends, but it got a little annoying in the end.Regardless, this show was hilarious almost all the time, loved it! didn't hear them.It's fine once or twice, but this happened all the freaking time.

It went from this hilarious ""romantic"" comedy that was pretty ridiculous in the first season, to a real romantic comedy that toned down some of the ridiculousness in favor of plot and character development. It still has the same comedy and all of the same assets as the first season, but with more seriousness and just overall progress. Which I Love.....except for that ending.Story- The story is alot better in the second season than the first season, because it actually has a ""story"". In the first season it feel too episodic, meaning that...it didn\'t feel like it had a direction or set path, almost like the episodes could be viewed in any random order and you wouldn\'t notice it. However the second season is nothing like that. I really like this change of pace, because the characters seem alot more dynamic and less linear, and there is actual progression between all of the characters. It feels like it has alot more romance in it and just feels alot more thought was put into it than the first season. My one and pretty much only gripe about the second season is the ending it has. It had everything going in it\'s favor and then that massive disappointment of an ending. The third season is definitely where everything will really go down, and you get a peak of that, but it feels way too much like a cliffhanger. If I had to compare the ending to another ending I would compare it to rosario+vampire, which is now in second place for worst cliffhanger ever. I really loved the story line and how it was compose, and I love the new direction this anime is taking, but I feel that cliffhanger ending is holding it back from being better. As of now it\'s a 7/10 as a whole for me, but if a third season does come out (oh please god let one be on the way!) then it will easily go up to an 8/10 or possibly even a 9/10 if it plays it\'s card right.Art- The art style is the same as ever. If you liked the art style of the first style then you will love the art style of the second season.Sound- The sound is great in this anime. The opening really fits the overall theme and just syncs with what the anime is all about, as well as the ending theme.Character- The characters were already really good in the first season, but after the end of the second season they are on a whole different level. The characters really do change alot during this season and really seem to grow for the better, except maybe one person which is left unclear whether or not it was bad or good what she done. By the end of the third season the characters will be the same, and yet drastically different in key areas.Enjoyment- To be honest I wasn\'t expecting much out of this anime when I first started watching it. I was expecting it to be in the same format as the first season with no real progression and just more hijinks, but I was presently surprised with how it started going and was hoping for it to end good, and that wish was half granted. It\'s still as funny as ever, but it seems to have more direction and character development now, and seems to be taking itself more seriously. With alot of anime i\'ve watched that where in the same category as this, they always seemed to get worse in the second season and the overall quality of the anime would lessen, but not with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. It seems like they wanted to be taken more seriously, but stay the same somehow, and they definitely accomplished that. It was extremely enjoyable for me and I am eagerly awaiting the third season to come out. I haven\'t been this hyped for another season of an anime in, well forever.Overall-Overall the second season was a huge surprise to me, in a good way. I\'m so glad it decided to take the direction and tone it took now, personally I think it\'s for the best. I\'m having high hopes for the third season which is where I think all the really important stuff is going to happen. It was a really fun ride with a rather abrupt stop that I think wasn\'t executed all that well, if it wasn\'t for that sour and distasteful ending it would have easily been ranked an 8, but it just left a sour taste in my mouth. If you watched the first season and aren\'t sure whether you should watch this season then I highly recommend you do. Alot does happen in the second season and the characters change quite a bit, but if you can\'t handle a major cliffhanger then you might want to wait until the third season comes out and finishes. it didn\'t feel like it had a direction or set path, almost like the episodes could be viewed in any random order and you wouldn\'t notice it. However the second season is nothing like that. I really like this change of pace, because the characters seem alot more dynamic and less linear, and there is actual progression between all of the characters. It feels like it has alot more romance in it and just feels alot more thought was put into it than the first season. My one and pretty much only gripe about the second season is the ending it has. It had everything going in it\'s favor and then that massive disappointment of an ending. The third season is definitely where everything will really go down, and you get a peak of that, but it feels way too much like a cliffhanger. If I had to compare the ending to another ending I would compare it to rosario+vampire, which is now in second place for worst cliffhanger ever. I really loved the story line and how it was compose, and I love the new direction this anime is taking, but I feel that cliffhanger ending is holding it back from being better. As of now it\'s a 7/10 as a whole for me, but if a third season does come out (oh please god let one be on the way!) then it will easily go up to an 8/10 or possibly even a 9/10 if it plays it\'s card right.Art- The art style is the same as ever. If you liked the art style of the first style then you will love the art style of the second season.Sound- The sound is great in this anime. The opening really fits the overall theme and just syncs with what the anime is all about, as well as the ending theme.Character- The characters were already really good in the first season, but after the end of the second season they are on a whole different level. The characters really do change alot during this season and really seem to grow for the better, except maybe one person which is left unclear whether or not it was bad or good what she done. By the end of the third season the characters will be the same, and yet drastically different in key areas.Enjoyment- To be honest I wasn\'t expecting much out of this anime when I first started watching it. I was expecting it to be in the same format as the first season with no real progression and just more hijinks, but I was presently surprised with how it started going and was hoping for it to end good, and that wish was half granted. It\'s still as funny as ever, but it seems to have more direction and character development now, and seems to be taking itself more seriously. With alot of anime i\'ve watched that where in the same category as this, they always seemed to get worse in the second season and the overall quality of the anime would lessen, but not with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. It seems like they wanted to be taken more seriously, but stay the same somehow, and they definitely accomplished that. It was extremely enjoyable for me and I am eagerly awaiting the third season to come out. I haven\'t been this hyped for another season of an anime in, well forever.Overall-Overall the second season was a huge surprise to me, in a good way. I\'m so glad it decided to take the direction and tone it took now, personally I think it\'s for the best. I\'m having high hopes for the third season which is where I think all the really important stuff is going to happen. It was a really fun ride with a rather abrupt stop that I think wasn\'t executed all that well, if it wasn\'t for that sour and distasteful ending it would have easily been ranked an 8, but it just left a sour taste in my mouth. If you watched the first season and aren\'t sure whether you should watch this season then I highly recommend you do.

Protagonist has a harem but the main focus is the love triangle between him and the other 2 main characters.I liked the art and sound. It\'s nothing special but it looks good nonetheless, there\'s nothing that stood out to me as unpleasant.In general I would say this anime is more romance/drama than comedy. It has its funny moments but i\'d say the main reason for watching this is the drama stuff, lewdness and love plot, if you\'re into those kinds of things. The second season has more drama and does push the love triangle aspect a...lot more than the comedy angle if you compare it to the first season.The character writing annoys me more in this season than the first season. Kodaka is still the indecisive dullard that ignores his surroundings, but it gets even worse. He\'s constantly pretending he can\'t hear anything in this season and it gets really damn annoying. The one thing they got right was making Sena have a stronger personality. Originally she was a doormat that never stood up to Yozora, and in this season she seems to have come out of her shell a bit and stands up for herself. It\'s one of the aspects of character development that they did perfectly in this season.(Spoiler alert)Towards the end of the season, Sena actually confesses her love for him. In the first season I found Sena kind of lacking, but in this season she actually starts to stand up for herself and isn\'t afraid to tell people her feelings. Of course Kodaka (being the paperweight he is) runs off and ignores Sena and the rest of the club very rudely. Rika finally confronts him about his cowardice but even after all of that, it still seems like Kodaka hasn\'t learned anything. The season ends with Kodaka approaching Sena but ultimately saying nothing to her as they find out that Yozora, in her typical self-centered fashion, has ""gone on a journey"".On the topic of love triangles, this anime doesn\'t ever resolve anything. The love triangle exists throughout the entire anime to titillate the viewer, and nothing more. It felt like there was actually a degree of plot progression this season. The love triangle starts to become lopsided as Yozora is constantly incapable of approaching Kodaka. Not only that, but Yozora also paints herself as a very underhanded and somewhat sociopathic person in this season. She\'s constantly trying to cheat to get an upper hand over Sena when it comes to Kodaka. She tries to rig a game so that she can kiss Kodaka but when Sena ends up winning anyways, she calls the game off. She tries to write Sena out of the play and make her a villain, and when Sena calls her out on her shitty behavior, she storms off and says some REALLY mean thing to Sena about how she wishes she never met her. Yozora has transformed from a cynical tsundere girl to a sociopath and a bully, and it\'s almost sickening. This is an anime about a club created for making friends and Yozora is doing the exact opposite of that. It honestly disturbed me how all of the other characters let her sling her insults at Sena and nobody says a damn thing about it or even remarks on it really. Ultimately as the season progressed I found myself more and more disgusted with Yozora and rooting for Sena.The plot really takes a nosedive at the end of the show, and viewers are right to be angry with how the writers chose to sloppily end the season. It felt cobbled together and lacking cohesion, like nobody could decide on how exactly the show needs to end so they took the laziest route.What started out in season 1 as a dramatic romcom with heavy usage of tropes has devolved into a melodrama with a weak protagonist that refuses to grow up and a love triangle falling apart at the seams. The comedy is all but nonexistent this season and the drama is unpalatable due to the poorly written characters. This anime does not deserve a third season with the way it resolved everything in the final episode. lot more than the comedy angle if you compare it to the first season.The character writing annoys me more in this season than the first season.

It has funny and sometimes trashy characters and scenes. If you like trashy and often sexual humor, then this anime will not leave you indifferent. I would like to list the pros and cons that can be noticed and that will be noticeable to you while watching.Pros:-No fake Ecchi-Not very tense good school atmosphere-Interesting girls-Anime will not make you bored (IF you are not afraid of the humor mentioned above)-Cute and funny situations according to all the canons of rom-coms-Typical light and romantic soundtracksI recommend this anime to those who are tired of...action dramas and want to take a break from other creations with lots of deaths and other things. But...Cons:-If you want to feel angry at some characters and smash your monitor, then watch this anime.( BUT this can also be considered a plus for some)-Open ending, no continuation action dramas and want to take a break from other creations with lots of deaths and other things. But...Cons:-If you want to feel angry at some characters and smash your monitor, then watch this anime.( BUT this can also be considered a plus for some)-Open ending, no continuation', 'Story: For anyone that likes comedy, harem, and some Ecchi type anime then this show offers all that. I loved this anime because every episode was very funny, whether it was from the Ecchi scenes, to the harem, or because one of the characters was just being funny. Aside from that the message sent from this anime was said directly to the main character. I like how the story wasn\'t the typical ""love drama"" type anime. Sure there were moments where it showed that but for the most part this anime focused on the comedy rather that the love because the ending left a lot...to be desired in the love aspect.Art: Well what\'s there to not like. The art was very good, the character designs were not plain or overused it was just amazing. Also the hair color for each character looked realistic compared to the other animes where characters have green, blue, purple hair. This one focuses on keeping the art realistic yet enjoyable. I have to say black or brown is not my ideal color for a character\'s hair color, but in this anime it was very well done since it fit each character\'s personalities.Sound: The opening as always followed the theme of the story. Not much to say about sound because it was also very well done.Character: I don\'t mind Yozora\'s personality, she\'s just like that it can\'t be helped. Her actions taken do seem rather impulsive and rash at times, but seeing her personality as reserved I can relate to her. Every character\'s personalities matched their appearance even if some say they hated it. Sena well we all know how she\'s like, but honestly she\'s the reason why this anime has so much comedy. She was the character that brought out the comedy in the anime along with Rika. I think to further strengthen this review a third season would be nice because I would be able to give a more broad analysis about Yozora and Sena seeing as how those two seemed to be the focus in the 2nd season.Enjoyment: Ecchi, Comedy, Harem, School, this anime provides that. I enjoyed every second of it event despite the content showed. There were no boring episodes but I do have to say the ending was rather weak in my opinion because it looked rushed to me.Overall: I hope Boku Wa Tomadachi gets a 3rd season because it honestly needs one because of the way it ended.

For the whole two seasons you'll be groaning in frustration at how obstinate these people are. For the sake of my finger muscles, please take this as  review of season 1 as well as they are extremely similar in nature.Story - 7Don't expect anything in the way of deep insights and profound statements in this. It is brutally honest, in that it does exactly what it says on the tin. It is simply a show about a bunch of misfits who want to make friends. Of course there is the...odd twist and turn here and there but nothing that deflects the story too dramatically.Art - 9I enjoyed the visuals of this anime. It produced a nice blend of color and clarity. The only problem I had was it made everyone's head look rather fat.Sound - 9Not sure whether this ought to come under sound or character but I particularly enjoyed the vocal performances of this anime. Especially Rika and Kobato. I can't comment on the intro and end theme's as I've only recently got into the habit of listening to them and I watched this before then.Characters - 9The characters of Haganai (short for the full title, if you're wondering), are..... interesting to say the least. They all seem to have some sort of fetish or another. And psychologically they're all a bunch of oddballs as well. Except for the main, who has the misfortune of being ostracized through a combination of really bad luck and a tendency to be misunderstood. It's a strange ensemble but nevertheless they make for an entertaining bunch to watch. One mans pain is another mans pleasure, so they say. Though, thankfully, its not too serious in this.Enjoyment - 9The enjoyment of this anime is the fact that, being humans, we all probably have some parts of us we are ashamed of. Maybe we are (unintentional) bullies or maybe we have a bit of a superiority complex. Watching this is a nice way to find out which one you are because you'll probably end up relating to the character who is similar to you. Me? Well I ended up relating the one with a fetish for doujinshi featuring robots..... Yeah... oh, wait..... excuse me a sec, my therapist is calling.Overall - 9Like I said, this anime is uber uber frustrating. A lets-make-friends club. Well lock up a bunch of teenagers and a couple of pre-pubescent's, force them into doing activities together..... you can guess the outcome. Asides from the cast simply refusing to state the obvious, the sheer comedic value more than makes up for this animes shortcomings. odd twist and turn here and there but nothing that deflects the story too dramatically.Art - 9I enjoyed the visuals of this anime.

Well, I have seen both seasons of bokusuku and after finishing this one I would say I liked it a lot better than the first season. In this season I think we get a much better understanding of the characters and what the story is all about. In the first season I feel the story was lost and the ""we have to prepare ourselves for the world of friends"" aspect was just an excuse for the writers to make up situations that added no real value to the show\'s overall theme. Bokusuku NEXT however was, I\'m glad to say,...much more focussed on both characters and story.What I keep asking myself as I write this review is -""what would I want to know if I was considering watching this show"", well I guess I would have liked to know that this anime really explores its characters, showing us their flaws and struggles as the show progresses. That it focusses alot more on young love and a fear of love than the first season did. I also thought that bokusuku NEXT was alot funnier than the original too and I put this down once again to the familiarity we gain with the characters.Lastly I would ask, ""would I recommend this anime?""For slice-of-life lovers I would have to say yes. For comedy lovers, also yes. For people who are just in it for the fan service I would say yes again because it rarely isn\'t present (also something you may want to keep in mind if you\'re not comfortable with that stuff), but for any other people, people who like romance or drama or harem, I would say no. This anime, in my opinion isn\'t really main stream. Its not going to please everybody and not everybody is going to enjoy it. For a final statement I would have to advise that apart from the genres I listed before, comedy, slice-of-life and ecchi, this anime has little else to give. much more focussed on both characters and story.What I keep asking myself as I write this review is -""what would I want to know if I was considering watching this show"", well I guess I would have liked to know that this anime really explores its characters, showing us their flaws and struggles as the show progresses.

Now besides Yozora and Sena, Rika enters the spotlight to compete for Kodakas affection. It\'s a full makeover and transformed from a nerdy labcoat scientist to a cute girl and now looks just like the others. It\'s nice to look at but takes personality out of her.She doesn\'t look special anymore, just another cutie that wouldn\'t stand out if it were only for the looks.Maria and Kobata lost a bit of screen time but I\'m ok with this as they\'re only the supporting characters and too young to...play a meaningful role in this love triangle/square or should I even say pentagon.The Arguments between Sena and Yozura are not that one sided anymore. It became like a 60-40 or 70-30 ratio in favor of Yozura. Before it was like 99% chance that Sena would be running out crying. It was important for me to point out the change because it really annoyed me in season 1.It took aeons until we finally could see more relationship development between Yozora, Sena and Kodaka. Im not sure how I should rate Kodakas passiveness towards relations. Maybe he\'s so passive for the same reason as Yozora, in order to prevent hurt when the bond is broken, but then he should at least feel something for Yozora but this guy... We ll probably find out in season 3.For me it still lacks the depth I wanted to see between those 3. The last episodes also tend to let you root for Sena because she gets all these special relations with Kodaka while Yozora gets left out and Rika isn\'t even worth mentioning cause she\'s way out of the competing range.Kodaka ""was no protagonist "" until the very end of season2 but everything revolves around his perspective. Another Yozora point of view episode wouldnicely fit in as the first episode of season 3 or a Sena POV for a change.We dont really get into her mind and feelings at all.Spoiler:About Kodaka *inserts You Dense Mother#§% Meme*The Creators really let us suffer on their hook. When will this guy finally open himself up. Obviously in season 3.

In a nutshell the series is very good, and I mean VERY good. You will basically laugh from start to end mainly because masterly written characters. BUT there are two things I cannot forgive which in the end droped this sezon score down the on the bottom.***Minor spoilers ahead***First thing is the ending. I mean.. WHAT? So bad and opened ending is not acceptable even if the story still isnt completed (manga is still ongoing). The last episode seems like ""filling"". Yes, there is this awesome fight on the roof with really emotional...conclusion, but otherwise?? EH no good I tell you, no good. It seems like our main character Yozora is no more important, so we can just dump her with no explanation and final headlines. END.I can thing only of one anime which had worse last episode and it was Mayo Chiki! It is funny that in this anime there is even reference on Mayo, so maybe the author inspired himself and did some crappy ending in the favor of that also unfinished romance.I mean what is the point of watching this series really? It only drives you mad in the end. You will love the characters, love the setting and suddenly it all ends .. ends.. nothing more.Second thing I hated was this indecisiveness of the main protagonist Kodaka. I mean really? He has only TWO phrases to response to a girl who tries to help him or say she has crush on him, and with that I mean: Oh sorry didnt hear ya, the game is too loud. OR even worse He simply runs away. So dissipointed. In the first season was Kodaka so much better of a character, his deliquesnt like approach even if he didnt want it, and now he is crybaby who runs away in the slightest hint of emotions.I will again use reference to another anime - the only worse protagonist in his stupidity is Raku from Nisekoi.So in conclusion, what is the meaning of this I ask?? Why those characters who are so much fun and well writen in casual situations so much suck in the emotional moments which should be main part of this anime. I can thing only of one thing . Author is really bad and dont know how to deal with it. He is not able to write deeper emotional moments but he wants to have it in the show.WELL, overall score will be 7 because I really laugh my ass out almost during the whole series BUT I cannot go higher due to described reasons.For the characters I wanted to give straight ten due to Rikas awesome progress and overall good char settings but Kodaka blew it last few episodes. 8/10.PS: If the rest of the manga will be converted into anime we will all cry, because the ending and final desicion of main hero (who will be his love??) is mindfuck. It only confirms my statement that the author dont what what he is doing. conclusion, but otherwise?? EH no good I tell you, no good.

Rather than focusing on the Neighbor Club doing fun things like the first season did, this twelve episode fiasco decides that the club room is way more fun. So what we get is a slog of an anime with no redeeming qualities aside from the fact it ends.If I were to rate the story, I’d give it a nonexistent out of five. The beginning of this season is nothing but episodic garbage where Sena likes Kodaka, Yozora likes Kodaka, Rikka likes Kodaka; so on and so forth. There’s some humor to...be found, especially in the club’s one outing to an amusement park, but what little is there is not enough to sate even the biggest fans thirst. Later on there’s a minor plot about making a film for the cultural festival (a la Haruhi Suzumiya) but that only leads to an anticlimax and then segues to the worst ending I can possibly imagine a harem having.I’ve bitched about bad harem main characters before. The idea of the character not picking a girl is tied to the whole “fantasy” thing where you as the viewer need to put yourself in his shoes and decide. That’s the essence of many visual novels and I don’t think the folks who make anime understand that story telling in a visual novel works because, in the end, you’ve picked a girl to go with after being ambiguous and deciding for a while. In an anime, you cannot stay at that ambiguous phase. It’s annoying to have a show that boils down to a guy needing to decide on the girl he wants to date and then the show says “Nope”. Then what’s the point? Is the point of having a harem to have a bunch of platonic relationships that go nowhere and mean nothing? As a viewer, it’s boring. I’ve put myself in his shoes and obviously he needs to be dating Sena! I decided that, like, the first episode.What pisses me off even further is that Kodaka is betrothed to Sena. Yeah, they were childhood friends before he met Yozora. And Sena wants to marry him; she’s in love. And what does he do? He fucking runs away! This leads to Rika confronting him on the rooftop of the school in one of the most meta/stupid scenes I’ve ever seen. Rika is controlling metal balls with her mind and telling Kodaka what a pussy he is. It leads to a huge action scene that you’d think would end with Kodaka realizing that, while dating one of them would break up the club dynamic, who gives a shit when you’re hurting more people than you’re helping?Nope, instead we end with Kodaka approaching Sena, possibly to decide to be with her, probably not. It doesn’t matter because we get a stupid goddam interruption by their phones. Did I mention this series likes to end scenes where we could see development by abruptly having a phone ring or a rush of air breeze by?In the end, Yozora has run away after Sena’s confession and all I can say is good riddance. With her out of the way, why not FUCKING MARRY SENA?Or don’t and instead wait for the third season…that never came thank God.CharactersOne of my biggest problems with NEXT comes from Kodaka and Rikka, both of whom have obviously changed a little between season one and two. Kodaka is more perverted now, while Rikka is kind of a yandere. It’s a minor thing but very noticeable when you watch both seasons back to back.If you want to see more about the characters, read my review of the first season. What they boil down to is Yozora’s a bitch, Sena is awesome, Rika is funny but nuts, Kodaka is a pussy, Maria is an annoying loli, Kobato is just kinda there and Yukimura the he/she maid is actually a she but wants to be a he.Also, I want to mention Kate, Maria’s big sister. She’s a nun who drinks a lot of cola and is ridiculously hot…until the first anime fart joke I’ve heard since Naruto. She walks away after ripping ass and says “Oh, that’s a wet one!”.And the Lord said, let your boner recede into you and come out the other side like a tail. And it did.There are also a couple new characters in the student council but they make such minor appearances and have so little character I won’t even worry about it.AnimationOn top of everything else being a downgrade, the animation has also taken a plunge. It’s not bad at all but the crispness and beauty of season one has given way to cheaper looking animation.SoundThe opening and ending are pretty average. The English dub continued to be a decent substitution for the Japanese version, though Kodaka’s voice actor annoys me, and not just because of Kodaka. He sounds so dumb and the whole performance is phoned in. At least everyone else seems to be enjoying what little the script has to offer.EntertainmentIf forcing your way through something is entertaining for you, then go ahead and be my guest. But Haganai NEXT was nothing new or interesting, it was a painful downgrade from the first season. I think the most entertainment I had was watching my friend burst a fucking vein in his forehead at how pissed he was at Kodaka. Though I think I burst one as well.OverallIf you watched Haganai and wanted to see the further adventures of the cute cast, then you’re going to be pissed with what is presented here. It’s a downgrade in every department, has no redeeming qualities aside from an occasional laugh, and fails on every front to provide you with a satisfactory romance, nor a satisfactory slice-of-life experience.

Later on there’s a minor plot about making a film for the cultural festival (a la Haruhi Suzumiya) but that only leads to an anticlimax and then segues to the worst ending I can possibly imagine a harem having.I’ve bitched about bad harem main characters before.

However this season steers away their role within the school and just focuses on the character development and relationships of the clubs members.The story at first doesn't seem to have much of a plot line, with episodes you can tell if are fillers or not until later on or they throw in a big scene where even the thickest people cant miss that it's a major story line flag. Regardless of that fact, it can still leave you wonder what the anime is really even about with...how much it doesn't stick to a liner plot line. While this is by all means not a bad thing, it can cause some to dislike it because of this factor.Art is nothing new. Those fresh to this anime may find its art style displeasing to the eye and somewhat off putting at first but these are quickly disregard if they continue on as its very easy to get used to. With the standard cell shading for main part of the art and animation while using gradients to some objects to add some eye catching effects. Then when setting a scene or environment mood is where this anime shines. Using lighting to its utmost fullest to give major impact scenes, the right feel and flow with the rest of the anime. At the same time when the environment lighting used to make an engulfing scene it's an obvious billboard in the viewers face saying its a key story line point.A minimal use of music and sounds  some may consider a downfall, however this anime seems to take that fact and make a statement that you don't need music every scene to make a good plot line. The only times it does use music in the scene is, much like the lighting an obvious key point in the story. This being said it wouldn't hurt anything if the anime did have more music in some scenes as there are points where you welcome the opening and endings simply because of their music which is actually well made. The producer of the intro seemed to go a little trigger happy with the sound effects though.The one single, biggest and most amazing part of this anime is the character development. The first season was mostly character development and the second season is that ten fold. A few filler pieces near and far apart but almost every little thing adds up and is recalled upon in the end with how a few of the characters react in some situations that's causes the current scenes predicament, what ever it may be. Ever characters gets their fair share in progressing their relationships. Some in was you see a mile away, others take a turn that cause you pause the current episode and have to take a few minute to just realize that just happened.One cannot help but love the anime. Its points of humor almost always pull a laugh, some even for a few minutes. It has a way of either making a really good joke and then killing it with blatant insults or a deep emotional scene and then kills it with a ridiculous out of place joke. Even with these points, it still seems to redeem itself in the end with a few pieces towards the end that no one cannot be unhappy with. how much it doesn't stick to a liner plot line.

The original material was funny and lighthearted. I enjoyed it very much.However, the second season felt like it was dragged through a bucket of ""dark story writing."" All of a sudden, the lighthearted atmosphere disappeared and the story got way to serious way to fast.As a result, I really struggled to enjoy this second season as much as the first. It was a good attempt, but the ridiculous ending battle just lost all my interest. Why can\'t they all talk through their problems like they did...in the first season.

The comedy from last season is still in full force, but the tone of the series starts to become more serious as Kodaka has to deal with his friendships - having to decide if they should remain the way they are, or progress into something further. Kodaka's actions as a protagonist might be seen as cowardly, but the decisions he has to make are certainly realistic. Whilst the first season of Haganai did not have much to tell in terms of story progression, NEXT is adamant about shaking things up. Secrets will be revealed and...bombshells will be dropped as Kodaka struggles with his inevitable choices.This season's biggest fault is that it does not have a conclusive ending. At all. If you want to know what happens next you'll have to find a translated version of the light novels as not even the manga adaptation has surpassed the anime (yet). If you think the season ends with a girl being chosen, you'd be wrong. The ending unfortunately makes it feel as though the progression of the characters was all for naught, despite a very intense confrontation.If you enjoyed the first season and are looking for more, Haganai NEXT hits all bases. If you enjoyed the first season but wanted some more substance, there is plenty of that too. Fanservice is still present unfortunately but after the first season you should hopefully be used to it, even if it does still get in the way of the story. bombshells will be dropped as Kodaka struggles with his inevitable choices.This season's biggest fault is that it does not have a conclusive ending.

There is very little character development. Nothing really occurs that changes these characters until the last couple episodes. The characters are so frustrating that it took everything I had to keep from throwing my iPad.I have not read the light novel, but if this season is even a little bit faithful to the LN, then the writer has some serious problems. From what I gather, the first two seasons cover eight volumes of the book. EIGHT volumes, and the only real character development takes place at the end of season one and the end of...season two. 25 episodes is too many for your characters to barely change and grow.Another problem, in my opinion, is that this show is a harem, yet its pretty clear which girl the creators favor (Sena). It would have had a lot more heart if Kodaka had connected with all of the characters, especially Yozora. The show should be about their relationship, whether or not it becomes romantic or stays platonic.Another issue is that the finale really feels like just another episode. I understand that they just adapted what was in the books, but to end it the way they did, which no indication of a future season or at least an OVA to tie things up, is disappointing, and a problem I think a lot of Anime has lately.The one good thing I can say is that there doesn't seem to be any unnecessary nudity, especially when it comes to the younger characters like Kobato and Maria.

There may not be a lot of plot or character development, and it may feel like a rehash of the first season a lot of the time, but there are still some good laughs. Otherwise, wait until they (hopefully) announce a third season or OVA that brings the series to a satisfying conclusion.

The music they play is very funny and enjoyable to watch. I actually liked all the characters because they are very amusing and even though they have few friends, they still managed to understand one another and trust one another.The art and animation was very fantastic, not dull or boring but bright and lively. Some more, they also play some video games which I have never seen before. By the way, I used to play computer games but I got bored by it.I really wished I could rewatch this show in episode...2 where the nun meets Kodaka (my favorite character).

All the character backgrounds are thoroughly discussed in the first season so the second season is all about exploiting the intriguing character personalities through various situations. From slumber parties to the Kings game, expect some funny interactions at a mildly ecchi level. I found it a pretty good season and, though still feeling like an unfinished work, a worthwhile watch for those still interested after the non-existent conclusion of the first season.Animation:There have been some superficial changes with the animation style...since the first season. The overall color scheme is a bit softer/less saturated and drawing lines are thinner. Detail levels are comparable with the first season and overall the series still looks very good and crisp. Characters are all readily identifiable from the first season although Yozora has apparently dyed her hair and Rika ditches her fake eyeglasses and changes her hairstyle daily. A lot of activities take place outside of school and thus there are a lot of outfits/character compared to your typical slice of life school series.There is very little action here except for a small scuffle at the climax. There is also less ecchi/nudity than the first season. The majority of the ecchi is just bouncy and through conversations (as well as a few galge scenes). Overall this is relatively ""clean"" compared to true ecchi-based shows. Though to be hones I am quite thankful that they didn\'t resort to upskirt cameras and accidental gropings.Sound:Everything sounds appropriately in sync with the original show. I don\'t particularly like the new OP. The ED is a bit better with a lighter rock and more tangible melody. As with the first season, the BGM is light and fitting.The VAs all return from the original season and give likewise great performances. Kanae Itou, Kana Hanazawa, and Marina Inoue all do outstanding in their respective rolls, especially kanahana who usually voices softer roles.Story:This section is going to be fairly subjective for once. If a viewer is looking for progress from the ending of the original haganai, then one can say that the story is practically non-existent; the story is, for the most part, a sequence of half-episode long comic shorts. If a viewer is looking for small but interesting additional character facts and potentially a bit of tension, then the story isn\'t all that bad at all. I fit a bit more into the latter category as (given the ending of haganai 1) I wasn\'t expecting any significant progress.What makes this second season enjoyable is the execution of the short segments. One of my favorites would definitely be the theme park scene where everyone taunts the roller coaster in character before being thrown around in absolute terror. The episodes don\'t really build on each other much until the second half of the show beginning with a preparation for a school fair. This then builds up to an eventual climax where Kodaka is forced to confront the fact that he essentially has established a harem. Though the conclusion is just as unsatisfactory as the first, at least we knew it was coming this time.Character:Though all characters have been established in the first season, each character is either further developed or given additional background. Throughout the show, all characters remain true to their original characterizations; for example Yozora is still a tomboyish, sadistic schemer and Sena is still the two-faced galge-loving, aloof bijin. Many of the character interactions are very entertaining and the eventual development between Kodaka and the girls is royally overdue.If there\'s any negative, lingering aftertaste with the show, it\'s definitely with Kodaka and his unusual and (imo) tasteless means of avoiding the situation that he essentially created.Value:If anything, I think Haganai Next takes the best of the original series and amplified the quantity. Though an actual story would be nice, the execution of the existing pieces worked well. An entertaining watch for those who liked the characters in the first season. since the first season.

Throughout the show, all characters remain true to their original characterizations; for example Yozora is still a tomboyish, sadistic schemer and Sena is still the two-faced galge-loving, aloof bijin. Many of the character interactions are very entertaining and the eventual development between Kodaka and the girls is royally overdue.If there\'s any negative, lingering aftertaste with the show, it\'s definitely with Kodaka and his unusual and (imo) tasteless means of avoiding the situation that he essentially created.Value:If anything, I think Haganai Next takes the best of the original series and amplified the quantity. Though an actual story would be nice, the execution of the existing pieces worked well. An entertaining watch for those who liked the characters in the first season.', 'I just can\'t get why people give 10/10s to this anime. I hate it with a passion, for the last 2 episodes ruining the entire flow and just making me mad again (boy I am on a streak with anime that has a shitty ending). Here are my reasons why :Story 7/10 : If you are reading this review there is probably no point in giving a summary of the story since there is a season 1. The story is good, funny and enjoyable, having little to no bad moments. Now for why I hate the guts out of this anime :[SPOILERS, YOU HAVE...BEEN WARNED] The last episodes ends by Yozora running away, Kodaka ""confessing"" to Sena, right after a shitty pep talk from Rika. I put ""confessing"" because it is interrupted by a phone message, which was complete bullshit and would have been better just straight out confessing. Why is this ending or the last 2 episodes bad? Cause we got a funny Comedy Ecchi anime that turns into failed emotional shit in 2 episodes. This anime would have been perfect if It would have been RomCom all along. SO yes, my reason for giving this anime a bad rating is because of the ending, which was complete crap.Art 8/10 : Nothing special here. Good art, nothing outstanding.Sound 8/10 : Again, nothing special here. The opening is.. meh. Voice acting is on point .Character 7/10 : This is where the anime lacks for me. Kodaka is one of those ""badass"" MCs, he is basically Ryuuji from Toradora, he has nothing special, and is not relatable. Sena is one of the best characters in the anime, we know what she is supposed to be, and has the same personality all along. Yozora is bad to being hate-able. I never understood if she is supposed to be a Kuudere or a Tomboy with feelings. Rika is one of the weirdest characters again. She gets a giant personality change in the end of the anime where the author decides ""Hey let\'s make this anime a RomCom"". I could go on, but it\'s really the same thing for everyone. The only other good character is Kobato, being adorable as hell and a clear ""little sister"" type. The characters are not bad on Toradora level, but still pretty bad.Enjoyment 5/10 : Because of last 2 episodes.... This mark would have been 9/10 if not for that.Overall 6/10 : I would not recommend this to anyone. I hated myself for watching is because of the ending. Then again, it is my opinion. There be people giving 10/10 to this. BEEN WARNED] The last episodes ends by Yozora running away, Kodaka ""confessing"" to Sena, right after a shitty pep talk from Rika.

The reason for this is the ending I both loved and hated.Cliffhangers are very common in American television shows and they work verywell because of the fact that in  few short months there will be another season and we will get to see what happens.  They keep us emotionally interested.  However this does not work very well for anime's due to the fact that there are HUGE time gaps between seasons.When...I saw episode 11 of this anime I knew it in my heart but I didn't want to accept that there was going to be a cliffhanger to close out the season.  I love where the story was going because we have far too many romantic comedy harem anime's that close with an open ending so you as the fan can choose what happens next.  I love anime's that have the closure where they choose for you because sometimes (at least most of the time) the guy ends up with your 'best girl' and you get to see the happy ending that you envision in the harem comedies that leave it open ended.It is hard not to spoil when the frustration is fresh in my mind but I think that the anime creators made a mistake with how things ended up with this anime.  I believe this simply because of the fact that the delay due to the release of the novels and the production of a third season is too long of a wait to stay invested in the show emotionally.  Despite the fact that I am looking forward to the next season right now, I will lose interest in a couple of months and the new season wont be coming out for another year at least.In conclusion, the story was getting very good near the end and honestly could've closed right then and there and there wouldn't be any need for a third season.  However the cliffhanger on the least episode was a poor choice due to the delay cause by the novel's production speed.

In the first season of this show, there wasn't much to like aside from Sena (in my humble opinion). Not only the male lead, but the girls were pretty generic and stereotypical, and the show relied a lot on fanservice. For some reason, I chose to watch this season. I was surprised to see some heavy moments and actual character development, with funny self-aware jokes and wonderful voice acting (kudos to the English dub cast). The story, sound track, and art were pretty weak, but it was an okay show. Even...though I only give it an overall score of 7, I figured it deserved a review for keeping me watching to the very end when I thought it would let me down. though I only give it an overall score of 7, I figured it deserved a review for keeping me watching to the very end when I thought it would let me down."", ""This show is a really nice anime to watch when you want something light and relatively cheerful. The characters are built out well, and they each have different personalities. The conflict between Sena and Yozora is well done, and you can clearly see their personality contrasts. In addition to this, it's nice to see how the group bonds over time - despite them not realising it, they are in fact becoming friends and achieving the groups goals.There are also good parts of humor, especially in the special at the end of season 1, and scattered throughout the anime. Whilst some of it did fall flat,...there was enough of it to give me a chuckle every now and then.I love the soundtracks of this anime, especially the end one.

I rated 7 for the first season of this series, which i do rly find enjoyable to watch , a SoL harem(kinda) comedy with no real plotThen the season 2 everything just went downfall to me . The early episode is ok , the anime actually has a plot now. But the character development somehow didnt make sense to me . Starting from kodaka , season 1 hes ok , a usual protagonist which i thought handle everything in a way that make sense, but season 2 just wanna make me wanna...punch him in the face (the way he handle things by being a fking deaf person)Then the conflict between sena and yozora , yozora end up screwing up thing by saying smth she doesnt suppose to say , end up hurting sena. But then again , what happen next? NOTHING . Kobato show up , Sena went as her usual self like nothing has happened. Conflict is made to be solved , if u just end up not solving it at all and ignore it maybe the conflict should have NEVER been there which this show i feel screwed up the most.The ending is also really bad , not a thing you could actually said finished, except mb the relationship between rika and kodaka which i think is kinda meh. They literally left us hanging with  kodaka and sena relationship, nothing is really shown about how kodaka and yozora relationship turned out.Overall i still actually like the 2nd season a lot , but i kinda leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I would love  a sequel explaining the things above mb a movie or ova or smth punch him in the face (the way he handle things by being a fking deaf person)Then the conflict between sena and yozora , yozora end up screwing up thing by saying smth she doesnt suppose to say , end up hurting sena.

I firmly believe anything two consenting adults do together is 100% acceptable under any circumstances, but a teenage boy and his barely-pubescent sister is just fuckin\' weird, man. And it\'s in a *lot* of anime.Anyway, this show is great. It\'s one...of the few ""comedies that dive into drama"" I\'ve been able to tolerate. Why? Because all the characters except one are just so good. They\'re cliche, for sure, but they\'re all designed well from animation to voice acting. Personalities are strong, and the conflicts between them feel natural and in no way forced. Rich straight-A bimbo with no friends who secretly plays porn games? Sure, why not. The genius inventor who has an exhausting fetish for gay robot manga? I\'ll buy it. The probably-mentally-ill sister who cosplays as an anime character 24/7 and wants to bang her older brother? Well, maybe not so much, but besides the incest thing she\'s actually kind of likeable. Even the emo roodgrill is very charming. The harem-that-isn\'t-really-a-harem is the complete package.Hmm, who does that leave? Oh yeah, the harem owner. (Is that the correct terminology? Harem king? Harem general? Harem president?) I watch dubbed anime because god would curse me to an eternity of hellfire if I kowtowed to filthy infidel languages, so I\'ve definitely encountered bad dubbing before. What really stands out here is that every single character is voiced to perfection *except* the harem guild master. His voice makes me want to scoop out my ear bones with a dead squirrel; his voice makes me want to deafen myself my blasting Tool through a tuba; his voice makes me want to stab my eardrums with a blender. It\'s so unbearable I almost committed a sin by switching over to the original version. I can\'t stress enough how fingernails-on-chalkboard his voice is. Even worse, though, is how undeveloped and soulless he is even besides that. For example, at one point he confronts a group of bullies and appears to demonstrate some combat prowess, but this is never mentioned again inside the story. How did he do it? Did his dad teach him? Did he train with someone? Why did that just happen? Is he secretly a libido ninja? What the hell?But I can tolerate him because the supporting cast of harem participants (harem club members? harem nymphos? harem princesses?) is just so well done. It should also be noted that this isn\'t *really* a harem series because there\'s barely any ""plot"" to be seen, and overall the narrative is about friendship rather than romance/sex. The sole undeniable, objective negative about this series is that it just ends. The final episode clearly sets up a third season that never happened for whatever reason. In a way that\'s fine because it avoids concluding on a downer, but honestly it just leaves 100% of the plot strings unfinished. What a bummer.I still highly recommend watching this. Even if you\'re as drama-phobic as me, the moments here are heartfelt and the comedy is done tastefully. of the few ""comedies that dive into drama"" I\'ve been able to tolerate. Why? Because all the characters except one are just so good. They\'re cliche, for sure, but they\'re all designed well from animation to voice acting. Personalities are strong, and the conflicts between them feel natural and in no way forced. Rich straight-A bimbo with no friends who secretly plays porn games? Sure, why not. The genius inventor who has an exhausting fetish for gay robot manga? I\'ll buy it. The probably-mentally-ill sister who cosplays as an anime character 24/7 and wants to bang her older brother? Well, maybe not so much, but besides the incest thing she\'s actually kind of likeable. Even the emo roodgrill is very charming. The harem-that-isn\'t-really-a-harem is the complete package.Hmm, who does that leave? Oh yeah, the harem owner. (Is that the correct terminology? Harem king? Harem general? Harem president?) I watch dubbed anime because god would curse me to an eternity of hellfire if I kowtowed to filthy infidel languages, so I\'ve definitely encountered bad dubbing before.

The story and the characters' background gets deeper than in the first season, diving into their insecurities. It's slightly darker, ut still contains the comedy elements that made the first season fun. My only real problem with the story was how this season left off, as it created a lot of questions and problems, especially seeing how there might never come a season 3, but overall it might be even more...enjoyable than in the first season.Art/Sound: The art and sound is the same good stuff we got in season 1, but I'd argue that the intro is far better than the previous, as it is less messy and more concise.Overall: I love this show, but I would've wanted more, and less of a cliff hanger ending.

expand the story, luckily this is one of those sequels that was well worth it.The story continues with the Neighbours Club endless crusade to make friends and after the incident from the end of last series things have quickly gone back to normal, but more developments are in store for our dysfunctional club members.Now the story pretty much expands upon the first season as the club members continue to do activities that will hopefully make them acquire friends in the future and it obviously leads...to more disputes and funny outcomes of those disputes, but the tone of this series is a little bit more serious especially when we get closer to the end this series because now the club members have gotten acquainted with each other and know more about each other which this series shows how much the bond between them has grown, that being said it concentrates more on the relations between Kodaka and the girls as they have gotten to the point where they have some form of attraction for him especially Sena and Yozora.The characters definitely get more development in this series as their relationship has grown so have their feelings for each other.Kodaka continues to be the blandish guy, but you see the reason for why he acts the way he is around the girls and why he continuously knocks down their advances on him because all he wants right now is friendship.Yozora and Sena continue to be at each other's throats with the pranks and arguments they pull on each other, the first season mainly picked on Sena during the argument, but in this season the tables have turned and whenever Yozora tries to do something to get closer to Kodaka it always blows back into her face which gave the chance for Sena to make her move, you also see that these two have gotten more used to each other as their relations with the other girls improves too.The other girls of the group get their own chances too, Kobato and Maria also improve their own relationship while Yukimura continues her journey of being manly.Rika actually has a bigger role this season as her technical skills help to create a movie the club was working on and you really see her true self during the final episodes when Kodaka wa avoiding the club for a certain amount of time.There is even new characters introduced like Kate who is Maria's older sister, she is more of a tomboy and acts pretty vulgar around Kodaka although despite acting like this she does care for her younger sister even though she won't admit it.Aoi Yusa is mainly a supporting character and isn't shown a lot, but she is Sena's rival when it comes to the test scores and hates how smart she is even to the point where she tries to shut the club down which luckily Sena steps in and stops it.The artstyle is actually a little different compared to the last season and the differences are apparent from some small details like Kodaka's hair has actually changed a little and everything looks smoother too, we also get to see the girls in more different outfits that continue to make them look good too.The fanservice in this series is also cut down a little bit compared to the last season which is a little disappointing since there are new longer any cheeky nip slips or exposed breasts and it instead goes for the option of using hair or objects to cover up the girls, but it doesn't impact the show a lot to be honest.The comedy was just as good this season as it was the last one hell I think the pranks on Sena went to new levels as the first episode literally started with Sena having a monstrous hairstyle just because the others said it would improve her character and the fact they were the ones who made her hair look like that in the first place.The Romance increased more in this series since the relations between the girls and Kodaka has obviously grown it mainly focuses on Sena and Yozora particularly Sena since it is revealed that she is an even earlier childhood friend of Kodaka's than Yozora was and because of this we see the development in their characters on how much Kodaka has impacted their lives and how much they care for him.Overall this was a fun second series and maybe there''ll be a third season to close it off hopefully considering the ending for this season, but from what I've heard in the light novels I think it's best to leave it as it is or maybe a Movie to close the story. to more disputes

be remarkably disappointing compared to the first. Often apparently milking the success of the original story's last sour dribbles of entertainment (and monetary) value than anything intentionally planned in to offer necessary closure(s). The trouble with continuing a series of the slice of life variety is often all the most fun and dramatic scenes, such as the introduction of new characters and the development of their interactions and relationships have already been covered sufficiently and what is left is essentially just...a continuation of what was generally occurring, rarely with any notable improvement in story telling and frequently stagnant of anything dynamic. So a mark of an engaging story overall, I find, is if the interest can be maintained through suitably decent writing in the latter stages of any given narrative.Fortunately Haganai is able maintain said level of interest by having a decent array of characters, enough in quantity that some are kept back until the second season, but also that these initial characters continue to develop in some way as the story progresses; instead of becoming mere devices for slap stick jokes as often is the case. With the ironic exception of the male lead protagonist who begins to show the most abrasive traits of a typical harem lead (dense). Thankfully, rather than acting coy, the other characters act up in various attempts to force his hand rather than let some ambiguous harem continue unresolved.Still, the series ends on a rather sour cliff hanger to be addressed in a third (confirmed) series. At the very least we can expect some drama to unfold and drive the story forwards rather than allowing it to stagnate; hopefully the narrative can avoid some of the most offensive romcom cliché's. But finally the characters are beginning to get territorial over the groups token male which has its own element of satisfaction for the male viewership.Still, as an adult with mature tastes it would be nice if there was a decent harem out there similar to this where the main male lead actually acted somewhat like a normal person would rather than some impossible to relate to, holier than though libido-less teen. IE Instead of making completely unrealistic outright rejections of forward confessions of lust, to at least experience some confliction beyond turning their face away out of embarrasment. Basically a non-fantasy version of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! But I Digress.This show manages to maintain it's overall quality despite having most of the easiest to produce suspenseful moments out of the way. The Humour remains on point and the characters, male lead aside, become even more endearing/enjoyable to watch. a continuation of what was generally occurring, rarely with any notable improvement in story telling and frequently stagnant of anything dynamic.

Yozora is one of the female leads and she is well she acts really tough but she also is a pretty good person again though she really can get at a lot of the member's but a good character. Sena is the other female lead and well she really thinks all high and mighty of herself but she kinda is a airhead sometimes but she is a pretty sweet person. Kobato is the sister to Kodaka and well she really likes really bother and also has a persona that she does otherwise pretty odd but good character. Yukimura so it turns out he is well actually a she otherwise again another sweet person overall. Rika is scientist and well she is a really perverted person and really out there with the perv stuff like that but she can be really cool and stuff but a perv at best. Maria is the priest of this anime and well after awhile she gets the affection towards Kodaka like the other girls but she is a complete airhead to a lot of stuff also the fact she falls for stuff so easily otherwise a nice character. (just copying and pasting form my review from the 1st season sense they dont really change well expect for the fact the Yukimaura is a actual girl).Enjoyment: Things that i liked: i personally LOVED this 2nd season everything about i liked. it had a comedy that was really good maybe even a bit better than the 1st season, the fact that this anime had its moments of real drama in this (personally wont spoil but it will really happen with yozora and sena and the whole club), and also the characters are really good in this season maybe even better in some way. Things that i didn't like: honestly id say the ending the ending left up so much that a third season could happen by just how it ended but still a good anime.Overall: im giving this a 9 for sure like the comedy was good maybe even better than the 1st season the character do develop more has it goes and the drama in this is a nice touch also not alot of ecchi but yeah the second was everything better than the 1st for sure the comedy was better the characters got better and the good moments of drama were good to easily a anime worth the watch as a whole and a damn good one at that. it honestly otherwise i watched the dub but it was really good.Character:  Kodaka is the main male lead of the anime and well hes a pretty good and chill male lead just trying to make friends again a pretty cool and just overall chill guy.

It went into depth with the characters and their reasoning. This season was much deeper and complex than the first one. Rika really shined in this season as well. However, I was sad to see Yozora get pushed away a bit from Kodaka, as I want him to be with her. But that's just personal preference. A next season of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is most definitely needed for closure. But it may be a year or two until the LN has enough material... "", ""Well, here we go, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next. At the end of this one we'll find out more about the interests of our protagonists, I'm looking forward to it! Or that's what I originally thought when I started watching this anime.Coming from season one, I didn't expect anything revolutionary, but I hoped for a bit more development. Development which never came. The show pretends to move forward, which never really happens until the last episode, where they suddenly jump forward two miles in plot, and therefore make it feel extremely rushed.There is basically no character development, and therefore you wouldn't expect any choice...to happen, which saddened me, all the whilst knowing it was a harem, so I shouldn't expect anything in terms of plot movement at all, really. But then suddenly they make a conclusion based on nothing, because nothing really happened, and you're left with the feeling as if you missed something.Maybe I did, maybe it's not rushed and I haven't been paying enough attention, but when I said that I wasn't expecting anything special, I didn't mean for something like the last episode to happen. Oh well, it's still fairly enjoyable, but I can't take this one seriously anymore, not that I should've, maybe that was my mistake. to happen, which saddened me, all the whilst knowing it was a harem, so I shouldn't expect anything in terms of plot movement at all, really.

Kodaka is in a situation where every girl in the club likes him and if he were to choose a girl to date then the club would fall apart, he is also not interesting in dating any of the girls at all. Basically it's your average harem....The girls obviously like him, whenever they say something that shows they like him he doesn't hear it and the never ending cycle of this continues forever. This really makes me dislike this anime because it's just the same thing over and over and over again. Although, I have to admit it is not a bad anime. The art is good, the sound is good, the story is good, I just really hate the MC.tl;dr This is like Nisekoi.

It was a completely different experience from watching the prequel.The story: It was a continuation from the prequel in which they are still in The Neighbor's Club trying to achieve the common goal of becoming popular and making friends. However, the story for this sequel had more depth to it. Overall, I felt that it had a completely different feel to it. As expected from the prequel, I...laughed so hard from their crazy antics, the way they expressed themselves, and overall the way they carried on with the plot along the show. What I believed to be great about this was that however unrealistic the scenarios might have been, the feelings portrayed were completely relatable.With this series, it left me wanting more, that's for sure. Which is a different reaction from the first series because I only wanted more because I knew that there was a second season.Overall I can say I really liked how the story progressed here.Art: I think it was pretty good, I liked the way they were drawn and it was very appealing to the eye.Sound: I love the voices and the sound effects and everything else, it was great.Character: I absolutely love all the characters in this series. I only have an issue with Yozora sometimes because of her stubborn manner and the way she bullies Sena, but overall she makes me laugh so much so I really appreciate her character in this series and that goes for the other characters as well.I very much enjoyed this anime and that's why I gave it a 10, it think it truly deserved it, and it was such a nice continuation of the first installment of the series.

Their desperate attempts in making friends or exercising this objective makes it so funny to watch.The protagonist is also mature and composed yet understands the complexity of the circumstances to which he encounter...- although he is somewhat obstinate and dense at times, the story hints that he's well aware of his actions and leads the story to its unique passages.The story is also unpredictable thus adding to the sudden surprises which makes it either fun or unsatisfying. This fluidity of the series is because of the existence of the other characters, having different personalities and attainments, who are actually warm-hearted figures who just want to have friends. They greatly affect the story like different ingredients combined to make a fun watch.Contrast to this opinions regarding its complexity, this factor also makes it somewhat unsatisfying. The problems that appears in the story are sometimes resolved in a manner that isn't so significant (at times it even feels as if it is still unresolved). There are also times when sudden build ups become disrupted and leaves it as it is, making it a story with a great quantity of rising action yet I doubt the quantity of the climaxes are equivalent.In conclusion, the story is very funny and entertaining; unique and unpredictable. Each of the characters are essential and of different personalities. Although, I cannot guarantee it is always so satisfying, this unsatisfactory sometimes makes us want to crave for what's up next to this exciting story. - although he is somewhat obstinate and dense at times, the story hints that he's well aware of his actions and leads the story to its unique passages.The story is also unpredictable thus adding to the sudden surprises which makes it either fun or unsatisfying.

It's the sequel, So why are you disappointed?  Dude, It has been 8 years so why do we still not have a season 3 nor a final series? Man I'll just review this thing and move on.The show continues where we left off in season one (well of course because it's the sequel). There's not much to plot twists or anything of the sorts it's just a natural flow of continual events. This season while the first one of course focused on introduction, this one now focuses on building up and getting ready for the final events. Which is a visualization...and example of nice pacing.Now it points out a lot of clichés. It does in the form of avoiding it obviously and sarcastically speaking of it. Yet it doesn't break the 4th wall very often, since breaking the fourth wall is a cliché known in pointing out clichés.There's not much overall changes in the show but you'll definitely feel a lot more emotion on this sequel especially considering it's the sequel. It focuses a lot on development and buildup now or development in particular. Since every member of the club will now face lots of circumstances that may be unusually much more lukewarm rather than the jolly and hilarious first season.The main talk of this review goes to the show's main character Hasegawa Kodaka. In this sequel his character definitely now has a different shade of light or should I say it is the same light though we haven't realized that yet. If you don't know what I mean then watch the show, if you don't realize still then go for episode 10. It does definitely feel like a dating game now but as a guy who likes to complete his game as fast as possible he goes for everybodies routes at the same time. The main feature of this entire show is definitely his development as a character. Showing us a perfectly normal guy who has a lot of potential to become someone who's sociable but decides to attend a club full of loners, there's something wrong is there?.Well I should say that this was a very good sequel, I almost cannot point out anything I can say that's particularly bad in this one. All of the things above I've talked about are all about how it's good though.If this is the end of the story though then it's a filthy cliffhanger don't you think? Oh you haven't watched it yet so you don't know what to think? Go ahead proceed watching it then!.8/10 and example of nice pacing.Now it points out a lot of clichés.

As the series progresses, we get more and more of the same issues with a few new ones, while adding in some cool or nice changes. However, by the end of the series, the writing feels baseless and schizophrenic at best, with the majority of anything substantial coming completely out of left field as what feels like a spontaneous plot point, with no prior establishment or backing. This was a problem in season 1,...but they\'ve only made it worse with season 2 as they\'ve tried evolving the story and have added in more of such content to facilitate that. ""Oh, we suddenly have a history together and are engaged thanks to our parents!"" ""Oh, I suddenly met and became friends with the head of student council!"" ""Oh, now one of the main leads is overly-sensitive and caring about the social position of certain members in the club!"" These kinds of spontaneous events are all that make up the story for this series, and unfortunately, a lot of said events are completely nonsensical or illogical on a basic level. There\'s no real foundation.As far as the technical details, it\'s yet again pretty good. Animation, models, effects, dialogue and voice acting; all pretty solid and hilarious.Now, the ending. I really want to vent here, but this has to be one of the most ass-backwards logical plotlines that I\'ve ever seen. The main character ends up having his main plot confrontation with one of the most unexpected characters in the series, and it goes from some kind of ecchi or slice of life to full-on action anime on par with something like Parasyte, complete with the main character somehow surviving when he shouldn\'t have. It ends with yet another massive deflation between the two, downgrading to just friends, yet one of the main characters sees this and ends up leaving, and we end the series with the happy little theme song playing as she gets left out in the cold and leaves via what looks like a port, telling everyone to not come looking for her.As I said in the beginning, this series had so much potential, but they fundamentally dropped the ball so hard that it\'s no wonder we only got two seasons. Great dialogue, great VAs, and some pretty good moments, but the writers seem to have missed one critical part about writing a series: it has to actually be a SERIES, with a backbone and some kind of foundation. Instead, it was treated like just another episodic daytime TV drama until way too late in the series, where they tried to wrap up the story with nothing backing it at all. So we end with some very oddball dialogue, relationship dynamics, and a pointless confrontation with one character being completely abandoned. It\'s truly sad, but at least more generic content like Infinite Stratos has a foundation, plot, and plot progression. Disappointed to say the least. but they\'ve only made it worse with season 2 as they\'ve tried evolving the story and have added in more of such content to facilitate that.

I enjoyed the first season of this anime.Rushed Season.I felt like there was so much more in this anime and the scripters did not produce it. This makes me sad. I would mind another season but im scared that it will make it even worse. Also some characters were added in in a rush like that red haired guy i dont even know the name. Also these thing probably could be applied to the first season of this anime.Gender shit.Made it a little confusing and uncomfortable which i am not a big fan of. Is this person and boy or...a girl is not a question I would like to ask my self. No hate to anyone liking this, just not for me.(spoilers) sorry xd.But....  the anime lost here. I wanted at least one kissing seen or something with Sena and Kodaka. Ik there was other stuff but it didnt cut it. It seemed like there was so much more to add in the plot.

A welcome change since it focuses more on the actual point of the club and the hardships associated with a group of outcasts together.During this season we have actually got some pretty deep material that really hits hard. It also does a good job of making you want another season or reading the source. Of course, being 2020 and a new season didn't come it is about reading on. The ending...has a sort of cliff hanger that set up perfectly.The art of the show is of a very good standard and personally I liked it quite a lot. I did love the changes with Rika during a fair few episodes.The OP again is brilliant and the ED is great too.Characters:Well firstly, for me, Rika Shiguma is an amazing character. She embodies much of the representation of someone of great intellect being an outcast but desiring friendship to the point of ruin and I found her relatable. She is also a gorgeous character with a great personality. Also, her maid outfit and Neko ears were amazing.Yozora Mikazuki is a really good character. She is unable still to express herself properly but again that is why she fits so well in the series. I do think many of the issues she faced on a personal level could have been solved if the main character had resolved them himself but then his personality is broken too.Sena Kashiwazaki is someone I really think is great. Shows the dark side of popularity really well throughout. She is not as good as the others in every respect but she is great.When it comes to our Nun sisters again they have a great dynamic. I really like the way Kate continues to be shown. Maria is pretty funny too and her voice is just amazing.Kobato a desirable little sister type that is pretty great throughout.Yukimura Kusunoki still a character of confusion to how she didn't realise the truths of herself. Also how bad her parents must be like someone call CPS. Also, the maid outfit is great.Kodaka Hasegawa. He is an interesting character throughout. His personal issues which all of them have are the main reason that they all suffer at the hands of each other. He is a great character but also not. His idiocy is just astounding at times.The gem for the show was Aoi Yusa who was a great addition. Her opinion of Kodaka would have made them coming into contact a long time ago much better. Seeing Hinata who plays a more crucial role for later in the show was great too.The show itself, therefore, is very enjoyable. The ending is spectacular with Rika. The other bit of it was slight confusion but was really strongly trying to push another season forward or getting in the heads of views to continue reading. It worked I can tell you that much.If it wasn't the confusing cliffhanger it would have a 10 from me. It is a hard one to downgrade because I am sure no one knew it wouldn't get renewed again.

GOD DAMN THIS SHOW HAS A LONG TITLE. This show also goes by haganai and has the english title ""I don\'t have many friends"". Okay I\'m sorry but TITLES ARE SUPPOSE TO BE CATCHY!!! I don\'t get why animes have such a fetish FOR TITLES LONGER THAN MY COLLEGE ADMISSION ESSAY!  watashi ga motenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga waruiFUCK IT I DON\'T SPEAK WEEABOO! SO recently I learned why light novels have long ass titles....It\'s is because PEOPLE BE TOO DAMN LAZY TO READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE SUMMARY! To counter that, authors make the title the synopsis. CLEVER MARKETING STRATEGY!!! So what exactly does the title ""I don\'t have many friends"" even mean?Basically, this show follows around some dopey blonde ""delinquet"" kid. Who goes to this club called the neihbors club. A club for people with no friends.... FINALLY A CLUB MEANT FOR M- ANYWAYS. Thing is, this premise REALLY BOTHERS ME. YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE CLUB HANG OUT AND BOND OVER HENTAI GAMES AND SHIT! Listen, you KNOW you\'re friends with someone if you play porn games together! But in all seriousness, these guys CONSTANTLY hang out with each other. Even on the WEEKENDS!  But ALL of them talk about how they don\'t have any friends. Uh WHAT!? ALSO, Remember this is a harem show. So, they are more than just friends, if you get what I\'m laying down. cuz\' ya know,  all the girls want to hop on this deadheads dick! *horse noises* These characters get pretty close with K-pop wannabe but NOPE. He apparently has no friends.This anime doesn\'t seem to be that well revived as it\'s not even ranked in the top 1000s. So do I like it? YES, ACTUALLY! Despite all the complaints I have for this show, I would say that I not only like it BUT LOVE IT! This show made it on my top 25 favorite anime! Take school rumble a fairly well revived romcom that fans of the genre tend to love. I legitimately love that show DESPITE THE DICK TEASING (nisekoi, I\'m also looking at you!) However with this show. It honestly seems more like a guilty pleasure. Honestly this show was so fucking dumb and retarded at times it was laughable! From the excessive loli fanservice.To the ironically funny main characer whos so generic it\'s laughable. To the weird and somewhat unlikable girls in a freaking harem. And the LAUGHABLY terrible romance. This anime is so stupid it\'s fucking genius! And the weird thing is, At first I almost thought this anime\'s stupidity was intentional. Because the show was so obviously terrible that it was hilarious. However PROTOTWISTU!!!! The show tried to pass off itself as being  fucking retarded. But it turns out it\'s actually a deconstruction anime! The show HIDES the fact that it\'s a deconstruction show. You see the deconstruction element of this anime foreshadowed from the very beginning. I was naive to call this show a guilty pleasure. Because the deconstruction elements TOTALLY SLIPPED PAST ME! The first 22 episodes of this anime play out like a shitty romcom but foreshadow the deconstruction elementsBUT BAM the last 3 episodes where genius! FACKIN\' GENIUS! The last 3 episodes is when this show becomes a deconstruction anime! The show pretty much points out it\'s own stupid flaws and breaks down why the show itself is stupid.To give you the most primary example of this anime being a deconstruction.Take the main character, kotoka. This guy\'s defining personality trait is his lack of one! I\'m not joking this guy is FUCKING BLAND BORING AND STOIC! He just has the typical cliche ""Oblivious nice guy that likes helping people"". AND YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF CHARACTER IN EVERY ROMCOM ANIME! *crying voice* Why can\'t all romcom characters be as cool as harima! He sees yozora be a sadistic bitch, he sees see rika be a HUGE creepy perv, and he sees loli\'s get freaking naked. And this guy NEVER HAS A REACTION! He\'s so apathetic I find it almost amusing, kind of similar to how yu narukami from persona 4 the animation is. However. PROTOTWITERU the main character actually does have a personality! You see this with the last three episodes as you learn he just PRETENDS to be a generic main character. It\'s all just an act! *gilgamesh* faker. But really the reason he acts so apathetic is because he\'s SELF AWARE that he\'s in a harem. He doesn\'t want to show favoritism towards one girl because he doesn\'t want to hurt any of there feelings. YEA HOLY FLIPPIN\' PIZZAS! That\'s pretty interesting! So this guy just PRETENDS to be your generic romcom character when deep down, he actually does have a personality! Inside that lifeless shell of a generic main character THERE IS A PERSONALITY!!!! If that\'s not deconstruction slapping you across the face with a wet noodle I don\'t know what is.This isn\'t the only character that would be considered a ""deconstruction character"". So you think of a harem anime. You expect two things. NUMBER 1 CHICKS WITH HUGE TITIES and also chicks with cute and likable personalities. In contrast yozora, the main girl of this show is FLAT A BOARD! Also she\'s a fucking sadistic cunt and I can\'t see how anyone could call this BITCH a waifu! However that\'s the point. I mean the cast consists of a the most loyal chick ever, two girls with a big brother fetish, a girl who wants to ride your dick, and MEAT! *Insert mooing sound* Honestly even IF yozora was a half decent person she couldn\'t even compare to these other chicks. And that\'s what makes it so interesting! The main girl was childhood friends with the main charachter and CREATED the neighbors club just as an excuse to spend time with him. But as more chicks came into the club, ALL MORE APPEALING THAN HER really makes yozora not even a competitor for ""best girl"". Due to her sadism and pessimistic nature she is in almost every way ""the worst girl"". In most shows having the ""worst girl"" be the MAIN GIRL would suck massive giraffe dick *wisper* and we all know giraffe have big dicks...actually only I know that.ANYWAYS. as interesting as yozouras dilemma is, do I like it. eh!? I mean it\'s interesting and unique but the problem is. The writers did such a good job at making yozora dislikable THAT I FUCKING HATE HER! She\'s a bitch, she\'s a cunt, she\'s a bully, she\'s literally cancer embodied as an anime girl! Thing is, she\'s so dislikable that I can\'t even sympathize with her.In the 25 episodes we\'ve watched we\'ve never seen her show any likable or sympathetic traits. Her character concept is great but the execution was done poorly! At least give her a sympathizing backstory or give her, you know, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! She\'s a bitch from episode 1 to episode 25 and isn\'t willing to change. Like maybe if we saw her have the willingness to change and TRY to be nice I\'d be like, OH, I feel bad and want to route for you to be a better person. So maybe we could see her work her way up to being the ""best girl""BUT NO, SHE\'S A MEENIE WEENIE THE ENTIRE SHOW.Honestly, these aren\'t the only two characters in this anime that are interesting and unique. You got Senna who basically is what created the ""kamidere"" architype. Senna, is in my opinion the best girl, as you see she\'s happy go lucky, pretty chill, like\'s hentai games and also TITIES!!! She also has a whole god complex as in, she\'s arrogant as fuck. But to be honest, when you\'re about as perfect in every way as she is her arrogance might be justified. I mean, Being rich, being the top in her classes, being overly attractive and on top of all that having a likable personality, everything about this girl, screams ""best girl"". And what makes me hate yozora even more is because you constantly see her bully senna throughout the show. All due to her being a jealous ass bitch. And this is the BIGGEST reason as to why I FUCKING HATE yozora! While some of the yozora bulling senna moments where funny. ALL OF THEM MADE ME WANT TO KILL YOZORA! How can I sympathize with someone as cruel as her. I might sympathize with flowey before I sympathize with yozora!Next off, you got rika, not much to say other than SHE REALLY LIKES SEX. I\'m not joking this is the whole joke her character is based off of...AND IT\'S HILARIOUS. Unfortunately she looks kinda creepy but when she takes off those glasses DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYMMMN GURL! Honestly, this show despite being a romcom doesn\'t have good romance. Because I don\'t care for the main character so I don\'t care for his romance. HOWEVER, in the last 3 episodes, Rika was the one that pointed out the fact that kotoka is a faker. Rika has the desire to learn who kotoka REALLY is deep down. Her relationship and romance is by far more interesting than the main two girls. As she really brings out the best in our boring main guy. I easily ship these two. Unfortunate that she\'s not one of the two main girls of this show. So I highly doubt we\'ll see these two end up together.Next off. You got two loli\'s. One of them is the main characters little sister. Ok first off, the legal age in japan is 13 and she\'s 11 SO EVEN BY JAPANS STANDARDS THIS IS CREEPY! Not to mention the whole incest thing. Yea I don\'t need to get into that. Next off you got the nun girl. Take index from a certain magical index and imagine her being a 10 year old and KABAM. you get what is THE WORST GIRL. I might have said yozora was the worst girl, but I\'m not including loli\'s into the mix. Because, I kinda don\'t want to picture kotoka as a incestuous pedofile. Nun girl is an obnoxious spoiled little brat! It\'s creepy to think that this KID is a part of the harem. What\'s even more creeps is that there is FANSERVICE OF THESE CHARACTERS! WHY! THEY AREN\'T EVEN IN HIGHSCHOOL YET! AND ONE OF THEM ISN\'T EVEN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!!Then you got some trans guy. He\'s biologically a female but in spite of that want\'s to be a SUPER MANLY MAN! The whole trans thing is played off for laughs and created alot of amzing cringe humor. We don\'t even learn he has a fucking VAGINA till season 2!When the main character found out he biologically wasn\'t a dude. I died of laughter man. Also, does anyone else think he looks alot like mikoto misaka?Honestly, overall I would say that the BIGGEST strength of this show is it\'s character interactions. All the characters have a  unique personality. Seeing these characters interact with one another was hilarous. I found alot of yozora\'s sadism to be funny. (but also painful to watch at times), Then you got all the weird trans jokes that came with the dude who looks like misaka, and with rika you got a bunch of weird gundam sex innuendos. The comedy in this show due to the amazing chemistry the cast has is great as all of them play off each other very well.A Lot of people say that this show needs a season 3. AND I AGREE. The last 3 episodes where SO interesting as we learned that this show was secretly a deconstruction anime! The show forshaddows the fact that it\'s a deconstruction really well. But now we finally get to see the show\'s deconstruction in FULL FORCE.So yea everyone should contact AIC BUILD STUDIO TO MAKE A SEASON 3! Also, what is it with animes never getting a season 3. You got a certain magical index, Baka and test, school rumble, a certain scientific railgun, HARUHI! Seriously, WHY CAN\'T WE GET SEASON 3\'S!!!Overall despite this anime being both REALLY FUCKING STUPID and oddly intellectual at the end. I give this show a 7/10. To anyone who is a fan of the romcom genre I would HIGHLY recommend this show as it might be a different watch. As it deconstructs popular trends in the very cliched romantic comedy genre. This has been your host mightypie, Subscribe for more SEXY reviews. And as always, good night good bye and big balls. It\'s is because PEOPLE BE TOO DAMN LAZY TO READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE SUMMARY! To counter that, authors make the title the synopsis. CLEVER MARKETING STRATEGY!!! So what exactly does the title ""I don\'t have many friends"" even mean?Basically, this show follows around some dopey blonde ""delinquet"" kid. Who goes to this club called the neihbors club. A club for people with no friends.... FINALLY A CLUB MEANT FOR M- ANYWAYS. Thing is, this premise REALLY BOTHERS ME. YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE CLUB HANG OUT AND BOND OVER HENTAI GAMES AND SHIT! Listen, you KNOW you\'re friends with someone if you play porn games together! But in all seriousness, these guys CONSTANTLY hang out with each other. Even on the WEEKENDS!  But ALL of them talk about how they don\'t have any friends. Uh WHAT!? ALSO, Remember this is a harem show. So, they are more than just friends, if you get what I\'m laying down. cuz\' ya know,  all the girls want to hop on this deadheads dick! *horse noises* These characters get pretty close with K-pop wannabe but NOPE. He apparently has no friends.This anime doesn\'t seem to be that well revived as it\'s not even ranked in the top 1000s. So do I like it? YES, ACTUALLY! Despite all the complaints I have for this show, I would say that I not only like it BUT LOVE IT! This show made it on my top 25 favorite anime! Take school rumble a fairly well revived romcom that fans of the genre tend to love. I legitimately love that show DESPITE THE DICK TEASING (nisekoi, I\'m also looking at you!) However with this show. It honestly seems more like a guilty pleasure. Honestly this show was so fucking dumb and retarded at times it was laughable! From the excessive loli fanservice.To the ironically funny main characer whos so generic it\'s laughable. To the weird and somewhat unlikable girls in a freaking harem. And the LAUGHABLY terrible romance. This anime is so stupid it\'s fucking genius! And the weird thing is, At first I almost thought this anime\'s stupidity was intentional. Because the show was so obviously terrible that it was hilarious. However PROTOTWISTU!!!! The show tried to pass off itself as being  fucking retarded. But it turns out it\'s actually a deconstruction anime! The show HIDES the fact that it\'s a deconstruction show. You see the deconstruction element of this anime foreshadowed from the very beginning. I was naive to call this show a guilty pleasure. Because the deconstruction elements TOTALLY SLIPPED PAST ME! The first 22 episodes of this anime play out like a shitty romcom but foreshadow the deconstruction elementsBUT BAM the last 3 episodes where genius! FACKIN\' GENIUS! The last 3 episodes is when this show becomes a deconstruction anime! The show pretty much points out it\'s own stupid flaws and breaks down why the show itself is stupid.To give you the most primary example of this anime being a deconstruction.Take the main character, kotoka. This guy\'s defining personality trait is his lack of one! I\'m not joking this guy is FUCKING BLAND BORING AND STOIC! He just has the typical cliche ""Oblivious nice guy that likes helping people"". AND YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF CHARACTER IN EVERY ROMCOM ANIME! *crying voice* Why can\'t all romcom characters be as cool as harima! He sees yozora be a sadistic bitch, he sees see rika be a HUGE creepy perv, and he sees loli\'s get freaking naked. And this guy NEVER HAS A REACTION! He\'s so apathetic I find it almost amusing, kind of similar to how yu narukami from persona 4 the animation is. However. PROTOTWITERU the main character actually does have a personality! You see this with the last three episodes as you learn he just PRETENDS to be a generic main character. It\'s all just an act! *gilgamesh* faker. But really the reason he acts so apathetic is because he\'s SELF AWARE that he\'s in a harem. He doesn\'t want to show favoritism towards one girl because he doesn\'t want to hurt any of there feelings. YEA HOLY FLIPPIN\' PIZZAS! That\'s pretty interesting! So this guy just PRETENDS to be your generic romcom character when deep down, he actually does have a personality! Inside that lifeless shell of a generic main character THERE IS A PERSONALITY!!!! If that\'s not deconstruction slapping you across the face with a wet noodle I don\'t know what is.This isn\'t the only character that would be considered a ""deconstruction character"". So you think of a harem anime. You expect two things. NUMBER 1 CHICKS WITH HUGE TITIES and also chicks with cute and likable personalities. In contrast yozora, the main girl of this show is FLAT A BOARD! Also she\'s a fucking sadistic cunt and I can\'t see how anyone could call this BITCH a waifu! However that\'s the point. I mean the cast consists of a the most loyal chick ever, two girls with a big brother fetish, a girl who wants to ride your dick, and MEAT! *Insert mooing sound* Honestly even IF yozora was a half decent person she couldn\'t even compare to these other chicks. And that\'s what makes it so interesting! The main girl was childhood friends with the main charachter and CREATED the neighbors club just as an excuse to spend time with him. But as more chicks came into the club, ALL MORE APPEALING THAN HER really makes yozora not even a competitor for ""best girl"". Due to her sadism and pessimistic nature she is in almost every way ""the worst girl"". In most shows having the ""worst girl"" be the MAIN GIRL would suck massive giraffe dick *wisper* and we all know giraffe have big dicks...actually only I know that.ANYWAYS. as interesting as yozouras dilemma is, do I like it. eh!? I mean it\'s interesting and unique but the problem is. The writers did such a good job at making yozora dislikable THAT I FUCKING HATE HER! She\'s a bitch, she\'s a cunt, she\'s a bully, she\'s literally cancer embodied as an anime girl! Thing is, she\'s so dislikable that I can\'t even sympathize with her.In the 25 episodes we\'ve watched we\'ve never seen her show any likable or sympathetic traits. Her character concept is great but the execution was done poorly! At least give her a sympathizing backstory or give her, you know, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! She\'s a bitch from episode 1 to episode 25 and isn\'t willing to change. Like maybe if we saw her have the willingness to change and TRY to be nice I\'d be like, OH, I feel bad and want to route for you to be a better person. So maybe we could see her work her way up to being the ""best girl""BUT NO, SHE\'S A MEENIE WEENIE THE ENTIRE SHOW.Honestly, these aren\'t the only two characters in this anime that are interesting and unique. You got Senna who basically is what created the ""kamidere"" architype. Senna, is in my opinion the best girl, as you see she\'s happy go lucky, pretty chill, like\'s hentai games and also TITIES!!! She also has a whole god complex as in, she\'s arrogant as fuck. But to be honest, when you\'re about as perfect in every way as she is her arrogance might be justified. I mean, Being rich, being the top in her classes, being overly attractive and on top of all that having a likable personality, everything about this girl, screams ""best girl"". And what makes me hate yozora even more is because you constantly see her bully senna throughout the show. All due to her being a jealous ass bitch. And this is the BIGGEST reason as to why I FUCKING HATE yozora! While some of the yozora bulling senna moments where funny. ALL OF THEM MADE ME WANT TO KILL YOZORA! How can I sympathize with someone as cruel as her. I might sympathize with flowey before I sympathize with yozora!Next off, you got rika, not much to say other than SHE REALLY LIKES SEX. I\'m not joking this is the whole joke her character is based off of...AND IT\'S HILARIOUS. Unfortunately she looks kinda creepy but when she takes off those glasses DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYMMMN GURL! Honestly, this show despite being a romcom doesn\'t have good romance. Because I don\'t care for the main character so I don\'t care for his romance. HOWEVER, in the last 3 episodes, Rika was the one that pointed out the fact that kotoka is a faker. Rika has the desire to learn who kotoka REALLY is deep down. Her relationship and romance is by far more interesting than the main two girls. As she really brings out the best in our boring main guy. I easily ship these two. Unfortunate that she\'s not one of the two main girls of this show. So I highly doubt we\'ll see these two end up together.Next off. You got two loli\'s. One of them is the main characters little sister. Ok first off, the legal age in japan is 13 and she\'s 11 SO EVEN BY JAPANS STANDARDS THIS IS CREEPY! Not to mention the whole incest thing. Yea I don\'t need to get into that. Next off you got the nun girl. Take index from a certain magical index and imagine her being a 10 year old and KABAM. you get what is THE WORST GIRL. I might have said yozora was the worst girl, but I\'m not including loli\'s into the mix. Because, I kinda don\'t want to picture kotoka as a incestuous pedofile. Nun girl is an obnoxious spoiled little brat! It\'s creepy to think that this KID is a part of the harem. What\'s even more creeps is that there is FANSERVICE OF THESE CHARACTERS! WHY! THEY AREN\'T EVEN IN HIGHSCHOOL YET! AND ONE OF THEM ISN\'T EVEN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!!Then you got some trans guy. He\'s biologically a female but in spite of that want\'s to be a SUPER MANLY MAN! The whole trans thing is played off for laughs and created alot of amzing cringe humor. We don\'t even learn he has a fucking VAGINA till season 2!When the main character found out he biologically wasn\'t a dude. I died of laughter man. Also, does anyone else think he looks alot like mikoto misaka?Honestly, overall I would say that the BIGGEST strength of this show is it\'s character interactions.

And so Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT is... Well it's been a while since I finished it. Sometimes I go to my D drive to fish it out just to watch one episode so I still have fond memories of it and here are my personal thoughts.Story wise, it has practically none. You probably wouldn't be too hurt watching the anime jumping episodes (I never jump episodes. NEVER. Except with Suzumiya. They saw it coming.) There are small little parts of the story that...really got me and it makes me super excited for a sequel. But of course, the story doesn't compare to it comedy (or at least I think that's how they planned it to be). Thoroughly funny for me I must say.Moving on to the art and sound, where there isn't much to say, it was good. Just good I guess. Art was above average but then again it's pretty new and can't compare to stuff like Kimi ni Todoke. Music was unmemorable. I probably skipped through the songs like most other animes but this anime left hardly any recollections of how it's like. I can only remember some slap bass lines and that's it. Tada.For characters... Well this can be quite a love hate thing. I've read other reviews saying how they hate Maria sensei who say poop every episode but I'm like... WHAT. I LOVED THAT KID. Her irritating voice kept me smiling and laughing always. She's crazy. And then the main characters are... Well the guy is hard to understand to be honest. Like most of them. You've gotta keep this in mind that hey, they got no friends yo! Not till the formation of the club. Do you know what it's like? I don't >.< Some might call Kodaka a spineless idiot, but I think he's really just genuinely scared and scarred. He's just playing dumb mostly... As for the girls... Again you've gotta try to understand where they are coming from... I love Rika. Period. She works hard, she plays hard and she's smart. And perverted. Bonus there. :DI enjoyed it. Thoroughly. It was good, but then that's me. But anyway, since you've watched (I'm assuming) the prequel, finish it. Especially if you didn't think it was bad. They wrote it well, that the prequel ends with Taka meeting Sora and that you've gotta catch the sequel to find out what's up. So please do!Thanks for reading my elaborate review. I'm trying to be really to the point and not poetic like some people. It doesn't serve the people man. Write your poems somewhere else >.< really got me and it makes me super excited for a sequel.

Write your poems somewhere else >.<"", 'After finishing this series I was immediately swept over by a wave of disappointment due to the lackluster and, frankly, horrid way this series decides to end itself. The anime adaption does not cover all the events of the original work, though the ending there is even more disappointing I dare say.First of all, this series is listed as a ""harem"" but that\'s not true at all. The MC is cockblocking himself from what seems like a would-be harem. I strongly believe the story would\'ve been much more coherent had they not tried going down the harem route and limited the number of romantic...interests to two. Now I get the feeling they tried to do harem but gave up halfway through, ending up with this confused mess.The animation itself is nothing of particular note, openings and endings were nothing memorable as far as I\'m concerned and VAs got their job done.I rate this a 5/10 due to how bad the ending is; it makes a lot of the plot and character development from the previous season plus this season meaningless. interests to two.

I value this anime with a value of 8. "", 'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is one of the many light novels to there which is receiving a lot less acclamation than it deserves. While this is not unusual, it still is shocking to realize a majority of anime fans out there are missing out on such a great work of art and cannot truly appreciate its’ existence. In the anime world, light novels are often looked down upon for their brevity, many viewers seems to have the notion that due to the shortness of light novels, the character and plot development cannot be that great, they also commonly assume that there would be many...holes in the story line. While it is true that many light novels seems to fall under this category, such as Kore wa Zombie desu ka, it is also undeniable that there are others which, for some inexplicable reason, the manga-ka chose not to prolong the series, Club to Death Angel comes to mind, and it truly is a shame that such anime are not recognized for their sheer amazingness. Personally, I have nothing against popular manga and anime, I am a big fan of One Piece and Fairy Tail, and I agree that new viewers introduced to the world of anime should start with those, however they should also realize that Big-Timers are not the only anime that they need to grab popcorn and lock themselves up 25/8 for. Some light novels, such as SAO and K-ON, are appraised for their ingenuity despite their shortness, but it bothers me that people should not look deeper for equally great anime, and this is why I am writing a review for Boku wa Tomadachi ga Sukunai.StoryOn the most basic level, this series is about a teenage boy named Kodaka who has moved back to his hometown after 10 years and tries to make new friends, but because of the colour of his hair, people generally mistake him for a delinquent and avoid him, thus the name of the piece (literally: I don’t have many friends, which I am now going to refer as Haganai). Until he meets a girl named Yozora, who also is a bit of a loner (seeing as how she was talking to “an air friend”), and together they create the Neighbour’s Club, with intentions of learning how to interact and make friends, “A place where outcasts could just be themselves and not care”. The setting and plot is a complete slice-of-life, with nothing seemly out of the ordinary (besides Rika nearly killing Kodaka with flying metal balls near the end of the second season, but that’s beside the point), as Hirasaka evidently wanted viewers to be able to relate to certain events in the storyline. While this is a Harem, with Kodaka being our male protagonist with many adorable female characters revolving around him, it is not just your typical, generic fan service series, the story actually has deeper meaning and legit purpose for all of them being in the same club (in this case making friends), as opposed to the other harems out there where characters stay together for the sake of being together. Sure, there are some eye-candy screens which will arouse some excitement within our male demographic, but the story is also trying to teach us something, which is to value our friendship. We do not truly appreciate the friends we make, but as we watch Kodaka and the others struggle for the desire of friendship, it makes us think. What is friendship? IS it formed simply by being members of the same club? Through the interactions of our characters, we slowly begin to comprehend these values. The irony being that they are learning to make friends, all the process becoming friends within the club. These things are a part of what makes this series so great, as you would not expect such questions to come out of a series of just 25 episodes. The cast of this story is a colourful bunch: we have Kodaka, the cool-headed yet dense protagonist, we have Yozora, lacking in every aspect except for her looks, as well as Sena, the other female lead, self-proclaimed goddess and perfect at everything besides her personality, and others including Yukimura, Maria, Rika, and Kobato, all of whom have a distinctive character and defining trait. With a bunch of misfits such as these coming together, the romance which brews and relationships which follows is pure gold. Many of the events which take place with the Neighbour’s Club are just normal activities, ranging from Karaoke to a training camp at the beach, but the development of said relationships is what makes it so intriguing. Are there any flaws to the story line? Sure, while the cast is wonderful, we don’t know much about their backgrounds besides a general outline. Also, while the drama of some confrontations leaves you on the edge of your seat, Kodaka usually ends up ruining the emotional build-up by being his ignorant self. However, considering this as opposed to, say, Zombie desu ka where the plot line is completely disjointed and half the time your are trying to figure out what is going on, I would give this a try any day.ArtA strong point which I precieved of Haganai, is its’ artwork. Originally, I had picked up this series seeing as how the characters looked cute, not realizing I would be getting so much more out of it. Not much to say about it, just that the artwork is amazing, even going so far as to say the best I’ve seen in anime by far. The way FunAnimation was able to give life into the character’s eyes to the point where they seem to come to life, especially Sena and Yozora, is just intriguing. Also Maria’s child-like face, Kobato’s shyness, and Rika’s eccentreicity are all depicted so well to portray the various personalities. While most of us would just be enjoying Sena’s fan service, other things sucha s the detailsof the background and even no-name characters, the fact is that the artwork never fails to surprise, and viewers could easily tell the amount of effort put into make the anime aesthetically pleasing.CharactersThis, in my opinion, is the most prominent asset to Haganai. As mentioned earlier, Haganai is a story that circulates around a group of social outcasts who seek to make friends, and the on going development of relationships is what makes this anime so enjoyable. Each character has different life problems and conditions which opts them from making friends, whether this be being an isolated genius, child prodigy, a girl who believes she’s a guy, or an arrogant idol, the Neighbour Club brings them all together with the purpose of making friends, and the interactions are hilarious. The characters do not seem to all be held together by Kodaka, but instead develop their own relationships. A central focus would be the constant discrepancies between Yozora and Sena, as they disagree and compete in next to everything (besides Sena’s Girl’s Love games). From multiplayer video games to a roller coaster in an amusement park, there seems to be a constant unsettled animosity between them. This could be due to Yozora’s dislike for popular people such as Meat (Yozora’s nickname for Sena), but either way it’s funny. Similarly, Kobato and Maria are seen often fighting for “Onni-san’s” (Kodaka’s) brotherly affections. Being the two youngest members, Kobato and Maria could most relate to each other, and due to their credulity both believing that Kobato is a vampire while Maria being a nun, thus the allusion to conflict between light and dark. Among this, other relationships develop, such as Meat’s creepy obsession over Kobato due to her resembling characters from Meat’s eroge games, or Rika’s open perverseness towards Kodaka, all lead for great laughs. In terms of love relationships, seeing as how this is a harem, the feelings from the girls develop gradually, and the confrontations are all very realistic, while dense Kodaka either doesn’t understand or chooses to ignore the emotions involved and continues to treat everyone as “just club members”. Unlike its counterparts, Haganai treats the situations realistically, and it isn’t just some slug fest due to Kodaka being the only male character, Rika being the only one who openly expresses her feelings (which Kodaka chooses to ignore). In season 2, our cast seems to have mature more, with the exception of Kobato and Maria, and thus acts as such. While on the surface, these characters are just here to offer enjoyment to the viewers, however Hirasaka actually offers a deeper in look of our characters. While Kodaka is your typical male protagonist with “a bad-boy look” and a seeming tsundre attitude, at heart he is really a kind teenage boy who cares for the people around him. Kodaka is not just your unoriginal, cliché harem male, through him, Hirasaka is telling us to be who we are and to not judge by appearance, seeing as how Kodaka is bullied due to his naturally blonde hair but despite this refuses to dye it. It truly is amazing to see how well the characters are developed and their relationships within such a short series.Sound/MusicAgain, not much to say about this besides the fact that the developer, FunAnimation, incorporated the perfect OST into this anime. The OP of both season 1 and 2 are extremely fun to listen to, and one could sit there for hours listening to them as they sit in their room alone playing chess by themselves (not like I’m telling from personal experience, no never). There’s just one thing that bothers me with the music, and for the fact this goes with most Japanese anime music, and that is the inclusion of English words. Sure, “friend” and “bend” rhymes, but that does not always great song make. Also, the Japanese dub is excellent, wit the voice casting of each character perfectly suited to their personalities.EnjoymentGreat character foils? Check. Adorable and realistic art? Check. Comic relief? Check. Sena running nude and making erotic poses? Check. Haganai has got it all. I have already watched and rewatched this series, and would go for it again, that in itself should speak for enjoyment. The comedic relationships on its own should serve as a purpose to watch this. If you’re looking for arousing screens, Sena says hi. While not as fan service heavy as FunAnimations’s last work, Heaven’s Lost Property, Haganai has got its own fair share of eye candies to gawk over.OverallAs I said previously, I often feel that light novels are underrated and just aren’t receiving as much attention as it deserves. Viewers often perceive short series as mini-mangas/anime and treat it as such. Many don’t take them seriously, and most tend to read a couple of the crappy ones out there before coming to the conclusion that all light novels suck, and decide to stick to only the popular series. However, comparing light novels to longer series would be like comparing an old man at the park to rainbows; they’re just totally different entities. For this reason, and considering how short the series is, I strongly recommend anime viewers, both armatures and seasoned viewers, to give Haganai a try, and decide for themselves. holes in the story line. While it is true that many light novels seems to fall under this category, such as Kore wa Zombie desu ka, it is also undeniable that there are others which, for some inexplicable reason, the manga-ka chose not to prolong the series, Club to Death Angel comes to mind, and it truly is a shame that such anime are not recognized for their sheer amazingness.

Also, while the drama of some confrontations leaves you on the edge of your seat, Kodaka usually ends up ruining the emotional build-up by being his ignorant self. However, considering this as opposed to, say, Zombie desu ka where the plot line is completely disjointed and half the time your are trying to figure out what is going on, I would give this a try any day.ArtA strong point which I precieved of Haganai, is its’ artwork. Originally, I had picked up this series seeing as how the characters looked cute, not realizing I would be getting so much more out of it. Not much to say about it, just that the artwork is amazing, even going so far as to say the best I’ve seen in anime by far. The way FunAnimation was able to give life into the character’s eyes to the point where they seem to come to life, especially Sena and Yozora, is just intriguing. Also Maria’s child-like face, Kobato’s shyness, and Rika’s eccentreicity are all depicted so well to portray the various personalities. While most of us would just be enjoying Sena’s fan service, other things sucha s the detailsof the background and even no-name characters, the fact is that the artwork never fails to surprise, and viewers could easily tell the amount of effort put into make the anime aesthetically pleasing.CharactersThis, in my opinion, is the most prominent asset to Haganai. As mentioned earlier, Haganai is a story that circulates around a group of social outcasts who seek to make friends, and the on going development of relationships is what makes this anime so enjoyable. Each character has different life problems and conditions which opts them from making friends, whether this be being an isolated genius, child prodigy, a girl who believes she’s a guy, or an arrogant idol, the Neighbour Club brings them all together with the purpose of making friends, and the interactions are hilarious. The characters do not seem to all be held together by Kodaka, but instead develop their own relationships. A central focus would be the constant discrepancies between Yozora and Sena, as they disagree and compete in next to everything (besides Sena’s Girl’s Love games). From multiplayer video games to a roller coaster in an amusement park, there seems to be a constant unsettled animosity between them. This could be due to Yozora’s dislike for popular people such as Meat (Yozora’s nickname for Sena), but either way it’s funny. Similarly, Kobato and Maria are seen often fighting for “Onni-san’s” (Kodaka’s) brotherly affections. Being the two youngest members, Kobato and Maria could most relate to each other, and due to their credulity both believing that Kobato is a vampire while Maria being a nun, thus the allusion to conflict between light and dark. Among this, other relationships develop, such as Meat’s creepy obsession over Kobato due to her resembling characters from Meat’s eroge games, or Rika’s open perverseness towards Kodaka, all lead for great laughs. In terms of love relationships, seeing as how this is a harem, the feelings from the girls develop gradually, and the confrontations are all very realistic, while dense Kodaka either doesn’t understand or chooses to ignore the emotions involved and continues to treat everyone as “just club members”. Unlike its counterparts, Haganai treats the situations realistically, and it isn’t just some slug fest due to Kodaka being the only male character, Rika being the only one who openly expresses her feelings (which Kodaka chooses to ignore). In season 2, our cast seems to have mature more, with the exception of Kobato and Maria, and thus acts as such. While on the surface, these characters are just here to offer enjoyment to the viewers, however Hirasaka actually offers a deeper in look of our characters. While Kodaka is your typical male protagonist with “a bad-boy look” and a seeming tsundre attitude, at heart he is really a kind teenage boy who cares for the people around him. Kodaka is not just your unoriginal, cliché harem male, through him, Hirasaka is telling us to be who we are and to not judge by appearance, seeing as how Kodaka is bullied due to his naturally blonde hair but despite this refuses to dye it. It truly is amazing to see how well the characters are developed and their relationships within such a short series.Sound/MusicAgain, not much to say about this besides the fact that the developer, FunAnimation, incorporated the perfect OST into this anime. The OP of both season 1 and 2 are extremely fun to listen to, and one could sit there for hours listening to them as they sit in their room alone playing chess by themselves (not like I’m telling from personal experience, no never). There’s just one thing that bothers me with the music, and for the fact this goes with most Japanese anime music, and that is the inclusion of English words. Sure, “friend” and “bend” rhymes, but that does not always great song make. Also, the Japanese dub is excellent, wit the voice casting of each character perfectly suited to their personalities.EnjoymentGreat character foils? Check. Adorable and realistic art? Check. Comic relief? Check. Sena running nude and making erotic poses? Check. Haganai has got it all. I have already watched and rewatched this series, and would go for it again, that in itself should speak for enjoyment. The comedic relationships on its own should serve as a purpose to watch this. If you’re looking for arousing screens, Sena says hi. While not as fan service heavy as FunAnimations’s last work, Heaven’s Lost Property, Haganai has got its own fair share of eye candies to gawk over.OverallAs I said previously, I often feel that light novels are underrated and just aren’t receiving as much attention as it deserves. Viewers often perceive short series as mini-mangas/anime and treat it as such. Many don’t take them seriously, and most tend to read a couple of the crappy ones out there before coming to the conclusion that all light novels suck, and decide to stick to only the popular series. However, comparing light novels to longer series would be like comparing an old man at the park to rainbows; they’re just totally different entities. For this reason, and considering how short the series is, I strongly recommend anime viewers, both armatures and seasoned viewers, to give Haganai a try, and decide for themselves.', '(MODERATE SPOILERS)Surprisingly, here I am again writing another review of this anime. And no, I did not binge it. I actually just wrote the other one a little late, so I figured I would tackle two birds at the same time, having just finished this season today. Only this time, I feel I should be a little less negative, even though that\'s kind of hard to do due to the new atmosphere of this season. I really don\'t have much to write here, though, since it follows most of the same tropes you saw previously.By now, you\'re familiar with everyone. The club now has a...total of seven members, two of which are the little girls I mentioned before. And you are also aware that Yozora now has her original look back from when she was a kid. Surprisingly, they don\'t go over this very much. Yozora has short hair and, well, that\'s it. Besides Yozora, Rika is the only other girl to undergo a major change in design, which she does every episode. Oh, is there a lot I want to say Rika, but I will save that for later.Positives! I wanted to be positive first, so here we go. Remember the little nun? Well, she is fleshed out quite a bit this time around. In fact, remember that nun that saw Maria running around nude last season? She debuts here and is revealed to be her sister! And like her sister, she goes by a common name, Kate. Funny thing is that both Maria and Kate can be spelled in Japanese (まりあ or ma-ri-a and かて or ka-te) and the differences overseas are simply how they are pronounced. Despite her rather crude personality, Kate is a character that you may see yourself liking a lot near the end because she has the most common sense among the other teenagers.She is also probably the most attractive, even more than Sena, because she has a curvy body and possesses more common sense. Yeah, one thing I think I forgot to mention was that Sena is actually a genius, despite how I described her before. She gets top of her grades and is very athletic. That\'s why I could never really see anyone hating her is because she is just herself when she does the things that she does, as opposed to thinking she had average grades like everyone else.Sadly, the screen time for Kate is not very long beyond her debut and leading episodes. She is regulated to a minor character quite quick, but for the few times she does appear, she will certainly entertain the viewer. Oh, and just a little warning. Like Sena, fan service has to strike her as well, so she does appear fully nude one time. The scene is fairly obvious, though, so I don\'t consider this a spoiler.One thing I will note, however, is that when Kodaka sees her (who else would it be) on accident, she actually accepts the situation as an accident. And I am sure you guys are familiar by now with how much I consider this a rarity in anime. I just wrote about one that did the same thing a little while ago, but I think this one surpasses that moment by far since it was a far worse situation than the last one. Even better, she jokingly said he would be punished, but then says she was kidding and that it\'s fine. Yes, she actually used the typical overreaction as a joke. Something I really wish more anime did because I still stand by what I said before that most ""punishments"" for the, again, accidental encounters are far worse than the encounter itself. Will probably be the last time I bring this up for a while, though, since even I am noticing this to be a running gag in my writing. Comically, she also asks him to go to confession afterwards. Thought that was pretty funny with the whole nun thing and all.So, after the new character, the anime gets pretty low on them for a while. Strangely, the atmosphere is way more serious this time around. Heck, I don\'t think I can be positive about it anymore, so get ready. I will start with Rika. Firstly, I did not expect her to get so brutal in this season, but she did. If you thought the other girls were mean to Kodaka, take all of their hatred combined and you have Rika. She doesn\'t necessarily consider him a bad person, but she does treat him quite poorly. One episode in particular had her acting as a ""tsundere maid"" for a school festival idea and she was literally beating him up. Mostly by kicking, but that\'s what it was. She was also calling him everything that he hates and disrespecting him horribly for a few minutes of the episode. Any viewer\'s heart would go out to Kodaka after witnessing it as well. Well she did do it as an act, anyone would consider it overkill on her end since, surprisingly, the other girls felt uncomfortable well watching.Oh, and remember what I said before about how everyone always has a general disrespectful attitude towards Kodaka? This is why I said you would grow to like Kate, because every new character that isn\'t from the Neighbors Club respects Kodaka more than, well, any of the teenagers from the Neighbors Club. Some of their disagreements this time around could give you a bit of pain because you can\'t really figure out why, even the nicer characters such as Yukimura, agree with Kodaka being a rude person. And to add insult to injury, Kodaka has even admitted that he\'s a weak person, but wants to grow into someone respectable.So, his own self-loathing results in him usually never fighting back and there\'s really nobody to comfort him besides Kobato and Maria, the youngest members of the club. Doesn\'t happen often, though. Also, one thing you will find interesting about one of them, Kobato, is that she is actually the most popular girl in her school. She is just a sociopath and can\'t make friends with any of her classmates, only being able to truly interact with Kodaka and now mildly gets along with Maria as a friend. Pretty sad, actually. All the more reason why she is befitting to be in the club.You know, I have just about made a paragraph for every member of the club besides Yukimura, though there\'s not much to say about her. She has always been a recurring character, though the standout of her character is that she thinks she is a man. The anime won\'t tell you this, but her family actually wanted a boy and so they treated her as such. Funnily enough, she always went into the mens\' section of any place with Kodaka and so he genuinely believed her to be a man as well for a while. It was not really until one day in the male washroom where Maria joins them as well (not really being old enough where it matters) that she looks down at the (...) of Kodaka and asks why Yukimura does not have one as well. Naturally, Kodaka glances over and, well, he finally saw the full body of a woman that also saw the full body of him. Not how he wanted to do it, I\'m sure, but there you go.One last character I should go over is Aoi, one of the members of the student council. She appears very late in the anime, so much so that she barely has any real development, but does have a couple episodes centered around her for little bit of anime that is left. In what I consider one of the most bizarre ways to save a club, Yozora basically tells Aoi that their club is legitimate since they are not breaking any of the rules. All goes fine until Aoi reports Maria for not being the official staff of the school and Sena decides to just call in for her to be recruited, despite her age, and then very frighteningly threatens Aoi not to report anything false ever again.Of course, the viewer would naturally know that they were breaking the rules from the very beginning, but their dark threats scare Aoi off and their club continues on, despite them breaking the rules for quite a while by being unmoderated for several weeks. If you like really dark humor, this scene may make you laugh a lot. Aoi does indeed bring up how they were unmoderated for a while as well. Sena later goes on to say that power solves everything and, well, I hope nobody young is watching this anime. It is very impressionable in more ways than one if this is their first harem, much less first anime altogether. Could very well ruin the whole medium for them.Oh, and I actually like the design of Aoi as well. Something about the characters with red hair always spark my interest. She is also the only girl that is Kodaka\'s age to also respect him, so if there are a lot of viewers disappointed by his treatment up to that point, it feels like the writers wanted to give the poor guy a break. Even the student council president, Hinata, says not to judge a book by its cover, much to the relief of Kodaka whose voice breaks from hearing those words from someone else. Hinata actually does not play a major role in the anime at all, being thrown in near the ending of it all and only serving as a plot device. She actually even tries to clear Kodaka\'s reputation, but it obviously fails and all the students do is praise her for her efforts. Hinata is very aspiring, though, as she mentions that she did not care at all about how the other students would see her if she decided to let Kodaka assist her and said she would refer to them as students she would not associate her time with if they ever teased her.If you liked this anime before, this season will only disappoint you in the way they chose to suddenly take away the nonchalant feel of the last and turn it into a bit of a drama. Oh, and it disappointingly ends on a cliffhanger. I never feel like I am spoiling anything when saying this, but rather trying to warn you just so you don\'t invest your time into it. All I can say is good luck and I hope you have a high tolerance for torture porn, cause Kodaka gets the bad end of the stick quite often. total of seven members, two of which are the little girls I mentioned before.

Essentially, this season carries on seamlessly from the previous season - same animation, music, voice acting and general tone. One thing they seemed to do away with was the ecchi quality of the first season, not that it had much prominence there either - so no nudity and half-time eyecatchers this time around. Anyway, as a light, high school based comedy, this series does fairly well. It\'s nothing you won\'t have seen before in such arrangements, but Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga sukunai is nonetheless a fun watch through both seasons. If that\'s the type of thing you\'re after,...I\'d recommend trying it. This is a series more than that though, and it\'s at this point I become less eager to recommend it.Yeah, don\'t watch this for the romance. Well it\'s your call, but having seen it through to the end, I personally wouldn\'t rewatch this series purely as a result of how the romance plays out. I\'m aware a large portion of romance fans favour satisfying romances, even if there isn\'t a happy ending - I\'m certainly in that camp, at least - and Christ is the romance in this series anything but. As throughout the first season, romance is more or less left to simmer. That is to say, for most of the runtime, nothing really develops beyond what we already knew regarding how certain characters feel about Kodaka.But okay, the first season was based more on romantic subtext, hardly aiming to develop any such relationships - at least beyond a certain point - and that worked fine. However, that direction works because it sets the expectation that eventually, romance will see a place in the limelight. Bear with it, it implies. So you wait and wait, and... wait, this is the tenth episode!?  How will all this romantic potential between characters tie together in just three episodes?When romance finally begins to get the anticipated spotlight in episode ten, it feels like it\'s too late. Surprise surprise, it is. At least, the story doesn\'t bother trying to cram it all into three episodes. Instead, it draws upon the plot point you thought had been succeeded long ago  - friendship. As soon as the club members were all present in the story, this theme seemed all but redundant. Sure, they hadn\'t yet acknowledged it, but as far as anyone could be concerned by this point, they\'re all friends. Although resurfacing occasionally, this theme began to lose its grip more and more as romantic expectations increased through the story\'s progression, so when it suddenly tightens in the final straight, I was left thinking ""what was the point in the romantic setup?"".So, that\'s the romance. There are other things usually covered in reviews but I didn\'t really set out intending for this to be so thorough as to cover all bases, so onto the summary. First, this season specifically. As mentioned, it carries on well from the first with perfect continuity, but leaves far too many loose ends. Now, the series overall. If you\'re seeking romance, look elsewhere. If you\'re interested in this series for anything besides that, you\'ll likely find this a fun, engaging watch, but since romance is an inescapable aspect of the plot, you\'ll end up having to face it one way or another.

Rating it as a five is probably generous, but I am really just frustrated to all hell with the whole thing....If they continued art and animation is good.

They all have one thing in common. They all are friendless. Many Anime fans want to see a Haganai Season 3. And with some luck, it may come. We just have to wait.That is binds them together and they join a club to spend time together and engage in activities together. Many fans enjoyed the Anime, as the characters were very likeable and funny and on top of that the show has a good story as well. In this article...we will discuss a Season 3 of Haganai and go over some important facts about the Anime.Our main characters all join the club at the start and that is how they all become. They all have one thing in common as I said above. The majority of the episodes are just our characters arguing or going on stupid stunts and trips. Our main character Kodaka Hasegawa is pretty relatable and normal as it goes.Will there be a Haganai Season 3?So will Haganai have a season 3? To understand that we need to look at 4 main things. Once we have gone over the 4 main reasons then we can summarize if Haganai will get a season 3 and when it will air. The reasons I mentioned before are:Whether or not the production company that made Haganai (AIC Build) would be able to fund and produce a 3rd season.If the manga can be properly adapted by AIC Build as it has before which is highly likely given they’ve produced 2 previous seasons.The manga has been written and it is still on going so this would be another thing to consider.If a 3rd season of Haganai would be profitable or not.The manga has been writing and only around 14 volumes have been adapted. So that’s 2 seasons. This means that since the manga is still being written then there is still content to be adapted.The question of the adaptation of the manga and will Haganai have a season 3, are very important questions that need to be answered in order to learn if this is possible.Source: https://cradleview.net/haganai-season-3-what-we-know-so-far/ we will discuss a Season 3 of Haganai and go over some important facts about the Anime.Our main characters all join the club at the start and that is how they all become.

The reasons I mentioned before are:Whether or not the production company that made Haganai (AIC Build) would be able to fund and produce a 3rd season.If the manga can be properly adapted by AIC Build as it has before which is highly likely given they’ve produced 2 previous seasons.The manga has been written and it is still on going so this would be another thing to consider.If a 3rd season of Haganai would be profitable or not.The manga has been writing and only around 14 volumes have been adapted. So that’s 2 seasons. This means that since the manga is still being written then there is still content to be adapted.The question of the adaptation of the manga and will Haganai have a season 3, are very important questions that need to be answered in order to learn if this is possible.Source: https://cradleview.net/haganai-season-3-what-we-know-so-far/', ""*review of both seasonsHaganai is an ecchi harem romantic comedy, but it actually has characters that suffer consequences for their actions. The basis of Haganai is pretty simple: a bunch of loners starts a club so that they can learn to make friends. The character archetypes are pretty cliche: there is the shy osananajimi, the ojousama, the nerd otaku, the imouto, the loli, the femboy gender bender, and the harem protagonist. However, each of these characters goes far beyond what their character troupe says they should be. Each of them actually has developed as a character and has complex relationships that develop over time. Unlike...in most harem anime, the character’s ulterior motives give harem relationships when they don’t pan out well. The character’s weird oddities and stubbornness are shown to not always work the best for them. Yozora is probably the best-developed character, as her cliche-ness at the beginning breaks down over time as her relationship with Sena and Kodaka leaves the standard development and ventures into her own problems. Her relationships developed to be complex with the other characters and her unwillingness to do certain things are shown to have actual consequences. In addition, unlike in most harem anime, the main character, Kodaka, is shown to have more complex feelings than just “I want to date this girl” and actually is developed well just to want to be friends with all of the members of Neighbors Club, and how he may fail or not fail at it. In fact, unlike most harem anime, there was almost no focus on the main character wanting to date the characters and only focusing on the girls liking him. Other than the characters, the art and animations are just above average for the time and nothing special. Both OPs are decent but not great, and the first ed isn't good (however, I did like the second ED). During the first season especially there were a lot of odd nude scenes, but either I’ve gotten used to it or they were less painful than usual. Overall, this anime was better than I expected and flips some of the troupes to make an actually good anime about what it means to make friends.Score: 8.0date of review: 8/20/2022 in most harem anime, the character’s ulterior motives give harem relationships when they don’t pan out well.

Oh boy, was that worth dismantled in a way I wasn\'t hoping for.First of all, the story. More than anything that bothered me was the pacing. Almost all of the important plot happened in the last four episodes of this season, with the previous eight episodes feeling like something that could have been covered in maybe two or three episodes. Only the episodes involving Sena\'s home life seemed to have any major influence to the rest of the plot, and most of those moments could have been put...into a single episode and even a single day at her house. To have the last two episodes introduce two new characters, use them over a montage that spanned a week, and not tell us near anything about them beyond being on the student council just felt pointless. And the ending...I don\'t even want to get into that. It\'s been seven years without a third season, and I honestly don\'t think it\'s completely deserving of one after how much of this season seemed to be filler.The art was good, though I could have definitely foregone the overabundance of fan service shots of Sena, as nearly every fan service piece involved her. We get it, she\'s got big boobs and a nice booty. Not every shot of her needs to emphasize that. Even the shot of Hinata at the race looked like it came from a hentai, to be honest.Sound, I don\'t know what to say. I liked the music in it, though I was a bigger fan of the opening theme from the first season. Outside of that, I\'d say it was solid.Characters, well, this is where most of my gripes are beyond the story and its pacing. First of all, Yozora was wronged. They had such a good setup for a meaningful story between Kodaka and Yozora after the ending of Season One, and it was completely wasted to the point that, when the ending came, it felt like a slap in the face, since that was the first major character development in Yozora the entire season. Sena left me more and more annoyed with each passing episode, and the apex point in her and Kodaka\'s story felt almost out of left field, as, just like Yozora, there wasn\'t much character development through this season with her outside of ""oh, she\'s overly obsessed with Kobato and can be a bit of a creep."" Kodaka also irritated me because all of the character development literally was in the last episode. They could have easily brought that self-conflict and had it developing the entire season and made the final episode not only more meaningful, but made the pacing so much better. The other characters were the saving grace of this season on almost every aspect. Maria and Kobato\'s relationship arc was one of the more interesting and enjoyable ones of the season. Yukimura\'s character development was extremely interesting to me and left as one of my two favorite characters, though I do wish they would have chosen to treat Yukimura in a way that looked at gender dysphoria and accepting people no matter their gender like it looked for a second like they were going to instead of ""oh, you\'re a girl that wants to be a guy? That\'s weird."" I get that it\'s seven years old now, but the way they treated that just really irked me because it just felt like another wasted story arc that could have had a lot of potential if they had treated it differently. Rika, who left as my favorite character, was also wronged like Yozora, though in a different way. Rika had by far the most character development and really represented what I was hoping to see in the second season, being that they were coming to terms with who they all were and fulfill the idea of building friendships, even if they were all different. Instead, Rika was the only one who accomplished this and the only one who had good pacing in it. She was the saving grace of this season to me.I think Rika\'s growing irritation at Kodaka and everyone else for not being honest with themselves and seeing that they are all friends and that you can\'t keep relationships stagnant, no matter how hard you try, was how I felt with each subsequent episode. By the end of it, while the characters outside of the main three saved this season from being a true cheat of my time, I\'m frustrated by how much lost potential for story development and interesting character building there was. I give it a six on the merits of how to develop interesting supporting characters like Yukimura, Rika, Maria, Kobato, and even Kate (another character I do considered wasted), but for the main three, the first season did them justice and then the second season just left them falling on their face. Based on what I know about the rest of the LN, if they ever made a third season, they better not follow them because of how much wasted potential showed up in the second season.6/10, and that is on the generous side from me. into a single episode and even a single day at her house.

The combination of the Neighbours club, the gaming and the non urban setting make it different than the rest.ART:I liked the art a lot, they did a great job with facial expressions and small details during many characters conversations.SOUND:Meh, nothing...to write home about.CHARACTER:The characters are what the whole show depends on. i liked the cast of this show but felt certain characters didnt get enough development to warrant them hanging around the main cast the whole time. an argument could definitely be made that a few of the cast could've been scrapped from the neighbours club.THE LAST EPISODE :(The ending is bad. I kept waiting for a certain love confession to be returned, but as the show reached 20 minutes run time i realised it wasn't ever happening. don't get me wrong, there's plenty of logical reasons why the ending was how it was, but it felt like a missed opportunity to close of the anime on a high note.the shows creators went out of their way to imply Kodaka and one of the girls were going to end up together. everything was pointing to this ending. then they decide f*** it, let's leave the anime watchers hanging on this incomplete show.i think what happened is the creators realised this anime wasn't going to get a third season. As a result, they figured if they gave us this shitty ending, it would force us to read the Light Novel and Manga content which would make them more $$$. Maybe they wanted a season 3 and couldn't make it happen but we'll never know.Nonetheless, this show is quite popular in its own right and had they swapped the last 10 minutes of this show with some sort of definite conclusion, this could've been one of the higher tier harem shows (not nisekoi level, but definitely above average)ENJOYMENT:i enjoyed this show and would recommend it to anyone thats into harem shows, but otherwise i see no reason for anyone else to watch it.OVERALLOverall, 7.5 out of 10 for me due to the strong cast, beautiful messages about friendship and the great conversations and facial expressions in the show to write home about.CHARACTER:The characters are what the whole show depends on. i liked the cast of this show but felt certain characters didnt get enough development to warrant them hanging around the main cast the whole time. an argument could definitely be made that a few of the cast could've been scrapped from the neighbours club.THE LAST EPISODE :(The ending is bad.

In any other anime he would be like Minor side character C with a tendency to die first depending on the genre.You got the...flat-breasted (and very conscious about it who would\'ve guessed) blue haired chick who sucks at math but is a genius at linguistics or whateverThen you have the opposite big tiddy math chick who apparentl seems to have some form of undiagnosed asperger or another form of autism given how bad she sucks at both social interactions and any subject related to that.Finally you the sports chick which is bad at English but can swim. yay. Her most notable features are probably her tan lines oh and the childhood friend wave gets ridden a little bit but only back to middle school.These are the main ""heroines"". There are two notable side character, one being the graduated senpai chick who currently fails at getting enrolled at uni and ronins around and the pink haired teacher who would\'ve failed to get a teaching license in any anime not being a complete pile of garbage since she too seems to have some form of autism impairing her communication skills to one word lines or one liners at best which as we all know is the most desirable trait in a teacher. But common sense or any sense really is the last thing you\'re going to find in this anime so just don\'t bother looking for it.Oh yeah before I forget: All three main chicks have an obvious crush on the bimbo protagonist but you probably figured that out by the harem tag already you sneaky smart person you.As for the story:There is none really. No notable development aside from some basic adjustments to the premise like pink haired teacher chick changing her mind from previously against him tutoring to acknowledging him. It\'s basically episodical.Dude tries to teach these so-called geniuses their bad subjects. The rest of the show you can imagine as someone checking off every item on the unofficial list of mishaps, misunderstandings and other generic anime events all of which would\'ve not even being a thing if only one of the involved characters respectively showed the slightest amount of common sense (including the blue haired social""genius"" chick). This is apparently supposed to be funny and entertaining but unless this is your first anime ever you probably have seen this shit like 50 times by now. There is frankly nothing original in the entire series and the implemented and re-used stuff is just badly done.Art: Talking about badly done so is the Art. Animations are poor. Backgrounds are poor. Characters are poor. Not really much to say except that it\'s incredibly poor quality. You can probably produce the show with MS Paint as your only tool and it wouldn\'t be much of a downgrade if at all in regards to the art.Sound: Well probably the best about the series which means that the sound at least isn\'t horrible but also nothing worth of praise. It\'s just a big whatever.Characters: Yeah as already stated above. Just a boring patchwork of generic stereotypes with a disposition towards one or another form of slight to heavy autism and if you\'d take the combined common sense of all characters involved it would amount to around the level of a cow. You can probably take any (not even so much) advanced AI, give it a database of traits and tell it to come up with some characters. Probably wouldn\'t be worse than the characters in this show but at least a couple dozen times more entertaining.Enjoyment: None. It\'s bad and cringe.Overall: See TL/DR at the top: It\'s trash. It\'s bad. It\'s boring. It\'s unoriginal. Nobody ever should be forced to watch this waste of time and ressources.

We just had a similar show called “5-toubun no Hanayome” that aired a few months ago. That show came together as a teenage rom-com with harem content. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai tries to be something on its own but ends up being a fallout of stupidity.On the plus side, I do applaud that the manga has been running as long as it is right now. Too many shounen jump series ends being victims of the dreaded axe yet...this one managed to evade that. Trust me, I do want to see a shounen jump show succeed with romantic elements. The anime offers a 13-episode adaptation although from what’s shown, it’s far from a complete adaptation. For what’s worth, the anime is more of an advertisement of the manga that touches the main story with its cast of characters. But if you are actually expecting your mind to be blown with some masterful storytelling, then I’m afraid I got some bad news.The English title is translated as “We Never Learn” and spells out the story for itself. A straightforward premise like this is the way to go considering we have a set of goofball characters. To get the boring part out of the way, we got 3rd year Nariyuki Yuiga, the hardworking guy with a dense and dull personality. I can’t fandom how such a guy can be so oblivious when it comes to the feelings of certain people but alas, he’s our male protagonist. Not long after, we are introduced to Fumino, Rizu, and Uruka. All of them are talented in certain subjects but needs help in other areas. It shouldn’t take long for viewers to realize that some of these girls have feelings towards Yuiga. Unfortunately, the show loves to dance around the thought of building a relationship between Nariyuki and these girls. What ends up happening is little to no development with a senseless form of romance, if you can even call it that.Now, I do want to mention that We Never Learn’s storytelling feels more like skits with an intention to humor. It seems that every chance it gets, the show pokes fun of the idea of studying and the way characters interact with each other. Even Mafuyu Kirisu (the teacher of Ichinose academy) gets dragged into certain shenanigans despite her more mature personality and older age. Taking a look back at the trio of students though, there’s not really much special about any of them. In fact, they fit under archetype characters that you can find in just about any rom-com shows these days. For instance, Fumino is the sensitive girl with few friends. Rizu is the serious genius type who has trouble interacting with others. And finally, Uraka is the energetic girl who easily makes friends with others. With this character roster, it’s easy to distinguish each one of them but the show itself lacks concrete characterization. Sure, we see a good degree of their character traits and even some background storytelling. However, the show doesn’t make an impact to make these characters truly stand out. Forget Nariyuki. The girls only attracts my attention when they interact with certain circumstances. They never draw more on their own. On the other hand, I do find myself invested in some of the other supporting characters. Name such as Kominami Asumi and Sawako Sekijou managed to capture my attention more than the main cast.On the other hand, I do give praise to making the story entertaining on occasions. School can be a boring setting but the author is able to take advantage of the setting to make humorous drama. It’s one of the perks of being a romantic comedy where the author can stretch their imaginations. For a rom-com harem, I believe the show stands out the best when it seeks to entertain. If the characters were better written, this would have easily stood out as a solid show. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.With a collaboration between studio Silver and Arvo Animation, this pretty much stands out as an average looking show. To be honest, A-1 Pictures would have been my first guess considering the license. Nonetheless, the animation quality lacks impact with its uncharismatic character designs. Nariyuki has a punchable face while the main girls lacks any distinctive features. I will say this though, the anime likes fan service. It’s slightly tamer compared to the manga but in later episodes, it’s more and more fleshed out. Uraka is the big target eye candy for this for her status in the swim team and well-toned body. However, Fumino and the other are vulnerable too. Considering that this is a rom-com, you should expect a lot of shenanigans coming your way. The character expressions also speaks for itself when you see them react in ridiculous manners.Should I be surprised that We Never Learn ended up being no more than a mediocre show? Not really. As a manga reader, I kept my expectations in check. This anime lacks a bold story with a weak cast and borderlined forced comedy. It may draw out a few laughs on occasions but once you realize what you’re in for, there’s really much more to see. If you want to give the manga a shot, then be my guest. Just know that We Never Learn dropped the ball and there’s much better rom-coms out there. this one managed to evade that. Trust me, I do want to see a shounen jump show succeed with romantic elements. The anime offers a 13-episode adaptation although from what’s shown, it’s far from a complete adaptation. For what’s worth, the anime is more of an advertisement of the manga that touches the main story with its cast of characters. But if you are actually expecting your mind to be blown with some masterful storytelling, then I’m afraid I got some bad news.The English title is translated as “We Never Learn” and spells out the story for itself.

While there are worse undertakings, nothing compares to the angst of sacrificing countless hours to pass a meaningless course to attain a worthless degree that grants an aimless job to sustain yourself before you die.  Of course, having aspirations is ideal to avoid a life of poverty, but not all problems are solved with blind ambition.  Sometimes, as it were, you have to smell the roses.  Take pleasure in the little moments, before life passes you by.Therefore, my advice to Nariyuki Yuiga: appreciate the harem you find yourself in, because before you know...it, you’ll be stuck with one broad for the rest of your life.  Nothing wrong with that outcome, per se; nevertheless, when you discover a ‘gold mine,’ you stuff your pockets and grab with both hands.The plot of “Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai” is elementary.  In an effort to secure a college scholarship, Nariyuki tutors two girls — Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi — in the subjects they struggle with, yet wish to pursue in university.  As the story progresses, additional female characters receive Nariyuki’s tutelage, via creative means best suited to their particular interests.  It’s a concept that is ripe for teasing out character nuances, if only that were the focus.  Apparently, the writers seem content with devising new ‘games’ to study, rather than developing the characters themselves.  In exchange for this lapse in judgement, we are left with stock characters that exhibit no changes on the existing paradigms.  They are neither relatable, nor worth your time.Due to the deficiencies in the story and characters, the enjoyment is paltry.  Laughter is sparse to non-existent.  The romance is third-rate, along with being cliched.  And the episodes are a trudge to complete.  Simply put: boring, boring, boring! it, you’ll be stuck with one broad for the rest of your life.

Simply put: boring, boring, boring!', ""When I was young and first was getting into anime the harem genre was one of my favorites. It was a pleasure to watch a lot of cute girls do cute and lewd things, as well as have the excitement of seeing who would win and fighting in waifu wars with friends that had objectively inferior taste (unless they happened to pick actual best girl, and in that case they're fine.)However after watching more and more of these, it became clear that while some were well made and had lots of life to them, there were others that were not well made and ended...up being cheap vehicles for a show that they assumed a horny teenage fandom would eat up, and they did. Often the cast wouldn't be fully developed and were either just archetypes with less more going for them, or where way in the background causing one girl to take the center stage and defeating one of the points of a harem. While many seasonal harems ended up disappointing in these ways, We Never Learn, is a return to the good old days.It doesn't take that much to make a good harem that's a joy to watch. While I do love deep character development and interesting meanings and points that are made in a show, not every show needs to have them, and in particular a good harem isn't defined by having those. In my opinion, the most important parts to a harem are having a varied and likeable cast of girls, and having good fan-service. And Bokuben happens to have both of those.The main cast is a whole lot of fun. They interact with each other and play off of each other and are very clearly friends with each other. They don't exist just for the sake of the male lead but they have goals of their own and friendships outside of the male lead. They have charming personalities that makes it easy to root for them and very easy to like them. And while they don't have a great amount of development they have enough development that they feel like unique characters and not archetypes. Some of the silly things they can get into are a lot of fun and overall it made me happy to watch this show.And it fills it's role as a harem very well. There are three main girls and they all have their own charms that are quite distinct. There's an airhead who is much more emotionally connected to everyone but herself, a brainaic who can't understand others or herself, and a tomboy childhood friend who is pretty hyper and excitable. And while the archetypes are certainly there, they're vibrant enough to outshine them, and feel unique. Each of them gets screen time with the main lead, and each of them have a reasonable claim to him. Unlike many harems in the past it actually does feel up in the air who will win and not just a forgone conclusion that was turned into a harem for some reason. They each have their own dynamic relationship with the lead and it's a lot of fun.Furthermore the show also gives a good deal of fanservice so that we can see the more echiii situations with them and capitalize on their cuteness. And while most of them happen by accident, of course, a staple trope of these harems. The girls are aware enough to not blame him, and if they do blame him it doesn't last longer than 30 seconds. Too many harems like to go off on the blame game for too long which detracts from the show and ruins the vibe they have going. If anything what Bokuben does so well is it allows this vibe to continue throughout the show, and rarely becomes too much of a drag. The art and sound also help with this a lot as the art is pretty high quality and always looks nice. The sound is better jovial and helps accent the more comedic parts of the show. While it may not be impressive on its own it really works in the show.It may not be the most impressive show, but Bokuben is a good solid harem, and I very much enjoyed watching it.

All this nonsense works as a preparation for the future action now that the second season is announced in the last episode with the simple words ""tsuzuku"" (続くor つづく).Maybe I shouldn\'t be praising this series, but the season was too average, and I couldn\'t find an acceptable series. Although Bokutachi wa...Benkyou ga Dekinai is an unexpected finding with small but potent pleasures that can hook an avid anime enthusiast like you. This silly show has a lot of similarities with “5-toubun no Hanayome” to the point that it could be a copy. The question is: who copied whom?On the other hand, the plot is delightful because it does not follow the typical harem settings. In this series a guy, Nariyuki Yuiga needs to teach a group of girls that are considered geniuses in some fields and stupid in some other areas of knowledge. However, ironical as it may seem, these ""geniuses"" want to study a career where their abilities are useless. This setting leads to a series of silly events where we can enjoy the differences between each character, their feelings, and we could smile on the stupid jokes. Sadly, after some episodes, the series can give the impression that something is missing and perhaps you could end dropping it because it is tedious or lacks romance and the storytelling is average. Nonetheless, this first season only works as an introduction that shows the main characters and paves the path for the future season, where I do hope to see relevant plot twists, romance, and new jokes.The characters are acceptable, they have a big contrast. From my perspective, Yuiga, the ordinary guy, good at studying, poor, hard worker, is a neutral character that understands the girls\' decisions but lacks any romance comprehension.  This romantic aspect can be complemented with Fumino, who acts like the cupid of the story. I can explain this behavior because she is a literary genius, so her way to understand the human emotions is by far more different than Yuiga and the other girls such us Rizu or Takemoto. On the other hand, as silly as it looks, Rizu is the typical genius stereotype. However, she is a hard worker, and she cannot understand her feelings. And talking about feelings, the story introduces Takemoto, the athlete, full of energy and finds herself in a never-ending dilemma (cliche?).The other characters, Mafuyu, the silly teacher and Asumi, the sempai, are a healthy complement to the plot because they refresh the story when the author needs to change some repetitive jokes.The characters design is acceptable. Even if for some persons it looks weird, I want to say it is consistent. The animation follows the graphics from the manga and tries to keep closer to them. Asking more from this kind of design could be wrong.Mostly, the show is entertaining: For Yuiga to teach these girls, and for the girls to understand their feelings and to experience romance. Together, create an acceptable comedy that is just beginning. Benkyou ga Dekinai is an unexpected finding with small but potent pleasures that can hook an avid anime enthusiast like you.

Its fine to look at, and romantic antics ensue with the harem roster slowly filling out.Filling the role of harem manga in shonen jump after nisekoi ended, We never learns plot seems like more than a harem, but it isn't. Main protag helping out girls of different natures. small boob smart rich girl, big boob short restaurant girl, and athletic childhood friend. (also senseii and loli doctor girl). Romcom ensues.Except there is no comedy. The...jokes are bland and overused. And even if they had a chance of cracking a chuckle, it's ruined by the god awful pacing. This show is slow. Obviously they are adapting 3 chapters an episode. The manga is a quick read with stellar panel flow so you can fly through everything. If a joke doesn't hit, your already on the next page. Problem with the anime is it needs to stay grounded. They adapted it like a standard romance show, so the comedy can't be as bouncy as something like konosuba.There is no animation. Which is fine if my Brain had anything else to do. Absorbing new plot details, Pondering the dialogue, or taking in the artwork. But its just standard talking with standard art with no animation.Truly dull and hard to sit throughconclusion : this is spring seasons generic harem. even the shitty isekai kenja no mago has better romance than this. If you like the story, read the manga. There is no value of this adaption besides getting more people invested in the source material.4/10 only because there's worse this season jokes are bland and overused.

Why can't we as a community just enjoy the shows that are given to us, anime, in the end, is a way to escape or find enjoyment. Yes, this series is basically Go-toubun but with no sisters as the harem but that doesn't matter. What matters is that it is an enjoyable show to watch and I find it interesting. Just seeing so many low reviews makes me laugh, who are you to say a show is low...just because it is stereotypical but then agian it is also not my place to judge peoples opinion. So if you watch it and don't like that's fine but my personal recommendation is to give this a chance because I did and don't regret a single second of it. After watching the 5th episode I binge read the manga it quickly became one of my favorite stories since Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai. tldr people are entitled to their own opinion but give this a chance you might be surprised idk why I did tldr this review isn't even that long idk how yall write that much on a series lol. Hope everyone has a good day if you read this :) pceUPDATE :I find it hella funny that people can get a review of an anime after only seeing like 4eps lol, read update on manga or wait till anime ends then give it a 4 rating :) just sayin just because it is stereotypical but then agian it is also not my place to judge peoples opinion.

First thing that comes to my mind is about something that doesn't purpose absolutely nothing new, something built in a controlled space without any risk involved, something constructed with a formula; some people have no problem with this while it be entertaining enough, others simply doesn't like it and prefer to don't give it their time, the most famous example is the MCU: everyone knows that most of its movies follow the...same formula, in despite of this fact, these movies tend to be in the top of the box office rankings, which demonstrates that it has a certain grade of appreciation from the public, but in the other side, there are people who got tired of the same formula repeated once and once again, getting them fatigued of this tool, till the point of provoking the hate from some of which in the past where the fans of the franchise. I mention this because it can be applied to the harem genre, it has its public which hopes every season for the new show from this genre, but it also has a huge amount of people who are tired of one of the most formulaic genres: takes place in school, there's a childhood friend, there's a tsundere, there's a kuudere, the male protagonist is too insecure and socially awkward, its ending is as ambiguous as posible in hopes of a second season that probably will never come, and a long etcetera.For me, being generic isn't necesarily equal to being bad, it is possible to follow a formula and finish with a good product anyway, and I think this series is an example of it; there are some which states that it's generic, and they aren't wrong, but that doesn't mean it's bad, it follows the rules that the formula it uses has stablished and doesn't make something we haven't seen before, but it still manages to give us an interesting series.The story turns around Nariyuki Yuiga, an average school student who dreams with joining a good university, but he hasn't a good economic situation, which obstructs his dream; when the director of the school offers him a recomendation letter in exchange of being the tutor of two other students he accepts, but he's hugely surprised at the moment of knowing their names, Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi, the two famous geniuses of the school: Rizu is extremely skilled with maths and science while Fumino is with literature, but the problem is that they're trying to better in the other's subject and joining an university specialized in those areas; Nariyuki's work is make them better in those areas, but soon he'll learn that in despite of their position as geniuses, this won't be easy, and things only will get more complicated as they become closer and other girls appears in his world.If that premise sounds familiar is because it's very common, as it serves as a believable excuse for surrounding the male lead with their female partners, but it actually works, it's believable and well structured, one detail that proves it is the fact that he isn't their first tutor, there have been some before him which finished stopping at one point. From the moment he accepts to be the tutor of Riza and Fumino the plot follows a path that we could expect from a harem: the protagonists are confused about certain things, they stablish a plan, the plan doesn't work and things become harder, they stablish another plan, in the process they share some significant moments, the third girl appears, the blushes begin and the compromising situations appear, they become even closer...That's the path this and practically every harem show follow, but here we have some interesting things: the story is pretty basic, it musn't have a theme and if it have it, it must be really subtle (I don't know, effort maybe?), but it's plot is well writen, it works and keep things going further, it follows the 'harem' formula but uses it in a correct way, even sometimes try to be creative; as most harem shows, it's ligth-hearted and focused in a comic tone, the comedy also follow the formula with its compromising situations, but doesn't abuse of it and these are well justified and funny, at least for me, furthermore, there are some pretty smart jokes, with good construction and timing; it's fanservice could perfectly not exist but at least it isn't obstructuve, and sometimes is used as a nice excuse for some good jokes.When we talk about characters we talk about the strongest point of the series, they follow archetypes of the harem genre and anime in general, but works with it in a functional way and leaves space to develop them, not too much, but at least there's development, each one of them is well defined, they have strengths, they have debilities, they have goals and dreams that defines their actions, some receive a better treatment than others, but they all are interesting and lovable; for example, their motivations: all are understandable but some are more relatable because they're more specific, the best example is Fumino vs Rizu, Fumino's motivation to study sciences is her deceased mother and how through the stars she thinks she can stablish a conection with her, childish and inmature, like her, but completely reasonable and even touching, while Rizu's motivation is much more ambiguous, she wants to study literature for comprehend better the people around her and their behaviors, still strong but less powerful than Fumino's one.Nariyuki seems to be your normal harem protagonist, insecure and socially awkward, but he doesn't follow that rule excessively as other harem protagonists, he has this characteristics in a non-annoying level, along with others which help to define him better, for example he's smart, pretty smart, enough for realisticaly dreaming about joining a good univeristy, he's also direct, although he's a bit shy, he won't stop when he considers necessary to say something, sometimes cruel, sometimes dumb, sometimes correct, no matter, he will say it. Another character that follow an archetype is Rizu, she's a kuudere and fulfil the most common characteristics of this archetype: she's smart, she's quiet, she's short, she has short hair, she uses glasses (I mean, if she would be flat she would be a redhead version of Yuki from SHnY), you got the idea; she follow strongly her archetype but it works because her interactions with others are organic and show some minor details that give her a bit more of depth. Fumino doesn't seem to strictly follow an archetype, the closest one would be the moe, because she's sweet and moe means (in a summarized version) adorable; as I mentioned before, she's childish and inmature, she doesn't seem to have a real notion about her actions, she's very relaxed and she's a bit clumsy, but she has a strong determination and she's pretty sincere. Uraka Takamoto is the third girl in order of appearance, she's energic, she's strong, she's highly skilled physically, she has an easiness in sports, she's spontaneous and she's very determined, but she's pretty dumb and extremely shy when we talk about love; for instance, she's the childhood friend of the show, but the twist is that Uraka isn't Nariyuki's childhood friend, Nariyuki is Uraka's childhood friend, and her shyness hadn't let her confess her feelings after an unknown number of years, and even if she see an oportunity for expressing their feeling or making an advance in her relation with Nariyuki, she will finish letting it go for her insecurity. There isn't too much supporting characters with actual relevance, but till I understand there are two girls left, one would be one of the anterior tutors of Rizu and Fumino, and the other I don't really know where will come from (I'm an anime only viewer); one thing that I found interesting is that there are two characters that could fit with the tsundere archetype, but none of them belong to the main cast, which is really surprising, one is Mizuki, Nariyuki's sister, and the other is Sawaka Sekijo, the Science Club's President.In the technical side, the animation comes from Silver and Arvo Animation, two studios from which apparently no one heard before; their job is good, the character design is attractive, I specially like the art in the eyes, simple but very good, the color palette is soft and borderlines the pastel color often but it doesn't stand out to be fair, where the animation shines is in the facial expressions and the reactions of the characters, you know, this kind of face: (o_o), it uses this style that everyone in the community knows but also goes further with more detailed frames and a wider group of reactions, especially with Nariyuki; the work of the seiyuus is very good and gives much spirit to the characters, the music is good but is pretty limited to work for the scene, to complement the other elements and never really stands out, anyway, it's beatiful sometimes, the opening is the typical harem opening with a 'feel good' mood, the ending follows the same path, they may be catchy but dubiously memorable, although being fair the artstyle in both is pretty good.As you've seen (or read I should say), this series has potencial to go further, but surely it won't, who knows?, maybe it finish focusing on the characters and its development, or maybe not; anyway, actually this is a good show and it's pretty entertaining and funny, even if it can be fairly called generic, I would love it to go further, but I'm happpy with what I've got in this 4 episodes. same formula, in despite of this fact, these movies tend to be in the top of the box office rankings, which demonstrates that it has a certain grade of appreciation from the public, but in the other side, there are people who got tired of the same formula repeated once and once again, getting them fatigued of this tool, till the point of provoking the hate from some of which in the past where the fans of the franchise.

And I watched a lot of those. Part of its strength is that it wasn’t carried by single strong point, but rather was solid all around:The most important part of harem are, obviously, waifus. It’s pretty normal to have one main girls and “fodder” that is meant to lose. Or even if that’s not the case, harems rarely offer more than 1 or 2 interesting picks. BokuBen wins at both of those. Not only all girls get more or less equal development and chances to win, they also all...have top tier waifu potential. Yes, to my surprise, every single of them is great, to the point that I can’t decide which one I’d call “best girl” or pick myself. On top of it, Yuiga himself is not a bad character too.Being a rom-com, this anime doesn’t offer much in terms of story. At the same time it’s still executed nicely. All the comedic moments, developments, fanservice etc scenes are rather reasonable and don’t feel forced. Pacing is good and comedy level above average. What more could I ask for?What really helps with everything else is art. It’s awesome. No, it’s not some crazy quality, high budget stuff. On that front it’s rather average. What makes it special is style that fits sooo well with the characters and lighthearted atmosphere of story. The way girls are drawn is both cute and pretty and their emotions are shown in really captivating way.Overall it is, as I said, very solid harem.

The setting here is that our protagonist Nariyuki is great in academics. However, he is not going good financially and needed to get a VIP scholarship from his school. To his delight, the School Principal decided to give the VIP scholarship ti Nariyuki with a condition, Nariyuki must tutor two of his classmates. Rizu Ogata is a genius at science but struggles at literature. Fumino Furuhashi is the opposite, excelling in literature but is horrible at science.In the beginning, this anime tackles the reason Rizu and Fumino try to enter a major opposite to...their talent. It is touching to see the reasons and how Nariyuki empathizes with it. We also get a third character, Uruka Takemoto. She is amazing at swimming but bad in academics. While all of this is great, it is a shame because it doesn't last throughout the anime.About halfway through, a pattern becomes clear to be seen. Nariyuki and everyone else gets put in a situation, which may or may not be related to their studies. These situations are used to show the series' true colours, Fanservice. All the plot that have been introduced are just a setting, it tries its best to protect the status quo as the show focuses on getting more fanservice to the screen. It becomes clear that as the harem's being formed, the original focus is thrown away.The true colours of this anime extend to the whole cast. This includes Fumino, Rizu, Uruka, and their teacher, Mafuyu Kirisu. Late in the show, another character gets introduced, Kominami Asumi. She is older than Nariyuki and failed to pass the college entrance exam last year. Her introduction is actually a refreshing breeze for the anime, as it starts to get stale with its pattern.So should you watch this anime? It depends. If you're hoping the anime explores more on the characters and how they are pursuing subjects they are struggling with, go look elsewhere. In the other hand, if you're looking for a light-hearted school romantic comedy with minimal plot progression and some fanservice, this is a good anime to watch.

I guess Japan has noshortages of talented artists! Great show, high recommend."", 'The easiest comparison I can make for this show is either a soap opera where drama WANTS to happen but doesn\'t, or your typical harem with a gimmick setup in order to get things off the ground.\xa0 Well, there\'re worse ways to start your story I suppose.Story:Nariyuki Yuiga is an average high school student whose highest selling point is being a jack of all grades in school, doing well in all subjects but not really excelling.\xa0 One day he\'s informed by his school\'s headmaster that he\'ll be able to get the school\'s VIP recommendation for college on one condition: he must tutor the school\'s most...valuable honor students Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in their worst subjects to a similarly proficient level.The show\'s translation title of \'We Can\'t Study\' is really only partially true to the setup of the series\'s story.\xa0 Taking roughly two chapters of the manga per episode, the story can largely be explained as a romcom school series where studying primarily serves as the series\'s backdrop than its main focus.\xa0 There\'s definitely progress with how the girls\' grades improve as the series goes on due to the numerous amount of study scenes we see in the series, but this isn\'t really what the series wants to be even though it really should make academics its main focus.A typical episode setup involves the main cast spending time studying in some manor before the situation spirals out of control through random acts of god in order to further Nariyuki\'s relationship with two females that progressively increases to five by the end of the series.\xa0 Sometimes it improves the girls\' proficiency in studying, sometimes not.Depending on who Nariyuki is interacting with dictates the direction of the episode, which either creates a massive air of awkward dialogue where no party knows what to say, or completely coincidental encounters that were handcrafted by the twisted machinations of a higher power.\xa0 Because of this, episodes can feel largely disconnected from each other because the narrative relies so heavily on the \'status quo\' of the characters\' relationships that it feels like filler with millimeters of progress for characters too nervous to just spit out what\'s on their minds.\xa0 As such, the pacing for progress feels very stop and go with a rare episode having some large changes while the next four or something episodes either have nothing of note happen afterwards or features the awkward fallout.Characters:Yuiga Nariyuki is a bingo card of harem protagonist traits and tropes.\xa0 Dense?\xa0 Check.\xa0 Lucky pervert situations?\xa0 Yup.\xa0 Nice to everyone, apologizes profusely, and doesn\'t know how to handle women?\xa0 Fuck, we got a winner here folks!\xa0 Yuiga\'s character is less of a protagonist or character, and more of the starting gun to whatever shenanigans is destined to happen.\xa0 He constantly studies but usually gets flustered by either a passing comment said by a member of the female cast, or notices something about them (like being close or seeing that they\'re weirdly pretty today).\xa0 He consistently does this and it\'s not very exciting to see his character amount to what we see even though it\'s possible to create an actually fun harem protagonist.\xa0 We get vague inklings about his past and how he became obsessed with studying, but it doesn\'t come to light enough to matter.Ogata Rizu, Takemoto Uruka, Kirisu Mafuyu, and Kominami Asumi are the \'harem\' members of the female cast who largely serve the ""studying into perverted/funny/romantic"" moment that makes up the basis of this series.\xa0 Each of them have a very different dynamic with Yuiga to the point that the show devotes entire episodes to his interactions with each of them as a way to give each of them a moment in the spotlight.\xa0 (Budding interest, First love, Teacher & Student, and Senpai and Kohai respectively.)\xa0 They\'re also the show\'s way of raising \'flags\'/add character traits to the girls as Yuiga, through usually comedic means, accidentally finds out more about them and either gets them or someone associated to them to spill the beans on their motive for doing better.\xa0 While the content\'s different, the setup and payoff usually follows the same formula and I\'m not really interested when a lot of the dialogue in the interaction has the protagonist stutter.\xa0 A lot.\xa0 Give me characterization sure, but please spit some words out, man.Then there\'s Fumino Furuhashi.\xa0 Usually I talk about harem girls as a collective ""collect them all"" kind of deal, but I\'m giving her her own section cause this one\'s special.\xa0 While Furuhashi does share most of the girls\' motives at getting better at school, her role is being practically the only person with common sense and can read the room.\xa0 Without her, the show would be dead in its tracks because she\'s the only one who knows the shit that goes on around Yuiga and is the one who makes him confront the holes he\'s dug for himself.\xa0 She\'s an extremely refreshing character in a show like this because her motives aren\'t (mostly) based on any attraction towards the protagonist and really helps get the story going once it hits its many, many awkward roadblocks.\xa0 I actively cheer any time she\'s on-screen because she always manages to get the ball rolling whether or not she\'s the main focus of the scene.There aren\'t really many side characters to note of, and most of them are character-based, pertaining to their one relationship with a specific character (since each girl basically has their own support team...) and as such aren\'t really important to the story unless it\'s for a gag or when the show thinks not enough wrenches have been thrown into the current scene.\xa0 I\'m actually more pissed that most of the girls have at least one or two members of the cast dedicated to pushing them to pursue a romance with Nariyuki.\xa0 It\'s as if the girls don\'t have enough agency themselves to express their feelings or something.Aesthetics:Produced by a collaboration between Silver and Arvo Animation, the art for Bokutachi feels extremely bland to me.\xa0 Art-wise, the show relies heavily on a lot of really saturated and bright colors which are not only somewhat blinding, but is also a style that doesn\'t have a lot of depth to it.\xa0 This is mostly apparent with how exceedingly brightly colored each girls\' hair is, which even looks unnatural by the standards of a medium with this as a mainstay feature.\xa0 There\'s also a surprising amount of fanservice which is only made worse when breast size jokes are a mainstay due to Furuhashi carrying a vastly smaller cup size compared to the rest of the female cast.There\'s also not a lot of animation in the show\'s typical animation, reserving most of that for quick, sped up frames during the show\'s many, many comedic moments where the character\'s models squish and chibify themselves to express their current emotion.\xa0 There\'s also a constant use of tiny heads that pop up on the screen with one or two clear traits associated to each head to make sure you know which girl it is, which suspiciously reminds me of another series.\xa0 Hmm...\xa0 Since comedy\'s a mainstay of the series, this is where the series sits at for a greater minority of its runtime, so expect to see a lot of this when watching.""Seishun Seminar"" and ""Never Give It Up!!"" by the convenient artist name of \'Study\' are a pair of OP and ED tracks that aren\'t really all that interesting.\xa0 Super poppy songs that invoke the casual, school comedy setting aren\'t really my cup of tea, and aren\'t really the kind of songs are all that memorable.\xa0 They serve their purpose, but personally I think are songs worth skipping.Personal Enjoyment:When I first started reading the manga, I said to myself, ""Wow, this reminds me of Nisekoi, and not in the good way"".\xa0 The characters seemed to share a similar style, the setup to the story seemed to be largely forgotten for the sake of adding more slice of life moments with individual members of the female cast, and there were even tiny heads on the side of the screen/panels with one striking detail.\xa0 After a bit of digging, I found out that the series\'s author, Tsutsui Taishi, was responsible for the mahou shoujo Nisekoi spin-off, which leads to believe that he must\'ve also been an assistant for Nisekoi at some point prior.\xa0 So why the lengthy research report?\xa0 Well because Bokutachi is basically the middle hundred chapter section of Nisekoi where it\'s just the character faffing about instead of figuring out who\'s the right girl with the key.I don\'t really have much that can be said about my thoughts about the series that hasn\'t been said prior.\xa0 Episodes can either feel like there\'s story progress, or a massive slog with only a millimeter of progress to make it seem like it was ultimately worth it even though the show\'s just gonna return back to its status quo.\xa0 It\'s a frustrating cycle that can go largely unnoticed because the show is built around making these near pointless situations as comical as they can be for the sake of entertainment.\xa0 I just find it difficult to enjoy something when the characters\' default reaction to everything is acting flustered because Kami-sama decided to play a prank again on Yuiga that day.\xa0 Furuhashi is undoubtedly my favorite part of the series because she mostly manages to skirt around these issues with her sheer presence by pushing both Yuiga and the show in the right direction, and I shudder to think what the story would be like without her.Because of this, I find it hard to really recommend this show to many people.\xa0 Maybe to Nisekoi fans, because it\'s basically the same schtick where you fall into a camp and cheer for that particular girl to get the largely uninteresting protagonist trophy with a few interesting traits.\xa0 But beyond that I think the show is trashy entertainment at best.\xa0 Maybe season two will spend time on the girls\' arcs and explain the trials, tribulations, and reasons why the series\' females want to take the direction contrary to what they\'re best in in academics, but for right now, the show\'s a typical harem with only one character trying to push it in the right direction.\xa0 Godspeed, Fumino.\xa0 Godspeed. valuable honor students Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in their worst subjects to a similarly proficient level.The show\'s translation title of \'We Can\'t Study\' is really only partially true to the setup of the series\'s story.\xa0 Taking roughly two chapters of the manga per episode, the story can largely be explained as a romcom school series where studying primarily serves as the series\'s backdrop than its main focus.\xa0 There\'s definitely progress with how the girls\' grades improve as the series goes on due to the numerous amount of study scenes we see in the series, but this isn\'t really what the series wants to be even though it really should make academics its main focus.A typical episode setup involves the main cast spending time studying in some manor before the situation spirals out of control through random acts of god in order to further Nariyuki\'s relationship with two females that progressively increases to five by the end of the series.\xa0 Sometimes it improves the girls\' proficiency in studying, sometimes not.Depending on who Nariyuki is interacting with dictates the direction of the episode, which either creates a massive air of awkward dialogue where no party knows what to say, or completely coincidental encounters that were handcrafted by the twisted machinations of a higher power.\xa0 Because of this, episodes can feel largely disconnected from each other because the narrative relies so heavily on the \'status quo\' of the characters\' relationships that it feels like filler with millimeters of progress for characters too nervous to just spit out what\'s on their minds.\xa0 As such, the pacing for progress feels very stop and go with a rare episode having some large changes while the next four or something episodes either have nothing of note happen afterwards or features the awkward fallout.Characters:Yuiga Nariyuki is a bingo card of harem protagonist traits and tropes.\xa0 Dense?\xa0 Check.\xa0 Lucky pervert situations?\xa0 Yup.\xa0 Nice to everyone, apologizes profusely, and doesn\'t know how to handle women?\xa0 Fuck, we got a winner here folks!\xa0 Yuiga\'s character is less of a protagonist or character, and more of the starting gun to whatever shenanigans is destined to happen.\xa0 He constantly studies but usually gets flustered by either a passing comment said by a member of the female cast, or notices something about them (like being close or seeing that they\'re weirdly pretty today).\xa0 He consistently does this and it\'s not very exciting to see his character amount to what we see even though it\'s possible to create an actually fun harem protagonist.\xa0 We get vague inklings about his past and how he became obsessed with studying, but it doesn\'t come to light enough to matter.Ogata Rizu, Takemoto Uruka, Kirisu Mafuyu, and Kominami Asumi are the \'harem\' members of the female cast who largely serve the ""studying into perverted/funny/romantic"" moment that makes up the basis of this series.\xa0 Each of them have a very different dynamic with Yuiga to the point that the show devotes entire episodes to his interactions with each of them as a way to give each of them a moment in the spotlight.\xa0 (Budding interest, First love, Teacher & Student, and Senpai and Kohai respectively.)\xa0 They\'re also the show\'s way of raising \'flags\'/add character traits to the girls as Yuiga, through usually comedic means, accidentally finds out more about them and either gets them or someone associated to them to spill the beans on their motive for doing better.\xa0 While the content\'s different, the setup and payoff usually follows the same formula and I\'m not really interested when a lot of the dialogue in the interaction has the protagonist stutter.\xa0 A lot.\xa0 Give me characterization sure, but please spit some words out, man.Then there\'s Fumino Furuhashi.\xa0 Usually I talk about harem girls as a collective ""collect them all"" kind of deal, but I\'m giving her her own section cause this one\'s special.\xa0 While Furuhashi does share most of the girls\' motives at getting better at school, her role is being practically the only person with common sense and can read the room.\xa0 Without her, the show would be dead in its tracks because she\'s the only one who knows the shit that goes on around Yuiga and is the one who makes him confront the holes he\'s dug for himself.\xa0 She\'s an extremely refreshing character in a show like this because her motives aren\'t (mostly) based on any attraction towards the protagonist and really helps get the story going once it hits its many, many awkward roadblocks.\xa0 I actively cheer any time she\'s on-screen because she always manages to get the ball rolling whether or not she\'s the main focus of the scene.There aren\'t really many side characters to note of, and most of them are character-based, pertaining to their one relationship with a specific character (since each girl basically has their own support team...) and as such aren\'t really important to the story unless it\'s for a gag or when the show thinks not enough wrenches have been thrown into the current scene.\xa0 I\'m actually more pissed that most of the girls have at least one or two members of the cast dedicated to pushing them to pursue a romance with Nariyuki.\xa0 It\'s as if the girls don\'t have enough agency themselves to express their feelings or something.Aesthetics:Produced by a collaboration between Silver and Arvo Animation, the art for Bokutachi feels extremely bland to me.\xa0 Art-wise, the show relies heavily on a lot of really saturated and bright colors which are not only somewhat blinding, but is also a style that doesn\'t have a lot of depth to it.\xa0 This is mostly apparent with how exceedingly brightly colored each girls\' hair is, which even looks unnatural by the standards of a medium with this as a mainstay feature.\xa0 There\'s also a surprising amount of fanservice which is only made worse when breast size jokes are a mainstay due to Furuhashi carrying a vastly smaller cup size compared to the rest of the female cast.There\'s also not a lot of animation in the show\'s typical animation, reserving most of that for quick, sped up frames during the show\'s many, many comedic moments where the character\'s models squish and chibify themselves to express their current emotion.\xa0 There\'s also a constant use of tiny heads that pop up on the screen with one or two clear traits associated to each head to make sure you know which girl it is, which suspiciously reminds me of another series.\xa0 Hmm...\xa0 Since comedy\'s a mainstay of the series, this is where the series sits at for a greater minority of its runtime, so expect to see a lot of this when watching.""Seishun Seminar"" and ""Never Give It Up!!"" by the convenient artist name of \'Study\' are a pair of OP and ED tracks that aren\'t really all that interesting.\xa0 Super poppy songs that invoke the casual, school comedy setting aren\'t really my cup of tea, and aren\'t really the kind of songs are all that memorable.\xa0 They serve their purpose, but personally I think are songs worth skipping.Personal Enjoyment:When I first started reading the manga, I said to myself, ""Wow, this reminds me of Nisekoi, and not in the good way"".\xa0 The characters seemed to share a similar style, the setup to the story seemed to be largely forgotten for the sake of adding more slice of life moments with individual members of the female cast, and there were even tiny heads on the side of the screen/panels with one striking detail.\xa0 After a bit of digging, I found out that the series\'s author, Tsutsui Taishi, was responsible for the mahou shoujo Nisekoi spin-off, which leads to believe that he must\'ve also been an assistant for Nisekoi at some point prior.\xa0 So why the lengthy research report?\xa0 Well because Bokutachi is basically the middle hundred chapter section of Nisekoi where it\'s just the character faffing about instead of figuring out who\'s the right girl with the key.I don\'t really have much that can be said about my thoughts about the series that hasn\'t been said prior.\xa0 Episodes can either feel like there\'s story progress, or a massive slog with only a millimeter of progress to make it seem like it was ultimately worth it even though the show\'s just gonna return back to its status quo.\xa0 It\'s a frustrating cycle that can go largely unnoticed because the show is built around making these near pointless situations as comical as they can be for the sake of entertainment.\xa0 I just find it difficult to enjoy something when the characters\' default reaction to everything is acting flustered because Kami-sama decided to play a prank again on Yuiga that day.\xa0 Furuhashi is undoubtedly my favorite part of the series because she mostly manages to skirt around these issues with her sheer presence by pushing both Yuiga and the show in the right direction, and I shudder to think what the story would be like without her.Because of this, I find it hard to really recommend this show to many people.\xa0 Maybe to Nisekoi fans, because it\'s basically the same schtick where you fall into a camp and cheer for that particular girl to get the largely uninteresting protagonist trophy with a few interesting traits.\xa0 But beyond that I think the show is trashy entertainment at best.\xa0 Maybe season two will spend time on the girls\' arcs and explain the trials, tribulations, and reasons why the series\' females want to take the direction contrary to what they\'re best in in academics, but for right now, the show\'s a typical harem with only one character trying to push it in the right direction.\xa0 Godspeed, Fumino.\xa0 Godspeed.', 'Riding on the exploding success that is Negi Haruba\'s manga and Tezuka Productions\' anime adaptation of The Quintessential Quintuplets, this series is more of less the same, except with one caveat: it managed to pull out a pentuplet (with a teacher and a senior graduated student)! Such ingenuity and admiration that it managed more than just the usual harem rom-com that\'s plastered all over the place. And just like said series, Season 2 is coming soon too (Fall 2019), so for fans, the excitement isn\'t over yet! Just...for now.Based on Taishi Tsutsui\'s manga of the same name, We Never Learn: BokuBen is about a young...and uprising scholar by the name of Yuiga Nariyuki, whom despite his poor performance, is desperately trying to earn the prestigious VIP recommendation to fix his future\'s studying financial problems and give his home some peace of mind. Problem is, in order to achieve that status, he has to tutor students who are high-flying achievers in their own study and craft, yet are complete failures when it comes to achieving their passions. Just like Fuutarou Useugi, he takes up the challenge from the school\'s principal (who offered him the recommendation in the first place).The waifu contestants are:- Fumino Furuhashi, excellent in Mathematics, but fails spectacularly at literature, and one that is secretly (and unconsciously) pushing her way to Yuiga\'s heart, and the closest yet.- Rizu Ogata, excellent in Literature, but fails spectacularly at Mathematics, her decent-sized ""weapons"" helping a bit, but not much. The weakest of the trio.- Uraka Takemoto, excellent in sports (swimming to be exact), but just like the 2 waifus, extremely poor grades, and her massive boobs give Nariyuki the sense of incoming danger. But as a childhood friend, she exhibits the same tropes of confessions and whatnot.- Senior (ronin) Asumi Kominami, working part-time in order to pay for her school fees (without the knowledge of her parents), and just like the trio, working and studying hard through justification that Yuiga (seen as the ""boyfriend"") help her get her groove together.- Kirisu Mafuyu-sensei, Furuhashi and Ogata\'s former cold-hearted tutor, but yet is a very, very messy and clumsy person when all her teachings are stripped away, and unfortunately for her, being exposed to Yuiga meant that her facade is gone.All waifus, in the course of the series, try their best to get tutored by the self-proclaimed work-in-progress ""protagonist"", not knowing that more than just the effects of studying hard for their own sake, the usual harem rom-com that\'s reminiscent of Nisekoi (but lesser to a degree) shows indefinitely, allowing for some random moments of affection between Nariyuki and the various waifus, in their own shine and glamour.And I\'m sure that many of us have been complaining about how the rom-com was really sub-par and sometimes didn\'t help that one waifu was anchoring all this while unconsciously being the CLOSEST to him (if you have watched the anime, you can easily guess who). But all in all, while this aspect didn\'t resonate with many who have seen the tropey formula a million times over, it was certainly a breath of fresh air somehow.So, before the start of the series, even if you have never cared about this aspect, I feel like it is worth mentioning: the co-studio collaboration of low-profile key animations - veteran Studio Silver (founded in February 2001) and newly-founded Arvo Animation (founded in July 2017). Considering that this is the first time both studios are doing a major production work, I felt that it was done well. Not the greatest, but certainly not Hoods Entertainment-level bad. Even though their works are outsourced (like just about every anime), my first impressions are closer to the levels of high-tier Silver Link and low-tier Brain\'s Base. Artwork was inconsistent and rough at best, but at some points did it manage to pull out nicely. Same goes with the animation, stiff and unconceiving, but when compared to the original manga source, it fits, and that\'s all that matters.On the musicality side,  the OST is somewhat lacking, but for all intensive purposes, it did its job adding (mostly) into the comedic moments, and tying into the anime gives it a rather generic extent that has both hits and misses. As for the OP and ED (by Furuhashi, Ogata and Takemoto), they are decent-sounding, fit into the themes nicely which gives the overall series a non-serious, laidback feel. Or maybe it\'s my senses telling me wrong that it\'s good.Whatever the case, love it of hate it, BokuBen is defintely one of the hidden gems of the lackluster Spring season, a worthy 13-episode series that shows how even minor companies can pull off a major work, even with the backing of director Yoshiaki Iwasaki, of works like Last Period, Love Hina and Zero no Tsukaima (1st and last seasons).Regardless of how this series turned out in its full-on generic-ness, this was quite the watch that turned out fine. Here\'s hoping Season 2 (announced just the day before this review) will be more of the same, and the confirmation of one of the waifus being Yuiga\'s partner (or it could turn out to be like the last moments of The Quintesstial Quintuplets on who Fuutarou married which Nakano). and uprising scholar by the name of Yuiga Nariyuki, whom despite his poor performance, is desperately trying to earn the prestigious VIP recommendation to fix his future\'s studying financial problems and give his home some peace of mind.

In Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai\'s case is how greatly balanced the harem it is (well LA anyways) due to how it was extremely hard to pick ""best girl"" and through this allows the harem to be...greatly developed in the sense of their romantic endevours to the main protagonist.Nariyuki Yuiga voiced by Ryota Osaka is one of those harem protagonist who is pretty much the nice guy, slightly dense in the sense but has a strong sense of helping anyone in trouble or in this case, helping the girls going to their college of choice. The main strength of Nariyuki is the mere fact that though he goes through MANY harem hijinks, how he handles it subverts from the cliches (and sometimes thanks to certain harem members) of it. His kind-hearted nature is more in the case of his father telling him that useless people CAN be useful and Nariyuki is dutiful in both studying AND teaching as a result. Nariyuki MAY seem the typical cliche harem dense male protagonist but he quickly does get a personality of his own that nicely gives his harem great chemistry with him...The harem really does make this harem anime all worth it, be it through their interactions with each other and/or with Nariyuki. Starting from Rizu Ogata voiced by Miyu Tomita who LA can personally relate to the most in terms of her personality, but her wanting to pursue literature arts but is the genius in mathematics (another relation for LA, maths not the genius part), LA especially LOVES her pouting comical facial reactions and her reactions was funny. In relation to Nariyuki, she\'s one of the firsts to interact and develop feelings for Nariyuki and how she doesn\'t know how to know her feelings for Nariyuki and as a result confines in Fumino Furuhashi voiced by Haruka Shiraishi. Fumino is the other of the harem to first interact with Nariyuki at the start of the anime, being a literary genius but utterly sucks at maths. Although her gets latter development in the latter half of the anime and though she helps the other girls with their feelings towards Nariyuki, she\'s something of a confident towards Nariyuki and teacher in romance to him and as a result she also starts falling for Nariyuki but with her friendship with the rest of the harem as well as her genre savviness makes her interesting in her position in the harem. Uruka Takemoto voiced by Sayumi Suzushiro is Nariyuki\'s childhood friend and the genius athlete, yet she sucks in English. Her deal is pretty much the childhood friend who can\'t spit it out to Nariyuki but is confides in Fumino in helping her, she becomes regulated to Ms. Fanservice of the harem while keeping her childhood friend status and is pretty much ""twice shy"" towards Nariyuki though she has her moments even with all these elements in.Mafuyu Kirisu voiced by Lynn is a teacher in the harem\'s school and was Rizu and Fumino\'s former tutor, having an outlook in having Fumino and Rizu to take the college where their academic strengths are in, she is at first quite the obstacle for Nariyuki as a result but latter on she becomes a part of the harem as we learn more about her daily life and more of her personality as to her beliefs of pursuing academics. Nariyuki essentially becomes her confidant as he becomes known to her secrets while still keeping their teacher-student relationship at a safe distance. To say this is the most intriguing thing in the harem is an understatement and though it took LA a while, LA grew to like Mafuyu whenever she appeared...yeah LA rooted for Mafuyu by the end of the first season. Finally we have Asumi Kominami voiced by Madoka Asahina, a graduate of the harem\'s cast school but her wanting to be a medical doctor yet sucking in science and her meeting Nariyuki in cram school, but even though she has the last and furthest appearance in the harem, what screentime she got, she was a welcome addition to the harem, especially with her playfully aggressive personality let alone that she\'s just as sharp in the uptake of Nariyuki\'s harem much like Fumino.To say that the harem itself is the biggest strength of Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is an understatement and again, with LA not able to pinpoint LA\'s favourite character (as the harem members were ALL interesting) until Episode 12, yeah Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai put harem back into balanced harem anime, let alone the fact that the harem members themselves just don\'t fawn over the main male protagonist and actually interacts and be friends with the rest of the harem at that to not only help each other academically but romantically as well so the multi-layer the harem elements and thus make it MUCH more interesting.Back to why Rizu is much more relatable to LA, as LA was great in maths in high school but LA is now writing anime reviews, so LA can relate to Rizu ALOT, thus kinda showing off Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai notion of the characters wanting to pursue their academic weaknesses as it\'s ACTUALLY a real thing.Rizu is LA\'s most relatable, Fumino is the most genre savvy, Uruka is the fanservicey childhood friend, Mafuyu is best girl and Asumi is the fun factor.The structure of most if not all episodes does tend to focus on one of the harem members but when the entire harem concidentally gets to play around with certain scenarios, well the entire harem (depending on if they have been introduced or not) gets equal screentime. To this end, it allows the harem interact with one another, develop them romantically and iindividually as well as increase screentime for the entire harem as a result and well, makes for a really good balanced harem with how the anime is structured.The animation done by Silver and Arvo Animation and man, if there was one thing LA loved about the animation, that would be the character designs, so poppy and distinct and with the VERY comical facial animations of MANY of the characters that even the more comical features though looking ""light"" made itself all the more expressive and yes Rizu for LA was this though the rest of the cast gets this and LA loved it. Of course since this is mostly a character-focused harem anime, though the background work was great, the character deigns as well as the MANY costumes some of the characters goes through was the much more interesting element of the animation, but nonetheless good animation.Voice cast-wise, LA thought Nao Touyama voiced most of these characters (seriously they sounded like multiple cadences that Nao Touyama does), no but seriously the voice cast was great and with the harem having a balanced screentime, LA will give MVP\'s to well ALL the harem VA\'s...that being Haruka Shiraishi as Fumino, Lynn as Mafuyu Kirisu, Sayumi Suzushiro as Uruka Takemoto (probably the closest to sounding like Nao Touyama\'s genkiness), Miyu Tomita as Rizu Ogata and Madoka Asahina as Asumi Kominami. Ryota Osaka as Nariyuki also did a great job especially with some of the one-liners and great reactions from him. Really and obviously, LA LOVED this voice cast.LA did mention Go-Toubun no Hanayome and though both this and Go-Toubun no Hanayome has similarities towards it, they have differing strengths and weaknesses, as Go-Toubun no Hanayome has the mystery element that makes the anime all the more intriguing and though the first season of Go-Toubun no Hanayome makes it as an unbalanced harem, whereas Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai doesn\'t really have the mystery element and more so in ""shipping"" who the main protagonist but as a result, has a solid balanced harem to back it up. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai has it\'s strengths but if LA had a gun to LA\'s head and had to pick between the two.....Go-Toubun no Hanayome, but Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is still a great harem anime to watch as it\'s weakness doesn\'t detract from the overall great strength of a balanced harem.And those weaknesses that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai has, well for LA mainly is from Uruka and her ""twice shy"" and ""can\'t spit it out"" and though this was something LA did find and that is the MANY misunderstandings the harem goes through (well sans Fumino and maybe Mafuyu) with the victims mainly going to Uruka and Rizu as a result, sure to these flaws Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai still handles these cliches pretty well all things considered, even Uruka\'s childhood friend dilemna and her not spitting it out...well the harem cliches was STILL utilized quite well. Really even with these flaws, it doesn\'t detriment the experience due to how the harem cliche subversion and the solid balanced harem aspects.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai was just another enjoyable harem to watch in many aspects, from the balanced harem and structuring of the anime, likable harem members as well as an interesting main protagonist and much like Go-Toubun no Hanayome, utilizing it\'s harem cliches and subverting it away from the tired and old harem hijinks. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is getting a second season and LA would VERY much like to know what\'s happening next as well as giving the harem alot more hijinks and alot more romantic push...We Never Learn, no Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai LEARNED from it\'s harem predecessors and much like the harem members pursuing their academic weakness\', LA hopes Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai\'s 2nd season will do the same and make Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai EVEN BETTER. greatly developed in the sense of their romantic endevours to the main protagonist.Nariyuki Yuiga voiced by Ryota Osaka is one of those harem protagonist who is pretty much the nice guy, slightly dense in the sense but has a strong sense of helping anyone in trouble or in this case, helping the girls going to their college of choice. The main strength of Nariyuki is the mere fact that though he goes through MANY harem hijinks, how he handles it subverts from the cliches (and sometimes thanks to certain harem members) of it.

Of course since this is mostly a character-focused harem anime, though the background work was great, the character deigns as well as the MANY costumes some of the characters goes through was the much more interesting element of the animation, but nonetheless good animation.Voice cast-wise, LA thought Nao Touyama voiced most of these characters (seriously they sounded like multiple cadences that Nao Touyama does), no but seriously the voice cast was great and with the harem having a balanced screentime, LA will give MVP\'s to well ALL the harem VA\'s...that being Haruka Shiraishi as Fumino, Lynn as Mafuyu Kirisu, Sayumi Suzushiro as Uruka Takemoto (probably the closest to sounding like Nao Touyama\'s genkiness), Miyu Tomita as Rizu Ogata and Madoka Asahina as Asumi Kominami. Ryota Osaka as Nariyuki also did a great job especially with some of the one-liners and great reactions from him. Really and obviously, LA LOVED this voice cast.LA did mention Go-Toubun no Hanayome and though both this and Go-Toubun no Hanayome has similarities towards it, they have differing strengths and weaknesses, as Go-Toubun no Hanayome has the mystery element that makes the anime all the more intriguing and though the first season of Go-Toubun no Hanayome makes it as an unbalanced harem, whereas Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai doesn\'t really have the mystery element and more so in ""shipping"" who the main protagonist but as a result, has a solid balanced harem to back it up. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai has it\'s strengths but if LA had a gun to LA\'s head and had to pick between the two.....Go-Toubun no Hanayome, but Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is still a great harem anime to watch as it\'s weakness doesn\'t detract from the overall great strength of a balanced harem.And those weaknesses that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai has, well for LA mainly is from Uruka and her ""twice shy"" and ""can\'t spit it out"" and though this was something LA did find and that is the MANY misunderstandings the harem goes through (well sans Fumino and maybe Mafuyu) with the victims mainly going to Uruka and Rizu as a result, sure to these flaws Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai still handles these cliches pretty well all things considered, even Uruka\'s childhood friend dilemna and her not spitting it out...well the harem cliches was STILL utilized quite well. Really even with these flaws, it doesn\'t detriment the experience due to how the harem cliche subversion and the solid balanced harem aspects.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai was just another enjoyable harem to watch in many aspects, from the balanced harem and structuring of the anime, likable harem members as well as an interesting main protagonist and much like Go-Toubun no Hanayome, utilizing it\'s harem cliches and subverting it away from the tired and old harem hijinks. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is getting a second season and LA would VERY much like to know what\'s happening next as well as giving the harem alot more hijinks and alot more romantic push...We Never Learn, no Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai LEARNED from it\'s harem predecessors and much like the harem members pursuing their academic weakness\', LA hopes Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai\'s 2nd season will do the same and make Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai EVEN BETTER.', ""Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai boasts everything about an unusual time in high-school. This anime can make you feel a whole lot of emotions based on your situations in real life and how 'relatable' they can be. Personally, I loved it, it was addicting, funny and more importantly interesting to watch. The soundtrack is awesome, there's alot of work gone into thinking of fully developed characters for each person featured. This anime was amazing, and there has not been anything like it.

I\'ll start first with the amazing OP, Seishun Seminar. The op was very cheerful and lively, and it really fits the anime. Just listening to it will make you want to study. Too bad Kirisu Sensei didn\'t have a part in the OP.

But if you have, you are likely able to predict all of the plot in advance. As someone who has seen frankly too many series of this type, the plot was simply eye-wateringly boring.And there is of course the fact that this is based on an ongoing manga and is only 13 episodes long season. As any veteran will tell you, this means that the plot and relationships will advance absolutely nowhere. Plenty of tease of progression but all of it never amounts to anything....Most often this type is just meant to tempt viewer to buy the manga, so fully expect the last episode on the note of: ""Our crazy groups hi-jinks have only just begun, Teehee!""

Yes, I'm also a big fan of the other major one as well.To be honest I can't really say what specifically I like about Bokuben, what made me decide to collect the Manga (a first for me), or what keeps me rewatching the occasional episode. It's a good time with good characters in a fun environment and the story isn't suffocated by romance and fawning over some half-baked idiot.Although to his credit Yuiga isn't your standard protagonist, he has a genuine belief that helping those who wish to improve what they aren't...good at, helping those who aren't talented is the right thing to do.

The real art of this show is the chemistry between the characters, and it's primary objective of comedy.

The super cute pink-haired young sensei is very much a part of the harem.

It is practically the generic series that we have seen many times.His style is nice and very simple, having all the same faces, nor has history and less character development, being simply an episodic comedy where they will show us erotic scenes all the time. The characters are so unoriginal, that we can classify them by archetypes: Nariyuki as the kind and silly protagonist, Fumino as the insecure, Rizo as the antisocial or the one who has trouble understanding people and Uruka as the childhood friend.

Lets begin.Story: 5/10Nariyuki Yuiga strives himself in his studies to become a top student and provide a better life for his family by getting a VIP nomination to help cover all of his university Intuition fees. One day, the opportunity arrives to obtain the VIP nomination. But there is a catch. He must tutor the school’s top two students, Fumino Furuhashi and Rizu Ogata, and help with the subjects they are weak at in order for them to pursue their dream careers. With the VIP nomination on the line, Nariyuki must help them improve their grades before time to submit their university application runs out.What was a simple case of helping out students with their studies slowly (and predictably) turns into a case of awkward meetings because the main female characters start to develop feelings for Nariyuki and Nariyuki is too dense to realise. This is amplified when you add characters Uraka Takemoto, Mafuyu Kirisu and Asumi Kominami to help set the harem. It mainly uses the tutoring aspect as a way at getting these female characters together and is mainly used to get to know more about them and why they want to succeed in the academic areas they struggle at. But slowly but, surely, the gimmick this show starts with is slowly not the focus of the show and what we get is another bog standard harem comedy with a diverse cast of female characters and a dense protagonist. It loses focus on what kind of story it wants to tell in favour of doing tropes and cliches that we’ve seen in other harem comedies.As for the comedy of this show, it’s one of those rare cases where the comedy arguably gets better as the show goes on as the awkwardness increases. That’s not to say that it wasn’t funny at the beginning because there were humorous moments but the humour only got better as the show got on. But it does over-rely on using the misunderstanding card to humour the viewer quite a bit and can start to get tedious but there were plenty of humorous moments throughout the show to make quite amusing overall, but it can get tedious at times.Another thing I criticise the story for is them balancing the screentime of the girls throughout the show. Rizu gets arguably pushed to the back as the show goes on past the halfway point. Whereas Asumi was introduced too late into the show despite being a breath of fresh air for this show. So it does have problems when balancing its girls and when we get to see them. Granted in Rizu’s case, we do get to see plenty of her in the first half and she moved aside for the other characters, but when you start adding characters, you need to start balancing it out. But the show struggles to do that at times.Characters: 7/10Nariyuki does have aspects of his character and personality that would be considered cliched. The main aspect (which is shared among MCs in this situation) is him being dense to the girls’ feelings when it comes to love and such. Well not all of them, but some of them. I would say it is on the rather endearing side because all he wants is to make sure that he helps these girls in their studies. Sure there is the VIP nomination, but his attention rather turns to helping them, which causes them to develop feelings. But the genericness really does kick in at times and it really does feel like he does not want to act on this and is just let things happen. I know he’s focused on his studies but come on man.Now the female characters, the harem, is a diverse cast which is supposed to be because you want each of these girls to have their own personality and stand out of in their own way. What this show does great though is that each girl have certain qualities and quirks that make interesting and endearing and have set goals they want to achieve in life. So it’s hard to decide which girl is best because, Fumino is best girl, Rizu is best girl, Uraka is best girl, Kirisu is best girl and Asumi is best girl. This show is in a weird position where you can make a case why which character is the best one and you would have good reasons why.Animation: 7/10If I had to describe this show’s animation with one word, it would have to be, “Vibrant.” The show’s art direction is very colourful with plenty of striking scenes to make it vibrant. It matches the light hearted tone this show has so I see it as being very appropriate. There are the typical facial expressions and movements used to add humour to a scene by exaggerating it. Some of them are amusing though (Rizu’s pout face will always be adorable). Honestly, the show’s art style makes me feel comfortable, as if the usual day to day lives of our characters are something you can just relax and see how well they can get along with each other.Sound: 8/10I didn’t expect the ost to be as dramatic as it is but does consist of some of the more memorable soundtracks from the show. It is normally used when we get to know more about our characters to add some humanity to a scene. While there are other soundtracks that are used mainly for comedic timing the soundtracks for the show’s more touching scenes are more memorable.I very much enjoyed this opening mainly for its cinematography and how well some shots in this anime opening and has some very good animation. The song “Seishun Seminar” by study was a nice, uplifting song to get you hyped for the episode and timed well with some of the scenes in the opening. The ending sequence was also really good and is my favourite from this season, just beating out Isekai Quartet and Sarazanmai’s ending sequence. I’m a big fan of the chalkboard art style used to match the school setting. Study also does song; this time being called “Never Give It Up,” which was another nice uplifting song to match the tone of the show and is good to end off the episode.ConclusionI will say that this show struggles to have an original bone in its body as the show consists of aspects we’ve seen from other shows like this. Its protagonist is generic at times and the whole gimmick of this show slowly boils down and is heavily downplayed so we can focus on the romance element. Yet it also has a good cast of girls and the shows animation is good to look at and a good soundtrack.  No doubt this show will probably be remembered for the arguments as to who was best girl in this series. But if you are looking for a fresh take on the harem comedy, then this ain’t it. It tried to be with the focus on these girls getting better with their studies, but the standard harem comedy tropes kick in and we get a show of two halves, one that is generic, the other is not. While it is entertaining and the humour is funny, it isn’t what I consider to be a must watch but it is the kind of show that it is best to formulate your own opinion on. While I did enjoy my time watching this show, there are aspects from the show that I didn’t like. But who knows, maybe my criticisms will be addressed in season 2 (hopefully).My personal enjoyment: 7/10Overall score: 6.8/10 Recommendation: Consider it review of We Never Learn.

Rizu gets arguably pushed to the back as the show goes on past the halfway point. Whereas Asumi was introduced too late into the show despite being a breath of fresh air for this show. So it does have problems when balancing its girls and when we get to see them. Granted in Rizu’s case, we do get to see plenty of her in the first half and she moved aside for the other characters, but when you start adding characters, you need to start balancing it out. But the show struggles to do that at times.Characters: 7/10Nariyuki does have aspects of his character and personality that would be considered cliched. The main aspect (which is shared among MCs in this situation) is him being dense to the girls’ feelings when it comes to love and such. Well not all of them, but some of them. I would say it is on the rather endearing side because all he wants is to make sure that he helps these girls in their studies. Sure there is the VIP nomination, but his attention rather turns to helping them, which causes them to develop feelings. But the genericness really does kick in at times and it really does feel like he does not want to act on this and is just let things happen. I know he’s focused on his studies but come on man.Now the female characters, the harem, is a diverse cast which is supposed to be because you want each of these girls to have their own personality and stand out of in their own way. What this show does great though is that each girl have certain qualities and quirks that make interesting and endearing and have set goals they want to achieve in life. So it’s hard to decide which girl is best because, Fumino is best girl, Rizu is best girl, Uraka is best girl, Kirisu is best girl and Asumi is best girl. This show is in a weird position where you can make a case why which character is the best one and you would have good reasons why.Animation: 7/10If I had to describe this show’s animation with one word, it would have to be, “Vibrant.” The show’s art direction is very colourful with plenty of striking scenes to make it vibrant. It matches the light hearted tone this show has so I see it as being very appropriate. There are the typical facial expressions and movements used to add humour to a scene by exaggerating it. Some of them are amusing though (Rizu’s pout face will always be adorable). Honestly, the show’s art style makes me feel comfortable, as if the usual day to day lives of our characters are something you can just relax and see how well they can get along with each other.Sound: 8/10I didn’t expect the ost to be as dramatic as it is but does consist of some of the more memorable soundtracks from the show. It is normally used when we get to know more about our characters to add some humanity to a scene. While there are other soundtracks that are used mainly for comedic timing the soundtracks for the show’s more touching scenes are more memorable.I very much enjoyed this opening mainly for its cinematography and how well some shots in this anime opening and has some very good animation. The song “Seishun Seminar” by study was a nice, uplifting song to get you hyped for the episode and timed well with some of the scenes in the opening. The ending sequence was also really good and is my favourite from this season, just beating out Isekai Quartet and Sarazanmai’s ending sequence. I’m a big fan of the chalkboard art style used to match the school setting. Study also does song; this time being called “Never Give It Up,” which was another nice uplifting song to match the tone of the show and is good to end off the episode.ConclusionI will say that this show struggles to have an original bone in its body as the show consists of aspects we’ve seen from other shows like this. Its protagonist is generic at times and the whole gimmick of this show slowly boils down and is heavily downplayed so we can focus on the romance element. Yet it also has a good cast of girls and the shows animation is good to look at and a good soundtrack.  No doubt this show will probably be remembered for the arguments as to who was best girl in this series. But if you are looking for a fresh take on the harem comedy, then this ain’t it. It tried to be with the focus on these girls getting better with their studies, but the standard harem comedy tropes kick in and we get a show of two halves, one that is generic, the other is not. While it is entertaining and the humour is funny, it isn’t what I consider to be a must watch but it is the kind of show that it is best to formulate your own opinion on. While I did enjoy my time watching this show, there are aspects from the show that I didn’t like. But who knows, maybe my criticisms will be addressed in season 2 (hopefully).My personal enjoyment: 7/10Overall score: 6.8/10 Recommendation: Consider it', ""Really funny anime. I was scared at the start with the harem but it turned into a really fun and enjoyable one. The story is not like the greatest in the universe, just a guy who help his girl companions to study, the characters change quite a lot during the first season from the start to the end, they get some develop and is pretty good. The art is great, not a ton of fan service which make it even better (yes, we all love fan service except when it's all that can give us an anime and then we hate it).

Relative to the genre standard, character's have depth and heart. MC is not a loser or neanderthal, and girls are not over-the-top in love with him. Situations manage to be outrageous without being contrived, and funny without relying on cringe. Obviously this show is quite lighthearted and simplistic, but I think here that manages to be a good thing, allowing for a larger emphasis on the characters and their interactions.

Animation quality is also very good, for example, in the opening at 0:45, the way Takemoto swims backwards, twiddling with...her hair really surprised me, it's so fluent and cute.

But the truth is that even if we normally look for new experiences or ingenious turns in what we already know, we are creatures of habit and every so often we return to what is familiar to us because it is our comfort zone. I mention all this because the series to which I dedicate this review is no wonder that reinvents the genre of romantic comedies to which it belongs, however, it has resulted in one of the series that I have enjoyed watching in this already...finished spring season 2019 (although it was a slow season, so it\'s not saying much in its favor).The work is therefore a romantic comedy, of those that throw comedy more than romance itself, of school atmosphere and harem type, with certain elements of ecchi, which tells us the story of Yuiga, a young man with low resources but very dedicated to his studies, to which the director of his school offers him a deal that is impossible to refuse, and in exchange for the boy to work as the tutor of two students and help them raise their grades in certain subjects, he will be awarded a scholarship that will facilitate his passage to the university, which is great for him due to the economic situation of his family.A task that would not seem too complicated, especially when the boy learns that his two students will be, Rizu and Fumino, two pretty famous girls inside the school due to his outstanding intelligence, the first being a genius in everything related to Mathematics and exact sciences, and the other an expert in letters, the problem is that despite this talent, the girls due to their future ambitions, they really want to stand out in the opposite field from which they currently shine, Rizu wants to be good in literature to be able to become a psychologist, while Fumino wishes to learn mathematics to fulfill her dream of studying astronomy, the two being completely useless in these areas, costing both of them to learn something no matter how much they study and repeat them, finding this way our protagonist in a very complicated situation that will have to go solving one step at a time, being friends with the girls that, at the beginning somewhat distrustful due to their bad experiences with previous tutors and teachers who surrendered with them very easily.

However, its charm is how it integrates their characters and clichés in a quite natural way despite the formulations that can result in their way of narrating the events. However, even if from the beginning the characters comply with a usual cliche in the romcoms so that you can easily differentiate them by the tropes they represent, they have enough personality to make them credible since everyone has their own ambitions and dreams. So, not only do they exist for romantic relationships and comic gags, but any trace of these is born during the interactions of the characters and how they begin to know each other more. It is nothing that makes it stand out in the huge list of romantic comedies and it feels the same as many I saw a decade ago, but it gives it enough identity to not feel like a project lacking inspiration, especially with all the editions it does the anime to adapt enough of the manga and thus include all the important characters. It\'s a simple romcom, but it\'s well executed to give simple light entertainment that doesn\'t want to be a drama or touch subjects in too much depth.When it comes to the technical work of the series, I have to say that even when it\'s nothing incredible, it does its job well.

I have nothing about boobs, but you can\'t make a show about them and call it ""romance comedy"".Yet some characters can be saved, and the final episode does its job, but that\'s not enough. ', 'This past month I\'ve been watching a lot of rom coms and harem anime, and I have to say, We Never Learn had one of the weakest starts out of all of them. The premise isn\'t overly interesting, and the first couple episodes only really exist to introduce the characters. Luckily, the characters developed in a way that made this show quite enjoyable in the end.Story 6: Definitely the show\'s weakest category, the overarching plot is basically Yuiga (MC) is poor as fuck and needs to get a special recommendation from his school so he can get a full-ride to the university of his choice....In order to get this recommendation, he has to teach geniuses in subjects that they suck at, to help them get into the universities they want to attend. It\'s kinda unique, but at the same time the series is mainly done episodically, very few episodes directly impact later episodes, however a large handful of the individual episodes\' plots are actually pretty decent.Art 8: Really solid all around, and keeps a nice consistency. Certain shows like Nisekoi, have scenes that are animated incredibly well, but then they have other scenes that clearly had little to no time put into them. It was nice having something a bit more consistent in the animation quality.Sound 7: OP was pretty solid, and none of the VA cast annoyed me.Character 9: Definitely the shining point for this show. When first introduced, Fumino seems like the shy type, whose overly impressionable, and Rizu seems like the brash and insensitive type, whose overly assertive. However, once those characters have time to show their true colors, you\'ll find that those descriptions fit better when flipped for the two girls. Fumino doesn\'t take most things at face value; she\'s typically the character who realizes that a misunderstanding might take place, and is assertive in steering the conversation in a way to avoid it. Rizu is insecure due to her inability to read other people\'s emotions, which is commonly mistaken for her being overly assertive. Asumi and Uruka are both solid characters as well. Ms Kirisu is definitely the least developed of the harem cast, but she\'s not an awful character. Last part on the girls, I didn\'t really care for any of them when they were introduced, especially Uruka, but over the course of a few episodes, they really developed and became characters that were enjoyable to watch.The harem dynamic can only function if the MC falls into one of three categories; oblivious idiot MC - this MC is too stupidly oblivious too see that all the girls in his life are fawning over him (Raku from Nisekoi); uninterested in love MC - this character is typically aware that multiple girls have feelings for him, but his lack of interest in love keeps them at bay, and he has no desire to change the status quo due to his disinterest for love (Kodako from Haganai: I don\'t have many friends); harem king MC - this MC wants a harem and he\'s usually a massive pervert (Issei from High School DXD). Yuiga is interesting because he falls into two of the harem MC categories; he is both the ""oblivious idiot MC"" and the ""uninterested in love MC"". This is interesting, because he doesn\'t fit either category perfectly; Yuiga isn\'t completely disinterested in love: he just wants to focus on his studies until entrance exams, and he isn\'t completely oblivious: if enough of the pieces are put in front of him, he\'s more than capable of putting things together. The harem cast also works really well to support Yuiga, as none of them are overly affectionate. The fact that almost everyone in the harem wants to maintain the status quo causes this show to feel less like a harem, and more like your typically rom-com, just multiple girls happen to develop feelings for the same guy.Enjoyment 8: It\'s touch and go for some episodes, but overall, the characters and how they interact was what really made this an enjoyable watch. I\'ve been watching rom-coms to focus on studying character arcs to help the novel I\'m currently working on, and this show in particular gave me a fair bit of inspiration through its characters.Overall 8: If you\'re looking for something with a deep, breathtaking story, then don\'t waste your time here, but if you want to watch a harem anime with a cast of well-written, dynamic, cute girls then this is definitely for you. In order to get this recommendation, he has to teach geniuses in subjects that they suck at, to help them get into the universities they want to attend. It\'s kinda unique, but at the same time the series is mainly done episodically, very few episodes directly impact later episodes, however a large handful of the individual episodes\' plots are actually pretty decent.Art 8: Really solid all around, and keeps a nice consistency. Certain shows like Nisekoi, have scenes that are animated incredibly well, but then they have other scenes that clearly had little to no time put into them. It was nice having something a bit more consistent in the animation quality.Sound 7: OP was pretty solid, and none of the VA cast annoyed me.Character 9: Definitely the shining point for this show. When first introduced, Fumino seems like the shy type, whose overly impressionable, and Rizu seems like the brash and insensitive type, whose overly assertive.

Sounds good to me...We Can't Study is... well, it's hardly original, we can say that much.  Those who followed Winter 2019's Go-Toubun no Hanayome will find the premise eerily familiar - although in truth neither manga is 'ripping off' the other, as they started serialisation at pretty much the same time and the authors are known to be friends.  Despite the surface similarities, however, BokuBen takes itself in much more of a lighthearted direction, with the focus on comedy, character gags and unlikely conicidences rather than Go-Toubun's heavy character drama......which meant this was always going to have to...do a lot of work to distinguish itself from any of the other gag-driven harem rom-coms out there.  Did it succeed?  Well, kinda sorta.  The show's not doing anything new, and anyone who's ever seen... erm, anything at all before will be able to predict the story beats as they happen.  You could almost tick off the story devices on a sheet of harem comedy bingo.But, despite that, it executes on these well.  The characters are familiar - but charming and with a spark of life that endears them to us.  The jokes are classic - but they land with superb comic timing, leaving us laughing along rather than at the show.  The romance is by-the-numbers - but hey, if it ain't broke don't fix it, right?So just a basic harem comedy that pulls off the basics well, with nothing to stand out?  No, not that either.  BokuBen has one massive advantage over its competitors - and I'm not talking about the show's loyal manga fanbase.The sound design on this show is, quite honestly, incredible.  I've never seen - sorry, never heard - anything like it.  Once you notice it, it's impossible not to keep on noticing and appreciating how much work has been put in.  The soundtrack is part of it, with a dizzying array of background tracks all used to their fullest extent to enhance a mood or cut out to emphasise a point.  The voice acting is part of it, with strong performances all round and incredible direction making the most of the VAs' talents.But it's most noticable in the sound effects, where the attention to detail is like nothing else.  When two characters fall into a pool, there's two splashes.  When one character is in wooden sandals and the other is in sneakers, we hear both the clop of wood and the squeak of rubber.  When someone twists their ankle, there's a crunch that makes you wince in sympathy.I'd have followed - and liked - this show just based on the strength of its manga, and I'd have been pleasantly surprised with the adaptation based on the visuals and direction.  But the sound design has raised BokuBen into my AOTS, and an unexpected delight every Saturday.  I'll be keeping a lookout for sound director Motoyama Satoshi's next work - my hat off to him and his team.Ufotable and KyoAni shows may be a feast for the eyes, but if you want a treat for the ears, give BokuBen a go. do a lot of work to distinguish itself from any of the other gag-driven harem rom-coms out there.

Despite its harem tag, it's a very enjoyable anime.Story(8/10)-This not one of the anime that you watch for the story. Rather it's for the enjoyment. But the story is good. In a good way, it's very much different from other harem anime. It does get annoying with the classing harem tropes but the comedy balanced it really well. All the characters get together and do enjoyable and funny stuff together.But I felt the pacing...was a bit off. The story gets interesting whenever a new character is introduced. After a few events regarding that character it starts to become very slow. I personally felt there was some confusion as to what new things to do with the new characters.Art(8/10)-This anime is very pretty. The character look very neat and the environment is pretty good too. The face animations during comedic scenes are very cute and suits the tone of the story.Sound(8/10)-The VA is really nice. All the various emotions are conveyed really well. The opening and ending are alright.Characters(9/10)-This is where this anime shines. The personalities of the characters are somehow refreshing relative to other harems although you can guess each character's personalities from their looks. None of the characters are annoying.

The harem portion of it is relaxed and well constructed, which is hard to say for the vast majority.  The main protagonist is kind and considerate, albeit slightly dense (per usual of a kind protagonist), but not annoying like the majority of MCs in the genre.Week to week I am constantly surprised by the entertaining additions and writing for such a seemingly mundane topic--studying/school.  All of the characters have unique personalities and not a single one annoys me which is very rare for anime characters ESPECIALLY in this genre....Needless to say, I am a fan, and I am sure the last three episodes will not disappoint, as my interest has only increased with each episode.I just finished the 10th episode and I am liking the show more and more each time I watch it.  Rarely have I yearned to watch the next episode of an anime as much, and not to over-reiterate my opinion, but that feeling is especially rare when it comes to a harem-based anime.  The show is great, go in looking for a good time and you will probably find it.  I certainly have.(dororo and rising of the shield hero are two other shows I\'ve really enjoyed this ""season"" if that helps hone my interest and general preference for anyone reading this review and still sitting on the fence about giving this show a shot.)

I usually like romcoms, but this one is one of the better ones imo. And I rarely give 8 or more to seasonal shows.Now first, the bad stuff, I don\'t know if the art of the show is for everyone, I really liked it tho and it\'s consistent during the entire season. The show is pretty safe and it doesn\'t have anything innovative and it has it\'s fair share of cliches. The soundtrack is meh. It is a harem, something that not everyone likes, but I have to add...that it avoids most of the commons cliches of this genres. Most of the cliches of this show are around some classic ""events"" that happens in most SoL or romantic shows.The plot is a romcom, don\'t expect more than that.Now, the good stuff:Characters and their development, I actually liked all the characters and all of them get screen time. They have a pretty natural progress and they never felt like they were acting out of place. All of them got some backstory to some extend, all of them matured or changed during the season to some extend without loosing their personality and they all have some kind of goal.The MC actually seems to act like a guy, he also gets development and he matures a bit during the season. That is a huge plus in these kind of shows for me.The animation is great, everything is fluid during the entire season.Despite being a harem, we don\'t get almost none jealousy cliche scene and even those aren\'t exaggerated as the usual.Despite being a romcom, the show has the subplot of the girls trying to achive some goal, that is also something that I like that breaks a bit the constant flow of romance and it makes the show more interesting to me.Overrall, if you like romcoms with a pretty casual story with well developed characters that act in a pretty natural way I think you should give it a show. The show was interesting from the beginning to the end and it actually improved after a couple episodes, something not that common in this kind of genre.So yeah, if you like anything of what I said I think you should try it. that it avoids most of the commons cliches of this genres.

I have watched lots of harem and I know how they work. More and less, it is easy to describe and predict the movements of the series. And Bokuben has not surprise me a lot. I like some of its parts and characters. But from further, I can not say what could they do to bettering the anime. I mean, it is not bad at all, but the story that Bokuben say to me I have watched it in lots of different places.Something I dislike about the story was the situation. Bobuken tend to exaggerate their scenes and...put the characters in not common situations. Even If the series do that, is okay if the know how to development it in a good way. But Bokuben does not do that, it uses a lot of repeated situations that everybody has watched. For example, the restroom, see the female characters with a few of clothes, an involuter kiss, etc.Art: 7/10For me, the art was great in specific situations but so fair in the normal situations. When the anime tries to express an emotion to us, the art does a great job. The expressions of the characters become more vivid and expressional xd. It is important to send the feeling of the characters and I think that the series do that part. But when they draw a background or a scene, the image is normal, nothing more than the mean.Sound: 7/10The sound, like the art, is great for the situations and the characters voices, but when we talk about the background sound, are different things. I think that a good point was the voice actors of the girls. The voice covers the type of personality that characters could have, and the voices were so great. You can see this with Fumino and his potential noises xd.The background music was okay, but I do not feel it in important scenes, and it does not make me feel anything.Characters: 6/10I cannot say good think about the characters. It seems to me so cliche and boring except for Fumuni. The protagonist is the same characters that I have watched in lots of harem animes. He has a lot of things that make him a chicle. He is kind with the girls, helps when it is need and bla bla bla. He is not a human, he is just a character written in paper. But and after watching the final episode I can see that he has a good future. I mean, he can reach more and evolve in a good constructed character.The other girls like Ogata, Takemoto, and Kirisu-sensei has a lot of problems in their feelings developments. It is like for magic they will love or like the protagonists. They feel empty. In fact, the anime has forgotten about Ogata. I have not seen her in long time. And even in the final episode they were like mere argumental objects that only appear to say that still alive.But and it is something that I can presume, is Fumino. Indeed, Fumino feels like a person. She feels, analyses, understand the situations. She will not love the protagonist for magic, she has a constructed argument that make her be her. It cannot understand why if the serie can make characters like Fumino, for the other girls it is not the same. And after watched the final episode, I can say that Fumino is that shining star in this black night. Her construction and spoilers were so great. And hers feels has a lot of potential, more in this type of series.I don’t mention the senpai Kominami because I do not know her to say something about.Enjoyment 7/10I said. The serie has good intention but make the same errors that lots of harem animes has done. I enjoy the serie as a watcher of the anime, but I will not re-watch or recommend it because it does not give me a lot of good moments of memorable things.Overall 6/10It is said. This anime lacks argument, character’s construction, good or funny situations. Even if it makes some excellent points, it does not compensate the bad things. I hope that with this base and the characters they have now, can reach something better in the second season. put the characters in not common situations.

For me however, nothing really stood out in this anime even though I did somewhat enjoy it.Story 4/10For a RomCom, the story is there but is quite lackluster in my opinion. And while the story doesn\'t always have to be the main focus as this is also a slice of life, there are small story arcs scattered throughout the anime which I believe are sometimes poorly done. Nevertheless, the score for story shouldn\'t really affect much about this anime.Art 7/10The art was above average compared...to some of the other monstrosities that aired this season **COUGH** Kenja no Mago. It was bright and colourful at the very least and I didn\'t find the animation to be jarring in many areas for it to be considered an issue.Sound 5/10While the voice acting was done very well, the anime is let down by its unmemorable OSTs. While the music will generally suit the tone of the scene, none of them were powerful in any way and did not ""enhance"" my experience (if you will). Ain\'t no Hiroyuki Sawano going on here.Character 7/10Look, the characters whilst sticking to the RomCom archetypes, were actually done decently. They all generally had depth and I found that all of the characters were generally likeable. No real problems here. Maybe some uninspired personalities but nothing too bad.Enjoyment 8/10Despite what I wrote above, I still found this anime to be quite enjoyable. Its good and helps take your mind off things in life, as any anime of this genre should do. Maybe since I\'d read the source material, it might have made me enjoy it a bit more.Overall 7/10The anime overall was actually done quite well, while I would not have given it an 8 (Good anime) it was very close to reaching this standard and just suffered from a few issues above. The lack of story and weak OSTs really hit the rating hard for me.

Here the plot focuses on studying which we hardly find in any of the anime now a days. It is quite similar ""The Quintessential Quintuplets"". the difference is between the student the MC had to tutor and their personal attitude.There are lot of similarities in both the anime like both the MC is poor and forced to tutor other students. Both the anime contain the harem and comedy scenes quite similar to each other.If you like any one of them, you would definitely like the other one. So...binge watch it. binge watch it.', 'This anime was not what I was expecting. I thought of this anime as a simple romcom about highschool girls simping over their tutor with a very standard plot yet I kept wanting to see each of the individual relationships develop. I watched both seasons of the anime and read the manga within about 3-4 days which is absurd as the manga had 187 chapters. The different backstories and the link back to the mc that all the girls had was so interesting and always left you wondering who the mc would go out with especially when the school festival left the person who helped...the mc anonymous. This links to how the anime continues its story in the manga where once all the relationships of the main story have developed, it splits into multiple routes and stories that could have happened when the mc goes out with them. It reveals that the person who helped the mc in the school festival was that girl and the mc goes to develop their feelings and confession like a post credit scene. These ending routes were amazing with really romantic and cute moments where there could be a time skip or just going back to the main story to uncover new parts. Each story as well was so laid out for example the mc pursues a job as a teacher in an island where he meets one of the girls working as a doctor on the island and they get together. Another route where he stays a teacher in the highschool where he gets together with the teacher. Even though I was biased between each girl and obviously wanted a certain 1 or 2 to win, they made all endings work out and they left no reader disheartened when their favorite girl didn’t win. In conclusion, BokuBen is a great romcom anime which was funny and ecchi at points. It had a great artstyle, opening and storyline that left readers feeling overwhelmed with the amount of backstory and development between characters. Fire anime/manga. the mc anonymous.

The first few episodes felt like a bit of a slog, especially since we've all seen this same sort of thing time and time again in harem/romcom style shows.That being said, I feel that things really finished off strong. The VOs felt like they really started to get a feel for their characters as the show went on, and that helped to flesh them out and make them much more enjoyable to watch. The last few episodes of the first...cour really left me feeling like there's more to come, so I'm excited to pick this back up in October when the 2nd one airs! cour really left me feeling like there's more to come, so I'm excited to pick this back up in October when the 2nd one airs!"", ""Bottom Line: Best experienced after the better Manga.Pros:+ Some amazingly designed characters you can't help but fall in love with, who have real flaws and work to overcome them, including an unusually likable protagonist for a harem+ An adaptation of one of the best romantic comedy manga ever and can be both heart wrenching and funny+ Contains Best Girl Uruka Takemoto...Cons:- Nothing special to look at most of the time- Loses some of the nuance of the original to focus on the big moments which makes the show feel far more generic and trope-y than the source material---Seriously, read the Manga first. I can't imagine having liked this show nearly as much as I did having first experienced it unabridged in the author's original vision.

A boy helps his female students study and (hopefully) pass exams and finish the school year with flying colors while dealing with growing affection between the two sides. However, while the Quintessential Quintuplets focused more on family bonds, We Never Learn: BOKUBEN went more into the delightfully absurd and nonsensical end of the harem anime spectrum. I'm not telling you what it is, but it certainly made the anime a tiny bit more interesting. Also, its...pretty much a comedy, but there are small, independent romantic moments where your heart skips a  beat and you just bask in the sheer beauty of the moment.And now, the characters. Pretty normal lineup of characters, except for the fact that Yuiga Nariyuki, the main protagonist of the series, is actually pretty average. He's not a genius like Futaro Uesugi, but the good thing is that he's not as dense as him either. Uruka Takemoto is the sporty gal of the series who's good at sports and nothing else, Fumino Furuhashi the happy go lucky girl who falls asleep the moment she hears a math equation, and Rizu Ogata the busty nerd who doesn't seem to comprehend human emotions and therefore Humanities in general. All equally interesting, all getting personality developments that honestly, should be focused on a bit more in the second season. Adding to this lineup we have Yuiga's purple haired senpai Asumi Kominami and his teacher and former tutor of Ogata and Furuhashi Kirisu Mafuyu. Not a bad lineup, the only problem here is that because of the amount of people, sometimes they don't get nearly as enough screen time/time alone with Yuiga as they should have. Also, the fact that Yuiga spent a lot of time with Ogata in the first few episodes and ended the season spending all of his time with Takemoto is a bit...unsavory considering that he should be spending time with each of them equally.Also, the music is a bit inappropriate. Not in the PG-13 sense, but more like it doesn't seem to suit the occasion as well as it should be. Sometimes there's upbeat music for sad situations, and other times its boring music for tense situations. Now, this only happens once in a while so its not too big of a deal, and considering that this was pretty much my one problem with We Never Learn shows how well its went.Finally, the reason why I have to watch the second season: Someone's mom's DEATH, a boy and a girl sharing a room together, and a severe lack of character development and loose ends that I hope will materialize in the second season.Final Rating: 9.3/10Second season, here I come. pretty much a comedy, but there are small, independent romantic moments where your heart skips a  beat and you just bask in the sheer beauty of the moment.And now, the characters.

Not only one of if not the most consumed genre in this medium, but also ar the easiest to relate to, with a large target audience that cherishes the fictional high school experience (We all went to the wrong high school apparently).That was the most generic intro I could start this up with, but it has less to do with “Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai” (quite a mouthful) or the busy, “We never learn”. Mainly because of how hard it tried to distinguish itself from what we get every season. Long story short, It did pay...off.- Story (8/10):At its very core, “We never learn” has one of the most basic stories that goes about a guy unconsciously raising a harem of girls from his high school, only this time around, there were no superpowers involved, no faith of humanity at risk, just a select of concerned passionate students that want to excel at what they do, with a great emphasis of comedy and goof-offs.Nariyuki, a hard-working student tasked by the principle to tutor a duo of geniuses in his high school on materials that they're respectively bad at. The science genius red-head Ogata that wants to grasp a grip on literature, and the bookworm blue-head Fumino that wants to pursue a career in the scientific field. A short and a tall one, a flat and a garden-of-melons one (you get the idea), and trust me, the contrasts between them are much deeper.Of course, with time, other girls join in, Takemoto the athletic idol of the high school (Team Takemoto for the win by the way) and a couple of others, of which was the blessing of the season, enter, the almighty TILF, teacher Mafuyu.It all starts genius and study-centered until the romance and pairings kick-off, and oh boy were day never-wreaking (in a good way)I find it genius how the show aired at the exact universal period of exams probably to relate to as much audience as possible. Aside from the main story that goes about the harem, the nostalgic atmospheric school vibes were too strong, the last time an Anime made me miss being a student was “Ansatsu Kyoushitsu” or “Assassination Classroom”. You get to feel their youth on both naive moments and not.- Art (8/10):2019 feels like a weird year for animation. A lot of studios given us the unexpected, there was a lot of disappointment for some as well. But “We never learn” didn't partake in none of those.Presented with the most generic slice-of-life-y art style that's good enough to keep you watching without complaint. Probably the best thing it had going for it visually was the consistency of the production. No episodes felt visually inferior, what you're used to is what you get, fair and simple.The character design is just as average as the overall artboard, but the artistic choices are taken to influence said characters are striking, for example, a unique color that identifies every character based on their personality and mood. The proportion of the body is also a clever play on portraying everyone's treats.I don't like the direction they went with Nariyiki specifically, giving him the dull appearance with the very uninspiring brown aesthetic (talking mainly about the hair and eye color), but maybe that was the catch? He seemed like the center of the story to me, at least give him more of a better highlight.- Sound (8.5/10):I really got invested so much into the cast of voice actors and actresses, so much in fact that I can't imagine any other sound when I see the characters' faces.Takemoto's voice actress Suzushiro Sayumi is a fairly unpopular voice actress compared to most others, with very few roles in her experience, but God, her performance was a blast.The opening song strikes a vibe of its own, making you feel like pulling off a high school material book and pretend you are preparing for an important exam in a group study at a summery day, it's just so surreal.The ending theme song was not looking at the same direction as the opening, quite the change with a distinguishable tone and a more energetic pace, really well done too.- Character (7/10):I'm not as happy with this one as I would have loved to.Don't get me wrong, the characters are all unique individuals with their own stories to tell, but at what catch?If anything, there was a huge lackluster in fleshing out the characters. They all received proper self-defining arcs, next episode, it feels like nothing was achieved.Most of the characters go through such length and bring out a new side and new thesis to tackle, but then it's like, “next”, good o'l switch a roo...What I'm trying to get to is, it's fine if you had a slow progressive story if you're going to sacrifice that to a more in-depth character arc that leaves its mark in the later episode. Now that I'm thinking about it, the only thing that changes is their level of affection to the main character, which is excusable for this show's case, but what about their dreams they keep bringing out?  Their past? Anything, please.- Enjoyment (9/10):I really had a blast, as short as I can phrase it.Probably one of the best Rom-Coms I watched, it did better than “Kaguya-sama love is war” in some aspects, and worst at others, both are great shows.It's exactly the kind of show that makes me go “I want an OVA asap, or maybe a sequel if you're generous enough”.I don't think I'll be able to remember every name or every character in this show, but the hilarious moments and quotes shall forever be remembered.- Overall (8.1/10):This is a really easy show to get into, definitely, a binge-watch material, even though I only experienced it in a weekly fashion.If you're looking for a Rom-Com, you can start right off the bat and with no regrets, a lot of hilarious moments in the waiting, glorious misunderstood setups, and likable characters.The main character doesn't make you spit slurs up every second, it feels like a chill series you'd want to watch after a long day of work in order to relax.

It is of course a harem, and there are some tropes that you typically see with that genre. That aside I really enjoyed watching this show. And the second season is about as good as the first.I think the characters were done pretty well. Again nothing to deep here. I will say the male MC isn't a complete moron or a complete pushover like you can typically find in this genre. He is even semi aware of his situation with the girls he...tutors.

The pacing and art of the Manga is top class, making  the somewhat frivolous story into something really interesting.

Another big problem though it seems kind of small is that the hair color really doesn't fit in the world at all.  Seeing the teacher, Kirisu with pink hair ruined her character a bit.

I thought Ogata (one of the girls being tutored) was really cute, but beyond that, I didn't really feel anything special about the other characters.

The story feels fluid and even though there are lots of cliches it isn´t predictable or boring.The cast interactions are very funny and all the characters work very well together. As individuals the main cast feels a bit fake and too idealistic but all of the female characters have their uniqueness and their thoughts and acts feel real according to their personalities. Yuiga is a good main character, he does what you expect...him to but ends up surprising some times. Another very positive point of the main cast is that they dodged the cliche of the girls blaming the boy always and that makes the cast feel unique and a bit lighter and funnier to watch. Now looking at it individually, Fumino and Uruka were better developed than Rizu. The beginning was focused on Rizu but she ended up too shallow, her dream of becoming a doctor is not as touching as Fumino´s and she is not as well developed emotionally as Uruka, which ended up surprising a lot. Uruka seemed at first to me as a supporting boring character but she turned out to be funny and cute, her interactions and dialogues with Nariyuki were great and full of life. Her efforts to make he fall in love are cliches but they surprise because you do not expect it.The character design is cute and beautiful, the girls don´t look very similar to each other.

Seriously there\'s nothing really unique about this show compare to any other generic high-school harem.The only thing that usually changes between shows of this genre is the background story and ""Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai"" is no exception - Take a students that\'s a little above average in all subjects (but emotionally an airhead) and a bunch of girls who are exceptionally talented in one subject but ridiculously bad in others then just throw them all together and have the girls, have them all fall in love with the guy and stretch it...by having one who\'s too afraid to confess, one who\'s not willing to admit to herself that she wants him and another that simply doesn\'t know it yet herself. Now where did I hear this story before? Maybe more or less every single harem I\'ve ever watched. After the first few episodes even those few background story things (like one of the girls trying to analyze classic Japanese literature as a series of equations) disappear and you get a truly 100% generic harem. Of course, 3 girls is never enough so let\'s throw in a teacher and an alumni as well so they\'re not high-school kids to make it ""super unique""... not.Nothing much to say about the art... As moe as virtually any other harem.Bottom line - If you\'ve never watched a harem before (are there any people who even fall into this category) you may watch this one as well as any other. If you\'re the type that enjoys the usual harem cliches then go ahead, this one is not better or worse than any other. If however you\'ve already watched a fair share of harems and don\'t want the same thing all over again then you should probably skip this one because that\'s exactly what it is. by having one who\'s too afraid to confess, one who\'s not willing to admit to herself that she wants him and another that simply doesn\'t know it yet herself.

Mainly because it does not add anything new to the harem genre and if anything overuses some key plot lines associated with the harem genre.First lets start with the plot:The plot is simple enough one high school student tutoring three girls who are geniuses in their talented subjects however completely fall flat on the career paths they want to pursue.The plot is good in my opinion as it was something I haven\'t seen before and I thought this anime would try to add...something new to the worn out harem genre. But I was wrong, this anime added nothing to the existing genre however that does not mean I do not like.The story\'s in each episode are generally hit or miss as in when they miss they miss hard! While when the story\'s do hit they hit hard! Let me explain.When the story\'s miss I mean that they end up dragging on and end up leaving me falling asleep on my chair. For example when one of the main characters Fumino goes on a diet and struggles to lose weight. It may seem very simple and thats just it, it was very simple. It was so simple that it it would have been more interesting to just tell someone what happens then to just watch it. The episode felt bland nothing really goes on. Its bad filler in a slice of life harem anime.The MC is constantly forced into embarrassing and awkward situations to the point where it starts to get old and unfunny.Throughout this anime the MC goes through some situations so much that it essentially takes a core part of the harem genre and overuses to the point of madness. Every other episode I has this one plot that is just ""Hey lets force MC to accidentally get trapped in the girls"" Or ""Hey lets force MC to get stuffed in a mascot at a female clothing store and make him measure his friends cup size"". It eventually gets worn out and by the time they do use a similar situation and it ends up being good, you have a hard time trying to appreciate it because it probably just flew over your head as ""another situation MC goes through"".Time for a positive change in this review. The jokes aren\'t all that bad and end up actually being funny.Don\'t get me wrong but not all the jokes are like this. Some just fall flat and end up making you feel awkward but a solid majority don\'t. The jokes and up being well timed and clever sometimes doing the opposite of jokes that do fall flat and turning awkward situations into normal ones just like that. The jokes do tend to also be clean though not as quotable because they do rely on the situation too much to be used irl.The characters end up being to bland and are cliches of the harem genre.The main characters come off as your average harem cliches and thus far haven\'t had enough character development to make them interesting or unique. Their talented subjects don\'t get any screen time to show them who they are such as Fumino who is supposedly talented at literature but aside from the first episode we never get to see her actually show off these skills. The same goes for Ogata where she suffers the same problem but not as much. She incorporates math into her speaking so most of the time she would come off as nerdy but this tends to lessen and aside from that we never get to see her actually doing equations or use for anything else. .I get this is a 13 episode anime and you only have so much time to develop the other three characters and the MC so ill give it some slack.In conclusion this anime wasn\'t all that bad it was funny but needed more originality from the overused, worn out genre that is harems. I would recommend if you want to take a break from all the serious and long series and just chillax with a 13 episode one. something new to the worn out harem genre.

It’s pretty typical in that it features an overtly kind hearted and dense but otherwise essentially unremarkable protagonist, Nariyuki, that due to various circumstances, in this case being assigned as their tutor, ends up spending a lot of time with a bunch of girls. The girls start off somewhat interesting due to them being natural geniuses in different fields, but wanting to pursue careers in different fields where they have no talent in order to pursue their dreams. Nariyuki himself is someone that doesn’t seem to have any natural talent and...got where he is through hard work, so he’s able to sympathize with wanting to do things one has no talent for, though he’s someone that doesn’t have any particular dream beyond getting into a good college so he’s also envious of them for already having decided on their dreams. As such there is an underlying current of exploring themes relating to how talent, hard work, and goals all interconnect. This is a very subdued however, being somewhat prominent at the beginning but only showing hints and flashes beyond that.The majority of the anime is thus simply slice of life with Nariyuki and the various girls studying as well as getting into other light hearted situations. The only thing that I can think of that makes this anime stand out compared to others like it, is how it’s completely lite. Other similar anime often seem to try to force in drama or random twists, or at least make it seem like they are at the end of episodes to try to hook the viewer, but this anime doesn’t at all. There are times that things seem a bit more serious, like where the girls have to achieve a certain score on exams or Nariyuki will be removed as their tutor. However, even these situations aren’t framed as all that heavy and they’re passed through smoothly without much fanfare.In what is more standard for the genre, there are moments where it feels like there may be some romantic development, but these too go nowhere. However, the frequency of such moments felt a lot more rare compared to most other similar anime, wherein other similar anime seem to constantly be trying to make as many moments as they can seem important and like something major is at the cusp of happening, this doesn’t even try to play at that. It feels like its pretty clear that nothing is going to happen. One of the main reasons for this is that it establishes that the cast don’t have time for romance until their done with the exams they’re studying for, with it very strongly being hinted that after that is when things will begin to move, and thus indicating to the viewer not to expect anything before that beyond the cast just hanging out and having fun and maybe having some light relationship development along the way. The ends result is that it actually feels a lot like the common route of a moege VN, which is pretty surprising considering this is based on a manga.As such, the anime is entirely reliant on it’s slice of life aspects, which comes down to how likable the heroines are and how good the comedy is. I would have to say that it’s somewhat mixed on both fronts. In terms of comedy it is pretty solid, but also somewhat repetitive, with each character having a single strain of comedy centered around them and it not deviating too much from that. It switched up enough between heroines that it still feels like there’s some variety, but not a tremendous amount. The fact that almost all episodes are split up into two distinct stories also helps in terms of pacing, but it still feels like it’s getting stale at times. As the comedy is such a core part of this anime, because of the comedy getting repetitive in large bursts, I would highly advise not marathoning this, as at least in my case the enjoyment per episode went down after each consecutive episode with it not really being enjoyable at all watching more than two or three episodes at once.In terms of heroines, there seem to be five that seem to be very different in terms of not just traits but narrative structure as well. The most fleshed out of those is Uruka, the childhood friend, who gets a good amount of background and gets the most clear relationship development with Nariyuki. It’s all pretty standard osananajimi trope stuff that is only decent executed, so it’s just okay. The rest of the heroines aren’t just standard tropes and thus aren’t generic, but they’re all fleshed out very little. As such, how likable they are comes solely down to how much their personality stands out. The heroine that felt like she stood out the least is Rizu, who’s supposed to be incredibly logical or something like that, but just didn’t feel all that prominent. There’s also Asumi, who has a bit of a teasing senpai dynamic going on with Nariyuki that makes her stand out somewhat, but at least so far she’s kind of been a side character so she’s also stood out very little.The heroines that stood out the most are the last two, Fumino and Mafuyu, who do it for very different reasons. Mafuyu is straight up a teacher so just based on that she stands out quite a bit, and the situations she ends up getting into with Nariyuki are very different from the situations he ends up getting into with the rest of the heroines. Add on her dichotomous personality, with one side being very strict, prim, and proper, and the other being really lazy and weak-willed and there’s a bit of gap moe going on too.Fumino is interesting, in that unlike the cast of most rom-coms where everyone is terrible at reading other’s feelings, Fumino stands out as someone that is actually really competent at doing so, with the major exception being her own feelings apparently. Because of that, she’s a pretty omnipresent character to other heroines stories as well where she’s helping them out, though at the same time she gets some really strong moments of her own, with her being featured in the finale being the strongest moment in the anime overall I’d say. Though the caveat on that is that the finale overall was pretty underwhelming for a finale, with it only standing out due to the rest of the anime overall being really subdued. All in all though, it isn’t really clear at all who the heroine that’ll get picked will be at all with it not really feeling like there’s anything close to a main heroine, which is actually pretty rare as far as I can tell in such anime, wherein even though the main heroine doesn’t always get picked there usually still is one.In terms of production values it was decent enough in terms of art and animation quality. The art style and character designs were only okay but I appreciated how it seemed to be trying to show them off well. The OP and ED have pretty decent songs and decent visuals for the most part, but they feature visual effects that I don’t really like much, lightly animated manga like pages or lightly animated drawings on a blackboard, so I wasn’t much of a fan overall. The soundtrack was pretty good and actually managed to stand out a bit surprisingly enough. got where he is through hard work, so he’s able to sympathize with wanting to do things one has no talent for, though he’s someone that doesn’t have any particular dream beyond getting into a good college so he’s also envious of them for already having decided on their dreams.

This show focuses on a unique point that i've never seen it in another show till now, it is not that deep as other shows but it is interesting and what's good about it is that you can relate to it when you are watching the show, because it is very common to be in their shoes or to want what they want, this show captures their struggle to get what they want and really good.Cute Characters  ----it is a must have for chill shows to have cute Characters, these type of shows tend to have the cutest characters and behaviors that i personally want to see, this show nailed this really well all the characters feels unique they think differently they act differently and the encounters are not repeated, their reactions and behaviors are very funny and they are way too cute i had so much fun looking at the characters from both visual and behavioral sides and some characters imo can be considered top tier pretty easily.Unique Scenes  ----while shows like this tend to have repetitive ideas / encounters between the MC and the other characters this show has one of the most unique ones I've ever seen. some of them may be derived from similar ideas but they are still unique in it's own manner and they are really fun to watch as they conclude...etcUnique Relationships / Mindsets  ----While Harem shows typically features some sort of a competition between the Girls to win the boys heart this show doesn't really work that way, characters are friendly and helpful to each other and the entire show is a struggle between their loving side who wants to win, the shy side who wants to help or prevent any romance from happeningThe Bad,Teenage Romance  ----it is not the romance talk / encounters that you might want to see, teenage romance is about blushing, getting embarrassed, struggling feelings and hesitations of whether a char likes the MC does the MC likes her back...etc etc these types of romance tend to capture the early phases / behaviors for a romance relationship and while it is not bad if done somewhat with decency but we have seen a lot of those already and tbh compared to the adult romance shows that actually focuses on 2 people in an actual relationship are way better at least for me. what's kinda bad about teenage romance is that there are often some cringe encounters, this show has some of them but they are not abundantVulgar Elements  ----Common stuff that you see in every show of this genre, they seem to follow the same event / encounter pattern and this show is no different, stuff like indirect kiss, people having to stay together for whatever reason or sus / weird excuses to be alone with somebody , fireworks festival, exam period encounters. are some examples of this and yes i know it is a School themed show I'm not talking the events it self i'm talking about how these events are handled , how they occur, what happens during them, what encounters and how they conclude,,,etc this show has some of them which may not feel too good but this doesn't ruin the show at all it still is one of the most unique shows of this genre you shouldn't be missing this show at all it is well refined and no doubt it will give you entertainment. even though it is filled with vulgar scenes, some unique scenes but turns out really good in overall  for this type of shows.The Good,Focus Point  -----shows like this needs to have some sort of a revolving point, some sort of a main focus / journey, it doesn't have to be very deep or unique but they just need to exist or the show will end up like Horimiya lmao.

But I do have a few things I want to say first.To begin, romance is my fav genre. Bunny Girl Senpai, The Quintessential Quintuplets, Rent a girlfriend, all some of my favs!! I love harems and romance in general. So that's not my particular issue with this anime.My enjoyment in shows mostly stems from it's characters. They're my absolute fav part everytime. That's where my issues stem. Takemoto and Rizu, in my opinion, are very unlikable characters. I hate that a ton of the interactions were with them I felt it wasn't...balanced very well especially with Furuhashi, who in my opinion, is the best character and one of the only genuinley kind hearted characters in the show. Her character really shines and is lovely, where the other two's are just really annoying and kind of unlikable because of how they treat others. And again, they were majority of the show, especially Takemoto.I'm not usually against fanservice but I felt there was just a tiny too much where I wanted some sweet cute interactions (the final episode of this season was great!!) There was fanservice I did enjoy but at sometimes it was just too much like every other second they're saying something about Rizu's or Takemoto's chest, or poking fun at Furuhashi's. ): That's another reason why Furuhashi is able to develop best, she isn't always put in the awkward fanservice situations we see a lot of her interactions being a genuinley sweet person and not her chest being zoomed in on every other second. What I'm trying to say mostly, Takemoto and Rizu's character development was honestly hindered by fanservice and it would have been nicer if we could see just a little bit more of their true personality and not just them embarassed.As for the more minor characters, Kirisu and Kominami, I honestly loved them!! Kominami was so refreshing and I honestly didn't expect to like her as much as I did but she is just so great!! Kirisu too!! (And I feel Kirisu is a character where her fanservice was done right and not overdone where it took away from her character.)As for the MC, nothing major to talk about but he is just too sweet and I love him lol he's clumbsy and genuine, over all great!! I can see why people may think he's boring or a basic nice guy but I really don't mind MC's like that and honestly he was just great to see!!Overall, just wanted to ramble a bit about what I liked and disliked about the show. ((: Don't take this too seriously it's not a very serious critique I rate everything I watch with enjoyment and not genuine critisisms or analysis and I really did enjoy the show and am super excited to start season two. If Takemoto and Rizu were more enjoyable characters and had more meaningful.less fanservicy scenes, and more balancing between character screentime (Furuhashi my baby u deserve so much better) could've very easily been a 10!! balanced very well especially with Furuhashi, who in my opinion, is the best character and one of the only genuinley kind hearted characters in the show.

Yes, it's a harem, yes everyone he seems to run into falls in love with him as he is Mr nice guy and looks at the world a little differently.As usual with harems, we see them all hardly knowing him, and falling in love with of course takes away from the story, but at least we see efforts to develop the characters, their backgrounds, and their own idiosyncracies.The anime is far from perfect but is a sweet take on high school romance, the nerves around it, and the worries kids have where don't want...to be rejected.   We also see some class differences between our poor MC and his friends, but they generally don't care, they just don't visit his house.What i liked with this is if a girl saw someone giving attention to the guy, it never ran like the water of a duck back, they reacted, got worried, got angry, frustrated, embarrassed, or worried, unlike many harems.    The fan service was there but was not as bad as some out there like.The truth is it was very quintessential quintuplets with a bit more spunk, Characters of course had stupid errors not identifying the obvious in the typical clueless guy stage, on who is attracted to who, how many people he impressed, and it tried to push, if your just gonna study, you will miss out a lot in life.   I swear half the time, japan loves harem animes, due to the falling birthrate to try and encourage people.The story is just like the final year of high school and is pretty tame, the characters have their own personalities, even if the nerd, the chopping board, the best friend are the generic stereotype girls.   But, you know it would end with a feeling of betrayal possibly, whoever dates him when 3 friends are so close and worries of him sighted at the teachers.The truth is the story was fine, the art was good, the sound ok, the characters were generic but filled out by the anime and I enjoyed it, and overall it was fine to good.    Is no Romeo and Juliet but you're not expecting it with anime, at the rate such things are churned out.   Some people will look at it for its qualities, others will say, not another school romance, is so overdone. to be rejected.

But, you know it would end with a feeling of betrayal possibly, whoever dates him when 3 friends are so close and worries of him sighted at the teachers.The truth is the story was fine, the art was good, the sound ok, the characters were generic but filled out by the anime and I enjoyed it, and overall it was fine to good.    Is no Romeo and Juliet but you're not expecting it with anime, at the rate such things are churned out.   Some people will look at it for its qualities, others will say, not another school romance, is so overdone."", ""Okay so the anime wasn't as bad as some people claim to be, the only problem I have is that the main character is a complete clutz. IMO he didn't choose the right girl but I'm not letting that guide my review though. I enjoyed most part of the anime though sometimes the anime feels slow, rushed, and forced. Especially near the end. It is interesting seeing learn more about the character's backstory and the ending is okay, though not the best for me. You can watch it quickly if you non-stop watch it. Would I recommend it to you; not really. Should you watch...it? If you want to, you probably would enjoy it more than me. it?

Air,https://myanimelist.net/anime/101/Air,"[""Air~ The 1000th Summer...~Story (9/10)Air the story of Yukito Kunisaki, a young man carrying on his family's journey to find the &quot;girl in the sky&quot; and free her from a curse. Stumbling upon a sleepy coastal town, he meets three girls: Misuzu Kamio, Kana Kirishima, and Minagi Tohno. He comes to spend more and more time in the town, living at the Kamio residence with Misuzu and her adopted mother.Some may know, others may not, but Air is based off an ero visual novel by KEY. Thus, each of the main heroines (Misuzu, Kana, and Minagi) each have different scenarios to explore. The short anime...tries its best to explore each scenario, but since it was so short, it felt somewhat rushed and the arcs of Kana and Minagi felt somewhat detached. Thus why the story only gets a 9/10.However, I still rated it so high because the main story (the one of Misuzu) is simply beautiful. It's original, fresh, tear-jerking, and just beautifully done. I'll admit it, I cried at at the end.Most consider Air to be confusing when they watch and don't understand the Kanna arc. I myself got it the first time, but if you don't, just watch it over -- you won't regret it. Most understand it the second time and come to appreciate the series much more.Art (10/10)Kyoto Animation, the company that animated Air, did a stunning job as always. The scenery felt alive like I could just step in, everything flowed smoothly and they're weren't any inconsistencies. Air is set in the summer, and like to watch parts of it in winter when I feel cold -- that's how real it feels. The clouds and skies in particular were stunning, and kudos to them for that, since the sky and flying are important symbols of Air.Sound (9/10)I love, love, love the opening theme to Air (&quot;Tori no Uta&quot; [The Bird's Song] by Lia). It's beautiful and the mood and lyrics reflects all the emotions and events in the series. The ending theme (&quot;Farewell Song&quot; also done by Lia) as well complimented the story and plot wonderfully. The BGM was nicely done, giving off the perfect aura for whatever was going on when it was played. Kudos to the voice actors, also -- they did terrific work on their roles. The character's emotions were conveyed convincingly and they spoke with such emotion it could tear your heart out.Character (8/10)The characters in Air were all alive and I felt for each and every one's issues. The designs on them were varied and I never was annoyed by any character in particular (a nice change for once). However, the reason this rating isn't higher, is because since the anime was so short most characters did not receive the development they were in need of.Final ThoughtsI gave Air an &quot;enjoyment&quot; rating of 10. I don't let this affect my score, however, since it's really a personal thing -- someone who isn't a romance, drama, supernatural sort of thing probably won't like this.

I actually quite liked it, in fact, I like it better than Kanon 2006. There were similarities between the two, like for example, I though the two series had similar characters. Yukito was a lot like Yuichi and Misuzu&rsquo;s story and predicament was a lot like Makoto&rsquo;s. Air&rsquo;s story is also made up of character arcs. I think Air has 3 or 4 character arcs and each arc focuses on one major character at a time.It was a sad anime. The scene when Misuzu was crying out &ldquo;mama!&rdquo; has been embedded into my...anime memories. While it was sad sometimes, there were a lot of funny scenes too. In fact, compared to Kanon 2006, I think Air is the funnier one. Air had a more supernatural theme compared to Kanon as well. Just wait and see what happens in episode 8.The characters are just great. Misuzu is just adorable. I love it when she goes &ldquo;gao&rdquo;. Her story is also the saddest out of all the characters. If you&rsquo;re into cute anime animals like me, you&rsquo;ll probably like Potato the dog. Don&rsquo;t ask &ndash; just see for yourselves and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean. Yukito is great too. He&rsquo;s sarcastic, manly, witty and likable like all the other KyoAni leads. He is a lot like Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Yuichi from Kanon 2006.They were so much alike I thought Yukito was also played by Tomokazu Sugita, but in fact Yukito was played by Daisuke Ono, who was Koizumi Itsuki of another KyoAni series, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I recognized Tomoko Kawakami&rsquo;s voice as Misuzu right away too, since I loved her work as Sayuri of Kanon 2006. She made Misuzu even more adorable.And because it&rsquo;s KyoAni, the animation was just stellar. There&rsquo;s no arguing about that. Watching Air was pleasing to the eyes as well, because the scenes were very delicate and serene. The animation was also very smooth.As for the music, I would have to say that it&rsquo;s a lot similar to Kanon 2006 once again, especially the BGM. The difference is that I liked the music of Air more, because it was less dreary and it complimented Air perfectly.I also have to note that I like the theme of Air TV, which is the importance of having a family. All of the characters are very close to their family members and you&rsquo;ll realize that if you watch the series.I have to say that this is one of the best KyoAni series I&rsquo;ve seen so far.

Air is an anime with a very weird concept which can be pretty difficult to comprehend to begin with. The story basically follows Yukito, the male protagonist who gets to know three girls, each of them having something mysterious and peculiar about them...and their past. It seems that they all are linked in some way to &ldquo;the girl in the sky&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s something they eventually discover. The problem is that behind all the excellent drama lies a very confusing story that can leave anyone thinking &ldquo;where the heck is this going?&rdquo; Yet the show still remains great to watch throughout, plus the 2 amazing OAVs are a bit of an extra.The quality of the animation is the best thing about this show as the story only comes alive with the spectacular visuals that are always on display. The character models are okay, with the cute girls having the typical &ldquo;moe&rdquo; look anime fans are used to. The environment is where the animation truly shines, with an incredible amount of detail put into every aspect and object.On the other hand the music doesn&rsquo;t really do much for the show and is barely even noticeable. At least it has a decent opening and ending theme song. Thanks to &ldquo;Kyoto Animation&rdquo; (the same company later responsible for Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon and Full Metal Panic!) the animation quality of the show remains the strongest aspect and can easily overshadow every other aspects, including the confusing storyline.Overall this is a really interesting, short anime, which can be difficult to understand from the beginning but it improves as more is revealed later on. It always remains very emotional throughout, but the voice actors could have done a better job. So in the end, this can only be recommended to the most open minded romance anime fan or someone whose a fan of other KyoAni works, but I must warn you that this series will get fairly depressing.^_^ and their past.

This evidently should come as no surprise since this is an adaptation of a prized and cherished visual novel made by the adept and adroit studio known as Key, a subsidiary of Visual Art’s.Air is an anime that pertains to a select breed of anime that strive to relay a considerably greater amount of occurrences and revelations to the viewer than one would reasonably anticipate out of a mere half season series. It’s exceptionally high compared to what one of...its banal kindred would habitually consist of. Unfortunately, due to this ambitious and perilous tactic, the series suffers some notable as well as essential drawbacks, and it conspicuously shows it.Yet despite the overwhelming plethora of considerable limitations that certainly should have been excluded from the very beginning regardless of the reasoning, this series still astonishingly manages to attain greatness, albeit to a certain degree.Though I obliged to address the concept to my fellow viewers that contradictory and disparate to the bulk of anime in existence, this particular series is very special in regard to that, based on what your own personal preferences are for what you seek in anime, will determine your individual impressions of the quality of Air.For those of you who are compelled and oblige only specific aspects within a series to be adequate and efficient, then Air will absolutely satisfy you to the fullest extent, since after all this is indeed a very captivating anime.Themes: 8One unrecognized and unsigned theme that is extant in Air is undeniably mystery, though this is inadvertent rather than actually deliberate, and is very detrimental to the development of the plot. The constant sense of aggravating bewilderment significantly hinders your level of cognition, but fortunately isn’t quite to the unbearable extent of being imperious though.Nevertheless it still wistfully manages to prevail over and detract from the strong points of the series, resulting in an inadvertently jumbled and convoluted conclusion that leaves you somewhat perplexed, making you wonder what the main point(s) genuinely were.The romance was rather subtle though providentially not quite tenuous, it was very heartwarming and rousing, without incorporating any sense of archetypical sensuality (aka fan service). It’s verily admirable how the romance was quite effectively and flawlessly executed in such a manner, considering Air was twain an adult visual novel as well as an eroge.The slice of life is prevalent throughout the entire series, though predominantly integrated into the introduction and opening episodes. Despite the profusion of chaos, pandemonium and tragedy, as well as melancholy ambiance that prevails throughout the entire duration, slice of life still acquires a fitting place in Air, and deserves admiration for accomplishing such a feat.Every Key adaptation acquires their impressive and majestic artistic, as well as imaginative excellence from the supernatural aspects that are incorporated into them, and Air is indubitably no exception to this inclination. However ironically this element of Air is what delivers the gradual and continuous sense of befuddlement, especially nearing the bizarre conclusion. If only the supernatural elements would have been utilized adequately and appropriately.That’s what happens when you consolidate a rather comprehensive and intricate novel into only an incompatible half season adaptation, the inept result is merely an insufficient and convoluted anime.Unlike the supernatural elements, Air’s drama is virtually impeccable, no imperative flaws exist whatsoever. There is a bountiful variety of absolute awe-inspiring and defining heartbreaking as well as heartwarming moments that you will remember forever. No matter the magnitude of any particular predicament or occurrence, it’s repeatedly presented in a glamorous and charismatic style.Once again there is yet another theme is extant within Air that is queerly unrecognized for obscure reasoning, comedy. The comedy is tenuous throughout, but is very mollifying and is effective at alleviating, in addition to counteracting the gradual escalating climatic revelations being discerned by the protagonist(s).Main Points/Messages: 6Constructing an adequate review for Air’s vague and indeterminate main points is a rather onerous challenge to confront, though I will do my utmost to reach that feat since I feel this anime deserves it.Air is very similar and akin to my previous anime review in regard to that, the main points are addressed in an evasive and indirect manner. It requires a considerable amount of attentiveness to notice them all, since their conferred abruptly and rather erratically. The reasoning for utilizing them in such an outlandish and audacious manner is enigmatic to me, and is anyone’s guess. Likely the origin of this predicament is that numerous impolitic and imprudent alterations were required in order to adapt Air into only a half season, and quite frankly, Kyoto Animation definitely dropped the ball in that regard.Though a profusion of avid fans of this adaptation and Kyoto Animation will indubitably loathe me intensely for stating this and will try their utmost to dispute and disprove this, there is absolutely no motive or even purpose for this faulty as well as negligent execution of addressing the main points/messages of the plot. Surely KyoAni could’ve done more if they truly aspired to make this series greater, why they seemingly chose to neglect this notion and not give this exceptional adaptation the diligence it merited, we’ll never know.Putting the flaws aside, the essential messages addressed through the dialogue occurring adjacent to climatic scenes are exceptional and extraordinary, regardless of the execution. The supernatural elements incorporated into the main points make it all the more glamorous and elegant, not to mention fascinating as long as you can tolerate a lack of thorough understanding and attentive constantly.I’d be delighted to discuss in extensive detail each individual main point presented but I will refrain from revealing spoilers if possible, in accordance with the site’s updated rules.Story: 8The plot itself as I’ve previously stated is excessively variegated and convoluted, you simply won’t wholly comprehend everything that transpires throughout its duration. Still the exiguous story somehow administers a sense of adequate uniformity and superb elegance, it’s as if the series itself was unwilling and reluctant to allow itself to fall to the depths of ruin. Air is truly superlative and inspirational considering that this anime still managed to retain a compelling as well as distinguished story, despite the plethora of unjust limitations enacted upon its inception.Characters: 9It’s meritorious and quite impressive how the voice actors implemented such a gratifying and exquisite performance with the script they were constrained to work with. Each individual character was very pragmatic and unique, absolutely no archetypes extant in Air whatsoever. They all are first-class examples of exemplary characters, vibrant, astute, and dynamic, they virtually resemble real homo sapiens. Overall the pristine quality of the characters is on par with other notable Key anime adaptations.Art: 9Considering Air was released in 2005, it’s very alluring and angelic to say the least. The landscapes portrayed were ordinary yet hypnagogic, and very radiant. The character animations were aberrant without being disproportionate to be more appealing or to conform to a particular viewer type.Sound: 9The voice actor’s well, voices themselves were adapted to absolute perfection for the characters they represented, truly magnificent performances executed throughout the entire cast. The general sound effects were adequate and alluring, in addition to being very well balanced. Another opulent as well as sumptuous aspect about Air was the imaginative and absolute breathtaking music present within every individual episode. It’s quintessential for delivering the tone for the series, and does so flawlessly. The OST for Air is certainly one of the best I’ve heard, it’s a true personal treasure to possess.Enjoyment: 8Despite the abundance of ridicule and bantering I’ve bestowed upon this anime, it still was a very outstanding and accomplished series, despite how much it unfortunately simply couldn’t achieve due to its design limitations. The auxiliary and subsidiary aspects are genuinely what sustained the quality and more importantly are what luckily sustained Air’s virtue in addition to sophisticated excellence that its novel consisted of. This is certainly a distinguishing and adept anime, especially considering the unjust alterations enacted upon it, with a very imaginative, inventive, as well as ingenious plot that any anime fan should watch regardless of its aggravating drawbacks.Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, will gladly and readily listen to any comments and opinions of my reviews as to better future reviews. These reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not to merely state my impressions of it just for fun, thanks! its banal kindred would habitually consist of.

Despite the profusion of chaos, pandemonium and tragedy, as well as melancholy ambiance that prevails throughout the entire duration, slice of life still acquires a fitting place in Air, and deserves admiration for accomplishing such a feat.Every Key adaptation acquires their impressive and majestic artistic, as well as imaginative excellence from the supernatural aspects that are incorporated into them, and Air is indubitably no exception to this inclination. However ironically this element of Air is what delivers the gradual and continuous sense of befuddlement, especially nearing the bizarre conclusion. If only the supernatural elements would have been utilized adequately and appropriately.That’s what happens when you consolidate a rather comprehensive and intricate novel into only an incompatible half season adaptation, the inept result is merely an insufficient and convoluted anime.Unlike the supernatural elements, Air’s drama is virtually impeccable, no imperative flaws exist whatsoever. There is a bountiful variety of absolute awe-inspiring and defining heartbreaking as well as heartwarming moments that you will remember forever. No matter the magnitude of any particular predicament or occurrence, it’s repeatedly presented in a glamorous and charismatic style.Once again there is yet another theme is extant within Air that is queerly unrecognized for obscure reasoning, comedy. The comedy is tenuous throughout, but is very mollifying and is effective at alleviating, in addition to counteracting the gradual escalating climatic revelations being discerned by the protagonist(s).Main Points/Messages: 6Constructing an adequate review for Air’s vague and indeterminate main points is a rather onerous challenge to confront, though I will do my utmost to reach that feat since I feel this anime deserves it.Air is very similar and akin to my previous anime review in regard to that, the main points are addressed in an evasive and indirect manner. It requires a considerable amount of attentiveness to notice them all, since their conferred abruptly and rather erratically. The reasoning for utilizing them in such an outlandish and audacious manner is enigmatic to me, and is anyone’s guess. Likely the origin of this predicament is that numerous impolitic and imprudent alterations were required in order to adapt Air into only a half season, and quite frankly, Kyoto Animation definitely dropped the ball in that regard.Though a profusion of avid fans of this adaptation and Kyoto Animation will indubitably loathe me intensely for stating this and will try their utmost to dispute and disprove this, there is absolutely no motive or even purpose for this faulty as well as negligent execution of addressing the main points/messages of the plot. Surely KyoAni could’ve done more if they truly aspired to make this series greater, why they seemingly chose to neglect this notion and not give this exceptional adaptation the diligence it merited, we’ll never know.Putting the flaws aside, the essential messages addressed through the dialogue occurring adjacent to climatic scenes are exceptional and extraordinary, regardless of the execution. The supernatural elements incorporated into the main points make it all the more glamorous and elegant, not to mention fascinating as long as you can tolerate a lack of thorough understanding and attentive constantly.I’d be delighted to discuss in extensive detail each individual main point presented but I will refrain from revealing spoilers if possible, in accordance with the site’s updated rules.Story: 8The plot itself as I’ve previously stated is excessively variegated and convoluted, you simply won’t wholly comprehend everything that transpires throughout its duration. Still the exiguous story somehow administers a sense of adequate uniformity and superb elegance, it’s as if the series itself was unwilling and reluctant to allow itself to fall to the depths of ruin. Air is truly superlative and inspirational considering that this anime still managed to retain a compelling as well as distinguished story, despite the plethora of unjust limitations enacted upon its inception.Characters: 9It’s meritorious and quite impressive how the voice actors implemented such a gratifying and exquisite performance with the script they were constrained to work with. Each individual character was very pragmatic and unique, absolutely no archetypes extant in Air whatsoever. They all are first-class examples of exemplary characters, vibrant, astute, and dynamic, they virtually resemble real homo sapiens. Overall the pristine quality of the characters is on par with other notable Key anime adaptations.Art: 9Considering Air was released in 2005, it’s very alluring and angelic to say the least. The landscapes portrayed were ordinary yet hypnagogic, and very radiant. The character animations were aberrant without being disproportionate to be more appealing or to conform to a particular viewer type.Sound: 9The voice actor’s well, voices themselves were adapted to absolute perfection for the characters they represented, truly magnificent performances executed throughout the entire cast. The general sound effects were adequate and alluring, in addition to being very well balanced. Another opulent as well as sumptuous aspect about Air was the imaginative and absolute breathtaking music present within every individual episode. It’s quintessential for delivering the tone for the series, and does so flawlessly. The OST for Air is certainly one of the best I’ve heard, it’s a true personal treasure to possess.Enjoyment: 8Despite the abundance of ridicule and bantering I’ve bestowed upon this anime, it still was a very outstanding and accomplished series, despite how much it unfortunately simply couldn’t achieve due to its design limitations. The auxiliary and subsidiary aspects are genuinely what sustained the quality and more importantly are what luckily sustained Air’s virtue in addition to sophisticated excellence that its novel consisted of. This is certainly a distinguishing and adept anime, especially considering the unjust alterations enacted upon it, with a very imaginative, inventive, as well as ingenious plot that any anime fan should watch regardless of its aggravating drawbacks.Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, will gladly and readily listen to any comments and opinions of my reviews as to better future reviews. These reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not to merely state my impressions of it just for fun, thanks!', 'Let me start off by saying that I can be known for despising moe with the pure unbridled passion of a thousand blazing suns. BUT! I thought it only fair to explain why I hate it with a review of possibly the best show that moe has to offer up. “So, why the bile, JesuOtaku, what’s wrong with the heartwarming moe story?” you may ask. You may not have asked that nicely, but whatever.Well, before I get into that, I should probably praise all the things Air does right that make it by far my favorite moe title. Don’t get too excited, that’s like...looking in a dirt pail for me and picking out a “favorite” worm to use as bass bait.Air is emotionally a rewarding experience. Unlike in most moe shows, the other characters actually express Misuzu’s trademark moe quirks: the mental retardation, animal noises, strange tastes, and clumsiness, to be really weird and cause for real concern instead of just finding them charming. This makes her character more accessible, and on the whole the characters in Air are relatable enough to make the emotional gut-busters of the conclusion truly gut-busting. The story is emotionally honest, raw and unflinching, and will have many individuals clawing for their Kleenex when they least expect it. I was genuinely touched by Air’s conclusion, and my heart is a dried brown potpourri ball fit only to spice up the lavatories of a state penitentiary.On the technical side of things, Air is smashingly well-animated, something enthusiasts of Kyo-Ani have come to expect, as they produced the famous Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya among other girl-aimed shows with the budget and finesse usually reserved for boy-aimed shows.The music is oddly intricate, usually light, feathery orchestral ballads that never overtake the action onscreen, but flow underneath it subtly enough to work well, and the same can be said of the fluffy opener and closer.The voice acting in both languages is sufficient, with moments of greatness. The three main roles are cast nigh perfectly in the dub, with Luci Christian making an incredible star turn as Haruko, as if I didn’t like her enough as an actress, her work here is phenomenal and as I said, Vic Mignogna and Monica Rial sound born to play Yukito and Misuzu respectively, never missing a beat. The rest of the cast is fairly average to melodramato-bad, but you know what, they aren’t important.How could I possibly say the other characters aren’t important?...I must, for I must bring out the ugly stick now. Yeah, I was moved by this story, but that’s because Air basically planted its petite well-animated foot up my backside and shoved me on my face, which of course just watered up from the abuse. You MUST turn your brain off to think this is a good story. It would be vile enough with the number of badly written platitudes that pop up now and again, but the plot, no matter how you slice it, is CONTRIVED and MANIPULATIVE, and therefore, so is the emotion that you feel when you watch it. The other girls never serve any purpose to the main conflict, in fact, I want someone to messagel me and tell me WHAT purpose they honestly served at ALL except to serve the schoolgirl fetish population.Yes, I went there, because moe is Freudian. It is created innocent so the male viewers won’t feel bad fantasizing about the nonexistent fanservice that is fed to us through arbitrary tragedy rather than panty shots. I know there are women that enjoy it and also men that enjoy it in a non-dirty fashion, but that’s not what it was created for, you bet your sweet potatoes.All of these characters have an inexplicable tragic past or terminal disease that is usually tied to the supernatural and rarely has anything to do with the main idea of the story, if there even was one to begin with. Air tries to have a point, but only obtains one in the relationship between Haruko and Misuzu in the very end that I sorely wish had been the focus of the entire show instead of the typical boring boy learning about helpless girls in town pattern that proved pointless when all was said and done. That’s also a staple of the hentai games these shows came from...In the end, all Air really does is exploit your tear ducts without giving you a reason as to why anything happens, besides the words “magic,” “gods,” and “destiny,” which I will follow with the words “deus ex machina.” And also the words “screw that.” If I’m weepy at the end of something, I want it to be because the story meant something to me, because I learned something about the characters, maybe even about life, if that’s not too heavy to consider. I don’t want it to be because, yes, I was sucker-punched by pretty art, pretty music, and good acting pasted on a plot with all the finesse of a bad fanfiction written by that fetish guy I mentioned earlier. You know who you are. Go ahead, give me a good reason WHY there are so many girls near death or madness in this show, so I can stop beating this poor dead horse and let it gallop back to its home on the set of Days of our Lives! I recommend this to moe fans, really I do. After that, I recommend you click off this review and scan your TV for Lifetime channel where you will find live-action versions of the well-written drama presented in Air.All in all, a beautiful title where the tears and angst really are only ink-deep. Still, the pretty exterior and tenderness did trick me. It held my interest every step of the way until I stepped back and saw how silly it really was, so I’ll be kinder to that favorable result.*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW THAT CAN BE SEEN HERE:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ib-l3CIbv8Thanks for reading! looking in a dirt pail for me and picking out a “favorite” worm to use as bass bait.Air is emotionally a rewarding experience.

I saw the japanese version, btw.Well, I think you can immediately tell what I thought about this and downvoted me respectively. Cool, whatevs. But I really did not like this series...mostly. Haven\'t seen anything else from this series, I believe it\'s based on some visual novels or whatever. I don\'t know, but these 13 episodes were ulitmately not a good experience by themselves at least.There is technically an overall story to all of this. It\'s a shame it\'s far too vague and pointlessly cionfusing in an attempt to be deep. I mostly get what they...were going for but it just didn\'t work. It was just boring and with some painfully obvious sky, above the clouds, birds etc. metaphors all about the same general idea.The characters are a different story. Normally I complain in a series that the secondary characters aren\'t used enough. This series has the opposite problem. Those 3 other girls that aren\'t Misuzu I honestly can\'t stand. It is the perfect mix of the most generic and boring comedy from them, followed by some poorly written tragedy. The 2 ""sisters"" story is honestly one of the best examples ever of making tragic events combined with magic and suicide symbolism...and being boring. It\'s just dialogue not said by any human being and I can\'t stand it. I just feel somewhat depressed watching it, yet at the same time bored. And it really feels like it\'s trying way too hard to be deep and annoys me. So by episode 6, I was hating this series (and while previous episodes were better, they weren\'t that much better). And I came into this series expecting it to at least be good, so I was truly dissappointed.And then those characters were basically never seen again, focused on characters that mattered and it got better real quick. I was actually enjoying it after that. Flashback episodes with character names I can\'t remember had characters that were fun and kinda funny and enjoyable to be around and not depressionly boring. My god, that was fun. They have an adventure and find her mother. I liked those characters for what they were. It wasn\'t like amazing but I liked it, and I do admit I like any sudden increase of action in a series that at first has none. The ending of that story was silly but ok.And then we spend the rest of the series focusing on Misuzu and her mother. Again, some weirdness, but the sad parts work. I can see why her mother acted as she did and her struggle with her relationship with Misuzu felt genuinely touching. Not to mention the twists, while kinda dumb, made you sad but not bored this time. You wanted to see both characters are ok, which is always important, I think especially for a series like this. I was not exactly in tears but it was really sad, a good story, I enjoyed it.And of course the big final episode is a recap...wait what? Really? Couldn\'t let the show end on a high note I guess or it was used to advertise some sequel OVA or I don\'t know. The point is that I hated the first half but kinda liked the 2nd half for the most part.The art was ok. I don\'t know, the faces I didn\'t exactly like but...the art was ok. It was too bright at times but it still looked decent. Sound was mostly ok, although the voice acting could get annoying for those secondary characters I don\'t like. But that\'s made up by the performances of Aya Hisakawa and the late Tomoko Kawakami. Misuzu\'s aunt is the best character and the voice acting helped...or maybe vice versa. But I did buy from her voice the drama of those last few episodes. Misuzu herself was also good, a role that could have been annoying is made genuinely sweet yet tragic. Most of the rest are just ok, not worth mentioning at all really. Same with the music, but that being said, I really like the OP. Good stuff.Yeah, maybe this series isn\'t one made for me. But one of my favorite series is the fairly depressing Welcome to the NHK!, which was written infinitely better and got how to make characters act and talk like real people more than almost any fiction I\'ve ever seen. This show, rarely got remotely close sadly. And I know a decent amount of people who agree so at least I know I\'m not alone. It isn\'t an awful series if you can get past episode 6, and in fact if you ignore episodes 2-6 I would likely call it a good series. But those episodes were awful, could not enjoy it at all, and the rest of the series was unable to make me fully forgive that.

This was a person I trusted and who introduced me to Ghost In The Shell. WOW.. Wasn't he wrong. A lot of people have given Air rave reviews, but I found it to be boring and at times, down right annoying.I found the story slow, repetitive and predictable. The major &quot;Twists&quot; could be seen from a mile away. The best parts of the story were the short and sweet subplots and flashbacks which I must admit,...were quite entertaining. But the main story of Misuzu really just annoyed me.I did think the overall art work in the series was good, it's not my normal taste in style but I thought it was cute and worked well, though some of the characters did seem a little underdrawn, even unfinished, but I liked it, it was a pleasurable change to the perfect well rounded style we tend to see everywhere else.The characters overall were well presented and all had distinctive interesting personalities. Unfortunately Misuzu annoyed the hell out of me, her annoying voice, bad habbits, The fact that she had a mental age at least 7 years prior to her physical age, and overall demeanor were so bad that it overshadowed the rest of the good characters and made them unnoticeable.The only other thing I feel I need to say about the characters is Potato, This quirky little puppy is reason alone to sit through the 13 episodes of crap. You are much better off just typing his name into a youtube search and watching the little clips they have of him.From the 4th or 5th episode watching this Anime became more like work than a passtime, the only reason I watched it through was that my friend was so convinced that it was the greatest thing ever, I assumed that somewhere something happened that made things fall into place and I'd start to enjoy it. Unfortunately this was only a pipe dream.Overall I wouldn't recomend this anime. Though to some people it must have more meaning or appeal than it did to me, as it has many many other rave reviews.If you do decide to pursue this anime, I wish you luck. were quite entertaining.

Running on an ethereal kind of magical realism and raw human emotion, it is a roller coaster for the heart that, even three years later, I can't bear to forget.Air is about a young girl named Misuzu Kamio, who meets a drifter named Yukito on the first day of summer. Misuzu wants to make Yukito her friend and so she offers to let him stay at her place with her and her mother, Haruko. Yukito reluctantly takes advantage of her...hospitality, and in doing so, learns that Misuzu may be a clue to something he's been looking for.From there, the story progresses gradually, focusing on the characters, including other girls Yukito meets. Each girl brings another piece of the puzzle to the story. What's so wonderful about the story is how multi-faceted and multi-layered the story is. Because it is so densely packed with vital information, some of it gets lost along the way. This gives the series a massive amount of rewatch value until you can gather all the pieces and understand the entire story yourself. Of course, this doesn't mean you have to watch the series repeatedly to enjoy it. It's just a good idea to watch it more than once if you want to understand everything.Though the players in this magical tragedy are moe cliches, each is given certain aspects to their personality that set them apart. In most cases, each character comes with a backstory with the intention of ripping out your heartstrings. This may seem overdramatic for some viewers, but I think it works. Especially as it makes some not-so-enjoyable characters early on pretty darn amazing in terms of characterization.Though it was Haruhi that put Kyoto Animation on the map, Air offers the same lush fluid animation that the studio is now revered for. The character designs are quite wonky, especially regarding the eyes, which are abnormally huge even by anime standards. A blending of Key's design and KyoAni's style, the character look won't appeal to everyone, but you can't fault the quality of the rest of the production.The animation is accompanied by a grand soundtrack. This is one thing that really sets Air apart from other game adaptations in that the anime keeps the soundtrack of the original game rather than create it's own. This was a brilliant move as the many pieces of accompaniment are epic on an emotional scale, from the OP music, to the background pieces, and especially the unforgettable insert, &quot;Aozora&quot;, from the final episode. The soundtrack works perfectly every time, every scene.Overall, this is one of my favorite anime of all time. Extensive replay value, raw often brutal emotion, set against a rich animated tapestry and set to one of the most beautiful soundtracks known to anime.Overall I give Air a 9 out of 10. hospitality, and in doing so, learns that Misuzu may be a clue to something he's been looking for.From there, the story progresses gradually, focusing on the characters, including other girls Yukito meets.

The tragedy of Misuzu and the whole theme of flying and freedom and destiny was pretty cool and the story ended up being an enjoyable one despite the complexity behind it.Art: OMG...Air has to be THE best looking anime I have ever...seen, everything on this show was just stunning gorgeous and the colours were bright and alive. The sky and the water and the characters and the background were all just a feast to the eye and made the show VERY pretty to look at.

But the background songs really made the show enjoyable and sad to watch.Character: Other than Yukito I never got attached to any character and its understandable since these type of shows focus on a certain girl for a set number of episodes and this being only a 12 episode series (ep 13 a recap) you just dont get the chance to truly get used to the characters since their airtime is relative short. But other than that it was still sad to watch their tragedies/problems unfoldEnjoyment: This was a great show to watch, I wish it wasnt so confusing otherwise I would've given it a higher score but Air is still a show I sometimes rewatch because of how pretty it is.Overall this is one show that does not disappoint and is definitely STUNNING to look at, it was because of Air that I started to watch more Visual Novel adaptations, specially if they were from the dynamic duo Key/KyoAni seen, everything on this show was just stunning gorgeous and the colours were bright and alive. The sky and the water and the characters and the background were all just a feast to the eye and made the show VERY pretty to look at.

A small example of this would be the extent this show went to show how imma\xadture Mis\xaduzu was. It went to quite ridicu\xadlous extremes. The sum\xadmer diary, the teddy dino\xadsaurs, the ‘will you play with me’, right up to the point when she cut her hair, she could have just as eas\xadily been 6 years old and I wouldn’t have bat\xadted an eye\xadlid. But that’s not really cri\xadti\xadcism, is it. It’s just some\xadthing I didn’t like. It’s like cri\xadti\xadciz\xading Hanamaru Kinder\xadgarden...because no real child has the depth of  know\xadledge Hiiragi has. It’s like “so? that’s what makes her awesome!”.The entire second half of the show was basic\xadally one huge sob drama story. Everything was tossed in to make this story even more sob-inducing than before. I’ll keep away from spoil\xading any\xadthing but mak\xading the lead female char\xadac\xadter sicker with every passing epis\xadode and mak\xading the mother feel even more attached to her with each epis\xadode felt way too manip\xadu\xadlat\xadive. Not that there’s exactly any\xadthing wrong with being manip\xadu\xadlat\xadive. Often it’s the sign of a good story teller. But never once did I give a fuck what happened to any\xadone in that show. Some people get sucked in incred\xadibly eas\xadily into sob stor\xadies and for them, Air con\xadstantly throws them moments to feast upon. I sup\xadpose you could say that Air needed more epis\xadodes to make me care about these char\xadac\xadters but I don’t buy that. Double the epis\xadode count and all I can see hap\xadpen\xading is doub\xadling the amount heart\xadbreak\xading situ\xadations involving Misuzu.I don’t care. I just don’t care and fail to ever care about these manip\xadu\xadlat\xadive sob stor\xadies. I liked Clan\xadnad for the double blow of excel\xadlent storytelling and the char\xadac\xadter of Tomoya, but rarely cared that much about the sob stor\xadies bey\xadond how they fit\xadted into the story. Air never felt like it was com\xadpos\xading a coher\xadent, well struc\xadtured story. It was just fling\xading these bloody baawwww situ\xadations at the screen over and over and never once did I care. In fact, I can only think of one time I did care. That was when that winged girl was try\xading to juggle for her mother. As someone who’s quite good at jug\xadgling myself, I know the pain of hav\xading to con\xadstantly pick up those blas\xadted things, although I get the feel\xading that wasn’t what I was meant to be sad about.The first half of the series wasn’t exactly that bad either. At least it cre\xadated the atmo\xadsphere of sum\xadmer well and I quite liked the lead male char\xadac\xadter.

And from where I stand today, I have to say, I really liked Air.The story was very good and it flowed at a continuous speed so that was good.  The art was nice too although the characters did look very cartoonish at times because their eyes were like 3/4 of the size of their face and it did bother me a little bit that all these young girls had heaving chests.  Minor details I...guess.Each character is so different yet so similar, drawn together by the town, the history and lonliness sprung from some misfortune.  I thought it was ironic how such a beautifully drawn anime can bring to life the darkest of human experiences - pain, sadness and lonliness.  A classic freeze frame that I always envision when I think of Air is Misuzu standing on the ocean dam reaching for the sky with the ocean breeze blowing past her.... she did her best.... so watch it! guess.Each character is so different yet so similar, drawn together by the town, the history and lonliness sprung from some misfortune.

Did it have an interesting plot? Did it even have a plot to begin with? Air is an anime that has recieved much praise from many people and I just have to say; it must be me who is in the wrong in thinking this anime is below mediocre, it must be me right?When I first started watching Air I had rather high expectations and you know what? They were shattered right off the bat. The first episode did not deliver the way I had thought it would, the only thing it delievered was good animation...and art yet characters that were so unbearable that if it hadn't been for all that praise by so many people, I'd dropped the anime after the first episode. In retrospective I should have.I fundamentally like anime, I like almost all genres when they are executed well with some redeeming points as a good storyboard (or even a storyboard at all), good screenplay and/or good characters and character development. But you see, when an anime fail in delivering any of these the way you expected them to be delivered you start to wonder. I can agree that some of the issues this anime address are interesting, or would have been if the two main characters hadn't been such drags. Seriously where did they find the two main characters? I am absolutely certain there must be some factory that produces mediocre bland characters that you can just copy and paste into your story-lacking anime. In a word you can describe this anime as boring.Many people like this anime though, many see it as one of the best ever made, many find deep meanings and important themes and issues being addressed in a wonderfully executed manner, but you know what; you're wrong. and art yet characters that were so unbearable that if it hadn't been for all that praise by so many people, I'd dropped the anime after the first episode.

Upon first look this may seem like your typical &quot;boy meets a bunch of women---perverseness ensues.&quot;  Trust me though, this anime is far from that.The story revolves around the legend of &quot;the girl in the sky,&quot; who is said to carry the entire world's burdens. Enter Misuzu Kamio, a typical little girl that likes dinosaurs and lives with her mom in a quiet little town, but who may also have some sort of connection to the legend. She lives mostly a solitude life in her town, that is...until one day when a stranger happens to visit the small sea side residents. Who finds out that their meeting is not just a mere coincidence.The character design and art style is smooth, sharp and just purely detailed! I especially liked the character's eyes in this series. That along with a memorable soundtrack and surprising plot twists, this is definitely a series you should pick up. Only downside I could think of was, its short and the story and ending can be a bit on the confusing side.All in all though,if you found what I said interesting, then you can't go wrong with this title.

Check it out!"", ""Air, unfortunatly, was the worst anime I've ever watched. It had alot of potential, but in the end it took a severe swerve onto the wtf-highway.Air is about Yukito Kunisaki, a young man who travels looking for a woman his mother had told him about in a story. On his travels, he meets Misuzu Kamio. The two become good friends, but a disease bed-rids Misuzu and leaves her fighting for her life.Now, up until that part, everything in the anime had been good, all the makings for a great ending. Until of course, as you'll see, it turned for the worst. As Misuzu...is on her last legs, Yukito comes in and sacrifices himself to save her (it was a very hard-to-explain turn of events, and even if I told you it would spoil it).You are then sent on a long and boring arch of the life of a group of three living in Feudal Japan, and as before, its hard to explain and would spoil the anime.So now back to the main story, what do you find? A crow. Thats right, we are now following the life of a freaking crow. Yukito reincarnate, yea, but still a freakin crow. We go into this screwed up kind of recap where we see what we already watched, but now through a crow's eyes. Except now Yukito (who is not in crow form) runs away instead of helping Misuzu.Now we watch a few, final episodes watching Misuzu's condition decay and eventually have her *spoiler here* die. Then thats it, aside from a part where Yukito (in crow form) sets out on a journey to find the flying woman, again. But this time as a crow. Yea, a crow. This is how they end the anime.Air had good potential and its episodes leading up to that giant wtf-moment of an ending, heck it was a great anime up until then. Yet the ending totally washed any good feeling I had for this anime out, and all around was a really bad ending.I personally would not suggest watching this anime unless you like watching good episodes only to be given a horrid excuse for an end, but then again is up to you. is on her last legs, Yukito comes in and sacrifices himself to save her (it was a very hard-to-explain turn of events, and even if I told you it would spoil it).You are then sent on a long and boring arch of the life of a group of three living in Feudal Japan, and as before, its hard to explain and would spoil the anime.So now back to the main story, what do you find?

Better late than never, as is once again proven in this case.I was rather sceptical at first when I began watching the show, despite my initial belief I\'d like it since, you know, I\'d planned on watching it in the first place. My fears were reinforced as what I was bombarded with during the first few episodes were things I\'ve...grown to dislike very muchly in anime: moe characters, overcute faces, irresponsible parents and other lame cliches of Japanese cartoons. Thus my willingness to watch the show dimmed to the point I almost gave up, watching only an episode every now and then almost solely for the sake of finishing what I\'d started. Ultimately I ended up marathoning the last seven episodes in one night; a feat which speaks for itself for someone who\'s used to watch that many episodes in as many weeks.No, the irritating moe-ness of the characters didn\'t go anywhere. No, the über childish faces with gigantic eyes and tiny mouths didn\'t grow into tolerable proportions at any time. No, the careless parents didn\'t develop into Mr. and Mrs. guardian of the year overnight...quite. But the better qualities of the show which became more prominent as the series went on overrode almost completely any and all disgust I have for such superficial issues.The gorgeous artwork of the anime is one of those qualities that is evident from the very beginning. Lush colors of the deep blue sea and sky, the green of the forests and the yellow of the fields all together reach the goal of showing us an ethereal summer at it\'s very peak. Something which surely comes in handy in a show where one of the main motifs is that sunny and warm season of the year. The show\'s highlighted summery atmosphere is not exclusively limited to the daytime sceneries either, for the brilliant sunsets where the world seems to be in fire and the hot nights alive with festivals are depicted so captivatingly one can almost feel the summer through the screen alone. No wonder so many have recommended this anime to be watched precisely in this time of year.The plot, as many have become accustomed to with the combination of Key and Kyoto Animation, is filled with mysteries. On one hand it arouses interest to go on watching the anime and find out what\'s going on. On the other it evokes frustration and anger as not all of the storyline\'s oddities are so easily comprehended in stride (or at all). I for one had to go over all the MAL summaries and character profiles to be sure I\'d gotten _most_ of it correctly. Patience is a virtue here.Characterization was one aspect of AIR which I was pleasantly surprised with later on. On some occasions I truly felt like the show was taking distance from some of the most typical character cliches seen in anime: Haruko, though a single-parent female, ain\'t your typical loving and all-can-do big sister for Misuzu, instead exercising in behavior both jerk-ish, cowardly, and cruel at times. Misuzu\'s father, though having ""abandoned"" his daughter a long time ago, isn\'t presented as an all-around dickhead with no compassion or other redeeming qualities whatsoever. For what little he\'s got screen time anyway.As for the main couple, Misuzu and Yukito, I can easily recognize their charm as well, even though they weren\'t quite my favorites. Misuzu is this very young, sweet, and lonely girl who\'s desperate to make friends yet is unable to do so for the special conditions she has. I suspect there are very few anime fans who cannot identify with her in that regard. Yukito on the other hand is a fine specimen of the relatively small group of tsundere males seen in anime, though I confess I didn\'t feel any connection with him at times - I couldn\'t have declined Misuzu\'s pleas to play with her the way he did at all. ;-; The more minor characters Minagi, Michiru, and Dr. Kirishima had their own, well-done story-arcs, but the characters themselves remained rather thin and generic to me. Props for Kanna, Ryuuya, and Uraha, though, their own small story was very warm and touching.Drama is something you can never count out when dealing with KyoAni\'s adaptation of a Key-work, and drama is aplenty in AIR as well. On some points the show truly clutched at my heart nastily as I watched the characters struggling in their personal affairs - whether it was about them stewing in their own stupidity or desperately trying to do what they knew to be the right thing. Many a time I found myself staring at the screen mouth open, my mind either screaming of cheering at the characters. This level of viewer\'s emotional involvement with the story is always a merit in its favor.AIR has also some powerful messages about life in general to deliver, ranging from the value of family to the art of appreciating what you\'re given. For the sake of keeping away from spoilers I won\'t go into great detail in this area, but there\'s one fitting quote that stuck in my mind which surmises quite well one of the show\'s themes.""I wonder how many years it took us to get here. We had so many opportunities to see this beautiful scenery. What the hell were we doing?""The musical efforts invested into AIR deserve an honorable mention as well. I recall no scene which would\'ve lacked the proper background tunes to help it reach its full potential, and both the opening and ending songs are memorable with their soaring vocals, atmospheric lyrics and catchy melodies. Admittedly I\'m personally in the habit of nearly always skipping both credits, but this time I felt a bit bad for doing so. Which speaks volumes of the series\' musical score in its own way.All in all, I believe AIR is a very good choice for the next short anime-series you might want to watch. It asks only for your patience and observation. In return you get a wonderfully animated show with candy for your eyes, touching emotions on your heart, and another memory for your summer. grown to dislike very muchly in anime: moe characters, overcute faces, irresponsible parents and other lame cliches of Japanese cartoons.

Air forces a complex plot on the viewer that doesn't fit well, which leads to its downfall.Air's story starts out pretty simple, but soon takes some emotional turns with characters we've barely met. The logical choice would be for our MC to leave or ignore these girls who need help, but he becomes ever so close into figuring out his mother's  tale. 1 cour was not enough to fill even 1 route from the VN and in turn, leaves the anime viewer...confused as to what's happening. 3/10The art and sound are excellent for the time, and still hold up today. The animation would still be considered nice to look at now, and the music is very emotional and works in favor of the writers wishes. 7/10 art and 6/10 sound.The characters aren't anything amazing. Right at the start, we meet almost an entire harem for our MC, each with stereotypical traits and problems to be solved. This creates a predictable sense I don't like to have while watching a show for the first time. MC on the other hand is interesting and fun to watch; if only he found his way into a better plot.  4/10I did not enjoy this as much as similar pieces (Kanon 2006 and Clannad). It was simply a bunch of sentimentality for characters that haven't been fully developed. The anime was boring after a while and confusing at that. 2/10 for enjoyment.Overall, this is an average anime for our time. It did not excel enough to stand out, and is left in the dust by better SoL drama romances that came out after it. Not bad, but not worth the watch. The VN is a better option here if you want to enjoy the story to its fullest. 4.4/10 confused as to what's happening. 3/10The art and sound are excellent for the time, and still hold up today.

If you know anything about Key than you probably have heard of Clannad, Kanon and Air.  Each of them are harems (one guy goes after several different girls and eventually ends up with one of them), and usually each heroine is given their own subplot.  What makes Key better than 90% of these type of narratives is all of them usually amount to something; whether it is an overarching theme (Kanon) or an effective way to lead into something more (like Clannad After...Story).  Air however... is disjointed and isn\'t as clear in its direction as the other two, but it had the potential to be something really amazing.Story: 6/10 (above average)Clannad was more grounded.  Kanon is a mix between reality and supernatural.  Air takes the slice of life genre and attempts to go more to the supernatural side.  The first half of the story is your typical harem, and is in my opinion pretty mediocre.  Air tries to give each of its 4-5 heroines a sub plot in the span of 6 episodes... and the result is a hit and miss.  There was one potentially interesting story about a girl who may have had some real psychological issue, only to disappoint me by turning it into a ""supernatural phenomenon"", which ended up being surprisingly dull.  This isn\'t to say that supernatural elements can\'t be interesting.  In fact one arc at the end of the first half was well done, and just when I was starting to get used to it... they change the direction of the series completely.  One of the biggest problems I have with Air is that the first half barely amount to anything, and the characters that were built up are completely forgotten in the second half!  This results into 2 disjointed halves that don\'t mesh well.  This sudden awkward change in pace and direction leads to a cluttered and somewhat unfocused experience.  Fantasy is thrown in, the core relationship focus changes, and... a really strange transformation occurs (???).  This may sound like Air fell off the rails and became a train wreck.  But when the last few episodes came together, it blew me away.  These last three episodes are fantastic, packing a really powerful emotional punch, and even reaching heights that can compare with their best work.  It explores a complicated mother-daughter relationship, that I really don\'t see a lot in this medium of story telling.  It also culminates in what is, in my opinion, a really powerful bittersweet open ended ending.Characters: 7/10 (good characters overall, but a little mismanaged)The ""main character"" is a weird looking hobo named Yukito that goes around trying to get money as a puppeteer and fails miserably.  While he sounds interesting, he doesn\'t have much character development.  In fact, in the second half he is... shall I say... ignored.  The side characters are also not very memorable and don\'t have much relevance in the big picture.  However, the cast really shines with Misuzu and Haruko.  Misuzu is a kind, clumsy girl who finds Yukito and helps him out by letting him stay at her place with Haruko.  Initially, she seems to be a stereotypical not-so-bright naive blond girl, but when you find out something about her and follow her development in the second half... you will be surprised when she becomes a character you admire and really care about.  Haruko is the mother that adopts Misuzu and isn\'t the motherly type.  She doesn\'t seem to care much about Misuzu and appears to be incredibly irresponsible, and this creates an interesting dynamic that is explored brilliantly in the third act.Sound: 10/10 (masterpiece)Some of Key\'s best music.  Uses violin :) one of my favorite instruments.  Complements the setting perfectly, and delivers well on the dramatic front.  Also has a core theme that is very memorable and that I listen to regularly!Art/Animation: 9/10 (excellent)Really impressive for a 2005 anime, but the real reason this scores high is not how good it looks but how it is used.  It creates a fantastic setting full of mystery and wonder that perfectly complements the story they are trying to tell.Enjoyment: 5/10 (mixed)For everything I liked there was something I didn\'t like, resulting in a mixed bag.  Overall, I admire Key for trying something new and attempt something outside what this genre usually presents.  If you enjoy their other works, I think you will enjoy it, but be ready for an unexpected turn in the second half.  While many people felt this is where it went downhill, try to give it a chance, because while it is a little clumsy, the vision they tried to reach was really admirable.Overall: 7/10 (good) Story).

The first two episodes started out good,but after that it was confusing and hard to follow. Also,half of the episodes are fillers. The girls introduced in the filler arcs,just disappeared after their problem gets solved,making them useless. The story itself was unique and had potential,but they showed it in a confusing way,making it boring to follow. It's also pretty predictable. I instantly knew Misuzu was the girl Yukito was looking for.Art  6/10I honestly didn't like it. The backgrounds...were done nicely,but the character's faces looked very out of proportion to me. I guess that's a personal thing,but I didn't enjoy the anime for its visuals.Sound 8/10The sound was good. I liked the opening theme and the other music fitted the atmosphere of this show very well.Characters 5/10Most characters were pretty dull.Yukito was just your typical nice guy,trying to help everyone he sees.Misuzu was kind of unique,but very annoying at the same time.Kano was just really pointless. They could have made her a good character,but she instantly gets forgotten after her arc.Minagi is kind of the same,while she has a bit more emotional story,she's just a filler in the end. Also,the way she talks sounds so soulless to me.Michiru was the most entertaining character to me.Her happiness and energy just makes me smile while watching her scenes.Enjoyment 4/10I really did not get much enjoyment out of this. Air had its moment,but none of them actually made me cry or feel very emotional. I just didn't feel the connection with the characters,probably because there wasn't much character development at all. The art wasn't very enjoyable either.......neither was the story. Half of the time I didn't get what was going on and it felt like a mess.Overall 5/10To me,Air is like Clannad with less comedy,less character development and an more confusing story.

There\'s really nothing wrong with this show its a beautiful piece of art ~!!Air was originally a visual novel published by Key and adapted into a 13 episode anime by Kyoto Animation (the same studio behind Full Metal Panic! and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya). The anime follows a young traveling puppeteer named Yukito, as he comes to a quiet town on the coast. Here he meets a number of the town\'s inhabitants, most of...whom happen to be high school girls. At this point, Air seems lightweight enough: it could easily be summed up with ""guy walks around talking to cute girls,"" and looks more like the beginning of a harem anime than anything else. Do not be fooled by this easygoing start, however - Air is anything but ""light.""Initially, Air splits its focus between three of the high school girls. However, two of these girls end up with small, self-contained story arcs that don\'t really seem to add too much to the story. Both of them are entertaining, yes, but they don\'t seem to add anything to the real focus of the story: Misuzu\'s arc. Misuzu is a cheerful yet lonely girl and is the first person in the town that Yukito meets. However, as the two grow closer, Yukito discovers why Misuzu never seems to be able to make any friends: Every time she gets close to someone, she starts to have a mental breakdown. And as Misuzu starts to grow weak and sickly, Yukito realizes that Misuzu is remarkably similar to a girl his mother had been searching for; a winged girl who was fated to die young and alone. Each of these arcs combine elements of drama, tragedy, comedy, and romance, and it can get a little overwhelming at times.And if you think this qualifies as a plot rollercoaster, all of the above happens within the first seven episodes.If you\'re familiar with other Key visual novel-based anime, then you probably know to expect an element of fantasy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the next arc (yes, there\'s more), a sequence that pulls the setting back to a thousand years ago, where a samurai named Ryuya and an attendant named Uraha help a truly winged-girl named Kanna to escape a life of imprisonment in a shrine. While the previous arcs present the viewer with a jumble of confusing ideas and plot elements, the flashback arc manages to tie all of these elements together in a way that not only works, but made me go ""Oh wow,"" as I started to connect the dots and see the strings that tied all of the plot elements and arcs together. It is a truly skillful show of storytelling, and it clears all of the confusion as it drives the series into its final, climactic arc.The production quality of Air can only be described as ""excellent."" Visually, the series is top-notch, with animation that one might expect to see in a film. But what really stands out about Air is its soundtrack. Whereas many anime series tend to leave music as an afterthought, Air takes the opposite approach. The series is full of exceptional scores, most of which were composed especially for either the game or the visual novel upon which it is based, and all of a quality that is rarely found in an anime series.The Air Complete Series DVD set that I received for review is notably missing the thirteenth and final episode of the series. However, ""final"" here is something of a misnomer, because as I understand it, the thirteenth episode was simply a recap episode of the last arc, which concludes with episode twelve. In addition to the full series, though, the set contains two additional episodes, collectively titled Air in Summer. These two episodes accompany the flashback arc, filling in scenes and fleshing it out a bit more. While entertaining, Air in Summer mostly consists of lighthearted humor, and while entertaining, isn\'t really necessary to the completion of the series.Really, Air is a rare feat. While many anime series can spend hundreds of episodes tying up plots, Air manages to pack an incredibly complex story into only twelve. While it may seem overwhelming at times, by the end of the series, all of the plot threads tie together into a single, complete, and immensely entertaining drama.Read more at http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/anime/6931-Anime-Review-Air#BxCO3h6vjW8OmQXx.99 whom happen to be high school girls.

Yes, “Air” is host to some of the most jaw-droppingly breathtaking art style I’ve seen in a long time. Most of the shots comprise of wide, scenic views to capture glimpses of the beautifully animated sky, which is so expansive and gorgeous, that is becomes a character and presence itself throughout the course of the show, also tying into one of its major themes. These shots and backdrops...of the shifting sky add to the grand folklore of the “girl in the sky”, adding a majestic, but enigmatic power to the story. This may be the shows ultimate strength that makes it so unique and fresh, but the characters is where the show shines through as well.Yukito is a very interesting protagonist, as he dreams of one day meeting this legendary figure, but also is a broke, down-on-his-luck schmuck half the time. His interactions with the various girls around the town are based mostly on his decisions to fill his stomach, but as the show progresses, he begins to grow an attachment to them, and we witness a great character arc that leads into a truly heartbreaking finale. The chemistry works particularly well with Yukito and Misuzu, but also Misuzu’s guardian and aunt, Haruko, who is a raging alcoholic that becomes good friends with the protagonist. There’s a sense of family here that’s quite strong, even though it’s pretty subtle. It’s especially evident in the latter half of the show, but the first half I feel is where it truly shines.The plot has a very calm way of revealing itself, never forcing anything vital down your throat, but rather letting you decide how much plot you want at your own pace. It’s a very meditative approach to usual narrative tropes seen in most romance genres, but “Air” insists on being patient, and hence, the audience has to be able to be as patient to capture the essence of it all. However, for those looking for a fast-paced, plot-heavy anime, this isn’t the one for you. Even given it’s relatively short 12-episode running time, there’s so much space to breathe (pun not intended) that you’re able to just sit back and let the gorgeous animation, characters, and light plot just soak in. To add to this incredibly atmospheric tone of the show is the music, which compliments it very well. It consists of mostly piano ballads over a soft techno-esque beat that adds a dreamy layer next to the animation. The combination of all these factors in any given scene where characters are facing the ocean view admiring the clouds and sky or just simply walking through town, is unbelievably euphoric. It definitely has a way of sucking you in. Though, not much can be said about a pretty rough few episodes…These episodes happen somewhere in the middle of the show, as it decides to take a time leap back into the past, tracing the origins of the “girl in the sky”. See, what was great about the first half of the show is just how much this mysterious figure is mentioned, which creates a menacing but quite intriguing allure about her. The supernatural undertones work amazingly. As soon as this time leap into the past happens, it introduces us to a slew of characters that more or less destroy this allure perfectly set up before. It was unnecessary, but moreso, very dull and contrived. It was quite a kick back for people like myself who were really invested in the show, then it decides to introduce a new setting and characters at the drop of a dime. It’s jarring, to say the least, and not nearly as interesting as you might think. Thankfully, this only last around two episodes before it takes us back into the main plot, where a random twist of inexplicable events occur that almost destroy this pre-conceived mindset of the mystery of the first half, but it has its special way of being funny while simultaneously breaking you down into tears, so I’ll give it that.Overall, “Air” is one of the most visually unique anime I’ve seen. It has breathtaking art style with a grand vision of the sky above a small town, adding to a powerful allure and mystery that compliments the legends of Yukito’s “girl in the sky” very well. The soundtrack is beautiful, combining haunting piano melodies with soothing trance beats (in what amounts to something akin to ATB), and the characters are very likable and have great chemistry. However, it’s second half falters in many ways when it decides to be an entirely different show and genre, which will polarize a lot of people. It’s only for a few episodes, but its impact leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth. Nonetheless, it manages to conclude itself in a kinda satisfactory way as the protagonist isn’t exactly given the greatest of endings, but at the same time, leaves open a world of possibilities as to what lies beyond the vast oceans and skies of the world.

There are a lot of great qualities about it though, especially the backgrounds and scenery.

Vic sounds appropriately indignant, bored, and playfully angry, along with an emotive performance, befitting of a young man who actually cares about his female companion\'s well being.I\'ve long maintained that Monica Rial was best in Panty and Stocking, but I might have to reorder my list after this. I did not know that she was capable of playing a dramatic, tragic, and nuanced role as she did in Misuzu. She was legitimately awesome in this; totally believable in the role of an immature, wistful, and sick, but hopeful young girl.There were no hammy performances, and no false-feeling emotional scenes- every bit of it was all one could have hoped for in a heartfelt drama.The music in Air is the true beauty- with soft, melancholy piano melodies, and a mixture of ethereal, airy sounding background music, including an excellently fitting opening song, ""Tori no Uta""; (Bird\'s Poem) that combines danceable bass beats with the celestial qualities of the vocals and string sections.Contrivances and Story:I think the whole show could be described as a very long, very thin Red String of Fate. This theme of long distant past events affecting the present day is fairly common in media, however, Air\'s usage of it relies on several plot conveniences that I just cannot forgive. I understand that they were trying to make the plot into a tragic love story, but the means by which they use to get there are, honestly, poor, and would have functioned much better and been more believable with only very slight changes to the story.I was following along well up until episodes 8 and 9. I lost it when the plot decides to make an unexpected jump off a cliff straight back in time a thousand years. That one paragraph of exposition at the end of episode 9 mostly straightened it out, but still, the show was about 70 miles into a 100 mile trip, flipped on the left blinker and cruised straight out of the country and into the ocean.I was, and am certainly not alone in being totally lost in 8 and 9, didn\'t know who the characters were or why I should care that this character\'s mother died; I just really didn\'t know why I was supposed to care about these characters you force on me for two episodes in the middle of a story- with very little explanation as to why it\'s important, only to have the supposed importance of it absolutely quashed in the end in favor of a emotionally manipulating tragic ending.The show had just spent the last 7 episodes building this relationship between Misuzu and Yukito up, only to hand me three new characters who, by the end of the show, aren\'t even that important.Also, this trip in time was supposed to make me feel bad for the winged people because they were used as weapons?? What kind of tacked on tragedy is that? Why can\'t people just hate them because they have wings?? Why do these people even need to have wings?

She took it home and never gave it back.""', ""So it's another Key/Kyoani series, and you're searching for the magic you found in Clannad/Kanon, but you're not sure if it's really worth your time.In this review, I will be comparing AIR with the other Key Productions, Clannad and Kanon a lot. Honestly, I only watched AIR because I disliked Clannad and Kanon(2006), and didn't want to be biased when discussing these Key/Kyoani productions. So, basically I had a bad first impression of the series. But I finally decided to watch it in the end. and AIR is just Awesome!Story (10/10)Of course, the very essence of Key's harem animes are touching stories. and...this theme is very similar in AIR as well, so fans of Clannad and Kanon would surely love the story too. However, there are a few big differences in AIR compared to Clannad and Kanon. Personally, Kanon and Clannad's stories, especially the goodbyes, are always sad, depressing and tear-jerking. a sad episode will leave you in a slump for days. On the other hand, in AIR, the goodbyes are so beautiful you can't help crying and smiling at the same time.Another difference is in the miracles/supernatural part of the stories. For Clannad and Kanon, the miracles and supernatural things that happen are usually never explained and leave us in the dark, and most of the miracles are very separate/unconnected with each other. But in AIR, the whole story is connected, and there is also a side story which explains the miracles/supernatural things which happen perfectly and beautifully.The plot twist for AIR is also very well done and leaves absolutely no room for any complain, although it would be very surprising at first. Well, a plot twist is supposed to be surprising, and it also shows how creative the plot is, because I really never would've seen it coming.Art/Animation(9/10)AIR has a tendency of stressing on dark lines, especially for the characters, which makes them look a bit out of place against the backgrounds sometimes. However, it does a very good job making the city come alive for audiences(the city in the setting exists in reality). the character design is also comparable to Kanon and Clannad imo. There are some ppl who might say it's old and those eyes are too BIG, but look at Kanon 2006 and Clannad. It hasn't changed much, and it's beautiful.Sound(8/10)AIR's OPED are quite well done, and very heartwarming. the music and bgm is also very well used. It doesn't feel overdone, and is pretty much natural. The Voice Actors are not really the best. one of the characters' voice feels unnatural and forced. however, this isn't very apparent, so i'm not really complaining.Characters(10/10)AIR doesn't have as many characters as Kanon and Clannad, but for a 13-episode anime, it's more than enough, and the character development feels so much deeper and more meaningful. The 3 main girls are very unique compared to each other, and are very amusing to watch. Not just the main characters, but the side characters grow so much. Unlike Clannad and Kanon, in which a girl disappears and life just goes on for everyone, AIR really shows the changes in the characters after the events.The characters in the side story are also very interesting, unique, and loveable. Their character development is explained in more detail in the DVD specials.In terms of popularity, AIR characters have very few fans when compared to Kanon and Clannad characters. I do not think this is due to the character design/development, but more to the publicity and fan distribution.Enjoyment (10/10)When watching animes, my enjoyment level usually depends on my mood and first impression of the anime. Hence, it is very amazing that AIR managed to really changed my mind about it even though I decided to watch it reluctantly. In a way, AIR is a miracle to me. The casual jokes made me laugh, the girls made my heart jump, and the goodbyes made me cry and smile at the same time. An anime I enjoy so much is very rare for me.Overall (10/10)AIR is just so beautiful and so close to heart. It really makes the world seem brighter to you, when you remind yourself of the endless sky, sea, and AIR's 1000 Summers.I really wish more people would watch AIR and realize the beauty and miracles in it, which I couldn't find in Kanon or Clannad. this theme is very similar in AIR as well, so fans of Clannad and Kanon would surely love the story too.

The story is an interesting concept and at first I was excited to watch this series. I hoped it would be like Clannad, and also, my boyfriend was telling me to watch this series and he normally has good tastes. It started to feel like a chore after only a few episodes.My problem with Air is that it needed to be longer. If it was longer, I believe that would have fixed the major problems...that I have with this series. The story centres around the main character helping three young girls with their troubles. Since this also created by those that made Clannad, expect drama and tragedy to be apart of these girls\' lives.Normally, I don\'t have a problem with tragedy as long as the character development is okay, as opposed to being melodramatic or manipulative into making you think you care about the character... Well, Air seems kind of like a mixture of the latter two things I said. Not enough time is given to develop the characters before their drama is introduced and absolutely no time at all is given afterwards to see how they changed after receiving help from the main character, with the exception of the main character, Misuzu. If the whole series focused on Misuzu from the start without needing to include the other side characters\' stories, I think it would have been better. The sudden turn of events that affects Misuzu near the end seem rather sudden...Also, the series has a few episodes devoted to back-story inserted right into the middle of it. It was a change of pace... but a slow, boring one. I think it would have been more bearable to watch if the back-story was chopped up into little snippets sprinkled throughout the first half of the season, but alas, it was not. Instead we are forced to watch some random characters that appear out of nowhere for a few episodes before returning to the true story of Misuzu.Misuzu was truly the only thing I cared about in his anime. As a character she is interesting, and the most well developed, and pretty unique despite being a ""cute, clumsy and childish"" girl.So, in the end I give it a 6/10.

It may seem a little confusing at first, but you'll understand it more when you watch it a few more times. The story goes with an arc feature which segments the main character's lives and development as they progress along and familiarize with other people.Air was visually beautiful and has a wonderful storytelling setting. It was narrated in the viewpoint of the main character Yukito, and how his life was changed by one girl. Its a very good anime with an awesome storyline, but like I said confusing at...first view.

It may take a while to completely understand the story in detail. Its a sad story, but worthwhile to watch. Definitely watch it and see for yourself!"", 'Why did I choose Air, which is essentially the prototype Clannad? The opening theme was pretty cool, and I figured I could poke fun at the character designs; poking fun being my machete that I use to indiscriminately cut through the layers of crystallized sap to get to the juicy meat of the series.However, after I cut through all the aforementioned sap, there was hardly any meat for me to gorge myself on. It was like prying open a giant clam to get to a pearl, only to find it conveniently replaced by an I.O.U and a cinderblock.In Air, a struggling puppeteer named Yukito...Kunisaki has arrived in a small coastal town to ply his trade. He’s in search of a flying woman who his mother told him about, for reasons that are explained later. One day, while at the mercy of the harsh sun, a clumsy moeblob named Misuzu offers him a drink and a place to rest against all common sense.From there a friendship is forged which lasts a few days, Misuzu’s dreams seem to take an adverse effect on her health, and Yukito acts as the catalyst for a lot of crazy shit. If you’ve played any dating sim at all, or watched any dating sim adaptation, the setup will be all too familiar.I wish I could say that the plot is transparent and practically nonexistent, favoring instead the ‘Cute girls do cute things’ approach. It would’ve been easy to wrap things up with a witty quip like “The plot in Air is as visible and substantive as its namesake.” But no, this is Key Visual Arts; a company that has to shoehorn personal drama and supernatural occurrences in whenever possible to tug heartstrings, regardless of how well placed such plot devices are. And they’re stuffed into every available crevice that they can be stuffed in, severely diminishing the impact.All 13 episodes are crammed so full of details and plot points that it’s almost suffocating. And for the first half, it even has the gall to not succeed with the drama, compounding the problems exponentially.In the series’ defense though, the main plot isn’t bad. It’s actually even touching at points, especially in the last few episodes. Not even close to the point of making me cry, but the second half is a compelling drama that I can find little to complain about. I may not have liked it as much as I would’ve hoped, seeing as there was still so much crammed in that didn’t need to be, but there isn’t anything to really attack. No, for a number of reasons, the majority of my plot complaints are reserved for the first two thirds and the story arcs that comprise them.Compared to the well laid out, well paced main arc that explains Misuzu’s general oddness in relation to her past and the dreams that she’s having, the first two are highly concentrated, irregularly paced messes that come off as more than a little sloppy.If there is anything that I can deride plot-wise above everything else, it’s that things get resolved too easily, and just to get the message across that “LIFE’S A MIRACLE”, or “MEMORIES AND FAMILY ARE IMPORTANT.” Most of these people just need to talk about their problems and they seem to magically disappear. It doesn’t make Yukito look useful, even when it should.Rather than being a direct part of what he sets into motion, he’s just a bystander like the audience, left gawking at what his presence has unleashed. Hell, in the last half he’s entirely relegated to bystander in an unlikely form. While he’s a decent enough character, certainly my favorite of the entire ordeal, it’s when he’s forced into stepping aside for Misuzu and her aunt to resolve their problems that the show really hits its stride.Aesthetically, Air is gorgeous. The music is moving (Again, pointing anybody toward the opening who hasn’t heard it yet), the backdrops are beautiful, and the animation is mostly fluid. The one area where it starts to get a bit iffy is with the characters, which will be explained further later in the review.The characters themselves run the spectrum from boring and trite to not quite boring, but far from Character of the Year material. Of special mention is Misuzu, who fits in one of my two criteria for acceptable moe in anime:- The character has subtle traits that contribute to their personality as a whole, rather than remaining disjointed and just there to make them seem unique. Example: Akari Mizunashi from Aria.- It’s explained to be the direct result of some kind of mental or physical impairment, and thus can’t be helped. Example: MisuzuMisuzu does many, many annoying things: She trips over herself constantly, she has a verbal tic that makes her sound like a dying cat, she cries whenever she gets close to somebody, she acts way too childish for her own good and has the social grace of a nine year old, and she remains unfailingly nice despite her self-imposed isolation from the world at large.However, none of this is directly her fault, so it’s infinitely more tolerable (Unlike Yui from K-ON, who I can only assume is more than a little touched in the head). Despite all this and her overall lack of usefulness, Misuzu remains difficult to hate as a whole. I even caught myself caring about her fate in the end, and that almost never happens with these kinds of shows.I couldn’t help but laugh at some things that I don’t think I was meant to, or plugging in that Baywatch music during every instance of slow motion running, but my sympathy for her was true.There were a few instances of conversation that were just laughable or not what any person, regardless of normality, would have. For instance, Yukito finally gives in to Misuzu’s incessant demands to play cards with her. When she lays out the cards, she has a freakout and starts breaking down.Rather than getting help or asking if she’s alright while going over to comfort her, he sits there dumbfounded and asks if she’s crying. It ruined what could’ve been a jarring, yet heartrending scene.Air TV is good. It isn’t great, but it’s far from mediocre. A rushed and cluttered first half isn’t made up for by a mostly excellent second half, but it almost comes close. Basically, if you liked Clannad or Kanon or pretty much anything that Jun Maeda has penned, yet you haven’t watched this anime for whatever reason, Air should be right up your alley. And if not… well, check it out anyway. If you noticed all my uses of the word moe in this review, that should clue you in. In the end, it’s a competent and memorable, if imperfect series. Kunisaki has arrived in a small coastal town to ply his trade. He’s in search of a flying woman who his mother told him about, for reasons that are explained later. One day, while at the mercy of the harsh sun, a clumsy moeblob named Misuzu offers him a drink and a place to rest against all common sense.From there a friendship is forged which lasts a few days, Misuzu’s dreams seem to take an adverse effect on her health, and Yukito acts as the catalyst for a lot of crazy shit. If you’ve played any dating sim at all, or watched any dating sim adaptation, the setup will be all too familiar.I wish I could say that the plot is transparent and practically nonexistent, favoring instead the ‘Cute girls do cute things’ approach. It would’ve been easy to wrap things up with a witty quip like “The plot in Air is as visible and substantive as its namesake.” But no, this is Key Visual Arts; a company that has to shoehorn personal drama and supernatural occurrences in whenever possible to tug heartstrings, regardless of how well placed such plot devices are. And they’re stuffed into every available crevice that they can be stuffed in, severely diminishing the impact.All 13 episodes are crammed so full of details and plot points that it’s almost suffocating. And for the first half, it even has the gall to not succeed with the drama, compounding the problems exponentially.In the series’ defense though, the main plot isn’t bad. It’s actually even touching at points, especially in the last few episodes. Not even close to the point of making me cry, but the second half is a compelling drama that I can find little to complain about. I may not have liked it as much as I would’ve hoped, seeing as there was still so much crammed in that didn’t need to be, but there isn’t anything to really attack. No, for a number of reasons, the majority of my plot complaints are reserved for the first two thirds and the story arcs that comprise them.Compared to the well laid out, well paced main arc that explains Misuzu’s general oddness in relation to her past and the dreams that she’s having, the first two are highly concentrated, irregularly paced messes that come off as more than a little sloppy.If there is anything that I can deride plot-wise above everything else, it’s that things get resolved too easily, and just to get the message across that “LIFE’S A MIRACLE”, or “MEMORIES AND FAMILY ARE IMPORTANT.” Most of these people just need to talk about their problems and they seem to magically disappear. It doesn’t make Yukito look useful, even when it should.Rather than being a direct part of what he sets into motion, he’s just a bystander like the audience, left gawking at what his presence has unleashed. Hell, in the last half he’s entirely relegated to bystander in an unlikely form. While he’s a decent enough character, certainly my favorite of the entire ordeal, it’s when he’s forced into stepping aside for Misuzu and her aunt to resolve their problems that the show really hits its stride.Aesthetically, Air is gorgeous. The music is moving (Again, pointing anybody toward the opening who hasn’t heard it yet), the backdrops are beautiful, and the animation is mostly fluid. The one area where it starts to get a bit iffy is with the characters, which will be explained further later in the review.The characters themselves run the spectrum from boring and trite to not quite boring, but far from Character of the Year material. Of special mention is Misuzu, who fits in one of my two criteria for acceptable moe in anime:- The character has subtle traits that contribute to their personality as a whole, rather than remaining disjointed and just there to make them seem unique. Example: Akari Mizunashi from Aria.- It’s explained to be the direct result of some kind of mental or physical impairment, and thus can’t be helped. Example: MisuzuMisuzu does many, many annoying things: She trips over herself constantly, she has a verbal tic that makes her sound like a dying cat, she cries whenever she gets close to somebody, she acts way too childish for her own good and has the social grace of a nine year old, and she remains unfailingly nice despite her self-imposed isolation from the world at large.However, none of this is directly her fault, so it’s infinitely more tolerable (Unlike Yui from K-ON, who I can only assume is more than a little touched in the head). Despite all this and her overall lack of usefulness, Misuzu remains difficult to hate as a whole. I even caught myself caring about her fate in the end, and that almost never happens with these kinds of shows.I couldn’t help but laugh at some things that I don’t think I was meant to, or plugging in that Baywatch music during every instance of slow motion running, but my sympathy for her was true.There were a few instances of conversation that were just laughable or not what any person, regardless of normality, would have. For instance, Yukito finally gives in to Misuzu’s incessant demands to play cards with her. When she lays out the cards, she has a freakout and starts breaking down.Rather than getting help or asking if she’s alright while going over to comfort her, he sits there dumbfounded and asks if she’s crying. It ruined what could’ve been a jarring, yet heartrending scene.Air TV is good. It isn’t great, but it’s far from mediocre. A rushed and cluttered first half isn’t made up for by a mostly excellent second half, but it almost comes close. Basically, if you liked Clannad or Kanon or pretty much anything that Jun Maeda has penned, yet you haven’t watched this anime for whatever reason, Air should be right up your alley. And if not… well, check it out anyway. If you noticed all my uses of the word moe in this review, that should clue you in. In the end, it’s a competent and memorable, if imperfect series.', 'Whenever a person writes a paper for school, they always start with a rough draft. They read it over a few times to check for grammatical and punctuation errors. Then, they will show their paper to their peers to get advice, take it to their school’s writing center for review, and perhaps read it out loud to themselves. Until the words flow on the paper just right, and the point of the paper is made clear, the paper should not be turned in.The way the story of Air is told kinda feels like the rough draft for Kanon (2006), which would then become improved...in Clannad.So, if you look at my profile, you will see that I am very fond of Kanon and Clannad, being my 5th and 1st favorite anime respectively. Just in case you’re not in the know, Air is the first among three Kyoto Animation adaptations of Key visual novels (Air, Kanon, and Clannad). Going into Air, I knew that I had already experienced the cream of the crop, but how far behind in quality Air really was to its peers was very disappointing to me at the time.Before getting into the review part, I will suggest that you only watch Air if:a.) You’re a big fan of romance/haremsb.)\tSupernatural elements in a slice-of-life anime don’t bother youc.) You have already seen Kanon (2006) and ClannadLet me make it extra, extra clear that I highly suggest you watch Kanon and/or Clannad before you watch Air. It would be a shame if watching Air soured your tastes to the genre of anime, rendering you unable to enjoy its successors. I will also make some comparisons between the three anime, and there will be some spoilers coming up.At the beginning of Air, the story shapes up to be a very straight-forward harem anime. We have the main-male protagonist (Yukito) who randomly gets caught up with a few females, but there is that one girl that sticks out among the rest (Misuzu). Then, after that, we have 13 episodes of Yukito helping all of the girls that wish they could be main characters with their respective problems until Yukito and Misuzu realize that they love each other, get married, have children and live happily ever-after.Well, I wish Air could have gone down like that, but the thing is that Air tries to make things way too complicated for itself.Now, for the first few episodes, that’s kinda how things happen. The relationship between Yukito and Misuzu is the main focus while two other girls make some brief introductions. Normally, these two girls would get their own arcs of 4-6 episodes to develop their characters, while also being long enough for the plot to progress adequately. The problem is that instead of arcs, each girl gets a whole two episodes to cram in some development for them so they can seem important. That’s not to say that these episodes are bad though. I actually enjoyed the first episodes of the show. Still, the ultra-fast pacing of these episodes sucks out a lot of the fun. Many will be outright turned off by this. In fact, there is something else about Air that turns me off.Time to make the comparison between the members of the KyotoAni trinity, so some spoilers incoming.All three members of the KyotoAni trinity have some number of supernatural elements. In Clannad, while they were there, they were by no means excessive. There was the end of Fuko’s arc, Misae’s backstory with the cat, the Illusionary World, and the ending. Supernatural was sprinkled around over 40 episodes to increase the depth of the story, but Clannad mostly just felt like a romance/slice-of-life. With Kanon, the supernatural was not used as conservatively. The arcs belonging to Makoto, Mae, and Ayu (especially Ayu) had a moderate amount of supernatural. With the exception to the end of Mae’s arc that revealed she has superpowers or something, it still didn’t bother me. However, Air has way too many supernatural elements for me to take it seriously.The reason why Air ends up using so much magic in my opinion is that it tries to be more complicated and convoluted than it should be. There’s a decent bit of magic used in the beginning, but at episode 7, it starts to spiral out of control. Yukito starts getting all of these crazy flashbacks and whatnot, and that’s when the plot shifts from this century to 1000 BC. The sudden time shift is very shocking. While it does relate to the plot just a little bit, we go from harem anime with supernatural elements to a story about a cursed girl with magical powers being rescued by a samurai in medieval times. Still, once I got over the shock, I did enjoy the next two episodes a little bit. Next, the setting shifts to the present time, and you realize that the previous episodes have little to no impact on the main story. Yukito becomes a bird because lulz, and the remainder of the story is about the relationship between Misuzu and her mom. And it didn’t help that I found the last few episodes of Air to be pretty boring.One could blame Air’s shortage of episodes available for the story not succeeding, but the truth is that Air really doesn’t know what kind of story it wants to be. It drastically shifts from harem/romance to some kind of fantasy anime, and then back to a drama between Misuzu and her mom that seems virtually unaffected by the rest of the episodes. If the anime just stuck to one of those things for 13 episodes, it probably could have succeeded at all of them.As much as I just kinda trashed Air, I really did see Air as an insight to the process of creating Kanon and Clannad. Without it, we might not have gotten the quality of what turned out to be my favorite anime. There are also some good things about Air. If you’re tastes are similar to mine, you will find the sense of humor in Air’s first few episodes refreshing, and Yukito is a pretty good main in my opinion. I mostly liked the side characters, and the song in Air’s opening will stay in your head for days. Even so, I still have to come to the consensus that Air is just a bare-bones average anime.Just to reiterate, do not watch this anime if you already know you don’t like the genre, or if you haven’t seen its successors. Watching Air is like reading a classic novel; you watch it as a way to see how it influenced others. But, if you don’t want to watch it, that’s fine too. I watched it just because I felt obligated to. But who knows? Maybe you will receive Air better than I did. in Clannad.So, if you look at my profile, you will see that I am very fond of Kanon and Clannad, being my 5th and 1st favorite anime respectively.

No, I have not played the game, but it\'s pretty disturbing when you notice that most of the major female characters look and act like they\'re around thirteen or fourteen years old. Fortunately, the anime removes all the erotic content. So the real question is if the story aspect is strong enough to gain appeal by itself or if the game was only somewhat popular for the shameless and disturbing sex appeal.The story revolves around a young traveler named Yukito who arrives in a small village. He collapses from hunger and ends up...meeting a strange girl named Misuzu who offers to let him stay at her house. Yukito quickly gets caught up in the strange events surrounding several girls in the village, including Misuzu. The story is pretty simple, but it\'s very sloppily written. There are several episodes that exist solely for unnecessary exposition, I call it ""unnecessary"" because you should have figured out all the details that are relevant to the major plot if you\'ve been paying any kind of attention. Then there are important details, like the thing with Sora, that are glossed over and don\'t make much sense. The ending could have been really strong, but the last few minutes of the twelfth episode are just really random and stupid and then there\'s a pointless recap episode. As I said, very sloppy work.Most of the characters are pretty flat. They only play a major role in a couple episodes and then they fade into the background. You aren\'t given time to acclimate to them or any real reasons to care about them. The only characters that you have any incentive to care about are Misuzu, Yukito and Haruko. To be fair, the three of them do get some really good interactions and develop nicely over the course of the series, but the lack of depth or development for the other characters makes those few episodes surrounding them rather pointless.The art is decent. The character designs are pretty well done, but the backgrounds look pretty bland most of the time and there are a few moments where the art visibly degrades for no real reason.The voice acting isn\'t bad but it isn\'t anything special either. There aren\'t any really spectacular performances nor are there any really terrible performances. It\'s all very mediocre. The music is really soothing and does suit the series pretty well.The yuri factor is a 1/10. All of the major interactions between female characters explores a familial bond, mostly maternal. You get some interaction between Misuzu and the other girls, but she\'s more of a passive observer during those moments and she doesn\'t really interact with the other girls.My final rating for Air is a 5.4/10. It\'s mediocre overall. It has some charming moments, but the writing is really sloppy and every truly good moment is offset by several pointless and/or downright stupid moments. If you like Kanon you\'ll probably enjoy this as well, albeit slightly less. Otherwise, you may want to try it since it\'s short and does have some charm, particularly in the last couple episodes (not counting thirteen). Just be aware that you\'re going to have to slog through a lot of pointless interludes to reach those moments so you might just want to skip it. meeting a strange girl named Misuzu who offers to let him stay at her house.

I have seen this series over 20 times, and still continue to rewatch it. I am absolutely in love with it.Story:The story is very unique and genuine. You follow around the new guy in town, named Yukito Kunisaki. He meets a girl named Misuzu with a very strange past. It\'s almost painful to hear about it. Such a beautiful and kind girl with such a hard life. The story moves at a very fast rate, as it is too short to move slow.Art:Kyoto Animation did this, so obviously it is going to be amazing but...wow. The art and animation is flawless. Beautiful!Sound:The opening theme ""Tori no Uta"" sung by Lia is amazing. My favorite opening theme of all time. The score mostly consisted of piano tracks and electronic keyboards, but it fit so beautifully with the show. The insert song ""Aozora"" makes me tear up everytime I hear it. And the ending theme, ""Farewell Song"" is one of my favorite songs.Character:There are very few characters in this series, but they are all incredibly important. Yukito is the main lead with other leads being taken by Misuzu, Kano, and Minagi, all with a different story. Very sad and touching stories.Enjoyment:If I didn\'t enjoy this I don\'t think I would keep re-watching it over and over and over again.Overall:Beautiful story and I highly recommend this to anyone, even if they don\'t like anime. Make sure you have tons and tons of tissues though. wow. The art and animation is flawless. Beautiful!Sound:The opening theme ""Tori no Uta"" sung by Lia is amazing.

Make sure you have tons and tons of tissues though.', '""The 1000th Summer""... I still get chills down my spine whenever I see or hear that phrase. The moment I saw that single sentence, I knew I found another great masterpiece by Key.Even though I had to watch the series twice in order to fully understand the entire story, it was personally better watching it the second time. Not only did I understand it more, I cried even more. Let\'s face it, those who don\'t cry while watching Clannad, Kanon, Angel Beats, or Air either hate showing emotions, or they have no soul. That\'s exactly what I love about Key though, their work is so...emotional that you can\'t help but cry. Watched this with like 5 of my friends, not one of us were embarrassed when we started crying. We didn\'t care who we were with, we just let it all out.I have to admit, no anime could make me cry as much as I did in Clannad, but this was a close 2nd or 3rd. I wish that this show was more than 12 episodes with 2 OVA\'s, but I\'m still glad that it was made either way. I guess the reason I say that is because there were only 3 story lines, so there were only 3 girls, so I guess it\'s just unusual for something made by Key, usually they have at least 5 or 6 stories in the show, but I still loved each one.The stories were each really good, above all I think Misuzu\'s story line was the best, but that\'s just my opinion. What I liked about each one was that each of the characters were dealing with something either sad or painful in their life, and I don\'t mean I like that they\'re in pain or anything, I\'m saying I think that it makes the show better if they have that kind of stuff. Some of the episodes kind of dragged the story out a little bit, but it isn\'t really a big deal, it was still good.Like the rest of Key\'s work, their artwork is always top grade. The character art was really good, I liked how each character was designed, and the scenery was beautiful. My favorite part of the scenery would have to be the ocean, in fact, I am pretty sure that\'s what Key was going for when they made Air, judging from how much the ocean is mentioned in the show. Very smart.I have to say that Monica Rial was the last person that I would have expected to become the voice of Misuzu, just because in the Japanese version of air, she seems like a really shy and quiet girl, and just thinking of what kind of characters Monica Rial acted as (Renge from Ouran HighSchool Host Club, Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, Konoka from Negima!?, etc.), I guess I just thought of her as the actress to act as hyperactive girls, but I gotta say I was impressed how well she did. Her and Vic Mignogna were the best actors in the show, I always love their work. The rest of the voice actors/actresses matched their characters just how I expected, and I was really happy.Characters, gotta love them all. Yukito is cool and funny,, Misuzu is adorable, Potato is cute (for an alien bred dog), etc. Also one of Key\'s strong suits. The ability to make awesome characters for their shows.I enjoyed this show a lot, the OVA\'s were a little bit slow, but good. I got really emotional throughout the show, and I\'m guessing anyone who got emotional with the rest of Key\'s work, I\'m almost 100% sure you will in this too. If you are truly a fan of Key, you gotta watch Air. The Key Experience isn\'t complete unless you watch Angel Beats, Clannad, Kanon, and now Air.I hope this review helped. emotional that you can\'t help but cry.

Eventually, the dinosaur loving girl Misuzu shows up, and she asked Yukito to play with her and they became friends. As the time passes by, another two girls that were covered with mysteries appeared, and they became Yukito\'s acquaintances. The story\'s quality was a mediocre+ for me notwithstanding having different realistic themes. Some of the episodes were repetitive. The new things here are the ""Gao"" word that was made by Misuzu and the three main heroines wished to fly...in the sky. Other than that, nothing\'s special. It\'s only another ordinary supernatural anime.Characters(8) - The characters were well-explained because of the character arc. Every arc focuses on one major character but that makes other characters feel like they\'re left behind. Their personalities were quite unique but not superior.Music(7) - For a dramatic anime, the bgms fits every scene. The OP and ED matched the series, but they are not exceptional since the music of Air was somewhat similar to other Key/VisualArts project.Art(8) - The places are realistic, the blending of the colors are good. I just don\'t like how they draw the eyes of the female characters because it\'s too big. Also, what\'s with that placement of the mouth?Overall(7) - As a whole, Air is only an ordinary dramatic anime that didn\'t interest me that much(well, just a little). I\'m just surprised how the story ended. Dramatic/supernatural/tragedy lovers will probably watch this. in the sky. Other than that, nothing\'s special.

The OP and ED matched the series, but they are not exceptional since the music of Air was somewhat similar to other Key/VisualArts project.Art(8) - The places are realistic, the blending of the colors are good. I just don\'t like how they draw the eyes of the female characters because it\'s too big. Also, what\'s with that placement of the mouth?Overall(7) - As a whole, Air is only an ordinary dramatic anime that didn\'t interest me that much(well, just a little). I\'m just surprised how the story ended. Dramatic/supernatural/tragedy lovers will probably watch this.', ""Air is an unforgettable experience that tells a story which seems simple yet complex simultaneously. Like a dream, there seem to be layers of meaning. As the story unfolds, simple objects take on symbolic significance and one must rewatch the show in order to see these clues, while some aspects of the experience remain cloaked in mystery.Story: 8Air takes on several interesting plotlines, but the only drawback is that it is only thirteen episodes. Therefore, it does not have enough time to fully develop some aspects of the plot. The show is told in a rather non-traditional manner with some plot elements not revealed until...much later in the show and others barely explained. After watching the show again, I appreciated this aspect more, but the style can throw you for a loop the first time. I think this could have been cleared up with more episodes. It also might seem annoying that while some episodes seem to consist of little happening, the dramatic moments seem to rush by without proper explanation. This might have been intended, however.Art: 10This is some of Key's best animation with a wonderful colors, and great contrasts between light and darkness. All the scenes are breathtaking and perfectly create the mood of the scenes which vary from dark and brooding to sunny and dreamy. The scene where Misuzu and Yukito stop to play in a stream near dusk is my favorite. The only cons are that as in Key animation, the characters look very similar and have very large eyes, which may not appeal to all viewers.Sound: 10Air has one of my favorite soundtracks, that is mostly electronic, but has some nice piano pieces. The opening is also amazing and draws you in from the start. The music is diverse and definitely another strong point of the show. The voice acting was also great in Japanese. I have not seen all of the English dub, but what I saw was not comparable to the original.Character: 8The individual characters are not the strongest point in this anime. None of the main girls really stand out, except Misuzu who morphs from being the typical cutesy heroine to a very tragic and pathetic character, who still remains believable. Haruko, the aunt is also a very compelling character, whose develops throughout the show. Yukito is interesting, but not the most original.Enjoyment: 8I have to only give this anime an 8 for enjoyment, simply because it is one of the more depressing series I have watched. There are several moments that are just excruciating, but of course beautiful in their sadness. I also disliked how once a character's story was finished we did not see any more of that character. I would have liked a less episodic style. It is definitely more enjoyable the second time, when you start to understand the symbols and intricate nature of all the details.

On the contrary i  loved Clannad , Canon etc. So it's not like i'm biased against it or something.Concerning the Story and the CharactersFor me story and characters are 95% of an anime. If those are great then the anime is a certain winner. If those suck, no matter how great the art or the sound the anime is gonna suck too.Here we have incoherent story-telling, with the story itself being quite confusing. Several points of the...plot are left unexplained or the explanations come too late. I mean i found myself watching whole episodes wondering wtf is going on, only to find out at the end a (usually) poor and not very satisfying explanation.As for the characters there really isn't much to say.Apart from the fact that the best and most interesting one gets transformed to a crow(!) there are also many other problems like the main heroine , Misuzu, being retarded beyond any redemption or the side heroines not having enough development. This led to another problem as well. Watching such uninteresting characters i couldn't feel any sympathy for them. I didn't really care for their problems which made the dramatic aspects of this anime seem way too forced to a point of being laughable.Concerning the Art and SoundThe art was ok in general. Nothing to complain about but nothing impressive either. The sound was probably the best part. I liked the songs and the voice acting was ok.Enjoyment - OverallWhile the art and sound are fair, the story and characters are POOR. I started with great expectations only to be horribly disappointed. I didn't drop it just because i was curious whether something unexpectedly great would happen in the end, something that would justify all those great reviews with 9s and 10s. Unfortunately nothing happened. It was pure bad.I'd certainly recommend to avoid it. plot are left unexplained or the explanations come too late.

Yukito\'s family has been searching for this girl for generations upon generations. Finally, Yukito\'s journey takes him to a small seaside town where he meets Kamio Misuzu, a girl who is eager to make friends with Yukito. Yukito ends up staying with Misuzu and her mother, Haruka, while he searches for the girl in the sky. In the town, however, there are strange occurrences, and as the days pass by, Misuzu starts to have strange dreams. What is the truth behind Misuzu\'s dreams and her failing health? And how...is everything connected to Yukito and his journey?Story & Characters  (9/10)It all began when Yukito met Misuzu, a teen school girl with a very childish personality. Misuzu lived alone with her aunt (who never had any time for her), after her parents were separated. She never made any friends at school mainly cause whenever Misuzu became too close with a person she would break down. No one really got to know Misuzu well, until the summer she met Yukito. It was also the summer when she started getting these mysterious dreams..dreams of ""her other self"" flying in the sky, following a path to somewhere. Each night the dream would lead her further down the path, leaving her in confusion and curiosity. Though she never realized the further into the dreams she went each night, the more she faded away by day. Yukito\'s relation with Misuzu seemed to make her weaker and weaker. Her health started to fail and her dream was drawing to an end.The story also focuses on two other girls who\'re just as mysterious as Misuzu.Kano, and Minagi. Both were ""different"", and lived tragic lives. Yukito was positive that one of the three girls must have been the Angel or ""The Girl in the Sky"" his mom had been searching for, but he didn\'t know which one. So as the summer passed, Yukito grew closer to each girl.. and found out about their sad and tragic pasts that have come back to haunt theirfutures.Anyways, since I don\'t want to spoil the whole plot, I wont say too much more. Though the plot sounds very sad and depressing, there\'s quite a few scenes in there that will make you laugh out loud, and the ending will leave you in tears, well at least it did to me.Art (9/10)Finally! An anime where the school uniform is actually different!..Anyways,The art for this series is terrific, the characters are well drawn. Every movement is very detailed and clear. Like how they concentrated on their hair, how each strand of hair moved in the wind. Each character was drawn to suit they own personality so well.The backgrounds are truly amazing! Especially the sky, the clouds look almost real! Some really beautiful scenes in there, it just looked so organized and clean. I adore this style and the artwork they used in Air. It\'s really awesome!Sound (8/10)The beginning theme song is very good, Tori no Uta, quite catchy actually. The scenes they put in there go well with the song. It\'s sung by Lia, who also sang the ending song. The ending song is not bad, though the video is pretty boring. It\'s just a sunset. Personally I like the beginning song more. The background music is awesome, fits well with each different scene. It really sums everything up and adds so much more emotion to it.The voices of each character bring them alive, like Misuzu\'s voice, so Kawaii!and it fits their personality well.Overall (9/10)I think Air puts on an awesome show, though it can get a bit confusing near the ending, it\'s still very good, mysterious and magical. Great for all ages, and I would definitely recommend this anime, even if you\'re not into drama or that kind of stuff, you just gotta watch it to believe it.The theme of the story is very unique and different. It\'s not just ""bad guys"" and villains, or \'happy-happy\'endings where the good guys always win. It\'s all about a curse and a legend. They tell the story through many characters views, and even go into the history of the legend/curse for a couple of episodes! I think it\'s very original, that\'s what I like about it.The artwork is leaves you speechless, the characters are cute, the plot is interesting, plus there\'s a bit of everything in there,love, magic, tragedy, humor, etc.In my opinion it\'s the best anime in 2005 yet! It sure is one of my favorites from that year! So, guess what I\'m going to say, YES, totally recommend this ANIME.

Thank you and I hoped you liked the review.', 'Air tells the story of the ""1000th Summer"", the summer that Yukito Kunisaki spends with a handful of girls each with their own problems, and ties to the Winged Maiden, the exiled beauty that Yukito is in search of.This anime makes me feel so nostalgic. This might be personal to me more than anyone else but the breathtaking soundtrack and visuals, and the story and unique characters all on the backdrop of a solitary summer make me feel so many emotions, not only to the amazing story that has roots over hundreds of years but how stuck it is in a summer of the mid-2000s,...when the anime came out. I have so many fond memories of both that time and my experiences in anime, and they make for an amazing combination.Just like any other Key or KyoAni show, Air is incredibly saddening at times, yet comedic and dramatic amongst others to boot. It is a very prominent precursor to Clannad and Clannad: After Story in these departments, so if you like those then give Air a shot. Air is unique in it\'s setting and how it chooses to deal with it\'s characters, and that is why I love it so much.Art is pretty standard and nothing special when it comes to casual scenes and the basic character designs, more along the lines of same old from a KyoAni show. But the backdrops and the depictions of the Winged Maiden throughout the show that truly take your breath away and are absolutely outstanding. The story could be paced a little better in my opinion, but it is immensely enjoyable nonetheless.So, Air is a delightfully nostalgic trip into the past with an enjoyable storyline and unique characters and motivations. I highly recommend it for the experience. when the anime came out.

It tells us the story (more sophisticated, historical story) about the legends of the Angels. Anime is composed of 12 episodes that describe mostly the tale of Misuzu and Yukito. The story itself will confuse you at first (If you are confused after watching this, you aren\'t alone). Later, all of the puzzles and clues in the anime will be solved and explained. Moreover, the feeling from you watches this anime is really like a roller coaster.I recommended this anime for those who want to watch some classic anime with...excellent art and story. The blend of romance, drama, a slice of life, supernatural, and a little bit of comedy and historical is incredible. There is no ecchi scene (the ecchi level my different from me to you), so it\'s safe to watch with friends or family members who are children. In the end, always, this anime isn\'t for everyone. I suggest you avoid this anime for those who hate romance, drama, and supernatural things because you mostly will hate this anime. In the end, I love this anime as overall, and I think it is one of the best classic anime that I ever watch.Long Review (may contain spoilers)After watching Air all 12 episodes, I will breakdown my review and share what I think and feel.Story and Plot (8/10)The concept behind the story, I think, is impressive. The story is started when the boy, Yukito, is searching about the girl who has a pair of wings. He is searching and traveling from one town to another because of the story passed from generation to generation about the Angel. He then settled in one small town and discover the tale of the Angel. Thus, the story begins.The story itself is excellent, but for the first-time watcher is somewhat confusing. I suggest watching full until the end and then rewatch some episodes that you think have a plot hole or unexplained things. The pacing itself is relatively fast and sometimes too little faster, especially Minagi and Kano arc, but oh well, no problem at all in the end. The end of all of the arc is gives the watcher an excellent explanation, too. Sometimes, the mystery is explained more in later episodes.About the feeling, mostly, you will feel the roller coaster feel, means sometimes you will be happy, laugh, confused, and sad. The story is rather original and genuine for me, even when I write this review is apart 15 years.Art and Animation (10+/10)For anime that on aired in 2005, the animation is simply fantastic. I can\'t say how many I pause and see the anime\'s animation. The animation is really well detailed and undoubtedly smooth. The transition from one scene to another scene is good too. The art is well created and gives good storytelling and emphasis to the watcher. The consistency of art is not only for one or two episodes but for entire episodes. My favorite one is the sunset scene. Never bored to see that one.Sound and Music (10+/10)The truth is I watch Air is because of the opening theme, ""Tori no Uta"" or ""The Poem of Birds."" The opening one is well animated, and sometimes I even watch it twice or thrice. The sounds are excellently placed, and it sounds great. The OST is beautiful and mostly will be used again at the Konan and Clannad, so don\'t surprise if you first watch Konan or Clannad. The wave of the ocean, the sounds of cicada, and other sounds much emphasize the story\'s condition. Not only that but also is perfect timing, so you won\'t hear the break of glass 5 seconds after the glass is broken. The Ending theme, I think, is excellent and related to the story. You can hear it all yourself.Character (8.5/10)The character is well developed. You will see how well the character feel, grow and realized each other. Air makes two new sounds, too, ""Gao"" and ""Piko-Piko""  that is pretty cute (My bad, LOL). Overall, I think it is well written, but some are rushed or too fast, so they don\'t have much time to grow, and the watcher doesn\'t get the feeling that the creator wants.Enjoyment and Conclusion (8.5/10)I really like this classic anime; some of the parts are really superior. The blends of drama, romance, supernatural, and a slice of life will make you feel happy, sad, curious, confused, and maybe desperate and cry sometimes. In the end, the feeling that you experience is one of the most beautiful things that Air is over to you and what makes you fall in love with Air.Overall (10/10)I take note my score (1-12) from all episodes (12) and OP/EDEpisode - Score(1)   - 10.5, 9.25, 8.25(4)   - 9, 10, 10.5(7)   - 9, 9.5, 9.5(10) - 8.25, 9, 10Total Raw Score: 113.75Main Anime Score: 113.75/12 x 10 x 90% = 84.6Opening & Ending Score = 105 x 10% = 10.5Total score is 95.1 that means overall score is 10I hope my review will help you!!! excellent art and story. The blend of romance, drama, a slice of life, supernatural, and a little bit of comedy and historical is incredible.

""Some people love it and yet some people hate it. Everyone has different opinions and I respect that, but I really love this show and here is my review and opinion why I consider this show a masterpiece and most memorable show that I have seen.Air is my first entry to the works of Kyoto Animation and Key and after this I got obsessed with their other works like Kanon, Clannad and After Story. It\'s also my first introduction to the drama genre of anime and it really...caught me off guard when I watched this one. So let\'s get started my quick review.Story: 10This is one of the highlights of this show. Unique and confusing though it\'s nearly impossible to understand in just one viewing. But still it has a beautiful, original and strong plot that is hard to find nowadays.Art: 9Kyoto Animation really never fails to amuse me in this part. The background art and characters are drawn smoothly. The art reminded me how beautiful our world is with those Skies, Birds, Sunsets and Seas. It\'s so pleasing to the eyes.Sound:In one word: Magnificent! Lia really did a good job in this one. The opening and ending song makes my eyes became watery every time I heard it. They also did a good job in dubbing and those background music. It\'s really hard to describe in words those sounds. I advice you to wear a headphones while watching to appreciate it even more.Character:I love all the characters. Especially Misuzu and Yukito. Minagi and Kano are also remarkable and have their own different story in the show. They really did a good job with Misuzu and her mother. From the first episode and until the very last I can feel the development in them. Those ""Gao"" and V sign is the most memorable part that I will remember for life.Enjoyment: 8It\'s really hard to enjoy the series with a confusing plot. And I\'m one of those people, I need to pause for a while and think for a moment to fully understand per episode. Still I enjoyed the show.Overall: 10A masterpiece. No other anime shows brought me to tears like this one. Just like I said it\'s not for everyone. Deep, Complicated and Beautiful I can see my self re-watching this again but not now, not tomorrow and not next week. Maybe when I\'m already prepared to cry again. I\'m happy that I accidentally watched this show. It\'s a gem of the drama genre. Thank you Key!Thank You Kyoto Animation! Thank You Misuzu! caught me off guard when I watched this one.

I\'m happy that I accidentally watched this show. It\'s a gem of the drama genre. Thank you Key!Thank You Kyoto Animation! Thank You Misuzu!', ""I wasn't too keen with the anime at first. The factor that made me continue to watch this anime was its sound. This is probably true for many first time viewers: you watch Air because of the prowess of one or two of its production elements. However, my views have changed once I watched all 13 episodes.We are first introduced to Kunisaki Yukito. Yukito is in search of a girl with wings who flies in the sky. He travels town by town looking for this girl. Finally, he settles down at a small seaside town. During his stay, he meets three girls that may be...the girl that he is looking for. From there, the anime develops a story that may be deeper and more complex than you have ever imagined it to be. Not only does this anime explore romantic love but the love of a sibling, mother and a friend as well; this is what sets Air apart from all the other anime. Make sure to keep tissues within reach while watching Air.Never has the sky looked so beautiful and magical yet so real in an anime. The surroundings are splendidly done; none too bright nor too shallow. The surroundings perfectly complement the scenes throughout the entire anime. The movements of the characters are so fluid and minute. Character design is consistent: great from the beginning to the end.As I have mentioned previously, Air's sound captured me. The OP and ED songs were magnificent. The background music was just amazing. It plays at the right time to give this anime an even glossier finish. Probably one of the very few anime soundtracks that make me feel so connected and emotional just listening to it.You cannot help but love all the characters in Air: from the lonely Misuzu to the adorable Potato. Each character has their own personality and a sad story to couple it. Although Kano and Minagi (the other two main female characters) are only given a short amount of time for their arcs, it was ample enough for one to like and feel empathy for the character. I can probably say the same for most of the supporting cast. As for Misuzu, I cannot help but feel pain myself watching her through her ordeals. I, personally, don't think she deserved this kind of life (just like her guardian, Haruko thinks).In the end, I grew to like this anime not only because of its sound, but because of the anime itself. I have never expected something so deep and complex to come from an anime. Most of the times, before I knew it, the front of my shirt was wet. Perhaps the anime that will tug my heartstrings the most. the girl that he is looking for.

Also, sometimes there's too much going on and things seem a bit rushed trying to cover all the stories at once with Yukito, maybe they tried to cover too much in a very short anime.Art (5): Nothing special, the scenarios were pretty and the characters agreeable, but nothing out of the average.Sound (6): Nothing special either for me, well, the opening and ending are...nice, and fair enough, the opening began to grow on me towards the end of the anime.Character (7): The characters were very different and particular, yet I'll give a low degree because many of them varely got the chance to start shining when their story ended. To be fair I'll say Yukito is a very dear character and his little puppet is great and has a lovely background story.Enjoyment (8): I'll be honest, everytime an episode ended I needed to watch the next one just to see what would happen next or what the hell was going on, so, it will probably keep you interested through the entire anime.Overall (7): If you enjoyed the drama, complicated darksides and the bits that were open for interpretation in H2O and Higurashi, you'll probably enjoy Air. nice, and fair enough, the opening began to grow on me towards the end of the anime.Character (7): The characters were very different and particular, yet I'll give a low degree because many of them varely got the chance to start shining when their story ended.

Dont give me those side-eyes for this review. ""Why does this guy give so high review but actually not recommend this works?"" It starts with one thing. It\'s a Key visual novel, what else?  obviously, you are in for a ride if you are actually an avid visual novel reader (and mostly know what Key could be capable of into what they will do into their stories).  For those of you who wants to see romance in this movie, there\'s actually a little bit of romance, well after that there\'s none.This show is unique...in its own way, it feels like you are trying to connect into the world, into the Air world itself. While there\'s actually world building (well this might be misinterpreted) it\'s actually a fresh new air to drama, actually it\'s good for you who wants to try the definitely regular High School drama. In which! you are reading a total 180-degree turnaround drama from the start to beginning. Including a three episode of flashback! No, it\'s actually fun! i promise. Well, for some of you it\'s annoying, but for story freaks like me it\'s actually important to know what plot i was missing. So! let\'s just get startedStory 8/10Caught your attention now huh? Well, first of all, Air is a unique piece of show that i couldn\'t bother but always try to watch the show. The MC Kunisaki Yukito are trying to reach for a girl in the sky, inherited by its own family (or thats what i think i hope i was right) on his journey to find his ""Winged girl"" he was stuck in a certain place in a certain spot that of course! Doesn\'t have anything weird inside it! (Im lying there\'s lot of weird stuff around it). So? will he actually find his winged maiden? or anything else actually happens to him.... Of course, it\'s just another drama with a sidekick of romance fantasy, right?? Right???? You are so wrong.The story itself was a complex developed around sky in which they believe that sky itself was a representative of anything, and that anything is mostly, you guessed it! Magics, Fantasies, and more!!!! But there\'s lot more to that, those magic was nound with human emotions that extend into a bigger problem everything, for a simplified stuff, its happened like1. Yukito meet girl2. Yukito saw weirdness3. Yukito solve problems4. Yukito happy5. girl happyIt\'s mostly like that, BUT there\'s a twist happened at around half of the show i say maybe episode 6 (i dont exactly remember what happened but it should be half of it).  Curious? go watch it yourself if you haven\'t. Beside that this story is actually very well made and leaves no plot holes (well if you\'re still confused, rewatch it again). It\'s structures and fine and ooh don\'t get me started for the character development, it was amazing at some points.Confused? me too, until i tried to understand what does it means and how it goes. I mostly predicted where it goes since it\'s pretty easy, but well, my prediction came out true and it was fun (and confusing).Animation 9/10FOR A 2005 ANIMATION it was AWESOMELY MADE, also its kyoto animation, of course it was good, the subtle flow of the characters, the angles, it was everything. For me, it\'s an actual 2005 anime where it succeeds on behalf of its animation, and i wish kyoto animation do so in the future (and they will be)Art 7/10It\'s pretty meh actually, but the kind art that i\'d not easily forget despite being backed up by the story, it\'s also not some kind of ""generic beautiful anime women number 1"" but instead it\'s ""that one anime girl in air""Soundtrack 10/10On point, stay on theme, and totally heartwarming, i say the constant amount of soundtrack that Jun Maeda makes is always a masterpiece.LAST REVIEW 8/10Air is a very interesting piece of works you can enjoy with your friends (Dont do that, it\'s confusing). Also a piece of work that makes your brain works better than your average mystery. THE ANIMATION IS PEAK FOR 2005. And of-course Jun Maeda is a maestro when it comes to making OST\'s. Overall, i\'d not give this anime a recommend and i\'d, gladly, gatekeep this anime with sidenote of watch at your own risk! in its own way, it feels like you are trying to connect into the world, into the Air world itself.

I don't care that it's based for a H game, with that ton of anime these day are based off H game that give no reason to automatic prejudge it. I found this to be a series that draws you in and doesn't let go. With that lets break things down shall we.Story:It's great and very emotional at times. But it one of those anime's that has a secondary story in it to explain and add onto the original story. But be ready cause the thing i loved about this is that...it isn't your happily ever after anime as every character has there dark secrets. I will explain that more one i get into the character section. But ill leave this at every 1000 summers a girl is born with a fate that is predestined and can't be changed.Art:Incredible is the word, me and my friend have alway joked of the whole HD anime thing saying what even the point of it. This is one of the extremely few exceptions to that. As this anime is so extremely well made that you can watch it in HD and actually see a large difference. If you want just youtube the intro opening song, when i first watch this series along time ago they had the intro and my computer at the time was no were near powerful enough to play the full graphic intro.  Here is a Youtube link that has it in 1080p http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HvzpstRN64 . There is a extreme gap in quality (720p and 1080p i see no difference and i have a dedicated 1 gig video card with 1080p HD setup). Just that should be all the proof need to set why i have this set as a 10.Sound:The sound is great, i love the intro and ending theme song. The Intro song has forever been scarred into my hard with deep emotions from how good the anime was. Plus i loved the voice actor choices at-least for the Japanese version. Misuzu had such a perfect voice actor. Over all it couldn't have been better.Characters:They has a story for everyone of the main characters, none of them were simple backgrounds either. The character were all well explained and were intertwined with the rest of the character and story. They went into very well detail for all the main characters and explain their purpose in the story very clearly. If they were to cut a character the whole story would fall apart. That is how well they used each character to their highest potential. You loved each of the characters as if they were all the #1 main character.Enjoyment:They kept me on that roller coast of emotion till the very end making me think if i could ever handle a ride like that again. But it was on of those even if it pure torture to my heart i had to see it again. The character were just created so in-depth that it made the whole series run smooth like watching a movie that you couldn't take your eyes off.  All i got to say it this is one of the few anime you go to find me ever rating an across the board 10.Thank you for reading my reviewSilent VoiceI.N.H.

Reviews"", ""*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Well I must say I am impressed with this. Very impressed. I am very glad for that review that was posted that sparked my curiosity to check this Anime out, I did. Between the rocky road trying to stream this from YouTube , and hopping around YouTube finding the many parts, I enjoyed this. It's a hauntingly beautiful Anime, not since Fruits Basket has a such an anime moved me so much.Now this is again one of the few Anime's that have made me cry my eyes out at points, that is how emotionally pact it can get. But...I think this is the only Anime that has made me bawl on the spot! I had to pause and get tissues! Some moments you just paused and let it all sink in. Chills ran down my spine at many points. And my gosh when Misuzu got out of her wheel chair and walked to her mothers arms and just collapsed and finally died, or when Misuzu runs to Haruko crying &quot;Mama!&quot; I never cried so hard while watching Anime. No really I was in tears I had to pause and get a tissue! And not only that, it's funny at times. A great mix of drama with comedy relief balances out this Anime very nicely.The art work is some of the finest with out a doubt in my mind.  Brilliant cinematography was used, it was stunning to see such masterful and beautiful work.And ah the characters, Misuzu she's so cute, and it's so funny the way she always falls flat on her face, she's so lovable and your heart goes out to her, and you just can't help but fall in love with all the characters, yet there are some you just want to bop on the head at times until you see their true nature but non the less great ensemble cast, one of the best I've seen.  And dub wise while I was a skeptic it wasn't so bad.Impressive music. A good drama like this needs a good music score and the three composers pull it off nicely. And a very catchy opening theme pulls it together nicely. Sometimes I can't help but think of the music from the movie Hook, they almost sound alike at times. :D  But anyway, again a very nice original score, provides a strong soundtrack for the series.  And the opening theme sets the perfect atmosphere to it.Well overall I can say I'm really enjoying this series. What more can I say, it's truly Award Worthy.

The show starts off with a lot of potential and intoduces several characters that develop the story in a positive way; however, this was short lived.  The story, in my opinion, fills you with hope and leaves you wishing for this wonderful ending, and then crushes your soul in a matter of two episodes.  If you do not want to feel as though you just wasted your time by breaking your heart hoping for a good ending, then do not watch this show. ', 'Basically you can sum up AIR in two words, magic and drama.But let´s get to the details.Story 7/10:The anime starts with Yukito Kunisaki. Yukito is a traveler... well, more of a bum.He travels from town to town. He owns money by performing a trick he learned from his mother.He sits down at the side of the road and tries to get attention of children passing by.Then he let´s a doll make some moves, without touching it or using strings.So basically he´s using magic....Also i think he´s using magic to not get catched by the police.Well, it might be just me, but i whould instantly call the cops if i saw a guy like him, who wantsto show a special ""trick"" to some little children...However, Yukito gets to a small village.There he mets several girls.They all happen to have serious problems.Mostly psychological problems, or serious family issues.Yukito gets involved with the girls and starts to help them.The anime is divided in four story-arcs. Each one featuring Yukito and two to three people of the village.Charakters 7/10:Most of the charackters are stereo-types.Some are more interesting, but, like i said, most are stereotypes.For example, the innocent, naive and clumsy little girl, which acts so cute andsweet that you´ll get toothache just by looking at her.Or the very reliable older sister  type.Or the hyperactive little tomboyish girl.The charackters featured in the, let´s call it ""flashback"", in episodeseven to nine are by far the most intersting charakters of the anime.Art 8/10:The art is quite good. The colors are bright.Sometimes there are CGI-elements or whole scenes.If you think about the year, AIR was made it doesn´t look to bad, but the CGI didn´t age well,especially when you think about the fact, that the CGI-effects weren´t neccessary most of the time.Enjoiment 9/10:Well, AIR was simply made to make the audience feel sad.And in this aspect it succeeds.On the other hand, the comedic parts are quite predictable because of their sereotypical nature.So, if you want to enjoy AIR, you have to watch it because you like drama.To be honest, the first two arcs are actually quite boring.But with the seventh episode the anime gets rolling.First with the really interesting characters from episodes seven to nine, which i mentioned earlierand the final arc, which is really something else.Overall 7/10:The problem of AIR is definitly the first half.These two arcs are totally unneccassary and don´t add anything to the second half.Just like the annoing charackters featured in them.But if you are able to endure them you are rewardedwith a really strong second half and a great resolution of the final arc.

The landscapes and town of the anime was beautiful, making the anime that much more enjoyable to watch.Story 9/10: The story is original, it revolves around the legend of 'the girl in the sky'. The story is quite sad thoughtout but not predictable at the least. It always made me guess what was going to happen. The plot was thought out very well. It was nice to see an anime that didn't really have any concept of another.Art 10/10: The drawings were incredible. They were all very bright and sharp. I loved how they created the characters. The...enviroment was beautiful, how they drew everything was just amazing, it really adds to the enjoyment of the anime.Sound 10/10: The soundtrack was amazing, they chose the best songs to be played, very fitting music to the plot and what was happening in each scene. The voices were very well recorded as well.Character 10/10: Each character seemed to be very planned out. Which is a good thing, they all seemed to have very difference personalities to one other. The main character Misuzu Kamio who likes dinosaurs and lives with her mom, who seems to not have much time for her.Enjoyment 10/10: It was very enjoyable to watch, the sounds the characters and the amazing drawings make it something you really want to watch.

He was funny and really likable (not to mention cute), and I found myself laughing out loud with him and that puppet of his. He is the reason why I give the anime a 6 and not a 4.However, I found the other characters really uninteresting, and the plot revolving round them was extremely eye-roll inducing, at least for...me. Once the problem was revealed, it was ridiculously easy to predict the rest of the plot.One story I thought was actually pretty neat was the Feudal Japan one. That is probably because it spent less time trying to induce you to start crying and more time being entertaining (not saying there aren't supposedly tear-jerker moments in it). All of the 3 characters were much more likable, including the princess/winged girl a.k.a Misuzu's past incarnation. She seemed to be a much stronger girl than meek Misuzu - which, despite what anyone says, I mostly pitied, and I don't think that should be the main emotion you feel towards the driving character of a series. I mean, sure, you can feel sorry for her position, but she should fight back and stay strong and whatnot, right? At least, that's the kind of character I root for.It went downhill fast when *SPOILER* Yukito turned into a crow. How could they do that to the best character in the anime?! Sigh.In conclusion, if you're looking for a really dramatic anime with burdened, fragile girls, this is for you. However, I won't be going round advertising this one for anyone else. me.

While that is partly the case, looking at it objectively, there is a lot to love about this title.So what makes Air so special?...~ An Unforgettable Encounter ~“Seawall”It’s difficult to forget the vivid image of Misuzu standing atop the seawall, yearning for the sky, as Yukito wakes and sees her standing there. This is the moment I realised there was something different about this show. Clouds, ocean and wind are all painted together in this one scene that serves as a visual introduction to the themes to be presented down the road.~ A Multi-Layered Storyline ~“Simplexity”The beauty of Air’s story is the age-old dictum of less is more; or rather it is a great example of ‘complexity born of simplicity’. The plot, without really spoiling much, boils down to trying to free a cursed winged being, whose soul reincarnates constantly. I feel even that is over-simplifying it, but it’s the characters that make this story so touching and humanly relevant. Air is, in essence, about love, and it’s many manifestations.Again, without spoiling anything, we are presented with love between parent and child, man and woman, siblings and a love that cannot realistically be categorised, but is nevertheless one of the most profound in the series.Furthermore, Air’s ending is unusual for an anime in two aspects (no spoilers). One, is that it is bittersweet and combines an equal amount of tragedy and joy – though you’ll still cry your heart out, I can almost guarantee that. Second is that it makes you think, makes you want to watch it again and pick up more details about the plot (adding to the re-watch value) and invites discussion. So rarely do anime present the viewer with something that isn’t a straight, no-brainer ending that this is – if you’ll excuse the pun – a breath of fresh air.In any case, I strongly suggest that you go into watching Air with the mindset that it doesn’t treat you like a dunce; it will require thinking and re-watching for you to understand all of it. Many people discount the plot as ‘confusing’ and therefore badly written. But it is, in fact, quite to the contrary; Air is a simple, yet complex and intelligently written, tightly written story.~ No Less Unfortunate, a Protagonist ~“Empathy”Misuzu is one of the most, if not the most empathetic character in existence. Jun Maeda and the other writers at Key know how to make you feel for their characters. There’s a reason Misuzu is my favourite character of all time and that reason is empathy. Empathy can be established if a character adheres to the following:Misfortune befalls the characterThey are kindThey are funnyThey are relatableAfter watching, you’ll know which of those Misuzu falls into, and they just happen to be some of the characteristics that evoke the strongest feeling of empathy towards a character.~ The Sound of a Seaside Town ~“Atmosphere”I can say nothing other than that Air excels in the sound department. I only noticed it on my last re-watch, but the sound design in Air is incredible. After a bit of research I noticed that it was released with 5.1 surround sound, the only one of the Key/3 (Air, Kanon [2006] and Clannad + After Story) to be given this lavish treatment. Furthermore, Ted Jensen, a very high profile mastering engineer helped in this endeavor and wow, does it sound great.The sound design plays a huge part in establishing the beautiful, melancholic atmosphere of Air and I know next time I watch it, it will be in the comfort of my new 7.1 surround sound headphones.The music, taken directly from the visual novel is also amazing. It also plays a huge part in establishing the atmosphere, with ‘Natsukage’ playing at Misuzu and Yukito’s first meeting, making it all the more memorable with this beautiful piano piece. And I’m not sure how they do it, but Key manages to make synths fit so well into the mood that I actually appreciate the fact that they’re there. That is to say nothing of the equally wonderful opening theme, written and performed by Lia, who has never let me down.~ A Picturesque Sky ~“Painting”The art, like the sound; is amazing. It’s difficult to believe this was released in early 2005. Air was made in the period where digital colouring helped make anime look much more refined and polished, but was not yet tainted by the addition of a myriad of special effects. This gives it a very warm, pure, visual character that suits the story perfectly.The clouds and ocean are beautifully rendered and are as much characters in the story as the human characters are themselves. The character designs themselves are some of my favourite, as I absolutely adore Key’s character designs. They aren’t for everyone, as the ‘bug-eyes’ can turn some people off, but I can’t really say anything objective about this other than “I really like them”.~ Finale ~""Adieu""And this is where subjectivity reenters the picture. Air will always, and forever be my favourite anime series. Nostalgia will only serve to reinforce that fact. I hope I’ve convinced those who seem apprehensive, or do not appreciate the beauty that is this story to watch it with the right mindset.I hope you enjoyed the review ^_^Now go, watch; for she is waiting in the air… ~ An Unforgettable Encounter ~“Seawall”It’s difficult to forget the vivid image of Misuzu standing atop the seawall, yearning for the sky, as Yukito wakes and sees her standing there.

I am really sad that this show is so short. They don’t seem to take enough time to flesh out the story lines or the characters. There are way too many girls that are really strange and you never really get much story line about them. The only girl you get to know is Misuzu but she doesn’t have much personality except for the whole girl in the sky thing.They also never talk about the girl in the sky much even if she was supposed to be the main focus...or even give us an answer about her. The answer we do get comes too late in the story line and it leaves more questions than answers. It’s mostly about what strange effect happens when someone finds one of her feathers but even then I don’t quite understand it. Are the feathers some sort of wish maker and if so, then why does it always end up in sadness?The ark with Minagi Tohno feels very out-of-place in a sense and as though it was rushed. There really was no backbone to the story and the ending, though it made me cry seemed rather out-of-place.All in all, this story is really slow and hard to keep watching; sometimes almost dull in some parts.The animation is rather pretty, bright and colorful. Unfortunately, some of the characters are actually lacking a bit and I’m not really happy that Misuzu’s mom looks more like an older sister instead. All the artwork is pretty much fan based. Potato the dog doesn’t even really look like a dog too which threw me off. The beginning has a lot of aspects of a beginning for a visual Game rather than an actual anime so it means that it looks good and helps set the mood of the show.The music is beautiful, both the beginning and ending made me want to find the actual music. The background music is sometimes not very loud and hard to hear, mostly consisting of silence or sweet gentle feelings. The montages that help make time pass seem to be used way to often with the same sappy song. The voice actors are good but some don’t seem good enough. I have to say, I like the English voice actors better than the Japanese, probably just because I’m more used to English voices.I like this but it is rather slow and I don’t think I will be watching the whole show at once again. I may watch one or two of my favorite episodes though. or even give us an answer about her. The answer we do get comes too late in the story line and it leaves more questions than answers.

I dropped them and said I completed them.Story:Other two girls aside, here's the plot: (SPOILER ALERT) Misuzu meets a hobo who wants to stay with her, but she breaks down whenever she tries to make friends. Then it is revealed that she is cursed to die if anyone gets attached to her. And ofcourse, she meets Aeris and Dumbledore.*end of spoilers*The story isn't good at all, and Air is non-stop lack of action. Nothing ever happens.Sound:The soundtrack may be good, but...none of the tracks stand out at all, to the point of being mixed up with ones I listened to later in better anime.Graphics:This got more attention than the actual storytelling.Characters:Unfortunately, the characters aren't that great. They lack depth, and the parents don't treat Misuzu like a real child. She's no hero, either. None of the main girls can solve their own problems, as they don't even try to work things out themselves.Enjoyment:...Overall:Skip it. There are much better shows out there and your time is precious. none of the tracks stand out at all, to the point of being mixed up with ones I listened to later in better anime.Graphics:This got more attention than the actual storytelling.Characters:Unfortunately, the characters aren't that great.

There are much better shows out there and your time is precious."", ""Air is an extremely difficult show to rate as you would others since an individual's enjoyment is largely dependent on whether or not they understood what the bloody hell actually happened. It's certainly a confusing show, but whilst it may have failed miserably in some aspects, it doesn't do as poorly as my overall rating might make a person think.We'll start with the positives.Of course, being from KyoAni, the visuals are stunning. Even though the character designs (with their large eyes, bizarre hair and pointy noses typical of KEY) could throw off a viewer, each character is still well-animated and the backgrounds look beautiful. Heck,...even the sky in the opening sequence is gorgeous viewing. Yes, the animation might fall far short of the stuff we have coming out today, but considering that Air was made around eight years ago, it's really very good next to other stuff of its time.The music adds to this atmosphere: not just the opening and ending themes, which are naturally good, but also background music. There is nothing particularly unusual about it, but in its simplicity it really shines, and not a single piece fails to evoke the right mood for the scene it's played over.Unfortunately, in terms of actual content, the show is...I hesitate to say 'poor' because it tries. It tries so hard to tell us a different, inventive story, and in the originality stakes it certainly did a great job. But that's just the problem: the show tries so hard to be different that it ends up losing a lot of viewers in the process, because it gets incredibly bizarre and doesn't seem to have any real sense of direction.The ending of every story arc is very rushed- sure, we always have our resolution, but it's never fully made clear why or how the resolution came about. And before we've had time to fully comprehend what just happened, there's a new plotline to focus on. Maybe this just really isn't the sort of show you're meant to marathon in one sitting as I did, but I found this jarring.And, unfortunately, the characters suffer too. This is possibly the saddest thing about the series, because most of the characters were very likeable and interesting, but we never got to see a lot of real depth to them and this would really have made the series more gripping and involving than it actually ended up being. The last two or three episodes did actually become more absorbing emotionally, and might even bring a tear or two to the eyes of some viewers, but it was too late by that point for it to make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things.I appreciate that the issues with a poorly explained plot and poorly developed (albeit likeable) characters was mostly down to the fact that Air only had twelve episodes in which to tell its story, but I get the feeling that if Air had been more focused in regards to whose story it wanted to tell and how, it could have been a much better series. It's just a pity that the lack of focus mixed with the short length meant that Air failed in the aspects a show like this relies on most heavily.To be honest, I'd never say that Air is an awful show or that people should never watch it, because its redeeming qualities do shine through and I know that other people have genuinely really enjoyed the show as much as I'd hoped to.But I certainly wouldn't put it on a 'must watch' list, because as animes go, this is one that's worth the watch on a rainy afternoon, but could probably be missed overall. even the sky in the opening sequence is gorgeous viewing. Yes, the animation might fall far short of the stuff we have coming out today, but considering that Air was made around eight years ago, it's really very good next to other stuff of its time.The music adds to this atmosphere: not just the opening and ending themes, which are naturally good, but also background music. There is nothing particularly unusual about it, but in its simplicity it really shines, and not a single piece fails to evoke the right mood for the scene it's played over.Unfortunately, in terms of actual content, the show is...I hesitate to say 'poor' because it tries. It tries so hard to tell us a different, inventive story, and in the originality stakes it certainly did a great job. But that's just the problem: the show tries so hard to be different that it ends up losing a lot of viewers in the process, because it gets incredibly bizarre and doesn't seem to have any real sense of direction.The ending of every story arc is very rushed- sure, we always have our resolution, but it's never fully made clear why or how the resolution came about. And before we've had time to fully comprehend what just happened, there's a new plotline to focus on. Maybe this just really isn't the sort of show you're meant to marathon in one sitting as I did, but I found this jarring.And, unfortunately, the characters suffer too.

It's a very heavy anime in terms of how the story develops to the viewers of anime. So many tear-jerking moments for me. Now after this and being more accustomed to Japanese media culture in general, it does make me feel like Air (the whole anime series in question) is like a high-budget J-dorama that is animated instead. I like it. I like the general mood and the presentation of this. However, I don't think I can watch it again.If I can describe the end of...this anime series in the most mundane and way, I will say it like this. Tragedy being masked with uncertainty and hope. Negative, positive, and something whatever all mixed into one. A huge rush of various emotions will be presented in your mind when you watch this, so please be extra aware about this. I do recommend people this anime for sure.One thing I really like about this is the opening theme, Tori No Uta. I consider it a masterpiece that fits the general storyline. And exceptionally decent voice acting. I do not forget about this. The opening song really encourages the viewers to pay attention to the story at best.Obviously, I would not recommend this anime to people who take stories lightly. There is much fewer instances of comedic scenes than I expected. Of course, why do I say it like this? It is a very a serious anime. this anime series in the most mundane and way, I will say it like this. Tragedy being masked with uncertainty and hope.

It\'s gorgeous in every single way from its visuals to its music to its story. It\'s a series I really liked the first time around and upon rewatching it several years later I liked it even more. Admittedly, given the lack of action/combat/violence this kind of anime isn\'t for everyone, but if you aren\'t an adrenaline junky and enjoy anime focused on story and characters and have an appreciation for anime as an art form, I really couldn\'t recommend Air strongly enough.Art-The presentation of Air is IMMACULATE. I challenge you to find an anime with a superior presentation as...a whole, nevermind one that came out over a decade ago as Air did. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the scenery is breathtaking and artistically beautiful and the music and art play together absolutely flawlessly. Animations are crisp and smooth and it is crystal clear the animators and the director paid tremendous attention to detail. I would give the presentation of Air as a whole the absolute highest possible score.Sound-The sound, along with the visuals, is the other part of an anime\'s presentation and as mentioned in the previous section, I\'d definitively give the presentation of Air a 10/10. In the sound department you\'ve got one of the best of the best in the business in Vic Mignogna voicing the main character, followed closely by proven, talented industry veterans in Monica Rial, Luci Christian and Kira Vincent-Davis.The soundtrack here is magical- as a whole one of the very best I\'ve ever heard in any anime of any genre- and fits absolutely perfectly with the rest of the presentation, completing the trifecta of art/animation, voice acting and sound/music that makes or breaks a presentation. Several songs are truly memorable and worth adding to your playlist. In particular ""Wing"", ""Bird\'s Poem"" and ""This Place"" were huge standouts for me that I\'ve listened to countless times independently, but this is truly a ""can\'t go wrong"" kind of soundtrack with winner after winner and I highly, highly recommend listening to the entire soundtrack for anyone even remotely interested in anime music.Character-In my opinion the story is the only imperfect part of Air. Right out the gate I want to say that the story is gorgeous (just like every other part of this anime), it\'s way deeper and more complicated than you\'d expect from this kind of anime (which I absolutely love and view as a positive thing) and it\'ll take quite a bit of critical thinking and reflection to truly understand the plot as a whole.So what\'s the problem? Well, the last part of what I just stated is the biggest issue. The base premise of this anime is very, very simple. However, the bigger picture plot and its resolution is quite complicated and it is perhaps not explained clearly enough for a number of viewers to truly understand all of it. I think part of it is Air trying to maintain its omnipresent sense of magic and mystery, which I thoroughly enjoyed throughout the anime, and I also think they intentionally wanted certain aspects of the show to be left to artistic interpretation, but they may have taken this a little too far. I think it\'d be fair to assume a number of watchers, especially first time watchers, would not entirely understand the resolution of this anime or why specific things did or did not occur. The resolution of this anime could definitely be a bit more clear.Also I should note, while I personally did not feel this way and really enjoyed the ride from start to finish, objectively I can see how one could view this anime as having pacing issues. It isn\'t in any rush to divulge its mysteries or get into the main plot and for those who need something a bit more uptempo in order to be entertained, perhaps Air wouldn\'t be exciting enough or fast paced enough for that kind of viewer. I watched this most recently with my wife and she felt it had a bit of a slow start and she\'d have preferred the overarching plot be investigated sooner.Enjoyment-Enjoyment is likely the trickiest and most subjective aspect of Air to evaluate. This anime is not for everyone, and I suspect most viewers will either be absolutely awe struck as I was or will view this as quite mediocre and nothing special with very little in between. This is a show for those who appreciate visual beauty, anime music, anime as an art form and a deep, emotionally affecting plot. This is not an anime for those who need combat/violence/blood, those who need high energy or uptempo shows in order to keep their attention or those who are looking for pervy fan service. Personally, I really, really liked this anime.Overall-The gold standard for presentation, a surprisingly deep and complex plot with moments that will inevitably hit you right in the feelings and a sense of magic, mystery and artistic beauty that is unbelievably hard to replicate, Air is simply a breathtakingly gorgeous anime as a whole. It\'s not for everyone, but if this review leads you to think this is probably the kind of show you\'d enjoy then this is an absolute must watch.+IMMACULATE presentation- exceptional voice acting, music and animation throughout+Excellent story- simple premise, very deep/complex application+Genuinely emotionally affecting-Bigger picture plot is very complicated and potentially difficult to understand-Slower paced and less action than certain viewers may preferOBJECTIVE RATING- 9PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9.5 a whole, nevermind one that came out over a decade ago as Air did.

But, yet I decided to watch it because I was craving some KyoAni. And to be honest, this anime had me hooked- but only during the first six episodes- after which it went so downhill fast that I became more depressed by that than any of the tragic moments in this anime. And that my friend, is a huge problem.Air, for me personally wasn’t as emotional as I wanted it to be- but it did still did make me go. ‘Aww…that sucks.” But, then...again after five seconds later, I’ll just completely forget about it. The pacing in Air was just awful to say the least- and it's pacing is some of the worst I have seen.Normally, I like shows that tend to be fast paced- but Air’s speed was like five times that of any other normal anime. It’s like they tried cramping so much material into only twelve episodes. Air had several arcs which all had potential of being something memorable. However, they all fell flat due to the poor execution of it. Arcs that should have been four episodes long were instead less than two- but yet despite that flaw I still thought Air was something enjoyable.But, then even finding enjoyment in this anime came to a bitter end- when the story decided to completely take place in a different time period. This was in order to somewhat explain Misuzu’s reason for being sick and also Yukito’s search for the winged maiden. Those episodes however felt really boring to me- and I couldn’t care less about those characters in that certain arc. Giving them screen time, instead of our main protagonists felt like a complete waste to me. Speaking of which- let’s talk about the characters.Unlike, Yuuichi from Kanon or Tomoya from Clannad- Yukito doesn’t have that big of a harem to brag about . It only consists of Misuzu, Kano, Minagi and Michiru even though the latter didn’t have the honour of being featured in the opening credits. To be honest, none of the supporting characters stood out to me- but they were okay in my opinion. Nothing good or bad. The three characters that I did care about was Yukito, Misuzu and Haruko. Like, this anime would have been a whole lot better if it just focused on them and their daily life and struggles with Misuzu’s illness.Yukito to my surprise was distinguishable from Tomoya and Yuuichi- but he did have that same charm those other two did. He was very likeable for a main character and I also really like the bond he had with both Misuzu and Haruko. Sadly, his bonds with the other girls weren’t as well handled though. Misuzu is just a really sweet girl- and she contributed to some funny moments earlier on this anime. Her relationship with Haruko was really good and if this anime had more episodes to further develop it- then maybe there relationship would have garnered more praise from me. But, during the final episodes- seeing them together did tug at a couple of my heartstrings at least.Also what the hell is Potato? Is it a dog or a Pokemon as it keeps saying Pico Pico?As for the animation, it’s pretty decent- given the anime came out almost 11 years ago. I guess, what I liked about the animation the most was the way it made the clouds look realistic. The scenes with sunsets were nice to look at too from time to time. The animation did a good enough of job creating the eventful summer that the story takes place. I liked the character designs too but the colouring of some of the characters hair just didn’t feel natural to me. I wonder if that makes sense- because the hair looked very subpar to me.The opening for Air is one of my all-time favourite things from this anime. It is my second favourite Key opening and for good reasons too. This opening makes me want to fly, no kidding and I never dared to skip this opening. Lia’s singing was so lovely and so she better sing the opening for Rewrite too. The intro with the clouds just makes my shoulder do some weird dance. The opening is just amazing to say the least.Finally, before I assign the show with a score- I must sing praise of the dub. Unlike the Clannad dub- this one is really good- but I guess that would be because it was done by Funimation. Vic Minogna was really good as Yukito- and Monica Rial too shined as Misuzu. But, my favourite performance was definitely Luci Christian as Haruko. This is one of those roles where Lucy Christian doesn’t voice a cutesy high school girl- and she does an excellent job at that.Overall Air had a lot of potential- but sadly it got all wasted away in my opinion. Even if I did enjoy the first half- the second half was just so messy- not to mention the  info dumps on the Winged Maiden that has some connection with both Misuzu and Yukito was not helpful- and iit was something I didn’t appreciate. In fact, what they did to Yukito towards the last couple of episodes actually made me mad- but I can’t tell you cause that would be a spoiler.The only bits of this anime that made me sad where the ones regarding Misuzu and Haruko- whereas the rest had no impact on me. That was mainly due to the fact- that the arcs revolving around certain characters were rushed and so it didn’t give me much time to grow attached to them enough to care about their situations.With all that in mind- it pains me to give Air TV a 5 out of 10 and that you should probably SKIP IT. I really wanted to like Air as much as Kanon and Clannad- but I guess somethings are not meant to be. I don’t however hate this anime- it’s just it was very disappointing in my eyes. Also, do you completely disagree with my points, because it’s fine, if you do cause we do have differing opinions and I am aware that all a lot of people love this show and it sucks that I am not part of that group. again after five seconds later, I’ll just completely forget about it.

Breaking it down:Story: Air's story is very well done, it is full of moments that can make you laugh with characters that feel like old friends, and then cry with characters that have unfair lives. It is a story that I enjoyed, although I found it to be quite confusing at times, and had some plot holes at others. Taking all of this into account, I...still think that it was great and a giving it a 9/10.Art: The art and visuals in this anime do not disappoint, they rarely do in these. I liked the drawing style used in this anime (as I did with the others), it being among one of my favourite styles. 10/10 for art.Sound: The music in this anime did not disappoint. Anything that the anime may have lacked in story fluency was made up for by the stunning soundtrack that followed it, I can classify the soundtrack, especially Aozora, as some of the more beautiful songs that I have listened to, and bothered to buy afterwards. 9/10 for sound.Character: The characters were very well done in this anime, having many of them be quite intricate and well written/built without it feeling forced or too-perfect in their designs. All characters had lots of development, and the introduction of several new characters in the Summer Arc, partway through did not make me feel as annoyed or confused as they usually do, instead I think it was quite refreshing to have a change to some new characters that were fun and I loved being around them (especially after doing research on their voice actors). 10/10 for characters.Enjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this anime, and after finishing it I felt like I had lost an important part of my daily dose of beauty, but I had also found something even greater within this story, it's own themes and morals have definitely left a lasting impact on my person. 10/10 for enjoyment.Overall: To summarise, I greatly appreciated this anime, as I have all of the other works that Jun Maeda has been in (that I have seen thus far), being one of my favourite people in the staff of anime industry, and this anime managed to meet my already high expectations. Overall 9/10. Gao~! still think that it was great and a giving it a 9/10.Art: The art and visuals in this anime do not disappoint, they rarely do in these.

Grab your tissues to watch this!) ', ""AIR is one of those uber-popular animes that just about everyone who's into anime—from the casual watcher to the straight up otaku—seems to know about, and I think that the level of recognition that it has is well deserved. Whether or not you are into shoujo [girly] animes, subject matter aside, this is still an anime is worth taking a look at, it has: excellent art, good music and all the key elements for a good story, drama, romance, comedy and a bit of action.ART/AnimationThe art style is very modern, everything is very clean with smooth lines and very bright colors. You can tell...this show was done by the very best of anime artists and the latest of art/CG technolgies. Very beautiful, picturesque scenes of sky, water and nature. Movement was flawless, most obviously when it came to hair and fabric movements.Music/SoundThe music wasn't great but it wasn't bad...it was standard J-POP dance beat but it was also very catchy....I had the song stuck in my head for a while afterwards.StoryThis is such a great and original story, yet I'm not quite sure what exactly what the story is about since it's told from so many varying perspectives. I guess it would suffice to say that it's about a winged girl who's up somewhere in the sky. She's imprisoned or suffering or both, I'm not quite sure but she's been in that state for a very very long time. The complexity of the story rests with the fact that this story about the girl is revealed bit by bit from the different persepectives of each character beacause they are all—in some way—affected or have had their lives influenced by this winged girl. But this is what makes the story so great and original, they way it was told....the narration, it was very original and never boring nor repetitive. The subject really doesn't matter if you look at HOW the story was told/structured and how well they pulled it off. In fact, the subject was of little consequence since it's pretty obvious the direction of the story focused more on character development rather than an overt act of rescuing the winged girl.CharactersAll the characters were very likable and each had their own moving tale to tell. Each of the characters, even the males, seemed very normal, very human and very vulnerable.....and eventho there's a bit of magic and superpowers in the show, there were no obvious heroes or villans to speak of. Character designs were done with the obvious intent of being cute as is chiefly with shoujo animes....big eyes, lots of hair and frilly clothes also, they all kind of seemed to have the same faces, to be precise there seemed to be only two face model types for the females and one face model/type for males....but it isn't annoying or anything, since the cast is relatively small.EnjoymentI enjoyed this show, eventho it was only 13 eps. I think that most people will too. Buy it. Keep it. Rewatch. this show was done by the very best of anime artists and the latest of art/CG technolgies. Very beautiful, picturesque scenes of sky, water and nature. Movement was flawless, most obviously when it came to hair and fabric movements.Music/SoundThe music wasn't great but it wasn't bad...it was standard J-POP dance beat but it was also very catchy....I had the song stuck in my head for a while afterwards.StoryThis is such a great and original story, yet I'm not quite sure what exactly what the story is about since it's told from so many varying perspectives. I guess it would suffice to say that it's about a winged girl who's up somewhere in the sky. She's imprisoned or suffering or both, I'm not quite sure but she's been in that state for a very very long time. The complexity of the story rests with the fact that this story about the girl is revealed bit by bit from the different persepectives of each character beacause they are all—in some way—affected or have had their lives influenced by this winged girl.

I think the development of the other characters that we saw in the first few episodes would have been nice in my opinion. This series had me on edge and close to tears by the time I finished it. In fact, it had me crying in a few episodes. It's definitely one of those &quot;What if you were in their shoes?&quot; kind of thing. At least it was for me. :( I love this anime and I recommend it! "", ""At first this anime seems kiddy looking and something a guy wouldn't watch, Misuzu seems clumzy stupid and a typical klutz which made me roll my eyes... The only reason I kept watching was because of the Opening song tbh.Untill I got up to around episode 7. Everything began to change, you can feel something sad is about to happen and sense a build up of some sort you no longer see Misuzu as a dumb klutz but instead you see her as a very cute kind generous loving caring free spirited did I mention cute? Girl.I'm going to try to not spoil this anime...as much as possible since it's important not to know the plot till you watch it.The storyline is at first very difficult to follow as you're wandering who is who's recarination or what does the girl with the wings do or why does the girls with the wings have to fly in the sky... Makes very little sense but don't panic, use your imagination and sit through the 13 episodes of the anime before you decide anything.The ending. This anime has one of the saddest epic emotional endings I ever seen. Seriously this anime isn't even romance and you're like crying inside.The magic of Kyoto animation is that make little things appear like a huge deal and once you get used to that kind of atmosphere the anime is extremely emotional.But in a logic point of view compared to rl tragedy movies this anime is probably nothing compared to the hardships of what is displayed in most rl movies however rl movies don't have characters like Misuzu, rl movies don't have the magical atmosphere nor the bright use of colours and the super cute characters which totally change you.Don't judge this anime by it's cover, watch all 13 episodes and most likely you'll fall in love like I did. as much as possible since it's important not to know the plot till you watch it.The storyline is at first very difficult to follow as you're wandering who is who's recarination or what does the girl with the wings do or why does the girls with the wings have to fly in the sky...

"", ""Oh man, where do I begen?The 10000th summer.Air was quite something, I know a lot of people in the anime community that hate this anime, and others who say its poetry in motion, and others say that it is, the saddest anime ever made. With so many mixed reviews I decided to watch it and make my own opinion. Since it was so short, I decided I would watch it in one day, I started at 9 am and finished by 1 in the afternoon. And for the rest of the day, I was in a drift, just thinking about this show.There are four...kinds of stories in this show. The one of the puppet master who travels to a quite seaside town were he meets a shy young girl who is very sad, and dreams of seeing the winged girl in the sky. Over the course of the show, the girl encounters a huge hurtal that changes the relashinship of her and her mother. That, to me was the saddest part of the show, were I had to wipe my eyes a couple times. It was just so beautifuly done, great voice acting. The fourth story tells how the girl in the sky came to be, its sort of like a subplot/OVA that they slipped into the show, but it works, and I always like a little backstory for all my characters when I'm watching anime.I think Air's message is that where there is happiness, there must also be saddness. They go hand-n-hand. The happiness of motherhood also has its sadness, being alone can have its benifits, but after awhile its not really worth it and the only way to be happy is make friends. But even those friends can hurt you, its like a double bladed sword.All in all, Air was a trip. I neither loved it, nor hated it. The creators got their point around in 13 episodes, each one played out fantasticly as the story progressed. I do have to say, it didn't live up to the hype it had been getting. I really don't see why it would be a crime not to watch it. The art work dosen't really fit with the atmosphere of the general show. And the ending was kind of a let down. But Air is very human, it deals with real human emotions and struggles. So if you're into that, go ahead and watch it. But bring some tissues.Take care everyone. kinds of stories in this show.

I dont want to spoil any plotline or anything of that manner, but I totally recommend this, I'm a guy, and I was in tears with the last episode, I was so hooked on the characters and how the plotline expanded and involved throughout such a short time space. The soundtrack borrowed from the original infamous eroge game really did highlight the anime's characteristics and what it was truly capable of. I...loved how each and every single episode expanded on each character in depth and detail, and I am definately going to watch this again (hence buying the DVD boxset).

Some people will complain about the story, the characters, the moe designs of every female character and how sappy it might be. Who knows? That might be true once I watched it but I’m the type of guy and reviewer that’s open to anything type of genre of whatever I’m watching or listening.When Yukito Kunisaki's mother died, she left him with...two things: a talent for puppetry and stories of a lifetime search for a girl with wings who flew through the sky. Yukito takes on the quests as his own, eventually finding himself in a small town where he does odd jobs and looks after a clumsy girl named Misuzu to earn a living and place to stay. Though Misuzu also dreams of a winged girl and harbors several odd quirks, she is not the only girl/young woman in town with a story and boatload of peculiarities. Teenage Kano has a personality disorder that may or may not be related to a curse borne since childhood, Kano's adult sister Hijiri had to finish raising her after their parents died, Misuzu's hard-drinking biker-chick mother feels unfit to serve the role, and so forth. Gradually Yukito finds himself wrapped up in their stories while trying to figure out if any of the tantalizing allusions to a girl with wings mean anything.I will agree that this is one of the saddest anime that I have ever seen but it is also the sappiest anime that I’ve seen, mainly due to the story in some parts was overdramatized and it left me not caring as much as the show wants me to, not that most of the feelings you get from this were justified.  The main storyline of the show is the basic line of this vagrant meeting a bunch of characters that are more likely one-time characters that you might forget about in the next episode and then in the second half of this 12-episode series, there was another flashback storyline that lasted about 2 episodes which stumble me for a bit, like they wanted to make a show like that but only fill that part for so little time.  Then there’s Misuzu’s sickness, which was never really explained thoroughly and I think by them not explaining what she’s gotten, it’s supposed to make us more concerned for her but really it still raises some questions to whatever she’s got.For the most part, characters are fairly balanced with a good amount of personality traits in them but the secondary characters are largely forgotten in the second half for Misuzu’s arc when she was sick and even the main character Yukito wasn’t much of a presence in those episodes, not that it matters, because he wasn’t exactly a character that I actually worry about often. Yeah, he’s smarmy in the beginning but soon he turns into a different man, but I totally expect that in this type of show. Haruko, Misuzu’s mom (well, foster mother or aunt) is pictured as someone who was just stuck with Misuzu after her real parents either died or something like that but sooner or later, she and Misuzu do get close as a small family, but to say more would be spoilers.Animation is fairly great in this part of the show, although I have some gripes with that and the character designs, being that most of them looked younger than they are, like Haruko looks like a teenager than who I suspect be a 30-something woman. I know it’s a small town but it just felt like it was barely living like the mentioned characters only inhibit this town. Character designs are very moe as suspected in an anime like this.The music overall fits the tone of the series, although it’s not as manipulatively sounding as the show is, it’s very relaxing to hear, especially both the opening and ending theme songs and they are both singed by Lia, who’s also the singer for another Key series, Angel Beats. The ADV Films dub was an alright effort but not nearly enough to call it impressive. Vic Mignogna, Monica Rial and Luci Christian do deliver great performances but the others were either theatrically hammy or just awful.FINAL VERDICT: Air can be sappy at some times but as it tries to make you feel sympathy, you are left with a feeling of confusion, unbalance, and just not being into the story or characters as much. I say that you should give it a chance for yourself before you turn it away but if you liked this kind of anime, you might like it but for others, I suggest you avoid at all costs. two things: a talent for puppetry and stories of a lifetime search for a girl with wings who flew through the sky.

Where Kanon and Clannad (also harems) are developments after Air and have further story development. Honestly, I did love this anime very much, but there were too many small various downfalls that led to give it 8. The story plot at first appears all jumbled and distorted, and it becomes more clear down the road; but in a slow manner that people must use their own logic to come with the ideas.Story:  To tell the truth, this show really needs to be re-watched a couple of times to...get the full idea of what Key (developer of all three animes) is trying to project. That's why most people turn away from this kind of show because it's hard to determine and is not a &quot;in your face&quot; answer. Also, since it is only 13 episodes, they could only put much into the show; and I think there really seems no exact closure which is very disappointing.Art: Misuzu, Yukito and the other girls in the anime are drawn and created so well. One thing especially well known by Key is their drawing of &quot;glassy eyes.&quot; To me, that is one of their most dramatic artistic aspects. And the detail in each scene and movement, is shown perfectly; by not revealing a pause in the readers' viewing.Sound: Key also has an amazing ear for developing small soundtracks to go with a certain scene and depicting the moods. The main song themes, Tori no Uta (Bird's Poem), Farewell Song, and Aozora (Blue Skies), were all sung by Lia but the lyrics were developed by the software company's main scenario writer, lyricist, and musical composer, Jun Maeda.Character: One downside to some harem animes, like this one, is that there are many different girls. Each one has their own situation and much character development is brought. But as soon as the girl's situation is finished they are sort of &quot;tossed away&quot; and are not brought up much in the anime anymore. Key has done that matter in Air for most the time. Sometimes there are too many different characters brought up in the scenes, its very questionable as is to what their purpose is; but  in the end, the girls are benefiting each other to creating a more full character development for the next girl.Enjoyment: This anime really isn't one that you would see straight 13 episodes in one day because of the intense emotion and problem-solving is very draining of the brain. But if Asian dramas suit you, then Air fits perfectly within that category.Overall: My own ranking for this was actually a 9 earlier, but as I wrote this review, it shows that Air TV is still and was only a pre-show of what Key's animes would become. That is how Kanon and Clannad turned about because they were the further tuning and corrections of Air TV. Honestly, if Kanon made you cry, then Air will melt your heart even more. Even with only 13 episodes, if took my breath away and left one of the deepest marks emotionally. If you think anime is all blood, action or romantic comedy, then this show is most certainly not for you.

Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu\'s aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being... the history begins!That\'s it, sorry for my newbie english t_t\'', ""This show is sad, happy, triumphant and beautiful.  You will probably cry at least once at some point during the show.  That being said, it's not necessary to say that this show's plot is conveyed well so that you feel the emotion it is supposed to make you feel.The animation is crisp and shows motion very well.  The shadows and highlights are done perfectly, but it's not overpowering.  Kyoto Animation did a wonderful job animating this series.  So well, that the art surpasses the quality of that from the visual novel it is based on.Each of the characters are unique...and have a very interesting story to tell.  Although it is obivous that Misuzu's story is the most important one, do not let the others go without the same amount of attention.  On the contrary.  Each of them are wonderful and worthwhile, as well as enjoyable.The soundtrack of this anime is perfect, meaning it guides the story and helps you feel the mood of the story.  The opening theme reflects the content of the show very well, and that is based on the audio alone.  The ending theme song is somewhat lacking, but that's not very important, as it is what ends each episode instead of starting it off.Overall, this anime is beautiful, a very carefully constructed piece of art that is refreshing and warms you up. and have a very interesting story to tell.

The story starts with Yukito a Magician from the streetsand then he encouters Misuzu a girl...that seems like dumb but that really has suffered a lot. As a the story goes by you'll see that more characters will be shown and each one related to the ''Air'' itself. With this story simply has some forms to twist the viewer's  mind in certain way. Because The plot has  like miniplots (Like 3 I guess) that will make you bored you since when I saw this series the plot was too linear for me. The characters didn't show that form of ''Love'' and ''Relationship'' cause The settings and themes weren't show in a way that the audience could understand.The first miniplot was the one that hate most because it doesn't developed in a way that the characters show how they wanted to be in the Air. They just like ''feel'' to be there. Because it doesn't show right away of what they suffer. That until the episode 7.The second miniplot simply made me say WTF? Cause you change from the present to the past in which that shows why the Air is united with this story but simply it doesn't that apports something brilliant.The Last one was the one that finally make the story at least to be safe because it is told from a ''different'' character and what happen to the characters after the second miniplot. This is the one that shines the most since it reveals the characters true feelings and what they have being suffering. Simply great this one.ART.The Art is simply great. It reminded me of the times when I saw anime as a kid simply beautiful and showing a great interest cause it holds a form of indicate everything to the characters up to the scenario. Simply brilliant. The only think I hate was the character desing of the face but that in the characters part.SOUND.Another great thing. Because it contains a feeling of peace with every instrument that the musicians used. Perhaps the OP/END are not of my taste because it's music that is too slow and will not make part of my mood.CHARACTERS.Well they are well desing with the art that shown but The only problem that I see as I say that their faces were too small to be drawn with those big eyes. Besides that, the problem that I see with every character is that they suffer in a way but show it in a form randomly cause they didn't want to say it and even to die with it. That's what I saw in everyone there.ENJOYMENT.It is not bad but you have patience since this thing twist every part of the plot. I enjoy in some sort of way but it just like of Boring, Sorprising, Randomness,sadness and WTF? forms of viewing it. I like it but the producers should'nt have done that form of way maybe they could do it directly but hidden at the same time, to make a plot incredibly awesome.Overall 8/10 Since the ending is incredible but the forms and arcs ruins great part of this anime cause its confusing.

So if you want to the play with your watch this."", 'Okay, ill probably take some heat for this review, but this should be said.Air has all the makings of being a gread anime, there was only one problem: It Sucked.Now lets talk about why I think that this did in fact suck. For starters, as ive already implied, there was potential for something truly magical, but it never happens. This anime couldve been the poster-child for the phrase ""cut the shit!"" because after the halfway mark I found myself thinking this at least once every thirty seconds over the course of the second half of the show(do the math and it comes out to about...3600 times this though crossed my mind).Some more problems are that there was a questionable beginning, the plot climaxed far too soon, and only about half the viewers knew half of what was going on half the time! In addition the characters spend more time talking about their dreams than Martin Luther King Jr. (yes that just happenned) and I get that the dreams were supposed to be symbolic, but after a certain point you dont care anymore, and they just become a burden.I was sad at the end of this, but not in a good way. When im sad or crying at the end of an anime I want it to be because the story touched, or changed me somehow (examples would be angel beats, or clannad) NOT because I was sad/pissed that I just wasted time watching the show.I will end on this: the story was cut far too short, given more time i think that they couldve taken this somewhere; this just goes back to what ive been saying about wasted potential. The end (if you stick around long enough to see it) is quite touching (that is if you understand it) but that in no way salvages the ruined hulk of this show.PS- the marks I gave Air are based on the fact that I knew what was going on, and I am recognizing that there was potential, had I not understood it they wouldve been far lower. 3600 times this though crossed my mind).Some more problems are that there was a questionable beginning, the plot climaxed far too soon, and only about half the viewers knew half of what was going on half the time!

However comparing to the plot development of other anime, Air doesn\'t have the capability to step up to the plate. The characters were fine and all developed very well, music and art were good for their time period of release. (Spoiler Alert).The only problem I found was the plot twist of when Yukito ""dies"" to save Misuzu. The plot twist and development of this event ruined the anime for me, other than the fact that...I was looking for something sad to watch, watching this after Anohana didn\'t help.Of course this is all my own personal opinion whether you choose to think I\'m just a total jackass or not is up to you.Air in its own aspect was a really good original story with an interesting way of taking a stab at the anime business. Ignoring the fact that it was adapted from an Adult Visual Novel and PC/Console game which included erotic scenes, it did its job and is one of the few anime that you can find to take a break from the standard shounen or shoujo.

It had good romance, a good story line and great characters so this anime for me is a 10/10 as it was the very first anime to make me cry. Back in 2013, I was depressed as hell due to all the bullying I was going through.When I started watching it, the opening was one of the most beautiful openings I didn't skip. Not only did it reach my expectations, but it made it even better.The characters were particularly memorable. Misuzu especially. She was one of the most unforgettable...characters I've ever seen. The story line was very touching even though it's very short. I had to stop at episode 11 just because of the super sad episode. I continued at the final episode and the ending was just depressing.I liked Air the most as it was more short, precise and watchable.

I have heard much praise for this one before I saw it myself. It had an impressive pedigree, its sister show Clannad is among one of my favorite anime shows. As such I put myself around to watch it. I can say with some certainty, that all in all it was disappointing.The story was a train wreck beginning to end. Our protagonist with irksome hair is the aimless drifter, who has...happened into the town which serves as the setting. The thing is he is not aimless at all. In fact he has the lucid and reasonable goal of find a flying woman that his late mother talked about in the stories she told him. With that very obvious goal in mind he just wanders about in search of her. When he arrives in town he meets several girls each with an issue of there own. Here is where the story takes a very Clannad turn. He spends an episode or two helping the girls with there problem, and then they never appear again. Even saying that, he doesn't actually help anyone do anything. As a matter of fact he doesn't do much of anything throughout the series. The first girl, the energetic girl who is great with animals, who may I add also had wings sprout from her back is just about forgotten the over the next few episodes. You know nothing serious. The next girl, who is also the only girl I was close to liking, has an imaginary friend of sorts and a mother who doesn't know she exists. While this is all happening our ditsy heroine is busy doing nothing as well.Writing this out reminds me how terrible this show is. Also I am out of room to type so final thoughts, Don't bother watching this series unless you wish to bore yourself. happened into the town which serves as the setting.

It is also the first one to be adapted by Kyoto Animation and well, you could say that this was their test run more or less.You might like this anime if:-You really enjoy romance anime-You are a fan of other Key adaptations-You are looking for something sad-You are looking for something fresh-You are looking for a show with a great OST...You might dislike this anime if-You dislike romance anime-You don't like supernatural things in romance anime-You want to get into romance anime-You disliked the other Key adaptations-You can't stand moe-You don't like when an anime switches to a different setting randomly-You don't like unfinished and unexplained stories.Story: 6You see, the story isn't honestly that bad for the most part, but when episode eight hits, it goes downhill. The next two episodes after that don't help either. It switches to a different setting, tells a different story, just to somehow tie it in afterwards and try to explain its convoluted plot with it. The only thing that this achieves, is providing even more questions and even fewer answers. Not only that, but it ruins the mood, the tempo and the entire story. This could have been easily avoided, by presenting that arc at the begginig, or in the second episode. I'm sure no one would have a problem with that. Instead, what we get is this random transition that failed to capture my interest at the very least. Other than those episodes however, I don't have anything againts the story. Hell, it even made me cry. The comedy was good, I got a few good laughs out of it. Overall, it's a decent story, but there are some really weird choices in storytelling, that can't be excused.Art and Animation: 7Well, it is moe. Girls with huge eyes, cute animals etc. Nothing really stands out, it does its job fairly well. Animation is pretty much the same, though there were a few visual gags that got me to smile here and there.Sound: 10As usual, Kyoto Animation does not disappoint when it comes to the OST. It is beautiful and touching, creates atmosphere, fits the scenes. Overall there's nothing bad I can say about it really. Bonus points for the tearjerker of an opening as well.Pro Tip: Put the opening on 1.25 speed so you can dance while you cry.Characters: 9The cast is easily likeable, like most of Key's characters. Of course if you don't like cute girls, that fall on their face at times, you might not like it, to each their own, but if you go into this anime, you should probably expect that already. Anyway, the characters, that at beggining seem stereotypical, actually take interesting turns for the better the more you get to know them and sometimes their development did take me by surprise. The main hero is also quite different compared to the other Key leads, because he is not a sarcastic bastard for the most part, so that was also a breath of fresh air (heh). Why not a ten then? Well, there was that whole thing with changing the cast all of a sudden and that sucked, that's why. Overall, a great, lovable cast, with some really good development at times.Enjoyment: 7So, this would probably be lower if not for the fact that my humanity took the upper hand again and decided to make a dry sponge out of me at the very end. While for the most part I just pushed forward, enjoying myself only from time to time, the ending really got to me. There were also the ocasional sparks of good humour and I did like the cast. The thing is, that I can't overlook all the bad stuff it did, because if not for some storytelling decisions, that didn't appeal to me personally, this would probably be much higher. Overall, I enjoyed it when I enjoyed it, but when I didn't, I was really mad at it.Overall: 7Air is pretty much a test run. For the time, when not a lot of really good romance anime were out, this probably was amazing, but after the new stuff  showcased how can you really tell a great story, without supernatural elements or all over the place pacing, you can't help but to look at it as just something worse. This show has it's moments, quite a few of them in fact, but it fails to mantain a steady flow and at times it feels like it just wanted to be too much. Not a bad anime, but if you are not a fan of the other Key adaptations, this will not get you into them, or change your mind about them most likely. However, there is a chance, that if you go into it with a correct mindset, with not the biggest expectation, you might just find it to be something more than it was for me. I really hope that that's what will happen.As always, this is only my opinion and I highly reccomend you to develop your own. You might dislike this anime if-You dislike romance anime-You don't like supernatural things in romance anime-You want to get into romance anime-You disliked the other Key adaptations-You can't stand moe-You don't like when an anime switches to a different setting randomly-You don't like unfinished and unexplained stories.Story: 6You see, the story isn't honestly that bad for the most part, but when episode eight hits, it goes downhill.

With the A/C not really working, I had to open the window and rely on the occasional breeze, but it didn’t help much. Outside of the window is the early summer scene of Beijing: trees blooming in the ocean of leaves and flowers, overheated people walking in the shadows of traditional Chinese architectures in hopes of avoiding the midday sun, and cars and buses crawling dizzily on the 2nd ring road, as if they were dehydrated too. The sky is...the same color as in the anime: unnaturally blue and sorrowful. On the hospital bed, I struggled to hold back my tears to avoid interrupting other patients’ sleep as I explored the world of “Air”.On my little anime tier list, “Air” belongs to the top. It is because of the strong impression and impact it has on me. It is easy for me to like an anime, but for an anime to be truly “memorable”, it takes something else. “Air” is one of the animes that I can’t forget. In fact, the impression is so strong that I was literally unable to focus my eyes on the food when I ate my lunch after watching the series, because all my attention was on the story in the anime. Right now, when I stop typing, all I think about are the scenes of “Air”: Haruko leaving the house to negotiate with Misuru’s biological parents, Misuru standing on the breakwater facing the afternoon sunshine, Michiru saying goodbye to Minagi, and such and such. I feel like the story is pullling me down and I can’t help myself. The last time something like this happened was when I finished “Cowboy Bebop”But “Air” brings something more than Cowboy Bebop does. It brings me the emotion like no other anime series does. Through the interconnected stories and art, “Air” makes me resonate with its characters. When Misuru feels joy, I smile. When she is in tears, I cry. For several times, I felt like I cannot hold back my tears any longer. No other anime has done something like this to me. “Air” did it since the 3rd episode.I also really like this anime from a personal perspective. Ever since the beginning of my life, I was taught by traditional values to be a “man”, a man who never cries, who does everything alone. Ever since middle school, I have insisted to myself that I was too mature to cry, too manly to cry. I did not cry when my girlfriend went with another guy. I did not cry when I failed my SAT exam. I did not cry when I was rejected by my dream university. But Air breaks my pride and stings me right on the soft spot in my heart. During the majority of the episodes, I forgot all my promises to be a “man” and cried like a child.“Air” makes me realize that I never will be and I never should be the man that I was taught to be, that the traditional standards of man is both idiotic and wrong. I realize that no matter how “manly” I am, it is fine for me to cry like a child from time to time, whether it is crying to my mom, like Misuru does to Haruko, or crying like when I was watching this Anime series. The day I stop crying, is the day I become a boring, ruthless, adult, “man”.So, until that day comes, I will try to discover more anime like this, taste more of this precious feeling of being touched, and cry more like a child. the same color as in the anime: unnaturally blue and sorrowful.

Ever since the beginning of my life, I was taught by traditional values to be a “man”, a man who never cries, who does everything alone. Ever since middle school, I have insisted to myself that I was too mature to cry, too manly to cry. I did not cry when my girlfriend went with another guy. I did not cry when I failed my SAT exam. I did not cry when I was rejected by my dream university. But Air breaks my pride and stings me right on the soft spot in my heart. During the majority of the episodes, I forgot all my promises to be a “man” and cried like a child.“Air” makes me realize that I never will be and I never should be the man that I was taught to be, that the traditional standards of man is both idiotic and wrong. I realize that no matter how “manly” I am, it is fine for me to cry like a child from time to time, whether it is crying to my mom, like Misuru does to Haruko, or crying like when I was watching this Anime series. The day I stop crying, is the day I become a boring, ruthless, adult, “man”.So, until that day comes, I will try to discover more anime like this, taste more of this precious feeling of being touched, and cry more like a child.', 'A forgotten summer breeze.As many people will tell you, AIR was the anime that built the Kyoto Animation as we know and love these days. Its part of the ""big 3"" KEY animes which were an absolute hit at the time: AIR, Kanon(2006) and Clannad; famous for their music and drama sequences. Made in production in the year 2000 with the anime coming in 2005, AIR manages to strike gold but at the same time losing its search to a greater success.Don\'t get me wrong, the anime does deserve a higher grade due to the music and the great story it has; 7.3 seems insulting...for an important anime like this. Tori no Uta was probably one of the most played songs back in 2005-2006 and the artstyle while goofy by today\'s standards, i think it portrayed the best version of moe ever. So why the low scores?It comes down to mostly one thing: 12 episode format. This format was unsual at the time; deemed very short which shows on its episodes content. Usually you will see half baked scenes that deserved much more attention...a lot of times the episode is at least 10 minutes of irrelevant talking such as same type of interactions between characters(daily conversation) and around 7 minutes of actual story. This proved to be harming for the series given that it made the story very confusing as it never has a 100% conclusion to what it has to say; either you pay attention or you need to google the answer. Not just the story but characters suffered aswell from the short episode format: ALL the characters exist because the story needs the feel of sadness for it to stay relevant; only Misuzu is the one you can at least sympathize.Though the anime isn\'t terrible, its good but its confusing. If you understand the story itself, you\'ll feel rewarded with well executed sad and emotional scenes but at the same time dissapointed on how forgettable the anime might be due to the characters.

As for Air, it felt like less than a prototype for Kanon, as it takes similar stories, but without the level of writing or structure of the other series.STORYYukito is a traveller looking for a ""winged girl in the sky."" He settles in a town where he meets several girls, and (of course) each girl has tragic backstories that we get to learn one after another.The setting was...quite interesting. Whereas Kanon and Clannad were rather realistic (despite the supernatural elements, the stories and their themes were deep and ground-to-earth), Air chooses to be a complete dream.The prominent theme is ""Sky"". Yeah, this is definitely not a deep theme, especially compared to Kanon (which theme is ""regrets"") or Clannad (which theme is ""Life"" as a whole). Where Kanon and Clannad can be Life lessons, there\'s nothing to learn from Air.But this is not what brings the series down to me. The worst is the huge lack of detail and explanation. The series is short (12 episodes) but still has plenty stories to tell. As a result, each story is wrapped up in 2 episodes, leaving no time to develop either the characters or the story. Everything felt rushed, which ultimately destroys any kind of impact the story could have.Long story short, the stories are nice, but way too fast to have a huge impact like Clannad or Kanon had.ARTIt\'s the same style as Kanon and Clannad, a bit less polished as it is a bit older, but it\'s not ugly. Only the animation was quite bad sometimes, but this is minor in this series.Overall nice, but not exceptional.SOUNDI love the opening. It is dreamy, catchy, and in the end, memorable. As for the OST, I like the main theme, but overall I found the music less memorable than that of Clannad or Kanon. That said, it does fit the scenes and never breaks it.Now, the seiyuus. Overall they\'re not bad... except Misuzu\'s mother. Most of the time she just annoyed me, and in the final episodes she utterly destroyed the drama. She was so off sometimes!CHARACTERI loved Misuzu, and I liked Michiru\'s story. Kanna was very fun to watch as well. As for the others, I didn\'t find them particularly attaching. But this is due to the very short time we get to know each of them. I\'m sure it would be better in the VN, where each story takes more time.As for the MC, I found him very unlikable.

But it is way too short for what it has to tell, so everything is rushed, which destroys all the impact the series could have.Air is very dreamy, so it may be the best to escape reality ; but on the other hand, it has nothing to teach, which brings it down compared to its ""sisters"".Overall I would say it is worth watching after Kanon and Clannad, but without expecting the same level. quite interesting.

And i can understand that people would love this kind of story. But there's just to much wrong here in this story. A girl that just allow's some hobo to live in her house. And the mother agree's with this. Then the story goes really slow. Nothing special happend's really. and then it suddenly turns into something weird. (I don't want to spoil stuff) But you get a view of an old ancient story. And that it affects the main story. That's uhm.. Interessting. But then the complete story replay's. It just felt so rushed. When the last episode hit's the credit's it just made me think whadufaq? Did i missed something. So i decided to watch the movie and yeah. Same thing but a little different. I am sorry.

Key's style is unique, but amazing with the scenery and what not, and they always pick the best music for their scenes.I think the characters were okay; only Misuzu was really developed. The other two heroines are a little flat and don't show multiple sides of themselves. The MC was similar...to Clannad and Kanon's: he's financially and socially weak, but he has a kind heart and wants to help all the heroines.I know most people review the story first, but I wanted to save it for the end. Will Air make you cry? Probably. The story is extremely emotional, and I'm a fan of sad animes (obviously I don't watch them too too often) so I liked it, but from a plot-based viewpoint, the story is a bit confusing. There are some contradictory details, and that combined the sudden ending makes for a very unsatisfied feeling after watching it. It's not like Clannad or Kanon where there's definite closure; the story just kind of stops which is unfortunate.Overall, I would say Air was not as strong as Kanon or Clannad, but still definitely worth a watch if you like fantasy (there's a ton of magic) and emotional stories. to Clannad and Kanon's: he's financially and socially weak, but he has a kind heart and wants to help all the heroines.I know most people review the story first, but I wanted to save it for the end.

Now like most ""Key"" productions, you have the tragic story build up, with the supernatural element near the end to conclude the Anime. One of the things ""Key"" really does bad when it comes to their shows, is when they enter the supernatural genre. They have a hard time explaining things to a point of where it does not make sense, not only that. But in this show\'s case, it really ruined the way they told the story of the main characters.That\'s where I\'d say the show...collapses, it\'s when it comes to pacing and explanation. Along with telling the story in a more settle understanding way. Now the cast is pretty ordinary, although they were able to give the supporting females a little arc to themselves even in only having 12 actual episodes.  Out of all the ""Key"" works, ""Air"" probably had the worst art and designs for their characters. Which is understandable seeings how it was made in the early 2000\'s.

This is the only anime so far that has really and truly made me cry. That alone is impressive, especially if you know me well.How exactly do I describe Air? Well, first off, it is not eroge, you don't have to worry about that. Yet in a way, this is one of the more adult animes that I have seen. Air is somewhat of an arthouse piece. It doesn't feel the need to explain its themes, the story is fuzzy at points, and I would be lying if I said that I succinctly knew just...what the hell everybody was talking about 100% of the time. But if you give this show a chance I promise that it will be worth it. I will not go into the plot, not only because the guidelines to the left of this word processor are sternly telling me not to, but also because the plot is meant to be seen through the show. Just take my word on this, it is offhandedly clever. The characters are also very endearing, from Yukito the wandering puppeteer to Potato the dog. The dub acting is really good as well. If you want to see the best performances that Vic Mignogna and Luci Christian have ever given, look no further than here. If you want a drama that can go from innocent fun to heart wrenching drama effortlessly, go here.

The music is very relaxing and beautiful, and depicts the emotions of the show extremely well. The art is equally as stunning. Everything is very vibrant, providing the show with that feeling of life it meant to give off.The story itself was breathtaking. It's so simple on the surface, yet still so meaningful. The gentle, dramatic themes of the series were very emotional and you're able to relate to the situation in question, even if it's not what you're facing or if it just isn't realistic, simply...because of the deeper meanings. Rarely have I been so moved by a series as I have by Air. I strongly recommend it to those who haven't seen it. because of the deeper meanings.

It lacks all of the generally present harems, ecchi, and a female cast that all happen to go off the deep end over the same exact guy. Instead, what we have here is a plot lacking mostly all originality. The back of the DVD box says it perfectly; ""An elusive girl in the sky...does she even want to be found?"" As much as I would also like to tell you I actually stole that from Gerard Way\'s nightstand, that...pretty much sums up our overdone fantasy plot. However a very, very important and often forgotten fact Air proves is that you needn\'t always seek pure originality. Sometimes, a well written script, well crafted cast and good, moody score can carry a series far above it\'s respective genre. I commend Air for being completely cliche, but doing so in a way that makes it a wonderful watch.Story; 9. As hard as it is to type, let alone tell another person, this visual novel based show has one of the best written plots and scripts I\'ve yet seen in anime. I was caught completely off guard once I was about three or four episodes into this series. The plot develops well, and a turning point that initially registered as a series ruining tragedy for me eventually became one of the best arcs of the series for me. Yes, I did say arcs; In thirteen episodes, Air spans three arcs, and does so successfully. The ending is emotional regardless of the viewer, and that is again thanks to a stellar script supported by a genuinely likable cast. The ending still pulled my heart strings. All three times I watched it. Very well done.Art; 8. Key\'s VN series may not appeal to everyone, however they are undoubtedly some of the most fluently animated series out there right now. However, Air is a bit older than it\'s brother series such as Clannad, and although still visually acceptable, has a select few visual flaws. You may notice...why am I even trying to sugarcoat this? You will, if you have eyes, notice the fish-like characters, a perfect example being Misuzu and her mother. The eyes are so much further apart than need be; also, the colors are almost completely consistent, however here and there they seem to dim out. This I attribute to the series age, however, it\'s still part of the score. On a positive note, Air\'s character designs were top notch. Of the many school uniforms I\'ve seen over the years thanks to anime, these are some of the better, less perverse ones (much more realistic). The series landscapes, in an inexplicable way, grow on you. They managed to capture a feel that lingers between reality and a video game. It was very unique, which I greatly enjoyed. The town definitely emitted a strange wonder, which worked perfectly for the series.Sound; 9. As expected from drama, piano and string themes are found thought the show. However, as is not usually the case with these types of series (I am looking at you, romcom harems...) the BGM did not make me wish I had been born deaf. It was not too special, but the fact that it didn\'t harm the series was a great help to my enjoyment of it. Also, the opening was fitting. Not my cup of tea, but not glossy pop like I usually get to hear out of anime OPs.Character; 9. Another cool milestone Air has created was that our main protagonist is not a tool, not a womanizing douche, and really...not much of anything. He is properly fleshed out, but enough detail is left out that it almost allows him the ambiguity of becoming anyone; namely, you can really easily slip yourself into his shoes. I can\'t with words explain how they did it, but Air is really an adventure you can often forget you are not actually part of. The style which the main male was portrayed in was really unique, and worked wonders for the show. As far as the direct/supporting cast, Misuzu, Kanna, and her mother are all incredible characters. They were developed beyond what you would ever expect from such a series, and the end involves characters you would never have predicted at the series beginning. The summer arc, Kanna\'s, fit into the series like a puzzle piece. I was initially skeptical, however this arc was well thought out and played greatly into one of the shows greatest moments, the ending. Really, the character depth combined with the critically important storyline made this series one you can\'t miss.Enjoyment/Overall; 9. You may have missed it before, but I have watched Air three times. It is still just as gripping and enjoyable as it was the first time, and with it\'s re-issue in a very nice thinpak, it is the best 40$ you could ever spend on anime. Air is by no means my favorite anime, and is also far from the most original story you have seen; however, the sheer effort that went into making it as good as possible and greatly exceeding the expectations set for it\'s genre make it the Shakugan No Shana of VN Romcom/Harem series.

It is beautifully sad work of art that has imprinted itself in my mind. There were things i liked, and things i didnt, of course, like any other anime.I didn't like how the side characters didn't tie in with the main plot, which involves Misuzu. I also saw no point in the fact that the guy turned into a crow, because it didn't affect Misuzu's fate much. For the side character's plot, I felt that they could've gone into a little more detail, especially with the girl with the ribbon on...her wrist ( I forget her name) and how she got possessed.This anime made me cry so much, my tissue box was gone within 5 episodes. I enjoyed how it dipped into the paranormal to create a surreal feeling that mixed in well. Happy moments made me cry, sad moments made me cry. The story was tragic, but even so there was a sense of possible hope too. It showed emotions raw and unflinchingly clear and the fact that there isn't always a happy ending.The art and music was outstanding. The art was beautifully detailed and was eye candy.

And that\'s exactly what it is.The story follows a girl named Misuzu who decides her summer vacation is going to be special. She\'s going to make friends, and it\'s going to be awesome! It doesn\'t sound very interesting...but there\'s a whole lot more to Misuzu\'s goal. We learn about her classmates, a traveller named Yukito, Misuzu\'s auntie Haruko, and a tragic story of the past. It\'s all very unique and heart wrenching...I cried all the time when watching AIR, and if you using up boxes of tissues, you will love AIR\'s story.Like Clannad and Kanon 2006,...AIR\'s art and animation is gorgeous. The character designs are nice, the colours are vivid and pleasing to the eye, and everything is so nicely drawn. There\'s a lot of skies and wind blowing...and it\'s all beautiful. The only problem I had is the supersuper shininess of the eyes and hair, and sometimes the eyes were a bit strange...but it\'s not a big deal since this shows up in a lot of other anime.Both the music and voice acting of AIR are phenomenal. AIR is really emotional...and the sound delivers all the emotion perfectly. Listening to the last few moments of AIR can make me cry, even if I\'m not watching the video and I don\'t even understand Japanese.I really, really like the characters in AIR. Misuzu is so sweet and innocent, I love her so much that I feel my stomach drop a little thinking when I think of what she\'s been through. Haruko and Yukito are so lovable, I want the three of them to be together forever. The side characters though...they\'re just ""okay"" for me. They\'re actually a bit boring...they had good stories, but they were just the ""calm Ojou"" and ""genki girl"" type. I liked them, but I didn\'t love them.I gave a 10 for enjoyment, even though I hated this anime for making me cry so much. But I loved that it made me hate it. Personally, I love tragic stories. I spent hours glued to my screen with tears in my eyes and tissues on hand, but I couldn\'t stop watching. I started to care for Misuzu and Haruko\'s happiness that you would\'ve though they were real. AIR is a fantastic anime, and you should really watch it. There\'s a reason why when you ask for a sad anime, pretty much everyone says ""AIR."" AIR\'s art and animation is gorgeous.

The only problem I had is the supersuper shininess of the eyes and hair, and sometimes the eyes were a bit strange...but it\'s not a big deal since this shows up in a lot of other anime.Both the music and voice acting of AIR are phenomenal. AIR is really emotional...and the sound delivers all the emotion perfectly. Listening to the last few moments of AIR can make me cry, even if I\'m not watching the video and I don\'t even understand Japanese.I really, really like the characters in AIR. Misuzu is so sweet and innocent, I love her so much that I feel my stomach drop a little thinking when I think of what she\'s been through. Haruko and Yukito are so lovable, I want the three of them to be together forever. The side characters though...they\'re just ""okay"" for me. They\'re actually a bit boring...they had good stories, but they were just the ""calm Ojou"" and ""genki girl"" type. I liked them, but I didn\'t love them.I gave a 10 for enjoyment, even though I hated this anime for making me cry so much. But I loved that it made me hate it. Personally, I love tragic stories. I spent hours glued to my screen with tears in my eyes and tissues on hand, but I couldn\'t stop watching. I started to care for Misuzu and Haruko\'s happiness that you would\'ve though they were real. AIR is a fantastic anime, and you should really watch it. There\'s a reason why when you ask for a sad anime, pretty much everyone says ""AIR.""', ""Misuzo is an annoyingly happy and hospitable girl, doing her best to get Yukito to stay at her house and be her friend, including using cunning tricks against her aunt, Haruko. She's like a robot, using Gao every time she's about to cry or troubled, tripping easily, asking a whole bunch of questions, and acting silly which somehow gets people to care about her? What? I mean why would the aunt at first disbelieve Yukito's reasons to stay and then believe him?Too many tsunderes in the show makes it not that good even if there's fun to be had elsewhere. The amateruish writing makes Air...a show that we've felt like we've seen before. Yukito is tsundere, sometimes acting cold and other times, acting likeable, making him quite inconsistent.Misuzu is a butt, at first I thought I would like her but she just turned out more foolish than I expected! She lies, whines and makes a big deal out of small things she could've fixed, constantly stops the world for Yukito just to play with him, unrealistically optimistic and seemed too nice. She also keeps too many secrets! Come on, Misuzu could’ve been well-executed, too! Being the innocent, childlike girl sounds cool but she needs to grow up!Characters such as Minagi seem like they serve little purpose but could’ve been well-executed. I mean, none of the characters are that good, the best is probably Yukito because he can be funny getting annoyed with that annoying Misuzu! The auntie is the cliché of the neglectful caretaker acting like an idiot but then turns caring too fast. Michiru is too loud and obnoxious. And what's the point in Kana?The show descends into melodrama, which is a bit too much for me, I guess not well-directed. I feel that the series should’ve shown some of that overly forgetful Misuzu at school! I mean, she takes care of animals? How so?As for the animation, well, it’s beautiful. The series is beautifully produced but Misuzu’s eyes when she was crying in the card scene made her look like she was going to fall out! Though, the character design looked dated.Misuzu's voices the only one annoying? Well, yeah, they're supposed to be. Maybe it's the directors' fault. Michiru's is well... annoying in the dub.

Air is just one of their many classics.I admit, I have only recently watched Air after seeing the works of Kanon and Clannad (which are both absolutely fantastic btw). Air will make you think; not only about the plot or characters, but about your own life as well. So many themes in this anime are applicable to modern society.Air provides insight deeper than a typical anime. After watching, I can almost guarantee a change in perspective upon certain things. The anime is addressed in about 3 arcs, but there are overlapping sections as well...as revisited ones. Each character explores a different side of human nature, and though it may seem innocent to start, the darker side starts reveal itself as the story progresses.There are a few parts in which you may grit your teeth. Not in a bad way necessarily, but with so many conflicting feelings and ideas of story, it makes you decide in what you believe in/wish to happen.Hopefully I haven't given away too much, but for any fans of Clannad or Kanon, then Air is definitely right for you. It shares similar traits from other Key works, and can be understood easily on the emotional and conceptual level. as revisited ones.

Make that 12, by the way. Episode 13 is just a quick fast-forward recap of the whole series. Episode 12 is really the last one.A very interesting setting with great characters, good graphics and told in a wonderful way.I loved the mood throughout the series. It reminded me of Haibane Renmei or the old PC game Sanitarium; A light and innocent approach, but with an undertone of hopelessness and doom. I don\'t know how they did it, but it...truly was great.AnimationI didn\'t actually like the character design; all the girls are too doll-like with oversized eyes and huge chins. Ok, big eyes is normal in anime, but this was extreme. I think the design made the characters look unpersonal.The thing is, that doesn\'t matter. You will love all the characters anyway. An impressive feat by the creators.Technically, AIR looks great, especially ""natural"" effects like clouds, sunbeams, stars and the like. Just a little minus for the somewhat dull character design.SoundMusic was ok at first, but now when I have had it for a couple of days in my MP3 player, it really has stuck. Especially the ending theme, which I now consider one of the best anime themes ever. The music overall has an elevating feel to it that really fit the story.Voice acting was awsome. It really made the characters come alive, and every emotion is enhanced greatly by the voice talents.StoryYou will not understand all of what is going on, but it is an ambitious and well told story. Lots of loose ends, though.AIR is very well directed and paced. There are no fillers at all (except for the whole episode 13, which you can ignore) and every second is captivating. I found it impossible not to watch the whole series in a streak.I\'m just a bit sad that they didn\'t use episode 13 to explain some of the loose ends instead of recapping the whole series.That said, I am fully satisfied with this story. So much, in fact, that I don\'t think I\'ll watch neither the movie nor the Summer special. I think AIR TV told the story the way it was supposed to be, and no extras feels necessary.CharacterWhile not looking that great, every single character is likable. In hindsight, though, I don\'t really get what part some of them played in the story. This means some of them could be cut out to make the series even shorter and more effective. But I\'d not like that.

At first, i watch this anime because i have watched clannad and yeah that anime was awesome and nominated as the best anime ever. Because i know that AIR and Kanon are from Key's as well, i decided to take a look at this anime. As expected from KyoAni and Key's, this anime was awesome too, although clannad is superior because it has more simple story and more length. Well, to the reviews.Story (8/10)The story of Yukito as MC that had told by his mother to find the girl...in the sky and help her. The story is beautifully made by Key's although when adapted to anime, its confusing so that you must see this anime twice to understand the story. But relax, the enjoyment is still there although the story is too fast and confusing. And im sure the story of AIR is as good as Clannad except that the story packed with 13 episode so sometimes it feel rushed. And yeah KyoAni know how to make a good drama anime : by removing fanservice and ecchi things from it. AIR is hentai game/VN from Key's, but not when adapted to anime. A very huge assets for this awesome anime.Art (7/10)Well this is 2005 anime so the art aren't so beautiful but its good. And as expected from KyoAni, the animation is so smooth and the ocean are beautiful. The art is good so that you will enjoy every scene of this anime.Sound (8/10)The sound is good. Tori no Uta as this anime OP song are good. When i have watched this anime, and then again i hear this song i can feel the sadness from this anime and almost cried. Amazing. And there is a beautiful song that can bring the atmosphere of sad scene and can make you cry, seriously. So i think the sound is a proud thing for this anime.Character (9/10)Very Good ! This is why i like AIR beside from sound and the story. We can feel the character development among the main character. There's a character that have been annoying to me since i first watch this anime. But in the end that person have a HUGE character development and have a HUGE role too. That character development alone can make me cry. Especially in that scene where The Main Female and this person share their beautiful feeling in the ocean. Overall, the characters in this anime is decent.Enjoyment (8/10)Well, because the story is confusing and a bit rushed, i feel a little enjoyment when watching episode 1 to 10. But start from episode 11, i feel a lot of enjoyment (or should i say *cough*sadness*cough*?).Overall (8/10)As expected from KyoAni Trio (Clannad, Kanon, AIR). This anime doesn't fail to make me amazed. The scene, Beautiful Ocean, Good Story, Good Music and Good Drama. I think when i have watched clannad, i won't find other anime that can make me cry like i watched clannad. But i was wrong, i cry a lot too when i watch this anime. Not to give you a spoiler but, this anime a bit different in Ending than Clannad and Kanon. You will see when you have watched it :) in the sky and help her.

I also love that they adapt most of Key\'s visual novels, and this show, Kanon, and Clannad are some of the most entertaining and moving shows I\'ve seen. Air is the earliest KyoAni Key adaptation, however, so it was interesting to see how they started, since I had watched both Clannad and the 2006 version of Kanon before seeing this show.The story is mysterious and has a sort of wistful feel to it. It\'s not entirely explained, and there is a touch of the supernatural involved with each character...arc, and the setting of a seaside town was very relaxing most times. It also has a sad ending, and it was fairly moving, but it didn\'t manage to make me cry.The art still looks good despite being 10 years old, and I have a thing for the art style of Key novels, and KyoAni reproduces the style very accurately. Some people may be turned off by the female characters\' abnormally large eyes, though.The OP is a beautiful but anguished sounding song, and the ED was good but not as memorable. The BGMs are all well crafted and fit the mood, and I like the synthetic sound a lot of them have. The English dub was well done, and Luci Christian\'s performance as well as Vic Mignogna\'s were outstanding. I am planning on rewatching this show in the Japanese dub so I have no comment on its quality yet.The characters were a mixed bag, but I found Haruko to be the most enjoyable one out of all of them. Her story of being Misuzu\'s ""mother"" was very heart-wrenching to watch and she felt like a very down-to-earth person trying to live their life the right way. Misuzu is a clutzy, but lovable girl who has some tragic fate and mostly ends up being someone to feel sad for, which then also makes one feel sad for her mother, Haruko. Yukito, the protagonist, was an interesting character, and though we don\'t find out much about him, I like that most of who he is is kept shrouded in mystery. He has a simple backstory and he\'s a man on a mission to find out about some lady in the sky that his mom talked about. And he does puppet shows. But he ends up getting fairly downplayed near the end of the show. Any romance (as it is one of the genres tagged for this show) is not really developed, and I can really only say there were some vague ""feelings of affections"" between Yukito and Misuzu flying through the air at most. Also, there is a pair of characters that appear in flashbacks from ancient Japan that are somehow related to the characters in the modern day story, and their interactions are fairly enjoyable. They make a cute couple in my opinion, but their story also ends tragically if I remember correctly.I would say enjoyed this show, but not as much as either Kanon or Clannad, which both have more or less the same premise, albeit reimagined. Befriend a bunch of strange girls, help them with their unusual circumstances, move on until the main climax arc with main waifu. I only watched Air because I figured I owed it to myself as a KyoAni fan to go back and see some of their earlier stuff (I\'m a little scared of going any earlier than this though). Overall it was a short, sad story that stuck with me for a little while in the way that stories that feel like, though they ended, you wish you could have done something to help the people that went through what they did.Overall, this is an entertaining show to watch if you want something slow and intriguing with a tragic end that is close to being amazing, but falls short due to some strange production decisions near the last few episodes. arc, and the setting of a seaside town was very relaxing most times.

I thought the story was both creative and unique considering I have yet to find an anime with a similar plot. The story began light hearted and mysterious, which willed me to complete the anime, I found myself smiling throughout and wanting to see more. Although the story is as I said above, the ending wasn\'t very rewarding for me, I\'d say more but I\'d like to prevent giving spoilers. Granted the story is fairly confusing and I did find myself sometimes re watching small segments...to get the jist of what was going on. As expected from Key Visual Arts, the creators of the visual novel ""Air"", they have made a beautiful tale which builds you up only to knock you back down with pure emotion!ART:The art in this anime is your typical Key Visual Arts animation with the insanely large eyes and immense attention to detail; it may take a while for some to get used to this style of art but you will soon find yourself loving it. The art overall is consistently beautiful and detailed.SOUND:The sound isn\'t much to be desired, being a short anime of 13 episodes it doesn\'t have an array of opening or endings, however the 1 opening and ending it does have were fairly good and catchy. The background music during the animation wasn\'t poor but not exactly the best I\'ve ever heard either.CHARACTERS:There weren\'t many characters but the ones I saw were pretty good, each was shown an in depth back ground story which made you love even the characters you didn\'t like to begin with.ENJOYMENT:As an avid Key Visual Arts anime lover, I really enjoyed this one too. There wasn\'t a moment I got bored and I ended up watching the anime all in one day. It interested me and willed me to keep watching.OVERALL:Overall I believe Air is a wonderful fantasy tale that is heart warming, emotional, and creative, making me feel so much in just 13 episodes!

How far can a daughter reciprocate that love? Air is a good take on how powerful a mother-daughter relationship can be.The most powerful theme presented by Air, without a doubt, is the bond between a mother and a daughter. We are then presented by “mini-arcs” involving the girls, Kano, Minagi, Kanna and also Misuzu.While the stories are undeniably touching (mostly thanks to the brilliant soundtrack behind the scenes), their impact cut short by how quick the pacing can sometimes be. In only 12 episodes (episode 13 is merely a recap and...a commercial for Air in Summer, damn it), much to my chagrin, we aren\'t given much exposure to the each of the girls.As such, characterization suffers, most notably to Kano and Minagi, whose arcs actually provide very little significance to the overarching plot. In a way, I believe that this happens because Air is based on a visual novel, by seeing their arcs to the very end, we get to see a feather float up into the air and dissolve into the air in the form of shiny particles. With my little experience with Key\'s visual novels (most notably Clannad), this is a way to determine your “completion rate"" and how close you are to the real and final ending of the game.Another thing is that Air is a dating-sim game, and an eroge, to boot. In the game, you can choose one of the 3 main girls - Kano, Minagi and Misuzu to target and make her your lover. Ultimately the real and final ending is actually, Misuzu. So she takes up most of the screen time and we will spend more episodes reaching the conclusion of her arc, which puts a dampener onto the other two girls’ arcs, a sad thing if you like them more.Supernatural elements are heavily featured here, and to a point I felt that it did not bode well with the how the show is trying to blend that into a slice-of-life show. All the dramatic incidents are all supernatural and in some way, it makes difficult to connect with the characters as whatever happens to them, won\'t really happen in real life. It may work better should the supernatural side be heavier, but unfortunately, the slice-of-life vibes are way too overpowering that I felt like these two themes are like oil and water.Another thing is, viewers expecting a romance show should turn away, for the end product of Air yielded zero romance, which is weird for a dating-sim visual novel that features eroge. The most powerful theme that viewers should look forward for, is mother-daughter. I\'d say this might make a decent viewing with your mom during mother\'s day (lol).Presentation wise, as expected from the soundtrack by Jun Maeda, dude knows how to create tear jerking moments using powerful music, not to mention the songs can get very memorable and inflict sufficient tear jerking damage simply by listening to it. “Tori no Uta” is a very popular and revered song among the anime community, and it is not difficult to see why, for it is indeed one of the best openings I\'ve ever heard.Though, I am still begrudged by the fact that, the vocal version of ""Natukage"" is nowhere to be found in the entire show.Sadly, the animation could have been better. During the age of Kanon, Air and Clannad, the animation design from Key can be quite horrific - unusually large eyes on the heroines that are too far apart, and terribly small nose and mouth. The resulting face can be quite revolting, but at least Kyoto Animation did a very good job to tone that down as much as they can so it\'s not too cringeworthy.  However, aside from the grotesque faces, other things can pretty well made.My final problem with Air, is the poor ending that leaves me very, very dissatisfied. I was hoping that episode 13 can be an alternative ending or something but sadly, episode 12 is the real and final episode. Still, it is a decent show if you want something that reminds you how great moms can be.Final result: 6/10 fair. a commercial for Air in Summer, damn it), much to my chagrin, we aren\'t given much exposure to the each of the girls.As such, characterization suffers, most notably to Kano and Minagi, whose arcs actually provide very little significance to the overarching plot.

I\'d say this might make a decent viewing with your mom during mother\'s day (lol).Presentation wise, as expected from the soundtrack by Jun Maeda, dude knows how to create tear jerking moments using powerful music, not to mention the songs can get very memorable and inflict sufficient tear jerking damage simply by listening to it. “Tori no Uta” is a very popular and revered song among the anime community, and it is not difficult to see why, for it is indeed one of the best openings I\'ve ever heard.Though, I am still begrudged by the fact that, the vocal version of ""Natukage"" is nowhere to be found in the entire show.Sadly, the animation could have been better. During the age of Kanon, Air and Clannad, the animation design from Key can be quite horrific - unusually large eyes on the heroines that are too far apart, and terribly small nose and mouth. The resulting face can be quite revolting, but at least Kyoto Animation did a very good job to tone that down as much as they can so it\'s not too cringeworthy.  However, aside from the grotesque faces, other things can pretty well made.My final problem with Air, is the poor ending that leaves me very, very dissatisfied. I was hoping that episode 13 can be an alternative ending or something but sadly, episode 12 is the real and final episode. Still, it is a decent show if you want something that reminds you how great moms can be.Final result: 6/10 fair.', ""Light spoilers ahead, though not too many to ruin the story of the anime until later on. Also, this review will be one of the most vague ones I have written in a long time, due in part to me being extremely confused when watching Air and the information feeling a bit scattered until I read up on it after finishing it. So, please bear with me.Air is an anime that will not fail to deliver an amazing story. However, I feel that some aspects of the story were a bit rushed and that the anime randomly jumped from one point to the next at...times.I will say this much, to start off. The beginning arcs were very well done with Yukito meeting the other girls, reminding me heavily of Clannad in this regard (and going so far as to have three girls look exactly like the main ones from Kanon in every way, shape and form) and I have not watched that one in quite some time now.Anyway, most of the anime consists of the usual generic comedy tidbits that is known of Kyoto Animation before really digging into the deep stuff shortly after. This includes the protagonist, Yukito, having humorous interactions with a majority of the female cast, before mostly spending his time with Misuzu at the beginning for a little while.This will be familiar to fans of Kyoto Animation already, but Yukito has at least one happy time, deep bonding moment and sad departure with each of the main female leads. It is the basic formula that is to be expected of this company and it is still just as enjoyable here as it was with their other critically acclaimed works.Major spoilers ahead.But, things get a little hazy when I hit little over the halfway point and we were abruptly thrown into the Kanna arc, which I thought was a departure from what the company usually does. In this arc, Ryūya, one of the guards of the shrine, becomes the protector of Kanna, a winged person whom was given various duties worthy of her position. She wished to reach out to her long lost mother, whom she believed to be deceased. Knowing this, Ryūya and Kanna's caretaker, Uraha, set their goals to help Kanna achieve her wish and prevent her from traveling to another territory.Later, after what feels like some filler stuff with generic, cheesy story formula following suit with basic comedy scenes, Ryūya and Uraha picking on Kanna and so on, we finally reach the location of Kanna's mother. From here, they rescue her and she is immediately killed by the guards, followed by a release of her powers that frightens the guards and they see the winged persons as enemies.Kanna, not wanting her friends to suffer, decides to fly into the sky so that they can escape. However, a curse is placed upon her, preventing her from attaining eternal peace and she is instead reincarnated over and over.Eventually, Ryūya learns from Uraha that he has succumb to an incurable disease that will slowly take away his life until he withers away into nothing. Knowing this, Ryūya wishes to create an offspring that can help the reincarnated Kanna find eternal happiness. As such, he and Uraha wed and have a child, whom carries this tradition forward until we reach Yukita in the modern time of the anime, whom is trying to aid Misuzu.Though never explained too well in the actual anime, Misuzu is the reincarnated form of Kanna in the present time and, due to having the soul of a winged person inside of her. She slowly dies due to her vulnerable body being unable to attain its power and we find this out near the end of the anime. Or, rather, near the middle before we are abruptly thrown into that Kanna arc for little under a quarter of the anime length.The anime has much more to it, but I would rather not spill too much of that here and simply say that you should give it a chance if you are into intricate plot patterns, as this anime will throw a lot of those at you; one of which, I just elaborated upon quite heavily here.Overall, I simply addressed a bit of the story of Air without trying to spoil too much of it, then warned of a major spoiler that I proceeded to tell and how it links to the main story. Also, I love its soundtrack a lot and some of the piano songs are beautiful to listen to.I will be completely honest here. The main reason why I did such a bland job with this review is due to how confused I was with the story of Air. I intended for this review to be deep, mainly because two Kyoto Animation works are some of my favorite drama anime and I love them a lot, but Air had a story that was a bit different and harder to follow for me until I researched it after finishing up the anime.Admittedly, I did cry during the arc with Misuzu and Haruko and I understood everything when Haruko went on about what she was really doing. It was amazing and I never thought I would cry tears of happiness well watching an anime when this arc came around. I recommend this to any fans of Kyoto Animation, especially Clannad or Kanon fans. It has a similar atmosphere and soundtrack ideas of the other two, in that the originality of them and fit are almost too perfect. times.I will say this much, to start off.

Let’s go through my praises and then my criticisms. My biggest praise is the sound design for Air. The moments where I felt most investsted were those that had a soundtrack playing. The Ending was easily skippable but that’s besides the point. My second praise is the characters and their personalities. I really enjoyed the moments with the supporting cast and found that was where I enjoyed most. This brings...me to my biggest critism. The story. As each supporting cast’s problem was solved, they just disappeared from the anime entirely. I get they moved on and them leaving was explained, but after the supporting cast was gone, I was left with Ms. Blondie and Mr. Protagonist. (I apologize but I’m really never good with names) Mr. Protagonist was fine as I enjoyed his presence in Air and Ms. Blondie is just kinda annoying at this point. (This point being Ep 12) Once Mr Protagonist was gone I had to slug my way to the end, finishing a full ‘nother anime before moving onto episode 8, and then I finally finished it all tonight. Being blunt here, once the supporting cast was gone, the show lost any and all emotion I had with it. I had feelings for the cast of characters who ended up leaving, only to come back for a recap episode in Ep 10. In episode 11 I got invested twice for a reason I could not explain until the end of Episode 12 and that is, “I got invested, because there was another person there”. Just having 2 people in an entire episode can become boring, especially when one of them was greatly glossed over for the majority of the season. Here’s what I’m trying to say: say you buy a game, and once you pop it in you are immediately thrusted into the action, and throughout the entire game you have nothing about the world or characters explained to you. Sure the game might be fun, but it would feel incomplete. That’s what the latter half of the show felt to me. In the end, 5/10.

Holy crap, this show had me in tears from start to finish. It started out as this light hearted comedy, which you think nothing of it, THEN, THEN, it just takes this drastic, dark, sad turn. By the 6th episode, your eyes are puffy and nose running. The animation was beautiful, the storyline, the historic factors and the secrets of the town and the people. I had to take plenty of breathers from this show because it became too overbearlingly sad at times. I had so many mixed...emotions by the end. That final episode is the one that gets you.

Watch at your own risk if you're prepared for a good cry."", 'A wandering puppet performer meets a mysterious girl who dreams about flying into the past. A low class samurai meets a flying winged-beast. In Air, these two stories are merged into one very complete and compelling package. This is a remarkable masterpiece in terms of art, sound, as well as thematic development. This was one of the first animes I\'ve watched and the one that pretty much convinced me to start watching other shows.Animation:Superb. The detail and backgrounds are crisp and create a very unique mood combined with the OST. The overall look of the rural ocean town makes me want to live there. If...you\'re looking for a calm scene to relax with after a long stressful day of classes/work, look no further than the blue ray release of this show. Though a bit dated by 2015 standards, it still is a very relaxing setting.Yes, the characters have very wide faces and are unrealistically thin, but the lighting, vivid colors, and attention to detail in the animation more than make up for this.Sound:The sound track is very open with lots of pads and reverb in the mix, creating a very ""air""-like open feel. It goes perfectly with the calming scenery and the innocent personality of Misuzu. I really like the opening song and an insert song is played perfectly at the climax of the show. The voice acting includes many veteran VAs and they do a terrific job at bringing out the characters. Daisuke Ono ftw.Story:At first, this series seems to go really slowly. There are a lot of moments that seem slice-of-life, with the characters reflecting while the camera pans around some beautiful scenery. It takes time to build but, if one uses the time to reflect on the themes and what is actually happening, it is worth it. There isn\'t much humor or flirting in this series.There are essentially two interconnected stories in this anime, that of the modern relationship between puppet-player Yukito and a mysterious girl named Misuzu and their ancestor/pre-incarnations one thousand years ago. This is told in three arcs with the second one being of the pre-incarnations. This plot sequence is masterfully done as the watcher slowly makes sense of what occurred in the first arc and comes to realize what will happen at the end. Be prepared for some very emotional moments.The conclusion is one to remember. It leaves certain questions unanswered and begs the watcher for a second watch. I ended up spending a good two hours after finishing this just thinking about the ending and its implications. Well worth it.Character:The characters in the modern portion of the series are very likable. The development of Yukito is very well done. He is looking for a ""girl in the sky"" and the ocean town has three girls whom all seem to have something to do with that girl. What will happen as he grows attached to them? I also really liked Misuzu as her innocence and clumsiness combine with her ""gao"" phrase to create a very lovable character.Value:This is a very mysterious yet calming series that is definitely among my favorite animes. It makes one think about reality and what it means to be alive. I\'ve watched this multiple times and still pick up new subtleties and themes. Overall, double thumbs up for Air TV.Enjoyment:This is both a laid-back show and a thinker\'s show. You can sit back and enjoy the perfect harmony between the atmosphere and the BGM, or you can ponder the themes that underlay the show.

""Pico? Pico pico pico."" ""KAWWWWWWW!""At first, nothing seem to make sense, everyone was so obsessed with the sky for some reason and well, actually nothing would still make sense throughout the anime but don\'t let the plot discourage you from watching, its mess of a clusterduck of a plot doesn\'t get in the way of how sad this anime is and it gets real sad, ohoho, I should really warn you how heartbreaking Air really is through and through but if you\'re here to know a summary of the story, I\'ll also warn you that the section ahead will contain MAJOR...SPOILERS, so just skip a paragraph if you intend to experience the show to the fullest.Right, so the plot is there\'s this deadbeat guy named Yukito who fell asleep on a wall in front of a beach, he earns his living by making puppet shows even though he sucks at it, then he kinda got hungry and almost beat a child senselessly for a bowl of ramen then woke up screaming to another child but this time this child suddenly wanted to make friends with Yukito, she bought Yukito some weird juicebox that you cant drink out of unless you squeeze the box and then she introduces herself as Misuzu, a child according to Yukito, ""A girl with severe brain damage"" Yukito, having no place to go to, gets invited to Misuzu\'s house and ate dinner there then came home her \'mom\' Haruko, a drunk alcoholic who tries to sexually harass yukito countless times and a horrible mother to Misuzu because she didn\'t buy her baby dinosaurs as a child, we\'ll get onto that later. So yeah this is kinda the introduction so imma skim pass some of these plots. So they let Yukito stay at their place cuz he a travelling performer and all but only if he sleeps in the shed and he did. Then one time Yukito met this girl named Kano and her dog named Potato who just barks out Pico pico like a damn pokemon, so apparently Kano has a ribbon on her right wrist cuz she said she needs it tied until she grows up so that she can use her magic as a level 20 sage or something but the catch is that her sister Hijiri was keeping a huge secret from her this whole time and that Kano is schizophrenic and tries to cut her own wrist to sacrifice herself to the gods because she is the descendant of a cursed birdwoman, in the end of her arc, she released her ribbon seal and Yukito somehow found a magical feather at the shrine and just magically knew to put the power of friendship into it to save Kano. Then one time Yukito met a pair of young ladies named Michiru and Minagi, Michiru likes to kick Yukito\'s ass and Minagi just kinda there to see it unfold and gives Yukito coupons for rice discounts, ok for their part Michiru was just actually a manifestation of Minagi\'s dream and she is not real and everyone is just hallucinating from the sand Minagi was keeping, probably. So actually, Minagi\'s mom had a traumatic incident where she lost her child due to an abortion and just lived her life thinking Minagi is actually that dead child so she sometimes has Alzheimers but in the end Yukito being the bastard he is, tricked Minagi into going to her own house and tell her mom the truth and yeah that actually worked out even tho it was like 10 years of her being in fantasy coocooland so Minagi thought it would be a good idea to have Michiru meet her mom and then she cried when eating her special favorite homemade hamburgs and then she said she had to leave because it was time, now this will make sense as to why after this part because one day, Minagi received a letter of invitation from her dad stating he was married with another woman and already had a child who is a few years old by now and so Minagi went to check it out and surprise, it\'s Michiru in child form. Ok so now, having no depressed girls to talk to anymore, Yukito came back to Misuzu to check on how she doing, so one night she suddenly cried when trying to play uno with Yukito, and her \'mom\' was actually in front of the door and she knew the reason why, cuz everytime Misuzu gets close to someone, she suddenly starts crying so she couldn\'t have any bonds with other people without hurting herself, so day and night Yukito was taking care of Misuzu until one night he was like, ""Yo, I need to get out of here cuz both of us will die if we get too close"" and that was like after Yukito got slashed so hard in his previous life as his ancestor that he felt it a thousand years later. Then Yukito kinda learned some new tricks with his puppeteering skillz and went back to cheer up Misuzu and f**king dies and now we\'re suddenly in 994 A.D, you can\'t make this sh*t up. So apparently Yukito\'s ancestor was a security guard samurai to a shrine priestess or something named Kanna and her maid or something, I didn\'t pay attention named Uraha. So they were playing house for a bit until Uraha explained Kanna had to transfer to lots of shrines because she is constantly being hunted by the anti-birdmen federation, I dunno, I didn\'t pay attention, so the 3 of them who bonded couldn\'t bear to see each other go so they travelled across the country to find Kanna\'s mother, they found her sealed in a prison cell and then the mother explained that none of them must ever touch her body because her body has been defiled ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but then they get ambushed and then the mother airbended her way through the forest till she got shot by 2 arrows and f**king dies but Yukito\'s ancestor, Ryuya or something, didn\'t listen and touched her cuz he was getting rid of the arrows and Kanna touching her cuz well, her mother just died, so Kanna revealed her wings, and her naked body and decided to leave the group because she was holding them down but then got shot by a lot of arrows and yeah that body defiled thing, that actually triggered a curse where both Ryuya and Kanna will forever suffer a painful death for generations and that means their literal incarnations will suffer the same fate. So yeah Ryuya and Uraha went into hiding and they just suddenly had the power to enter the consciousness of Kanna who is now trapped in a limbo somewhere and they can somehow see her dreams, then Uraha out of nowhere says, ""Hey we need to make babies so that one of our descendants may help Kanna one day"" and then they had wild s*x that spanned over countless generations until present day where Ryuya\'s descendant, Yukito is now reincarnated as a Crow and rewinded back in time where he was sleeping on the wall but now there are 2 Yukitos in the same timeline, where one of them is a crow now. Living his replay from then on until the point before his death, his soul was freed and Misuzu met with past Yukito, not Ryuya, thats way too past, I mean the timeline before this timeline but after Ryuya\'s timeline, and he explained that he will always be there with Misuzu but as a crow named Sky now. So yeah, now that Yukito is just a bird now, it\'s up to Misuzu\'s \'mom\' to take care of her, but surprise! She\'s not actually her real mom, she\'s her aunt, Haruko. Later on it was revealed that Haruko wasn\'t being an ass of a mother on purpose, obviously it was because of Misuzu\'s condition where she can\'t ever love anyone but now she kinda owns Misuzu officially cuz she threw a tantrum at her parents house and that actually happened but as the days go by after actually caring for Misuzu, Misuzu became weaker and crying and her dreams physically hurt her until she couldn\'t walk anymore. Yukito explained to Haruko before, when he was human, that Misuzu will eventually forgets everyone and everything and the final dream will kill her, of course, being the plot of the show itself, Haruko actually didn\'t buy it and continues on taking care of Misuzu until one day, Misuzu\'s dad came after buying cigarettes 10 years ago to take Misuzu back with him but Haruko already bonded with Misuzu so she doesn\'t want to let that go down the drain even after Misuzu forgot everything about that. One day Haruko was bringing Misuzu to the beach but she complained it was too hot so she left her in the sun to die cuz of how much of a spoiled brat she was but then picked her back up and decided that she wasn\'t really cut out to be a mom so she pulled a sneaky \'Return to sender\' on Misuzu until she regained her memories back and now they\'re together again, but Misuzu grows more weaker as the days go by. Misuzu finally had the final dream but wasnt dying yet, so Haruko thought she wanna bring Misuzu to the shrine festival to buy her baby dinosaurs cuz she didn\'t 10 years ago but it was raining and no one was celebrating, but suddenly they saw an actual stuffed dinosaur on the shrine, being worshipped for months because Haruko threw it away some months ago and some kid found it and said, ""Mommy, I think this is god"" and the mom agrees and the locals started to worship it until Misuzu took it, a day later, Misuzu decided to take her first steps again but suddenly Haruko realized that every girl in Kanon and Clannad died at some point and that hasn\'t happened yet to Misuzu but it was too late as she walked her way from her wheelchair to Haruko and f**king dies. Yeah so that\'s it, you can\'t make this sh*t up, I tell you.Did you get all that? Me neitherThe characters have their quirks and perks just like every Key\'s characters, they don\'t really have much to show but it was enough to set some form of plot, some characters just stands out more than others.The artstyle of Air was, uh, I would say Oldschool but there were literally better looking faces back in the 90s, I appreciate the implementation of 3D visuals though, they were subtle, but had an impact on the storytelling, but nothing was scarier than Misuzu\'s face at the beginning.I guess when it comes to voice acting, I couldn\'t really say much because I watched the english dub version of Air but I have to say that Yukito\'s voice actor was top notch because he reminded me of Speed racer 1970\'s personality and it was awesome, the rest were mediocre at best aside from Haruko.Overall, Air was pretty interesting, even if it won\'t make sense to you, it still plays with your heartstrings, and I think that\'s Key\'s strong points when making these sad animes/visual novels, they don\'t really need to make sense to make you cry, they just do. So yeah Air\'s pretty good. SPOILERS, so just skip a paragraph if you intend to experience the show to the fullest.Right, so the plot is there\'s this deadbeat guy named Yukito who fell asleep on a wall in front of a beach, he earns his living by making puppet shows even though he sucks at it, then he kinda got hungry and almost beat a child senselessly for a bowl of ramen then woke up screaming to another child but this time this child suddenly wanted to make friends with Yukito, she bought Yukito some weird juicebox that you cant drink out of unless you squeeze the box and then she introduces herself as Misuzu, a child according to Yukito, ""A girl with severe brain damage"" Yukito, having no place to go to, gets invited to Misuzu\'s house and ate dinner there then came home her \'mom\' Haruko, a drunk alcoholic who tries to sexually harass yukito countless times and a horrible mother to Misuzu because she didn\'t buy her baby dinosaurs as a child, we\'ll get onto that later. So yeah this is kinda the introduction so imma skim pass some of these plots. So they let Yukito stay at their place cuz he a travelling performer and all but only if he sleeps in the shed and he did. Then one time Yukito met this girl named Kano and her dog named Potato who just barks out Pico pico like a damn pokemon, so apparently Kano has a ribbon on her right wrist cuz she said she needs it tied until she grows up so that she can use her magic as a level 20 sage or something but the catch is that her sister Hijiri was keeping a huge secret from her this whole time and that Kano is schizophrenic and tries to cut her own wrist to sacrifice herself to the gods because she is the descendant of a cursed birdwoman, in the end of her arc, she released her ribbon seal and Yukito somehow found a magical feather at the shrine and just magically knew to put the power of friendship into it to save Kano. Then one time Yukito met a pair of young ladies named Michiru and Minagi, Michiru likes to kick Yukito\'s ass and Minagi just kinda there to see it unfold and gives Yukito coupons for rice discounts, ok for their part Michiru was just actually a manifestation of Minagi\'s dream and she is not real and everyone is just hallucinating from the sand Minagi was keeping, probably. So actually, Minagi\'s mom had a traumatic incident where she lost her child due to an abortion and just lived her life thinking Minagi is actually that dead child so she sometimes has Alzheimers but in the end Yukito being the bastard he is, tricked Minagi into going to her own house and tell her mom the truth and yeah that actually worked out even tho it was like 10 years of her being in fantasy coocooland so Minagi thought it would be a good idea to have Michiru meet her mom and then she cried when eating her special favorite homemade hamburgs and then she said she had to leave because it was time, now this will make sense as to why after this part because one day, Minagi received a letter of invitation from her dad stating he was married with another woman and already had a child who is a few years old by now and so Minagi went to check it out and surprise, it\'s Michiru in child form. Ok so now, having no depressed girls to talk to anymore, Yukito came back to Misuzu to check on how she doing, so one night she suddenly cried when trying to play uno with Yukito, and her \'mom\' was actually in front of the door and she knew the reason why, cuz everytime Misuzu gets close to someone, she suddenly starts crying so she couldn\'t have any bonds with other people without hurting herself, so day and night Yukito was taking care of Misuzu until one night he was like, ""Yo, I need to get out of here cuz both of us will die if we get too close"" and that was like after Yukito got slashed so hard in his previous life as his ancestor that he felt it a thousand years later. Then Yukito kinda learned some new tricks with his puppeteering skillz and went back to cheer up Misuzu and f**king dies and now we\'re suddenly in 994 A.D, you can\'t make this sh*t up. So apparently Yukito\'s ancestor was a security guard samurai to a shrine priestess or something named Kanna and her maid or something, I didn\'t pay attention named Uraha. So they were playing house for a bit until Uraha explained Kanna had to transfer to lots of shrines because she is constantly being hunted by the anti-birdmen federation, I dunno, I didn\'t pay attention, so the 3 of them who bonded couldn\'t bear to see each other go so they travelled across the country to find Kanna\'s mother, they found her sealed in a prison cell and then the mother explained that none of them must ever touch her body because her body has been defiled ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but then they get ambushed and then the mother airbended her way through the forest till she got shot by 2 arrows and f**king dies but Yukito\'s ancestor, Ryuya or something, didn\'t listen and touched her cuz he was getting rid of the arrows and Kanna touching her cuz well, her mother just died, so Kanna revealed her wings, and her naked body and decided to leave the group because she was holding them down but then got shot by a lot of arrows and yeah that body defiled thing, that actually triggered a curse where both Ryuya and Kanna will forever suffer a painful death for generations and that means their literal incarnations will suffer the same fate. So yeah Ryuya and Uraha went into hiding and they just suddenly had the power to enter the consciousness of Kanna who is now trapped in a limbo somewhere and they can somehow see her dreams, then Uraha out of nowhere says, ""Hey we need to make babies so that one of our descendants may help Kanna one day"" and then they had wild s*x that spanned over countless generations until present day where Ryuya\'s descendant, Yukito is now reincarnated as a Crow and rewinded back in time where he was sleeping on the wall but now there are 2 Yukitos in the same timeline, where one of them is a crow now. Living his replay from then on until the point before his death, his soul was freed and Misuzu met with past Yukito, not Ryuya, thats way too past, I mean the timeline before this timeline but after Ryuya\'s timeline, and he explained that he will always be there with Misuzu but as a crow named Sky now. So yeah, now that Yukito is just a bird now, it\'s up to Misuzu\'s \'mom\' to take care of her, but surprise! She\'s not actually her real mom, she\'s her aunt, Haruko. Later on it was revealed that Haruko wasn\'t being an ass of a mother on purpose, obviously it was because of Misuzu\'s condition where she can\'t ever love anyone but now she kinda owns Misuzu officially cuz she threw a tantrum at her parents house and that actually happened but as the days go by after actually caring for Misuzu, Misuzu became weaker and crying and her dreams physically hurt her until she couldn\'t walk anymore. Yukito explained to Haruko before, when he was human, that Misuzu will eventually forgets everyone and everything and the final dream will kill her, of course, being the plot of the show itself, Haruko actually didn\'t buy it and continues on taking care of Misuzu until one day, Misuzu\'s dad came after buying cigarettes 10 years ago to take Misuzu back with him but Haruko already bonded with Misuzu so she doesn\'t want to let that go down the drain even after Misuzu forgot everything about that. One day Haruko was bringing Misuzu to the beach but she complained it was too hot so she left her in the sun to die cuz of how much of a spoiled brat she was but then picked her back up and decided that she wasn\'t really cut out to be a mom so she pulled a sneaky \'Return to sender\' on Misuzu until she regained her memories back and now they\'re together again, but Misuzu grows more weaker as the days go by. Misuzu finally had the final dream but wasnt dying yet, so Haruko thought she wanna bring Misuzu to the shrine festival to buy her baby dinosaurs cuz she didn\'t 10 years ago but it was raining and no one was celebrating, but suddenly they saw an actual stuffed dinosaur on the shrine, being worshipped for months because Haruko threw it away some months ago and some kid found it and said, ""Mommy, I think this is god"" and the mom agrees and the locals started to worship it until Misuzu took it, a day later, Misuzu decided to take her first steps again but suddenly Haruko realized that every girl in Kanon and Clannad died at some point and that hasn\'t happened yet to Misuzu but it was too late as she walked her way from her wheelchair to Haruko and f**king dies. Yeah so that\'s it, you can\'t make this sh*t up, I tell you.Did you get all that? Me neitherThe characters have their quirks and perks just like every Key\'s characters, they don\'t really have much to show but it was enough to set some form of plot, some characters just stands out more than others.The artstyle of Air was, uh, I would say Oldschool but there were literally better looking faces back in the 90s, I appreciate the implementation of 3D visuals though, they were subtle, but had an impact on the storytelling, but nothing was scarier than Misuzu\'s face at the beginning.I guess when it comes to voice acting, I couldn\'t really say much because I watched the english dub version of Air but I have to say that Yukito\'s voice actor was top notch because he reminded me of Speed racer 1970\'s personality and it was awesome, the rest were mediocre at best aside from Haruko.Overall, Air was pretty interesting, even if it won\'t make sense to you, it still plays with your heartstrings, and I think that\'s Key\'s strong points when making these sad animes/visual novels, they don\'t really need to make sense to make you cry, they just do. So yeah Air\'s pretty good.', ""This is my first review, so bear with me.  Air is notable, because it is from kyoto animation and experimental.  It is also one of their earlier works; succeeded by kanon and clannad the following years.  The moai fad many people like and remember, and good music.  The characters and story are somewhat forgettable, but the whole series had the lightness of floating on air.  You won't watch it and say it's one of the best anime, but it's good at what it does and does it well.  Vic Mignogna (Edward Elric) and (Broly) voiced the lead.  It's...an anime I would watch again and recommend.  KyoAni is one of my favorite anime studios with high quality animation.  Because they don't rely on violence to show power or fan service to show charisma.  If you watch Air you're not an airhead, but to accept the transcience that is life. an anime I would watch again and recommend.  KyoAni is one of my favorite anime studios with high quality animation.  Because they don't rely on violence to show power or fan service to show charisma.  If you watch Air you're not an airhead, but to accept the transcience that is life."", 'Air is, to say the least, an entertaining anime. This is the first of the Key anime, which includes the likes of Kanon, Angel Beats, and Clannad. While Air is a pretty damn good anime that foretells some of the conventions of future Key series, it’s not as good as any of the newer ones.Key anime of the romance department typically involve a single guy who is forced into a situation where a bunch of girls with issues need his help. This stems from the fact that Air, Clannad, and Kanon are all based on visual novels, and visual novels have multiple girls you can...get with. So the anime’s attempt to tell each girls story while focusing only on a single romantic thread for our main hero. Air is different from its future incarnations as it doesn’t as much focus on that idea of multiple girls needing help solving their mental issues. It has three girls in it, two of which are the focus of maybe four or five episodes total. The others are divided into a really strange feudal Japan segment, a segment with our hero and the heroine, and a another segment between the heroine and her mother. It’s not typical of what will come, and I appreciate that especially.The story revolves around the “Girl in the Sky”, an angelic figure who has constantly been forced to be in pain through incarnation after incarnation. She is forced to die every time she gets too close to someone and reincarnate again. A man has followed her every reincarnation to attempt to free her of these horrible bonds. His soul is stuck in the body of a crow and he can become a human vagabond in his attempts to free her.So we have Yukito, the vagabond, and Mizusu, the girl in the sky. Mizusu has no close friends, no close family, and pretty much lives her life as a lonely klutz. But when she meets Yukito during one lovely summer vacation she may have found her greatest friend and the catalyst for her finally feeling accepted. He moves in with Mizusu and her drunken and rather inappropriate aunt, Haruko, and tries to help Mizusu be freed from her eternal bond. During that time he gets a part time job at the local clinic and helps the owner’s sister as she is being possessed (did I mention Key anime have really weird supernatural plotlines?). He also helps a girl whose sister has been dead for years yet her ghost has been following her around since she died.The two arcs with the girls aren’t particularly great. Neither is memorable and both are seriously shadowed by those stories told in Key’s later anime.During the last half the story shifts to feudal Japan where we learn the origin of the angel girl and the man who tries to save her. These episodes aren’t half bad, but really ruin the pace and interject very abruptly. It doesn’t feel right.The final arc is of mother and daughter. Well, aunt and daughter. Yukito is a crow who is made to watch as Haruko makes amends with Mizusu and claims her as a daughter rather than a niece. This is the best part of the entire anime, a very touching and well executed arc that builds on the character of Haruko and makes her the most likeable character of the entire anime.The ending isn’t the greatest. Now, I’m all for a sad ending, but I felt kind of cheated. I hate when an anime is just a small part of a bigger story and we really don’t see that story concluded. It’s just part of a story, a segment of a whole. And while Air contains a good enough story and characters, I want to see what happens to those characters and how the story plays out. Does the Girl in the Sky ever get freed? I really want to know the answer to it.The character department is pretty sparse of anything worth mentioning. As I said,  the two girls at the beginning are decent enough characters with decent enough stories, but they really don’t matter in the long term and their characters are not real exciting. This is doubly so for the main characters. Yukito is pretty dull all around. He’s what I like to call a cardboard character. He’s flat as a pancake and doesn’t shine at all. The same can be said of Mizusu. While she displays emotions, she’s a typical cry baby with an issue that needs to be resolved. I wasn’t really a fan of hers.Meanwhile, I grew to enjoy the character of Haruko. While at first I liked her as the drunken, idiot aunt taking care of her sister’s daughter, as you learn more about how she has had to distance herself from Mizusu, you grow to like her and feel empathetic to her having to stay away from a girl she really does love. As Haruko finally steps into the motherly roll and despises the fact she hadn’t done it sooner, you continue to love her. And as Mizusu loses her memories of her mother (she loses her memory of a person if they grow too close), and is nearly returned to her real family, it’s enough to bring you to tears as she struggles to return to her aunt’s arms, the woman she considers her mother.For Haruko’s character alone, the series is worth watching. While the ending, as I said, isn’t at all what I had hoped, nor is the rest of the show too special, the final stretch is good and memorable.Overall, I can’t give an enthusiastic recommendation as this is only going to appeal to fans of Key or romance in general, but I can say it’s a pretty good anime. The opening is really fantastic, the animation is good, the story is okay, and the characters are okay, but taken as a whole it’s a fun little experience. Not particularly as memorable as later Key anime, but it still contains the heart that you’d expect.Oh, and try and find the Kanon characters that show up in one episode.

It’s a pretty cool cameo!', 'Gao!Air is one of three KEY visual novels adapted by Kyoto Animation.  Out of the 3 adaptations, this is the one I remember the least.  Clannad and Kanon 2006 were both exceptionally fantastic series, being emotionally gripping and beautifully told.  So naturally, I had pretty high expectations for Air when I first heard it was made before the two series in question.  Unfortunately, I can\'t say that Air captured the same feeling I had when watching Clannad and Kanon.  So today, I look at KyoAni\'s first attempt at an adaptation, Air.  Enjoy.Story: 4/10.Yukito Kunisaki is out to find the...Winged Maiden, a old tale that his mother told him about as a child.  He passes through a small town that he didn\'t expect to stay in very long, as he meets Misuzu Kaimo.  This mysterious girl invites Yukito to stay with her.  As Yukito continues to stay in this small, quaint little town, he starts to realize something: Could the Winged Maiden be closer than he thought?  The first 10 episodes of the anime are pointless; some sarcastic guy with ridiculous hair helps a girl with their problems, and once their character arc is over, you never see or hear from them again.  This  is Air\'s biggest problem, character development.  I\'ll get more in detail about  the characters further down the track, but for now, let\'s talk about the feels.  The most interesting arc in the show is Mizusu and her mother\'s story, showing how powerful a mother\'s love can be.  It was so powerful and moving, I actually had to call my mother to tell her that I love her.  Unfortunately, the anime doesn\'t focus much on these characters, deciding to focus more on girls we don\'t give a crap about, an unnecessary flashback arc, and a recap episode at the VERY END.   The flashback arc in particular was a complete mistake.  They could have easily explained these two episodes in about 5 minutes; granted, it would have taken some time to refocus, but they should\'ve done that anyway to give Misuzu and her mother their proper story.  Add this with the incredibly pointless side character arcs that do nothing to develop Yukito\'s character, and half of the show was nothing but a waste of time.  You could probably skip episodes 2-6 and still understand what\'s going on.  The biggest problem with Air\'s story is the fact that it\'s way too ambitious.  It tries to take on many ideas at once, and ultimately falls flat on it\'s face.  KyoAni eventually fixed all these problems with Kanon, and perfectly avoided them with Clannad, but that doesn\'t excuse Air for causing those problems.Characters: 5/10.When it comes to adapting a visual novel, the one job Air had was to make me care about the characters.  If you don\'t care about the characters, then you won\'t care about  what happens to them; whatever happens will go over your head, and you\'re sitting there thinking: ""Was that supposed to make me cry?""  You can probably guess by my tone, I didn\'t care about the majority of Air\'s cast, save for Misuzu.  Even still, all she does for the first few episodes is fall over, drink peach juice and say ""Gao!""  Later on in the show, I grow more attached to Misuzu\'s character, but by that time, the show is near it\'s end.  I cared about her, but not even close to how much I cared about Nagisa or Ayu from Clannad and Kanon.  Air doesn\'t devote enough time to the main cast, instead deciding to have the side characters take the spotlight for a majority of the series, and even still, their arcs are very uninteresting.  The anime somehow achieved a middle ground, leaving both the main cast and the side cast extremely underwhelming.Art/Sound: 8/10The biggest praise I can give Air is it\'s atmosphere.  The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and the art, while it may be dated for some, is still fantastic.  Keep in mind, this anime came out in 2005.  The art and sound alone make this series worth watching.  Character design comes down to personal preference; if you don\'t like the huge eyes and bushy face, so be it.  The OST keeps a great balance of soothing and spiritual, matching the melancholic atmosphere the show.  Finally, for all you dub watchers out there, Air\'s dub is actually pretty good.  It\'s one of the few KyoAni dubs that doesn\'t want to make me tear my ears out.  Looking at you, first season of Clannad.  Overall, the art and soundtrack is fantastic, and while the anime itself may not have lived up to the beauty of the two, it was a pleasure nonetheless.Final VerdictAir isn\'t terrible; there\'s nothing about this anime that will make you think less of KEY\'s other adaptations, but the anime isn\'t that good, either.  This series has a lot of potential; it has an interesting story that mostly fails to deliver, characters too unexplored for me to care, and an amazing feel to it that the rest of the anime mostly fails to capture.  It could have easily been as great as it\'s successors with a few plot tweaks, a change in focus, and more character development.  I feel like Air would have done a lot better if it were longer than 13 episodes.  Air was a drama with missed potential that should have been a lot better than what it could have been, and doesn\'t hold up compared to it\'s predecessors.  At the end of the day, Air may make you cry, but you really have to ask yourself: Why are you crying?  Is it because the characters on screen are crying? Or is it something deeper?Air gets a C- Winged Maiden, a old tale that his mother told him about as a child.

The dialogue in this show is damn good as well, and each word uttered has some kind of deep meaning to it. Air although is a clearly messed up and infuriating show at times, it does...have lot of redeeming qualities. The characters are well made,even if they are kinda generic, the animation is stellar, and the summer blues and raw emotions humans feel are portrayed really well, throughout the majority of the episodes. Again I'm not saying the characters received whole lotta development, but they felt lively and real to me.Also air's overall premise is quite great as well,since it tells the importance of family and relationships.BUT now lets focus onto the negatives:1. Air's Story is too vague to be conceivable and the audience is left confused, since they can't really grasp the overall story and plot of the series. The story is so confusing that it took me like an eternity to get the fact that our MC was ill.2. The Characters in Air and their respectable Arcs, aren't shown the way they should've been and after exploring the story of the side characters, they just vanish in thin air not to appear again. The anime started of really great and charismatic and it lasted the way for the first six episodes after that it went downhill and our major protagonist was downgraded to a goddamn crow.. yes a crow!3. Although air is vivid and surreal, and its quite unique in its concept.. at the end of the day, its a sob story, which appeals to a certain demographic.4. The end is simply frustrating, and one episode towards the end was a recap. I guess, the producers would've just added an extra episode.ALL IN all, Air is an ambitious peice of art, which couldn't hold up to the viewers expectations, its aesthethically great and serene, but the story is too confusing and it has a lot of inconceivable subtle details scattered throughout its episodes which never get a proper explanation. The characters are great, but their stories are severely mishandled and most of them are fillers. And the other half is not properly written and rushed; contradictory to its first half. If they would've extended this series, explained the plot neatly and if the characters wouldn't have been downgraded (also if the end wasn't annoying af) then this anime would've been great.MY OVERALL SCORE- 6.5/10Enjoyment Level-  1st Half - 7.5/10, 2nd Half 5/10 have lot of redeeming qualities.

Air..Alright two things first  :1) Air TV could and SHOULD have been a 26+ episode series.2) Air, had it not suffered from a goddamn awful execution, could have been a nice series  maybe even close to the level of  Ano Hana : The Flower We Saw That Day.So, is this worth your time ? Is it enjoyable ?..Meh..maybe ?...Air TV is a eroge/romance visual novel developed by Key. Responsible for the anime series adaption  is studio Kyoto animation.After having dropped the anime series 4 times throughout the years and driven by how enchanted I am by the music (specifically the opening song) and the whole atmosphere that surrounds the series I decided to stick with it.Story ---> 6 ( Promising )Okay. Guys.Who the f knows what this show is about ?What is the plot, really ?Is it the romance between Yukito and Misuzu ?Is it the problems of the surrounding cast and how Yukito helps them out ?Is it the story of Kanna, a priestess-like winged girl and Ryura, the samurai guard ?Is it the curse that is placed upon Kanna that causes her to suffer throughout reincarnations ?Is it Misuzu's relationship with her mother ?No really, what is Air about ?A looot of plot elements were introduced and never developed, a bunch of subplots were never explained. I guess the synopsis though would be something like this :Yukito Kunisaki is a handsome young traveler (had to add handsome cause everyone in this show fits the bishoujo/bishounen archetype which makes them gorgeous) who goes around in towns and throwing puppet shows trying to make money of that.(he fails) He has one goal in mind : to find the winged girl that is in the sky. He meets and befriends Misuzu Kamio, a naive absent minded and quite adorable girl, that soon reveals to him that she has been having weird dreams that feature a winged girl that is in the sky. Misuzu calls this girl '' the other me '' and is greatly affected by whatever is happening to her.Do you sense supernatural ? Oooh yeaah~The premise is interesting and when it's given proper attention it becomes even more interesting. Winged beings that carry the dream of the world, dreams that harm the dreamer, romantic elements and magic.But its exactly in developing all those subplots that Air fails.It just decides that it wants to achieve a little too much. It wants to develop all themes and ends up fully developing none. The show's ending doesn't answer anything BUT BUT it manages to make you cry. (if you re willing to forget the rest)Characters ---> 5Not a fan of moe, not a fan of series with tons of girls (dont wanna say harem cause Air is technically not a harem yay) , not a fan of cliche stereotypical characters.But~I did find Yukito more interesting than a typical harem lead and I think that's because I clicked with his whole '' travelling performer that fails at being entertaining  '' thing.  He does however try to fix everyone's problems and wow he succeeds.Misuzu is cute, childish , naive and retarded, like what you'd expect from a moe character. She deals with psychological burden and is sort of a dramatic character. The thing that I did enjoy is how everyone treats her. Nobody is shown close to her, (apart from her mother who thinks her behavior is problematic) no one thinks her moe attitude is charming. She is truly alone and lonely and the series ,I think, succeeds in getting that across.I also have to admit that I liked the dynamic between the two characters.Everyone else was either boring or brought nothing new to the table.I firmly believe that if Kano and her sister did not exist no one would have cared. They did not add anything to the overall feeling of the series.Minagi and Michiru are not great characters but I did enjoy their backstory. I feel it was rushed though and should have developed in more episodes.Haruko is okay, not a bad character and I think the part that focuses on the relationship between Misuzu and her is probably the one that shines most from the whole story. It should have definitely been longer, or been introduced earlier in the series. It does make you emotional but it also manages to make you confused as to why this relationship between the two was not introduced earlier on. It seems important enough.Art -->7What can I say, I liked the art. At times it was gorgeous and other times simplistic af. Yes, the huge eyes become hard to take seriously at times.  It did however fit in the series' setting and atmosphere. Very few complains about that part of the show. I realize some people may find the art not very appealing and I understand it I guess.Sound --> 9I cant even begin to explain how much I love this show's opening theme. It has become an all time favorite. The soundtrack over all is great, compliments the show well.OverallI appreciate how the show did not end up being a harem show, even though the harem elements are evident, Yukito shows clear preference for Misuzu and quite early on I might add. I also think the last few episodes that focus on Misuzu and Haruko were nicely done and they should have been more of a main focus of the series. Air TV seems to be able to do drama/tragedy right only if it decides that that's what it wants to do. Soundtrack is a huge plus to this series overall enjoyment. The plot elements that Air introduces are not bad , in fact they re quite decent and if developed correctly would have made a beautiful series that fans of the genre would come to appreciate.However,Bad pacing, plot holes, unnecessary characters, not enough screen time, unexpected plot changes derive a lot from this show's enjoyment. I definitely understand people that give Air a lower score than 6 cause quite honestly, the flaws that it has are not easy to forget or forgive.I must say though that I do not hate this show, in fact I liked some aspects of it such as the setting, the atmosphere and the melancholic/nostalgic/tragic feeling that surrounds it.  I could say this is a guilty pleasure of mine. I might even rewatch it in the future , who knows.So, is Air TV worth your time?Yes -> if you like moe, romance, drama, supernatural elements in your romance, simple characters and an overall soothing feeling in your series.No -> if you hate any of the above + unexpected plot twists, unexplained stories + endings and if poor execution annoys the hell out of you.(Im new at reviews!

In all seriousness though, this anime was a disappointment, especially after all the 10* and 9* reviews I read.******IN SUMMARY******First few episodes were fine up until they introduced the supernatural aspect of it. The first few episodes weren't great, but at least they were watchable. The second they turned their focus to the magic, the show went downhill. It became confusing very quickly, and that caused the anime to become boring. And if that wasn't bad enough, they dedicated two episodes to a random flashback...that only raised more questions than it answered. It felt like they tried to cram way too many story details into the 12 episodes they had. Honestly the anime would have been better if they slowed the story down and developed the characters a bit better. that only raised more questions than it answered.

Our main caracter has special POWERS, he can basically make a puppet move with only his mind. So while looking for the girl and trying to make money with his skill on that long journey, he comes across this town and meets our main girl.

Some major things come out of nowhere that doesn\'t really make sense... I dunno... I might just get the story wrong but they could\'ve done that in a better way. The other characters in the series just didn\'t exist in the final arcs anymore, a little cameo or something would\'ve been nice.6 episodes was a little too short to grow attached to the relation Yukito and Masuzu had.Don\'t get me wrong: I enjoyed this anime and cried at the final arc. If...you saw Kanon and/or Clannad you\'ll start to see a pattern Key Visual likes to do (I\'m not gonna tell what because it\'s a spoiler).I\'m most likely gonna check out Air In Summer but it\'s not on the top of my watch list. This anime has, as in all of the anime\'s part of the Key Visual holy three, amazing tearjerking music. The sad version of the OP is gonna get added to my ""Anime music that hits me in the feels"" tab of my profile\'s description.This was probably the oldest anime I\'ve watched so far (IIRC). The artstyle didn\'t bother me at all (wich turns me off most of the time with old anime) but that\'s probably because I\'ve grown to love the doll-Clannad-artstyle I used to despise. you saw Kanon and/or Clannad you\'ll start to see a pattern Key Visual likes to do (I\'m not gonna tell what because it\'s a spoiler).I\'m most likely gonna check out Air In Summer but it\'s not on the top of my watch list.

That trait is probably the most apparent in this anime.But the problem with the story in Air is that you don\'t know if the conflicts from the story are coming from...mental state of the characters or the weird mystical things. The formula of the anime is that the main character meets with each girl and deals with their problems, but most of the problems are just magical things that are barely explained. These girls get possessed by ghosts, turn into birds,and even just disappear and you want an explanation, but instead the anime just assumes you know how or why these things happen and just go along with it.The worst case of this is the second half, It has  flashback episodes and  it pulls a retcon with a bird, now this bird is a very important ,but barely anything is explained about it that its just a mess honestly. Now the ending was super emotional, i was on the verge of tears through some of it,but ""verge"" is such an understatement. Most of the reasons why things led to a cry porn moment, was because of magic lol and i feel like i would be down for if it could be explained just a bit more. To put it in more perspective, these characters are not crying most of the time because of themselves, they are crying because of some poorly explained plot points. And it does loose me when it should really hit the most.This show does also have some very hard hitting themes of depression, anxiety, and one of my favorite themes in anime, familial bonds.But these themes are just implied instead of actually explored and i feel like they are at even more of a disadvantage because of the lifeless characters.What really i can say about these girls is that they do not act like normal people at all. They act depressed all the time,in almost every conversation they have they talk about the freaking sky, and they happen to be so lonely that they didn\'t mind going to a bird for emotional counseling.But what makes it worse is that about three quarters of the characters feel almost irrelevant since, compared to Kanon 2006 at least, they don\'t have the most lively personality.The only character names i do remember are Misuzu and Yukito, Yukito as a bland mc i do appreciate because unlike many other mc\'s in anime like this, the show does not beat around the bush that he is basically a hobo who begs children for money, and i think its kinda funny that these people just let him in with open arms when he is sketchy as hell. But as a character, hes as bland as they come, i watch the anime in english(since i watch dubbed anime when i work on stuff and i have hardcore astigmatism and im not a sub elitisit) so i think Vic Migno- i mean Junpei Elric, gave as much of a personality as he possibly could.The  real MVP of this anime is Misuzu , if there were moments of Air that actually made you cry, i bet my bottom dollar that it was because of her. As a character i cant help to think that she has some type of mental disorder. There are times where she just acts a bit too unorthodox for a normal person.  Also she falls face first on concrete a lot and its not really a cute anime thing, its just fucking hilarious not gonna lie.It really sucks that this weird behavior of hers makes her the  most interesting character in the show, because most of this behavior fits well within the presumed themes of depression and anxiety. But is sadly all of it is  explained by lol magik. Second best character goes to Haruko,Misuzu\'s guardian because her development in the final episodes is just *chefs\' kiss* amazing. I like how her bad choices in the beginning of the anime are still prevalent but it still works really well despite the ""lol magick"" story.Also the angel girl and the samurai dude, uh idk what to say about them because i forgot all about them.Watching the anime , i kept reminding myself that this anime came out in 2005, in the same season as Negima, Ah my goddess, and about two seasons before fucking SUZUKA came out.The animation holds up really damn well,so well that i almost want to call it timeless, it may also be that this anime has a 16:9 ratio in an era of 4:3 anime.But it may be because of kyoto animation\'s style which was definitely one of the more unique ones in anime history. With the huge heads and the eyes that are so far apart. This style is just a huge kamichama karin meme waiting to happen. I know a lot people can take it or leave it, and personally its not my favorite style out there, but i appreciate how Kyoto animation handled the proportions in a way where it doesn\'t feel weird.Also the character animation is god tier in my opinion. There are some shots in this anime that I honestly wont ever forget. I do think some color choices make the hair look weird, its not as bad as HandShakers but it makes the hair not look like hair. I know this was not Kyoto animation at its finest, but its nice to see them starting to build their legacy, its like seeing Harry Potter get his first wand.Not much to say about sound, the opening imo is one of the most catchiest anime openings of all time.This theme was stuck in my head for about six years before i even watched the anime, and it is very recognizable towards many people. I do have many things to say about the dub, It was alright, despite Tamaki Suo being miscast in a lot of things in my opinion, i think he did well trying to add emotion to the main  character in Air without crossing the line into overacting, and i can say the same for Monica Rial as Misuzu and whatsherface as Haruko. All the other voice actors are just okay, but what is not okay is the voice acting for the young girls in the show, on two occasions, there are female characters who scream a lot and they really made me want to blow my eardrums out HunterxHunter style.If anything, this dub\'s script felt a bit more sincere than other dubs i see coming out today, like it felt like they were trying to be the characters instead of acting like characters.Anyways i had an enjoyable time throughout half of it, i unintentionally laughed at times,and other times i was bored to tears. In the end i do feel like i have that easily disposable enjoyment you can get out of any daytime soap opera , which is not a bad thing, it almost goes to Violet evergarden levels where the anime tries so hard to evoke emotion from you that it ends up exhausting you by the time you get to the end, but sense the beginning was just so forgettable you find yourself actually engaged, i dont know if the ending of this anime will be something that will stick with me forever, but out of all of the cry porn shows out there, not exclusive to kyo-ani, this show is the more decent out of all them, but then again Myanimelist considered the word decent as  a 4 out of 10, so to each is own.Overall-6also, don\'t watch episode 13, its just a recap episode of the whole show mental state of the characters or the weird mystical things.

In the end i do feel like i have that easily disposable enjoyment you can get out of any daytime soap opera , which is not a bad thing, it almost goes to Violet evergarden levels where the anime tries so hard to evoke emotion from you that it ends up exhausting you by the time you get to the end, but sense the beginning was just so forgettable you find yourself actually engaged, i dont know if the ending of this anime will be something that will stick with me forever, but out of all of the cry porn shows out there, not exclusive to kyo-ani, this show is the more decent out of all them, but then again Myanimelist considered the word decent as  a 4 out of 10, so to each is own.Overall-6also, don\'t watch episode 13, its just a recap episode of the whole show', 'if you dont like drama, dont watch it. but for those you like a drama, it is recommended. the first episode is quite boring but as the story progress, the story becomes interesting. sory for the bad review since it is my first time to write a review ', 'I watched Air because I like Kannon and Clannad. Air, like Clannad has to do with interesting characters dealing with odd and supernatural events within their daily lives. It all starts with a traveling puppeteer who is down on his luck. He is search for the &quot;winged girl&quot; that his mother searched for. He befriends an odd girl who has no friends. Could she be the fabled girl? The story is composed of three arcs(chapters). The first is the story from the puppeteers view. This was the best of the three arcs. The second was set in the distant past. This one was pretty good....Finally, the last arc is told from the view of a crow. This was my least favorite arc. Overall pretty good. Finally, the last arc is told from the view of a crow. This was my least favorite arc. Overall pretty good.', ""Air starts off as funny and rather enjoyable but then as it continues on it gets much more mysterious and dark. The main character meets lots of people throughout his time in a small quiet seaside town. There he does his act with a doll that he controls and makes money off of it. He eventually meets Misuzu who invites him into her house so he can have a place to sleep. He of course stays throughout the series and this is where the story begins to pick up with the winged maiden. Misuzu becomes sicker and sicker with no cure and no way of...ever living through it. Eventually she ends up dying and this is the absolute saddest anime I have ever seen. If you don't cry at the end of it then you are definitely not human. The ending i would have to say gets a little confusing but still not enough that I would only give it a nine. It is still a very engaging story and would suggest it if you are into anime like kanon 2006. ever living through it.

The comedy is a bit weak, and the first girl's problem a bit opaque, but I remain hopeful for the rest. Overall, it's no _Clannad_ of course, but given that it was one of the earlier series, I liked it more than I expected. (And as ever with Maeda, some of the music is fantastic.) As episodes passed, Misuzu remained tolerable and maybe even improved to be quite possibly the single...most 'real' female character in any Key work I've seen (admittedly, not saying much), and to my considerable surprise, she didn't simply 'get better' or be magically healed. (The ending worked a lot better in _Air_ than _Angel Beats!_, where it had felt like a betrayal of much of the meaning of the disappearing.) I don't think it's *better* than _Clannad_ because the humor never was quite as good, and the side-stories definitely inferior to even Kanon's side-stories, but the main story is easily comparable. most 'real' female character in any Key work I've seen (admittedly, not saying much), and to my considerable surprise, she didn't simply 'get better' or be magically healed.

I wanted to try out a new anime and essentially bought this because it was only $15. It looked interesting though, at least from what you can get from the back of the box. I took it home, tossed it aside for later, and realized recently that it had been sitting in my anime pile for a few months now. I remembered it because I has picked up Kanon recently, (which I will be watching soon), and was told it was made by the same people who had made Air. So I decided that...before I watch Kanon, I would watch Air since it was only 12 episodes. I’m glad I did.Air is essentially a show about growth. Growth of feelings, growth of courage, but more fully, growth of character. Each and every character in this anime goes through different trials, and comes away a better person because of it. We have the main character, Yukito who was always something of a loner, until the kind and rambunctious Misuzu comes into his life. She merely wants to be his friend, but Yukito has no desire to be involved with her. She takes him into her home, with her rowdy mother, and their relationship grows from there. Then there’s Kano, a school-mate of Misuzu, with her own mysterious past, followed by Misagi, who’s family is malfunctioning. Of course we have the ever annoying little brat, Michiru, whom whenever she spoke I wanted to mute the TV, but even she had my sympathies when her story gets told. You see, each resident of this small town has a story, and you find out all of them throughout the series. My favorite has to do with Misuzu’s mother. It’s a touching story, and it even managed to make me shed a tear. Very few anime’s, much less media in general, cause me to do this, so I give high accolades to ones that can.Of course, no anime is without its problems. As mentioned above, a couple of characters kind of annoyed me. Misuzu’s voice is rather high, and to hear it often was problematic. It’s common in anime to have a high-voiced girl, but it tends to bother me. Then there’s Michiru…. Oh god there’s Michiru. She was the loudest, most irritating character by far. I was glad she wasn’t a prevalent character.Also, this is only a minor gripe, but the sound seemed to be a little quiet, as I had to keep the volume turned up higher than I normally have it. Not a real problem, but worth mentioning. I also was not a huge fan of the two episodes that basically travel back in time. Sure it fleshes out the story more, but it seemed out of place in an otherwise standout anime.Besides these, the show was fantastic, and a worthy addition to any collection. I’m glad I took a chance on this anime, and look forward to their other works. I highly recommend this anime. before I watch Kanon, I would watch Air since it was only 12 episodes.

But somehow in the end, Yukito decide to leave and only left her a doll that kinda have some sort of power and stuff that will become Misuzu companion since both them can't be close together or both of them will die. The point is that, I'm not sure where this storyline is going, YES we do learned the history about Kanna and how Misuzu is the incarnation that will redo the curse all over again. Not sure what the solution of the anime, and the storyline is pretty much messed up. I started to skip each second on each episode 10 to 12. by far, my favorite episode is 8 to 9, that tells the story about ryuuya,uhara and kanna back then.Art : 5/10- the art is moderate, although there is no certain elemnts on each characters that reminds me and have an impact on me. But overall it is nicely done, since it's kyoto animation afterall.Sound : 5/10- I don't really enjoy the OP and ED .Character : 4/10- the characters have so much slacks. No offence but the main hero and heroine really doesnt have a special personality that attracts me to them except for Ryuuya and Uhara. They have this sparkles in their character that makes me attracted to them. Meanwhile, Kanna and Misuzu are both childlike. If it's Michiru then it's fine since she is still a child but somehow I just had this thing for characters who can't stand up for themselves, it bores me to death since I like independent and strong characters.Enjoyment : 4/10- I haven't reach the climax of this anime yet, infact i dont even know which part is the climax. I still need more.Overall : 4/10- I'm not satisfied yet. The fact that saves this anime for me is episodes 8 and 9 itself. It perfectly tells the history behind the curse.

AIR has some seriously rough edges.Story(6) - The story is about the strange supernatural events/sickness surrounding these feathers that are shown (briefly) and how they are all related to Misuzu\'s strange supernatural sickness.  Pretty much all the events with side characters are just distractions from Misuzu\'s main story which doesn\'t pick up until the roughly the last third of the show.  The way in which the supernatural sickness/events were executed was just so poor that many viewers will be...scratching their heads for the first part of the show.Roughly half way through the show just when you are wondering what the heck is going on with these strange feathers and the supernatural events surrounding them you are warped back in time and new characters are introduced.   You then get to learn the story behind the strange feathers you saw in the first half.   You learn that the feathers are ""shards"" of a female demigod like being that was cursed by monks on her deathbed.  The feathers from this beings body being cursed and holding some kind of supernatural qualities that end up causing the prior events in the show are now explained (albeit poorly).Finally the story wraps up with the sick girl Misuzu (who is the partial mortal reincarnation of the cursed god like being, this is why she is sick) finding what she was looking for.  This is where a huge enjoyable amount of character growth for Haruko makes your investment in the show worth all the mediocre parts of the first half of the show.  Haruko decides to become Misuzu\'s parent by adopting Misuzu from her brother (Misuzu\'s dad).The characters (5) - Mostly mediocre with a few standouts.  The real problem with AIR is the poor characterization, all the girls are just card-board cut-out archetypes with the exception of Haruko who at first seems flat but gets a huge development boost during the second half of the show.  The other exception is Yukito who does a pretty good job when the other voice actors for the females give cringe worthy performances but is mostly there as a Deus Ex machina to shape events of the story.The chemistry between Haruko and Misuzu during the last portion of the show is ultimately what saves AIR from drowning in plot holes and the poor performances from the female cast during the first half of the show.  Yukito also gets a mention for making the first half of AIR bearable to watch with the poor to mediocre/average performances for most other female characters besides Haruko.Art(7) - The art is mostly fine for the time it was made, no real annoyances.Sound(6) - The sound is where things fall down a bit it\'s mostly in the poor voice acting and not really the music, there is just some really bad performances phoned in for the characters in this show.Enjoyment factor (7) - While air has huge problems and gaping plotholes and lots of bad writing there is enough redeeming features in the second half of the show to make you not regret watching this. scratching their heads for the first part of the show.Roughly half way through the show just when you are wondering what the heck is going on with these strange feathers and the supernatural events surrounding them you are warped back in time and new characters are introduced.

As beautiful as it is technically, it\'s story is more on the character-development slice-of-life drama than story orientated.

Shiny, nicely colored, fluid, movement... detailed backgrounds. This show has it all. I can only imagine how gorgeous it must look on a big screen on DVD.

The main character is pretty different from the others but since this is a Romance anime the female protagonist is cliched almost to the extreme. She's your typical clumsy girl who's also pretty and very nice, and who will even let a stranger stay in her home.

I actually came across fansubs of Air while looking for another show, and knowing nothing about it, I watched it and I wound up enjoying it. Fun fact: This, along with Ouran High School Host Club, were some of the first anime I watched fansubbed, before they were brought to the US on home video. I didn\'t...learn about the concept of licensing until later. I used to think anything that wasn\'t on TV was only in Japan until I learned that anime and their English dubs could only be watched on DVD, not on TV (Depending on the series). I enjoyed Air enough that I bought the DVDs (The movie included), though I did exchange them for a complete collection later. Air is an adaptation of one of Key\'s visual novels, and the anime was pretty well-liked when it first aired, though it would quickly get overshadowed years later by Clannad. While I do enjoy Clannad a little more, I still have a sentimental attachment to Air as a series, and rewatching it now, while some parts of it didn\'t age all that well, I still think it\'s a great show made by people who clearly loved the source material and did it justice.Traveling street performer Yukito Kunisaki arrives at a small seaside town called Kami, having traversed around Japan in continuation of his late mother\'s search for the ""girl in the sky"" who, according to a family legend, has been cursed to spend eternity all alone. Yukito\'s sole way of earning money is by performing a puppet show by moving a doll that has been passed down in his family with magic, but he fails to gain anyone\'s attention by doing so, and as a result, he\'s low on money. The next day, he meets Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy high school girl who is eager to become friends with him. He accepts her offer to eat lunch at her home, and Misuzu\'s aunt and foster mother Haruko Kamio is later persuaded to let him stay for the time being. Later on, Yukito meets two other girls who go to Misuzu\'s school—sly, friendly Kano Kirishima and serene, quiet Minagi Tohno—who, like Misuzu, have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts. Any one of them could be the incarnation of this ""girl in the sky,"" and if the curse isn\'t broken, the girl in question could die.If you can believe it, this is technically the first anime produced by Kyoto Animation all by themselves, without the need for outsourcing, which is what they themselves were known for providing to other studios throughout the 80s and 90s. If there\'s one thing KyoAni is famous for, its for its attention to making movement as smooth, detailed, and life-like as possible. Say what you will about Itaru Hinoue\'s over-the-top cutesy moe character designs, with their comically big eyes and small mouths on large chins, KyoAni managed to not only have them transition to animation quite nicely, but really put in the effort to make them come alive with fantastic character movement. Everything from clothing, walking, and hair animation is given as much care and attention as humanly possible, and even in scenes that would normally be static, such as characters standing around talking, the animators still put in the work. It helps that even mundane conversations are made visually interesting with intimate camera angles, absolutely stunning backgrounds, and creative, cinematic storyboarding. Real talk, I never had any problem with Itaru Hinoue\'s character designs, and still don\'t to this day, because I\'ve seen way worse, and whether you like them or not, those designs at least made Air distinct and gave it a sense of identity. Personally, my only real issue is that the whites in the characters\' eyes look distractingly blurry, like someone used the photoshop brush tool on them, which, to be fair, KyoAni improved on when they would go on to make the anime for both Kanon and Clannad.Really, there isn\'t much to say about the soundtrack that hasn\'t been said already, so I\'ll be brief: Yes, it reuses music from the game, but all of it is great, and Tori no Uta is still one of the best anime openings ever, no cap. Before I even go into the characters, there is something I want to talk about: For as revered as the works by Key are even now, there are many who dismiss their stories and narratives as emotionally manipulative. On some level, I can understand where they\'re coming from, as most companies think having cute moe girls be sad is all they need to get people to cry and spend money. Hell, I have this view on Prima Doll, another Key property, which I feel tried way too hard to push being cutesy moe over making any logical sense and putting in the work to get you to care about the characters and story. Again, I haven\'t played the VN for Air yet, so I don\'t know how it handles its narrative and characterization, but personally, I don\'t think Air is emotionally manipulative because unlike most moe shows, it\'s very clear that the staff behind the anime respected the source material and put in the work to get you to care about the characters and their interpersonal conflicts, and any so-called ""moe"" qualities they have do have in-story explanations behind them rather than just being there for the sake of having them be uwu pwecious. For example, Misuzu\'s quirks—her clumsiness, acting younger than her age would suggest, and tendency to make cutesy dinosaur noises—are treated as weird and causes for concern rather than as endearing. Air takes great pains to flesh out its characters and develop them, making them feel like more than just squeaky-voiced moeblobs, even if their characterization still can\'t be considered three-dimensional compared to others down the line. Not every character gets this treatment though, and out of the three girls, Kano is the weakest one because her story is just there to give more info on the ""girl in the sky"" legend and make her into a red herring, that\'s it. Without going into spoilers, Misuzu\'s mother Haruko is the most complex, compelling, three-dimensional character in the whole cast, and Air did an amazing job at bringing this conflicted, hard-partying mom to life, especially in the finale. Even Yukito winds up having more to him than just being the snarky, disillusioned self-insert MC that Key is usually known for.As far as the narrative goes, Air as a series is surprisingly well paced, having a clear plan on how it wanted to tell its story, build up to its twists, and wasted absolutely no time in doing what it needed to do. Being that this is a short series based on a much longer visual novel, I\'m sure a lot of stuff wasn\'t adapted, and fans of the VN might consider it to be rushed as a result. I wouldn\'t say that\'s KyoAni\'s fault because they were only given 12 episodes to work with, and the staff made the most of what they had. However, much like the rest of Key\'s works, Air is a series that, while it does put in the work to have an overarching narrative that makes sense, a lot of the supernatural elements don\'t get a whole lot of explanations behind them and really require you to stretch your suspension of disbelief. I personally had no problem with how Air did it, as the series did try to tie everything together as much as it could, made as much use of its overarching themes as possible, and had it all work in the context of its narrative, but if you\'re someone who wants your stories to feel more complete and logical, you will find yourself disappointed. In my opinion, I think Air\'s story and how it tied everything together and made use of its cast of characters worked in its favor, allowing all of the drama it set up to actually feel earned rather than cheap and slapped together for the sake of easy emotional manipulation. I actually consider One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e to be fair more cheap in its drama and actually emotionally manipulative because unlike Air, One thought it could get by with just cutesy moeblobs, a stick thin storyline, and an MC who is a repugnant jackass and didn\'t bother putting in the work to make us care about any of it.Say what you will about Air as an anime, it did help put KyoAni on the map as a serious animation studio, and its success paved the way for the studio\'s explosive success in the late 2000s, resulting in many other anime people still love to this day. I liked Air when I first watched it as a kid, and I\'m surprised at how well it still holds up when I rewatched it as an adult. While I do enjoy the anime for Clannad a bit more, I still have a soft spot for Air, as it was one of the first anime I saw that showed me that anime could tell many more kinds of stories than just Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Digimon. Plus, now that I\'m older and know how to use an emulator on my computer, I found a way to actually play the visual novel now, so expect a review of that in the future! Though with the new advent of Kanon finally getting an official release in English in the near future, here\'s hoping Air gets that same treatment. Is Air sappy and melodramatic? Sure. You can either embrace it as a heartwrenching drama, or just dismiss it as moe fodder made to cater to the fetishes of lonely otaku. Whatever floats your boat, and everyone\'s mileage may vary for something like Air, or Key\'s entire portfolio in general. But to me, Air is a nicely crafted drama made by people that truly loved its source material, made the most of the short time it had, and managed to expand my horizons for what anime is capable of, and for that, while it\'s not one of my favorite anime of all time, as I like several shows better than it, Air will always a place in my heart. learn about the concept of licensing until later. I used to think anything that wasn\'t on TV was only in Japan until I learned that anime and their English dubs could only be watched on DVD, not on TV (Depending on the series). I enjoyed Air enough that I bought the DVDs (The movie included), though I did exchange them for a complete collection later. Air is an adaptation of one of Key\'s visual novels, and the anime was pretty well-liked when it first aired, though it would quickly get overshadowed years later by Clannad. While I do enjoy Clannad a little more, I still have a sentimental attachment to Air as a series, and rewatching it now, while some parts of it didn\'t age all that well, I still think it\'s a great show made by people who clearly loved the source material and did it justice.Traveling street performer Yukito Kunisaki arrives at a small seaside town called Kami, having traversed around Japan in continuation of his late mother\'s search for the ""girl in the sky"" who, according to a family legend, has been cursed to spend eternity all alone. Yukito\'s sole way of earning money is by performing a puppet show by moving a doll that has been passed down in his family with magic, but he fails to gain anyone\'s attention by doing so, and as a result, he\'s low on money. The next day, he meets Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy high school girl who is eager to become friends with him. He accepts her offer to eat lunch at her home, and Misuzu\'s aunt and foster mother Haruko Kamio is later persuaded to let him stay for the time being. Later on, Yukito meets two other girls who go to Misuzu\'s school—sly, friendly Kano Kirishima and serene, quiet Minagi Tohno—who, like Misuzu, have strange personalities connected with mysterious pasts. Any one of them could be the incarnation of this ""girl in the sky,"" and if the curse isn\'t broken, the girl in question could die.If you can believe it, this is technically the first anime produced by Kyoto Animation all by themselves, without the need for outsourcing, which is what they themselves were known for providing to other studios throughout the 80s and 90s. If there\'s one thing KyoAni is famous for, its for its attention to making movement as smooth, detailed, and life-like as possible.

Rather simply, it begins to establish the characters personalities, through their interactions, specially with the main character. There is some slightly odd feeling regarding these at first, although they are all quite \'likeable\', they are also exotic and unusual somehow.The background of three characters shall be dealt with, one by one. Basically, the concept of this series is to reveal that behind the seemingly vulgar town and its vulgar girls, there are many things to be exposed. It chooses to...do it through unexpected slices of fantasy, showing how tradition and curses somehow influence or are related to their problems in the present.Indeed, the strength but also the weakness of this series could lie in the way such parallels are established. Whilst some viewers might feel discouraged by the unexpected plot resolutions, and find its fantasy touch a bit ""off"", such intersection of fantasy and psichology, of old and modern ages is arguably well executed.But I will say this: even if you find yourself in total disbelief for this series, watch it to the end. You will change your mind. Air\'s two first subplots are but a teaser to where it truly stands out: the second half of the Anime deals with a third girl - Misuzu. In it, Air truly delivers with excellency a superb drama, that is as emotionally packed as few are, with some of the most heartfelt takes ever done in anime,  at Elfen Lied level (without the gore or brutality).If the first half were as good, Air would earn a perfect 10.

The Fudal Story Arc was, however, interesting and redeemed this anime a little but not enough to sit through the whole thing. If you ask me, skip to that, ignore the artwork (unless you like that style), and be satisfied because that's the best you're going to get out of it. "", ""I watched this because I pretty much fell in love with Clannad, and when you go from Clannad to a story such as this one, it's really hard to make a review without any bias opinions.Story - 5. I called the story mediocre because in my opinion, it was two different stories going at once, maybe Air attempted to put a connection between the two stories, but I certainly didn't see it.

They were funny and I liked the characters, the animation and colours were great too. About half way through the series they start to go more into the story and mystery they set up in the first half, and this is where the series started to fall apart for me. The answers to my questions were not interesting at all and at some points I was super confused as to why some things happened as well and that just frustrated me even more than I already was by how dull the series got after this point. The last half is...super cry bait that was way too fast for me. I love Anohana and that's the most cry-baity cry-bait series I've ever seen but at least that felt slow enough for me to actually care while this gave me a few episodes to get to know ALL of the characters then goes 100mph into their tragic backstory or whatever. There were times where it was very obvious that I was meant to care about side character A during their super sad moment of sadness but because they had few appearances in the first half and maybe a few bits of backstory I just did not care whatsoever. Even with the two MCs I didn't care because before they got to their super tragic sad depressing miserable story I had to sit through all of the crap episodes (basically everything from 7 onwards) so a lot of the steam I had was lost. super cry bait that was way too fast for me.

This has been exploited in the first half of the series, where he has been involved with the problematic lives of Kano Kirishima and Minagi Tohno. I must admit that these story arcs have been able to trigger some emotional reactions. However, they are not that outstanding, for the unfolding of events is mediocre at...best. The pacing is really slow that it comes to the point that almost literally nothing is happening to move the story to the right direction. There are too many random ordeals that don’t contribute to the overall story. It’s a good thing that the emotional sequences make up for this trait. The other good thing about these arcs is the fact that Minagi Tohno’s story arc doesn’t start abruptly. It has been established during Kano Kirishima’s story arc, so the transition has been smooth.This smooth storytelling doesn’t last long, however. In the second half of the series, the story takes an awkward turn. It suddenly diverts its attention to a medieval sequence that stretches for about two or three episodes. Sure, this is a significant part of the series, for it explains the back-story behind ‘the girl in the sky’. But I can’t help to see it as problematic because it starts too abruptly. Aside from that, it has also failed on effectively linking itself to the original story, but its attempts to do so is evident. This fact has turned the storytelling very rough and the plot very disorganized.After the medieval sequence, the story goes back to the modern day, as abruptly as how it diverts its attention from it. Like the first half of the series, this has been able to trigger subtle emotions. In fact, it has been more effective on doing so. However, it is far from perfect, and the major contributor to this is its failure to establish some plot points. Some plot points are so not established that they make the unfolding of events very confusing. In truth, the idea of ‘the girl in the sky’, the very idea that the whole story is paying homage to, is the most confusing plot point. Again, the medieval sequence is to be blamed for this.As for the characters of the series, they’re not very deep, but not bad either. The only problem I have with them is that some of them don’t have proper closure. They just disappear as if they didn’t even exist. In short, the characterization of this series is not very remarkable. However, the opening theme is not the same case. I don’t always include opening themes in my reviews, but Air’s is worth noting. Even though the video is of generic visual novel adaptation, its music is still so commendable that it is enough to make the opening theme worth praising.Overall, Air has some serious potential. The concepts it represents are very interesting, and the only problem is their execution. Perhaps if the series has been longer, it would have had the time to properly express its ideas. It’s just too bad that the series is so short that even some of the characters are left out just to make room for the major chunk of the overall story.For more anime reviews, character analyses, and first impressions, visit pageprophet.blogspot.com. best.
