Toradora! Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23701/Toradora_Recap,"[""This is a recap of the whole Toradora show and is not the same as the special episode Toradora!: Bentou no Gokui or the \tToradora!: SOS! shorts.I've only watched this without subs, and it seemed like a good recap episode even though I couldn't understand it. It was mostly clips from previous episodes and the ending was Kawashima's impressions from when she stayed at Taiga's house during the stalker arc.The unsubbed version is pretty hard to find since it only comes with the Toradora portable visual novel, and no fansub groups are planning on subbing this, so I doubt a subbed version will come out...soon. soon."", ""Also known as “Toradora! Portable”, is a recap episode exclusive to the PSP game of the same title, it goes in the same direction as any recap episode out there. The pacing, in general, was good, they covered only the important stuff and looked like they jumped through a lot of other non-mentioned thins, but as far as a recap goes, it felt like it told everything it needed to.Having not seen the parent show in a long time, this was definitely a refresher to the series although it didn't cover up the very last portion of the show and stopped somewhere at the Chrismas.The...only issue with this is the lack of English subs if there are any at all. only issue with this is the lack of English subs if there are any at all.""]"
Tennis no Oujisama: Atobe kara no Okurimono - Kimi ni Sasageru Tennis Prince Matsuri,https://myanimelist.net/anime/814/Tennis_no_Oujisama__Atobe_kara_no_Okurimono_-_Kimi_ni_Sasageru_Tennis_Prince_Matsuri,"[""___________________________________________ Review the 2ndChihuahua Review(short&amp;sweet): A fun, continuation extra to the Prince of Tennis. If you like the original series non-chibi fillers you'll probably like this.------------------------------&gt;In Depth Review:&lt;------------------------STORY: This is a huge bonanza with every single character from the original series participating. Here Atobe of Hyotei Gakuen hosts a celebration to express his deep gratitude to a certain friend. During this time a variety of games are played including a dating game&gt;_&lt; and a relay. Story not really, but entertainment is there.ART: Art was well done again the characters looked vibrant and the animation quality is still improving. But still it wasn't really as...great without the high quality tennis scene. So in my opinion quality was passable for an extra episode.SOUND: There wasn't an opening so i can't judge it. The ED though was one of my favorite of the series as it created some nice closure to the episode and had a really fun beat to it.CHARACTER: All the chracters were here. Obviously no character developement unless u count Atobe's sudden good will. Even without the character developement its nice to see ALL of the characters that werent shown for a while. My favorite reunion was the lame joke guy who made the wackest japanese puns ever and then doing his little blow laugh psshXD. Seigaku fans however may feel a little unsatisfied with the regulars small but hilarious appearances.ENJOIMENT: As a filler this definately isn't my favorite but like i said earlier it is fun to see  all the characters in various events. Only one episode so no reason to not just watch it. ^_^OVERALL: Not really a story but with some decent sound and art it doesn't really matter. No developement, character wise but with all the fun who really cares.Recommendation: If you liked the original series watch this for sure. And if you liked this watch the National Tournament ^_^ for more tennis antics.If you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discss it. Always fun. @_@WoofWoof great without the high quality tennis scene. So in my opinion quality was passable for an extra episode.SOUND: There wasn't an opening so i can't judge it.

Toradora!: Bentou no Gokui,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11553/Toradora__Bentou_no_Gokui,"[""-May contain spoilers-Ahhhhh, Toradora! One of the animes that really made an impact on me, and after two years they released an OVA! You may be expecting some after story where Taiga could be pregnant (kinda hard for me to imagine though XD), she and Ryuuji are living in an apartment together or maybe even have kids! But much disappointment to a lot of people, it ain't. It's just another story of their everyday lives which could fit in perfectly if they placed this episode in the series. Some people could've gotten angry even. But I believe that this is a smart decision, to release...a normal story than an after story one. There is that risk of instead of loving Toradora! more, the OVA could've shown an ending that we would not want because I believe the ending in the anime is already perfect as it is. So they released an OVA on a normal school story of their lives but still very enjoyable nonetheless.Story: 9So the story is about Ryuuji feeling at loss because Yuusaku's grandmother is beating him when it comes to making ben-tos. And so he tries to make better and better ben-tos but forgetting on why do you make ben-tos in the first place and who you make for it.The story is fairly simple but still funny and comical.Art: 8~I don't really see and improvement in the art but still a relief to see the same old Toradora! style. Oh and I gotta mention the Taiga moe scenes are just...... HNGGGGGGGGGGGGSound: 9~Ahhhhh, I had goosebumps when I heard the OP and ED, brings back so much memories ^^ I was not sure but I think the ED had some added content.Character: 7~For some reason some characters didn't feel the way they're suppose to feel in the manga and anime. It really wasn't that noticeable but they still had a very similar feel and it was still fun and enjoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 10~I'm pretty sure whatever kind of story they show us here, I'm still going to enjoy it because of the feeling of nostalgia of seeing the characters once more in their comic acts. And it was also fun seeing Ryuuji and Taiga once more developing romance and Minori hiding her true feelings at a certain part :3Overall: 9~It was fun watching it is all I could say ^^  and it is obviously worth watching, especially to die-hard Toradora! fans :)*My first review btw* a normal story than an after story one.

When I did some research and learned that special had just come out only two months prior. Excited, and since the original anime was so darn good, I quickly watched it, thinking it was going to be, at the very least, AWESOME. However, it turned out to be much more disappointing than I originally had anticipated. In fact, it made me almost cry - not with tears of sympathy or sadness or humor, but just plain BORING.Story: 7/10Presumedly taking place a couple weeks after Toradora! ended, it started off logically but fell flat on its face in the first...5 minutes. Not that I didn\'t enjoy it, but the fact that I knew this was going to be ""one of those specials."" Moe-blob, circular plot sort of thing, where the storyline isn\'t advanced and everyone remains static. Poo. I was really expecting some sort of plot twist or SOMETHING to keep me glued to the screen, but it just wasn\'t good storytelling. I think they went sort of over the top with comedy as well; the producers seemed to focus mainly on the natural humor and personalities of the characters to create simply a side episode. This was accomplished - halfway. I laughed, oh yes I laughed, but the slap-stick humor really confused me: was this the Toradora! that I had loved only one episode ago?The background is simple: a couple days (maybe a couple weeks) after Toradora! ended, Ryujji Takasu and Tenori Taiga are back again with Kitamaru, Ami, Minorin, and the rest of class 2-C. The whole episode focuses on one thing (the title of the episode): lunch. Bento boxes, to be precise. The lesson at the end made sense, but this was pretty much lame. Compared to the rugged sort of interactions the characters had in the original anime, this specials really let me down in terms of things like a deeper meaning, or worse: no storyline.Art: 9/10I\'ll stand my ground on the art; like I said with the original Toradora!, the wonderful facial expressions are back! I love their realistic portrayal of anger or sorrow and especially embarrassment. The art was what made this so good in the first place: Takasu\'s scary face along with Taiga\'s small stature really made such a great juxtaposition, and continued while viewing this episode. The environment was crisp and clean, the colors bright and cheerful, never skipping a beat on the animation. So yes, the art deserved this great score.Sound: 8/10I rated the sound decently high because I always loved the OP and ED; both are on my Ipod and have at least 10 plays already. Great songs; but, again, what irked me a little was the fact that there was almost no background music. I love, even a little, background sound to let the story flow better and to sort of pave the way for the next scene. Again, like the anime, it lacked background sound; but no matter, because what made up for it was, again, the voice acting. I love me some good actors; especially when they make the characters sound so real. You could tell their feelings just by listening to the tone of the voice; no small feat. If you don\'t believe me, try saying something happy followed by something depressingly sad; can\'t do it with emotion, can you? Exactly.Character: 7/10Why so low of a character score? BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DEVELOPMENT. Static characters always incite my deepest anger; what makes a story good are the CHARACTERS. You can have the CRAPPIEST animation ever with the worse music in the history of nails-on-chalkboard, but if the characters are half-decent, so is the overall show! The only reason we know the characters is from the original anime; if this was a whole OVA or something on its own, I\'d give it a 4. There\'s no development, no internal conflict, just silly moe-blob the entire time. Takasu stays almost exactly the same (though they do show a personality quirk of his the entire time). Taiga acts a little less tsundere, though not by much. Ami hardly appears, Minorin is there for very little time, and Kitamaru says barely anything. Then again, this is simply a ""special"" and I shouldn\'t berate it so hard, especially since this isn\'t part of the main series; however, I was more than disappointed with the work they put into this...Overall, I WAS entertained; though I may have said some harsh insults, overall it wasn\'t that bad. It just needs some polish (and a whole plot-rewrite) to be better. The only reason I didn\'t give this below a 6 was because I knew the background from the original series; if it wasn\'t for that, like I said, I wouldn\'t even be writing this review. I loved the comedy; the producers worked so hard on it, I thought I would at least acknowledge it. Wonderful laughs all around. However, I was also disappointed, so don\'t expect too much. Whatever; a good bento is a good bento. 5 minutes. Not that I didn\'t enjoy it, but the fact that I knew this was going to be ""one of those specials.""

So my rating:Story: Good 7.Ok, so the OVA is all about Ryuuji who is having some insecurities of losing out to Yuusaku\'s grandmother who happens to make a good bento meal for the latter, so he does all the unnecessary things that he can to beat his best friend\'s grandmom\'s cooking, which overall...it is the comic part of this OVA that makes it to  have such rating.Art and sound: Mediocre 5.No need for me to say on this parts.Character: Mediocre 5.I did mention that the original cast of this OVA are still here.Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.I not gonna elaborate anymore, all I can say is that this OVA is worth watching and one has to think of it as a long awaited episode that is finally been aired. it is the comic part of this OVA that makes it to  have such rating.Art and sound: Mediocre 5.No need for me to say on this parts.Character: Mediocre 5.I did mention that the original cast of this OVA are still here.Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.I not gonna elaborate anymore, all I can say is that this OVA is worth watching and one has to think of it as a long awaited episode that is finally been aired.', ""The triple cast is back with Taiga, Amy, and Minori! or should I say Kugimiya Rie,  Horie Yui, and Kitamura Eri!Unfortunately, this show was mostly all about Takasu, Ryuuji's ego of trying to surpass a certain someone as a housewife.

If you weren't a fan of Toradora! to begin with this probably isn't worth watching.Review in full: Toradora!: Bentou no Gokui is a zany one-off episode that focuses on Ryuuji early in the series. It shows a deterministic side of him that doesn't come up too often in the main series and gives the viewer a better idea of who he is and what drives him. However the plot feels a tad forced in...that Ryuuji would have to be triggered pretty hard to push the episode's main dilemma like he does if we're going by what the main show told us. Within the main show he typically doesn't become competitive for its own sake, but here that's about all that can be drawn from the situation.The way the main joke repeats itself doesn't make it as funny as the comedy in the main show either. In fact I can't recall any episode in the main show that recycled a joke as its main premise throughout its duration. It also doesn't help that most of Toradora! relied on and was seemingly built for story arcs that lasted 2-3 episodes. Perhaps this story could have been better if it had more room to develop. While the many characters present are generally themselves and the conclusion to the episode is nice, the episode as a whole just feels off-kilter.Lastly, Bentou no Gokui's general production quality is simply good enough for what it sets out to do.  The visual style is no different than Toradora! ever was, but there aren't any moments where particularly interesting camera angles or special animation changes are used like they were in the main show.  At least the sakura scene was nice.  Meanwhile the voice acting is just as lively & expressive as ever, but the episode sounds somewhat empty as far as music & SFX are concerned.  Of course both are entirely reused from the main show, it's just applied more sparsely than before, which is not to Bentou no Gokui's benefit.Verdict: It's a good thing they decided to skip out on this story in the main series as doesn't fit very well with the rest of it and would have thrown off the show that Ryuuji would have to be triggered pretty hard to push the episode's main dilemma like he does if we're going by what the main show told us.

When Kitamura's Grandmother prepares a big bentou for him. Ryuuji starts a competion by himself to prove that he can prepare a great bentou better than Katamura's Grandmother. It is a funny story that if you had a chance to watch it. I really recommend. "", ""Bentou no Gokui (literally Bento Battle) is an unaired episode of Toradora. It’s mostly a fluff episode; Kitamura brings an extravagant bento box made by his grandmother. Seeing this ludicrously lavish lunch makes Ryuuji feel inferior, so he retaliates by trying to best Kitamura’s grandmother’s cooking.I watched Toradora on via its Blu-Ray, so I naturally watched Bentou no Gokui after I had finished the series proper.And let me tell you, don’t skip out on Bentou no Gokui despite it being an OVA with little-to-no bearing on the plot. It's good stuff. It’s actually better than the series as a whole.Okay, okay, hear me out before...scrolling away. If you read my review, you’ll know that my biggest gripe from the series came from the beginning. Without this difference in quality to bog my perception of it down,  Bentou no Gokui is optimal Toradora!Honestly, it’s the perfect episode of the “comedy” side of the romantic-comedy Toradora! The animation and facial expressions helped convey the comedy and the absurdity of Ryuuji’s “rivalry” was a riot. I consistently laughed throughout the episode. I can’t recall any other episode of Toradora! that had this effect on me. For this reason, I consider it the funniest episode in the show. Despite this focus on comedy, it’s still sweet, too. The romance is wonderfully apparent and it made me feel warm inside. Bentou no Gokui was the perfect blend of comedy and romance. While it wasn’t the most romantic episode, it’s romantic enough to be good. The episode, tonally, could fit well in the middle of the series, prior to the School Festival Arc.The music was superb as always.The perfect OVA if you’re a fan of Toradora! and can’t get enough. Honestly, I think it’s pretty good for newcomers as well. I didn’t see anything too spoiler-y, and it’s honestly a better exposure to the series than the first episode is, in some ways.85/100B scrolling away.

Ryuuji is one of the male leads well the legit male lead and he is a pretty nice guy a person who loves cleaning and just doing household stuff well but all in all a pretty nice and just cool character. Yuusaku is the last male lead and well he is the vice president of the school honestly he is a pretty chill and pretty nice person nothing else really to say about him honestly. Ami is another female lead and well shes a model and well she kinda has a bratty attitude and also she puts on a act that she is pretty much nice and sweet. Minori is the last female lead of the anime and she is well she is like bat crazy but in a good way but also she does tend to dodge stuff a lot like many of the characters but honestly shes another good character. (just coping and pasting this from my review of Toradora sense the basically act the same here as well.)Enjoyment: Things that i liked: the character all return here so there's that also the comedy is really well done here as well as i laughed a good number of times from the OVA and also that it is pretty enjoyable. Things that i didn't like: cant honestly say that i didn't like anything from this honestly it was a really good OVA.Overall: giving this OVA a 8 its a really good watch cause the comedy is really well done and also that all the characters return for the OVA it worth the watch for sure. anime so the backgrounds and the characters look good as well here.Sound: the first OP and ED are here don't care much for the op but i love the ED i watched the dub for this and everyone's returns for it but everyone sounded good.Character:  Taiga is one of the females lead and she can be a bit of a bad attitude and also she is known as the Plamtop tiger as i said she goes have a feisty side to her but also a good side to her as well.

Things that i didn't like: cant honestly say that i didn't like anything from this honestly it was a really good OVA.Overall: giving this OVA a 8 its a really good watch cause the comedy is really well done and also that all the characters return for the OVA it worth the watch for sure."", 'You surely came here after wacthing Toradora because you needed more of this masterpiece story. And I have to say, this is actually enjoyable.It´s like a chill episode where evryone relaxes (well, not Ryuuji) by cooking and eating. It´s a basic but still reliable idea to add another chapter and make everyone remember those great characters that made us laugh and cry all over the other 25 chapters.The best part of the episode? Inko shouting ""Inzaghi"" while he pretends to kick a football and score a goal. Holy crap, what a great character.If you haven´t watch it, I definitivelly recommend it.

I miss the characters and couldn't accept it was over.Somehow I found this special episode.I was hoping for a bit more Ryuuji and Taiga action, but it was more just food food food... Its alright though. The episode doesn't bore you and I mean, we all want more Toradora so this couldn't hurt. 7/10 from me.Probably gonna rewatch the show soon though, I feel kind of empty inside...The reason the episode doesn't bore you is probably because we...all love the characters in Toradora, I mean... we hated Ami-chan and now we like her kind of for some reason... And they always, in every episode are a good addition!SO ye 26 minutes of straight up Ryuuji making bentos sounds boring...But it was really enjoyable with the other characters!(The ending was wholesome and made me crave for more Toradora even though there is no more, so that's good and sad for me.) all love the characters in Toradora, I mean... we hated Ami-chan and now we like her kind of for some reason...

Yaoguai Mingdan 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36160/Yaoguai_Mingdan_2nd_Season,"[""The purpose of this review will be to hopefully shed some light on how great this Chinese cartoon really is, therefore this review will contain both seasons of Monster List.Just finished watching the second season and I cannot believe the negative bias surrounding this anime, judging from first season's reviews. With a rating of only 6.73 of first season(7.13 of second) as of writing this review, this anime is criminally underrated. With any luck, that will change for the better.Story's unique, very fluid and gets gradually more elaborate, as shows moves on, especially in second season! Characters are very vibrant, cheerful, goofy and easy to...separate one from another, just as you would expect from such a series, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. It's just so easy to get into, and to digest it, again very fluid, amusing. The atmosphere is very lighthearted and colorful, though it gets sad at times, which provides viewer with heartfelt feelings of joy and sadness. Nothing feels insincere, artificial or cringy, which is a big plus in my book. The series exceptionally show great promise when it ended in such a fashion that it makes you crave for more.Only real downside, which I personally had absolutely no problem with, would be the obviously inferior voice acting, it sounds much less impactful comparing to an anime with Japanese voice actors. This is a Chinese anime, after all, and debatably, artwork feels more of a mediocre quality rather than what standard modern Japanese anime artwork looks like, though, again, in my opinion looks just fine, not 'mediocre'.Openings and endings of the show are very enjoyable, even more so the second season. Both seasons have episodes slightly shorter than your usual 20 min run-time, so you can pass through the seasons quicker than you may anticipate.I'm very eagerly anticipating third season, for more joyful moments and crazy adventures of our cast. separate one from another, just as you would expect from such a series, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.

The first arc eps 1-4 is a small arc with Feng Xi joining the Taoist sect, Guo Shuang, Su Jiuer, and Yan Chaoxue (Senior) teaching him how to use magic, and their first mission where they take on a Cafeteria demon. This arc was kinda bad.The second arc, eps 5-15 is a major arc beginning the story of a virtual demon girl born in cyberspace. A virtual girl that is everyone’s idol but is draining the life out of her fans. Her fanbase deeply in love with her cheers...her on and that soon causes trouble when people drained of their vitality still continues to cheer for her until they start losing their consciousness and are in danger of dying. I think this arc was too long and dragged, but it was interesting to see a demon girl that has inadvertently gathered too much power who almost couldn’t be stopped, with even Shen Lei the Eye Yin falling to her mesmerization and his strong subordinates losing to her. Yan Chaoxue brings an aggressive blade to battle, but Feng Xi who is the Eye Yang, can he see his way through this fight? The resolution of this arc was good.Episode 16 is a Special with interviews from seiyuus and staffThe third arc, eps 17-21 the last 5 episodes had a good emotional punch and was touching and moving. In this arc, you will finally understand Long San Yuan, who is the doctor in Feng Xi’s school her story with Feng Xi. When Long San Yuan was a child as the Dragon Princess, she also met Feng Xi in another past life of his Ah Feng who was also still just a child. Ah Feng had a promise with Long San Yuan. When she grow up, he will marry her, but as you know dragons age slowly, while humans age at a much faster speed. In Ah Feng’s lifetime, he did all he could so he could still keep that promise to Long San Yuan, but it was really sad. To the present, where Long San Yuan has grown up, you can see just how long she has been waiting for Feng Xi to reincarnate.

This was my favorite arc in season 2.', 'I would agree to the people that says, ""this anime is underrated"". This is because, as a general anime fan, Chinese anime had been many steps behind Japanese anime however, I would say that this anime is one baby step behind Japanese anime.I\'m sure many people have anime that they really enjoyed and wished for another season, it is the same with this anime. It is an anime that you don\'t want to end and can pretty much be enjoyed when binge watching because the arcs require a lot of attention however, the increased attention allows you to, practically, fall in love with the...anime just like I did (Not weird at all).Therefore, I would honestly say that this anime is one of the greatest fantasy, superpower harems I\'ve ever watched.BTW, This review is for both S1 and S2By the time I wrote this, it seems like the ratings of the anime has heightened reaching 7.16 (S1) and 8.04 (S2) anime just like I did (Not weird at all).Therefore, I would honestly say that this anime is one of the greatest fantasy, superpower harems I\'ve ever watched.BTW, This review is for both S1 and S2By the time I wrote this, it seems like the ratings of the anime has heightened reaching 7.16 (S1) and 8.04 (S2)', ""I bet only because its in chinese its didn't got much attention.this series has 20 ep this season.and another 18 from first season.yes the first season is meh.it has bad animation.less interesting plot.but season2 is a masterpiece....the only problem i got with this sereis.was the fact that each episode without the ed and opening.are about 10 minutes its just not enough.for the same reason.those 10 minutes are top polished.they are flawless.the story is superb and unqiue.the art is also really good in season 2.the sound?well surprise! the chinese isnt really that bad!it's quite nice language can be fast at times.but the female voices are wow! srsly.the ED was amazing.the OP was also amazing...

I began reading the manhwa when it was just about the arc of fengxi began training after he discover himself as the yang eye.looking at the thumnails of the episodes of this season, i got happy, a little excited and also kinda sad. cause i already know what will happen.it is so good, the graphics is so pretty!!for a chinese products, many will compare it to japanese anime. and many will say that japanese's anime is superior than chineese's, well i think...they were wrong. This donghua prove it, the adaption is so good. of course me too noticing about the fps rate of the animation is not that many, but it doesnt mean that the graphics (art) animation became inferior. For me, this kind of story telling have decent presentation in it's own way. The lacks of frame key arts compensated with dynamics vfx lights. The sea, the skies, the ponds, the fires, the tears, the snows, the mountains, the fireflies, the sparkle of cyberspaces, weapon effects, attack effects, etc.. Even for the comedic scenes they splendidly draw the characters with all the limbs (i am alittle bit disapointed because it is not the stickman, but also glad they made it better). All great.I dont have chineese descendances in my blood, so i naturally cant speak chineese. and i found it hard to learn about it. They speak too fast and so many latter in the sentence and it is hard to know what words is what. i t's a little hard to follow watching while reading the english subtitles. but the musics is good, i enjoy the music even though i dont quite get what the lyrics are. the bg musics in this donghua is fresh, i never heard any of this before watching the anime (either it is because the bg musics really exclusively composed for this donghua, or it is just beacause i never heard them before because i am far away from chineese culture).the character potray is so good, giving better improvement than what already presented from the manhwa. in the donghua we can get the emotional feelings of the characters. gao shuang, ling ling, sujiu, even shine the mosts long san yuan's. we got to see all of their emotions and feeling conveyed by their words and facial mimics and body language.I really really really enjoy this donghua. I hope they will made another continuation, at least a movie specials or some main arcs donghua adaptations.wish i could lived till i witness this series got it's Ending. they were wrong.

The production quality and cringe of the first season made it almost unwatchable for me despite my love for the manhua (source). However the changes made to season 2 changed my entire outlook of this adaptation. Having worked on the manhua of this as a translator, I am very happy to see how the second season did this work justice and brought this work to life.Plot Summary: Due to breaking the seal on him twice, Feng Xi, the MC, has been outed as...the legendary Yang Eye. In order to fulfill his responsibilities as the Yang Eye and to protect himself, he starts to study under the daoists to learn how to use his powers. As he dives deeper into his past and powers, he starts to learn of a greater number of past lives, his ties with allies, and the goal he has pursued across reincarnations.PlotThe story in this season can be divided into 2 chapters (yes 2 chapters, not arcs). The first chapter, EP1-15, directly follows S1 (even teased at the end), where we follow the MC, Feng Xi, as he starts his training and learns about taoist techniques, about the taoists\' mission in the current world, his own past, and takes part in a taoist operation to keep the peace between monsters and humans. The chapter has some of the typical cringe harem/romance comedy from season 1 (and it is from the manhua), but for the most part, it very thoroughly builds up how the world works and the relationship between the monsters and humans. Most of it is presented through the eyes of Feng Xi, a newcomer to this ""world of monsters"", and a newly born AI monster. This allows the show to provide a crash course for more exposition into the world without feeling forced. A job well done in executing this.Note: Episode 16 is a sneak peak at Part 2 and an interview episode with contributors to the donghua.The second chapter, EP17-21, is about Long SanYuan\'s past with a past life MC. This chapter, totaling 5 episodes, is disconnected from the other because it jumps directly to this flashback. The transition into it from the manhua has been removed, but since the previous chapter concluded and this flashback can be viewed in its own, it isn\'t too bad; just consider it like another season. This provides a very emotional story about the pains of long-lived species romance with a short-lived one. I think this portion is also done quite well.CharactersMost of the characters important to the story had shown up by the last episode of the previous season, though some barely got a cameo. There isn\'t much more to say about the totality of the characters in season 2, though Feng Xi, our MC, does get some better development moving me away from a stock harem MC, making him more unique. All the other characters get screen time and we get a more in-depth look and backstory of all the other important characters as well.AnimationThe character designs are still have the same style as Season 1, though asthetic now matches the manhua more than before, ditching stylistic choices like the large eyes. The character design/models are more proportional and the animation is more fluid and natural (though it can still be a bit stiff at times). The quality of the rendering is better (it is less pixelly and more crisp). Overall, much better quality than Season 1.SoundThe sound work in this season is done light-years better than the previous one. Almost all the problems from the last season have been addressed. The voice-acting is more human, natural, and conveys emotion through intonation. The volume of the BG now meshs well, unlike before. The OP and EDs are still good. The only complaint regarding their work on sound this season is their attempt at spatial sound; when the character is ""furthur away"" they make their voices softer, which sometimes makes it hard to hear because of the constantly changing volume. Other than this, they did a much better job is syncing all the sounds together.Final ThoughtsMy only reaction after watching this is: wow. Because of the disappointing production quality in the first season, I thought this season would also be a drag. However, they suprisingly fixed almost all the issues I had with the first season. The designs of the characters have been improved, the sound production quality has been vastly improved, the animation is much more fluid. The plot and characters have also gotten better, though that mostly has to do with the script. If you liked the first season (or like the story from the manhua), this season is a highly recommended watch. Otherwise, I would still recommend this if you enjoy stories within this genre.Score: 6/10Adaptation Review (may contain spoilers of the manhua):First, this Season adapts chapters 75-152 (Part 1:EP1-15) and 188-200 & 279-281 (Part 2:EP17-21). EP16 is a sneak peak at Part2 and mainly an interview special.Wow, just wow. I didn\'t think it was possible to be this faithful to the source material. This season\'s adaptation is basically animated panel for panel what was in the manhua; in fact, in the S2 EP1 recap, they even did a soft-retcon of one of the ""biggest"" changes to the first season (where Su Jiu\'er took out the internal alchemy of the tree demon vs her destruction of it in S1 EP6). In addition to the soft-recton, there was just one little scene added in about Feng Xi being a ""bad kid"" growing up, but that\'s all. In the previous season, I suggested simply reading the manhua for a better experience. For this season though, I think I would recommend the donghua, though I still suggest reading the manhua.There is a disconnect between the two chapters since they skipped straight to the Long SanYuan flashback without the portion in between, as indicated by the chapters that I listed that they had adapted. They essentially skipped over chapters 153-187 which originally provided a transition to the recall. For this adaptation, what they decided to do was to tell the story of a specific life, combining two different recalls (one for Long SanYuan and one for Su Jiu\'er) into a single flashback story. Because of this combination, they changed now the flashback was narrated, added/changed some details, and tried to make it a stand-alone story. In the manhua, because of the events that led up to the recall, it was understood that this was Long SanYuan\'s flashback on her life with the MC. The adaptation, however, made it a combination of two flashbacks, therefore they had to make specific parts specifically narrated by Long SanYuan, while including Su Jiu\'er\'s parts, thus weakening the impact that this flashback should have had. Su Jiu\'er also seems very childish; the progression of time, a significant part of the sadness, is also not as noticable because of the combination as well. The timeline for the two was originally counted by how long each knew the MC in this life, and because the difference in time lengths, they eliminated this part of the narration. The final change was they added a tiny segment of him being accepted as a disciple by a daoist and his senior disciple scenes. Overall, while this part of the adaptation envokes the proper emotions, they don\'t hit as hard because of the lack of full context for the flashback. In the end, it is simply a standalone chapter flashing back to one of the MC\'s previous lives with the girls.Last but not least, I really hate how the Part 2 OP teases scenes from the skipped chapters 153-187.Adaptation score for EP1-15: 9.8/10Adaptation score for EP17-21: 8/10 the legendary Yang Eye.

Lastly, I am a huge fan of the series, but I\'ve never read the manga.""To Love-Ru Darkness 2nd"" is just as entertaining as its prequels (To Love-Ru, Motto To Love-Ru, and the first...season of To Love-Ru Darkness); in fact, the disparity between this and its prequels are, in my opinion, little to none. Unfortunately, this implies that many of its infamous flaws are also present in this second season. In this review, I will explore this season\'s strengths and weaknesses.Story: 5To Love-Ru, as a series, has a weak story. After 70+ episodes, there is little character and plot development; for example, much of the content in each episode (addressing the entire series) is Rito stumbling or slipping while female characters are conveniently nearby which results in a perverted scene. He is then chased or lectured, but ultimately forgiven. This exact scene repeats many times throughout this season. I, however, personally enjoy them and laugh occasionally because the show is self-aware that these scenes would only occur so frequently in a fictitious world.As for character development, if you\'re here to watch Rito and Lala grow romantically closer, you\'ll likely be disappointed; there is one scene, but they simply end up reaffirming those same feelings that they had at the conclusion of Motto To Love-Ru. Additionally, more girls are added to the Harem Plan; furthermore, the characters who, originally, never knew about the plan provide their views on the subject. It\'s interesting to see different perspectives because some conflict with Momo\'s beliefs, although I had hoped that they would further elaborate on their reasoning. Still, it\'s exciting to see that the Harem Plan may not be as perfect as Momo makes it out to be. Interestingly, in this season, there is an antagonist (and I don\'t mean random fodder alien assassins) with a goal (not minor transgressions like kidnapping). I was also pleased that the show didn\'t feel episodic; there was continuity unlike To Love-Ru and Motto To Love-Ru.And although it may appear that I dislike the story, I think the lack of progression is justified in some ways. For example, in To Love-Ru\'s universe, only two years or so (maybe less) have passed since the first episode. I don\'t know if two years is enough for someone like Rito to suddenly devote himself to over fifteen girls. He\'s sixteen; marriage, falling in love, and managing the entire universe are things that most teenagers would never think too deeply about at that age. Moreover, Rito is portrayed as an average male student; his only unqiue trait (that is emphasized) is his kindness and reliability when you really need him. So in many ways, I understand why he feels unsure about these things, especially the Harem Plan. The plot makes this clear several times that polygamy is not allowed on Earth; this implies that, for about 14 years, he has been raised with the idea that marriage is between a man and a woman. Maybe he hasn\'t thought about it until he was 7 or 8, but to ask someone to suddenly change their life values and beliefs in just two years seems improbable. As for character development, I think it\'s rather realistic that Rito\'s personality hasn\'t radically changed. I never expected him to suddenly become a whole new person in merely two years. And yes, several times, Mikan does mention that Rito has changed ever since the arrival of Lala and friends, but it\'s likely nothing serious as he is still shown to have those same mixed feelings (from the very first season) about marriage, love, politics, and the Harem Plan.This is simply my opinion, and I just thought some of these things were worth thinking about.My final note: If you don\'t like the theme of friendship, you may not like this season.Art: 9Compared to the very first season of To Love-Ru, the art has significantly improved (I\'m sure many of you reading this know that already). Nevertheless, I don\'t know much about art; however, to me, the art looks colorful, vivid, and vibrant. I do prefer season 1\'s art (Darkness Season 1), but Rito\'s, Yami\'s, Momo\'s, Lala\'s, and Mea\'s faces are drawn really well this season. (I am in love with everyone\'s eyes!) Also it\'s interesting to note that the art is so stunning that when you see even a slight drop in quality, it\'s rather noticeable. Usually, I have to look for these, but I saw quite a few here -- especially when you\'re viewing the characters from a far distance (which is understandable). Nevertheless, I was bothered by how bright everyone looked as well.Another example of good art, I think, is the ending. The planets, Yami, and the flowers are all quite artistic.Sound: 9I know I compare a lot, and unfortunately, I\'m doing it here again. I only give the sound a 9 because I really enjoyed listening to Rakuen Project by Ray. Secret Arms is fine; I never skipped the opening if that means anything. Conversely, the ending, in this season, is far better. Kawada\'s Garden is amazing; if you have some extra time, I recommend listening to the full version as well. The background music, however, wasn\'t memorable.Characters: 7Rito: As I mentioned before, in the story section, I think Rito is growing/maturing, but it appears to be a subtle growth. That said, if you watch the specials (episode 13 and 14 which conclude the season), Rito does something quite surprising and out of character (not because he\'s drunk or anything like that; it\'s intentional). I wouldn\'t call it a serious change, but I like the pace of his growth; it might appear too slow for some, but I think it\'s fine. One of my biggest issues with the character, however, is his passive personality.Lala: Learns something new from Momo, and there is one other minor thing with Rito, but saying anything more will ruin it. That\'s about it.Haruna, Kotegawa, : Both characters remain static throughout this season, unfortunately.Yami, Nana, and Mea: These three characters are the highlights of this season. If you like any one of them, you\'re in luck. The theme is friendship. That\'s all I\'ll say. And if you didn\'t like any of these characters before, you might like them now. You learn quite a bit about each of these characters, and I ultimately felt that they were no longer just one-dimensional characters.Murasame Shizu: Even she sort of gets her own episode. Again, the theme is friendship.Rin: There is more revealed about her character as well.Mikan: Keep on eye out for her. She has some great moments this season.Momo: I believe Momo is a character that does not need to change (personality wise). Her presence in the story is what drives a lot of these character actions in the second season. If you liked Momo in Darkness season 1, I think you\'ll appreciate her role here as well. Her alluring mischievous personality is always fun to watch.Overall, I think it\'s fine that a lot of these characters are still the same after all these years; at least they\'re consistent. But until something a little more significant happens to Rito, Lala, and friends, all I can say is that the characters, this season, were good.Enjoyment: 10As I\'ve said before, I\'m a huge fan (Momo and Yami fan) of the series, so much that I ended up watching the first four uncensored episodes and finished the rest of it (along with the specials) in one sitting. Originally, I had planned on waiting until all 14 episodes were available uncensored, but I simply couldn\'t wait; in fact, I plan on re-watching those 10 episodes again once it\'s released on Blu-Ray.Overall: 10To Love-Ru is an anime that truly tests the limits of the ecchi genre; it is the epitome of a borderline hentai. For this reason, you really have to love the characters to continue loving this show. I know I didn\'t say much, but if you\'ve seen the first season (which I assumed you have) you already know exactly how these characters are. In lieu of a summary, I thought it might be best to tell you what season two has to offer. Honestly, had I not enjoyed the show as much as I did, I\'d give this season a 6.5/10.Anyways, I suggest giving at least the first uncensored episode a try!Thanks for reading. season of To Love-Ru Darkness); in fact, the disparity between this and its prequels are, in my opinion, little to none.

The girls won at least two episodes prominent with Rito, showing why they like him and each showing a different way of acting.It is impossible not to like the girls, they do not have the same mode of operation as in ""certain anime"" that all girls like the protagonist and are rubbing it, they show...that like the Rito of different and indirectly.Despite being a ecchi he can have a good story without disturbing anything, showing the history and how each girl feel about Rito. Many people criticized for not having the same story of the first season, talking about marriage, but the story of Darkness has its purpose and is essential to the history of marriage continue to succeed .If you watched the first two seasons do not waste time and watch this that has the design better and best voices for sure you will see the anime otherwise and you will love it (or else love Momo as all hahaha.) that like the Rito of different and indirectly.Despite being a ecchi he can have a good story without disturbing anything, showing the history and how each girl feel about Rito.

It has literally been seven years since the original To Love-Ru, and despite the original characters much of the show has changed greatly. What began as a show dedicated to a love triangle between Rito, Haruna, and Lala has now grown to an outright harem large enough to match any competing series out there. The show has increasingly had to rely on blatant ecchi to match the competition to the point where this is essentially soft-core hentai. Moreover, the...original heroines Lala and Haruna feel all but sidelined as the focus shifts towards Momo, Nana, and a new generation of harem members. Nonetheless, the show retains semblances of its roots, be it ridiculous inventions by Lala or Haruna\'s inability to confess her feelings. If harem-based ecchi comedies are up your alley, this is a pretty easy recommendation. If you\'ve followed the show up to this point, this is probably one of the better seasons so I wouldn\'t miss out. That being said, the ecchi is so in-your-face that god rays often cover the entire screen, leaving you clueless as to what ecchi act Rito is actually committing; if the ecchi part is what you\'re looking for definitely wait for the Blu-rays.Animation:The show retains its overall feel from Darkness, though a fair amount of detail has been given to backgrounds and water scenes. The plethora of characters from previous To Love Ru seasons return with the addition of even more characters; I\'ve honestly forgotten some of the more minor characters, and don\'t expect the show to remind you who they are. As in previous iterations, expect a lot of blushing and skin. I will say though that I have no idea how Nana tucks all that long hair into her tiny twin tails, it must be a gravitational anomaly or something.The show still has a decent amount of action thanks to former assassins Mea and Yami. I have no idea how the school pays for it but expect tremendous collateral damage repeatedly. As for ecchi, expect it literally everywhere. By now, Rito is the king of accidents and always ends up touching or smelling things that require almost constant god rays. To add to this, Momo literally visits Rito to be groped while he sleeps. It\'s not just Rito as apparently many of the girls enjoy fondling each other. Indeed, this is among the most shameless shows of the season.Sound:The show opens with a relatively light OP with a fair main melody. The ED feels somewhat nostalgic as Mami Kawada\'s nice piece reminds me of her previous work on Index and Shakugan no Shana. As in previous seasons, the BGM is supportive but not particularly memorable.The strong VA cast returns for yet another performance heavy in aroused, elated groans. Aki Toyosaki still gives a great performance as Momo though sister Kanae Itou as Nana gives her a run for her money with an emotional performance. Misato Fukuen also does a great job as Yami; her embarrassed voice is particularly good.Story:To Love Ru\'s revival as a somewhat plot-based show continues, and actually improves in this second season. The early episodes are generally mainly episodic, emphasizing either one of Lala\'s inventions gone wrong or focusing on a particular girl. Surprisingly, a fair amount of minor characters gets center stage including Yui Kotegawa and Rin Kujou. Nana also gets a bit more love to balance out with Momo. The most humorous aspect of it all was that an episode is dedicated to Lala, who finally realizes that she\'s no longer the center of the world. Despite the episodic feel, the story slowly introduces antagonists and foreshadows events that eventually link the show together. Once you hit the three quarter mark, the show finally decides to get serious and we learn what Darkness really is. To be honest, the first part of the final arc was a bit new but everything after was a tad too predictable. This climax is followed by a likewise predictable and open conclusion. All in all, not too shabby of a run with decent entertainment value throughout, and I don\'t just mean the ecchi parts.Character:I think Momo and Nana\'s characters are finally starting to sink in and feel more like real heroines rather than fill-ins for Lala and Haruna. They, along with Mea and Yami get a fair amount of development. Momo\'s harem plan seems to be going well as more and more girls seem to be falling for Rito\'s ""nice"" comments, despite him matching every nice comment with a not-so-nice grope. I still don\'t like the fact that the cast is so spread out but it does mean that whatever fetish you have is guaranteed to be covered to some extent by the show, yes including tentacles. The interactions between the girls are still fun as they fight over the idea of winning over Rito vs. submitting to a harem.Value:I feel like this second season of Darkness fixes many of the sour notes that I had from the end of the last season. This revival of sorts of To Love Ru is turning out to be fairly good, albeit ecchi heavy. If you can deal with the massive amount of blurred frames or are able to patiently wait for the blu-rays, this is an entertaining addition to the franchise. Enjoy the Darkness and may it brighten your day. original heroines Lala and Haruna feel all but sidelined as the focus shifts towards Momo, Nana, and a new generation of harem members.

Enjoy the Darkness and may it brighten your day.', ""This show is practically all about the enjoyment, and I enjoy it a lot!!. If you watched the original TO LOVE RU and the 1st season of Darkness, you will definitely enjoy this show as well as Rito's Ecchi escapades has no limits and will really keep on going for ever.With the first series, the plot is somewhat episodic due to each episode having different characters to mess around with. However, there is more of a plot in this one; As there is the whole overlaying plot of what DARKNESS actually is and that is talked about through most episodes and each episode connects...to the next, rather than it be episodic.  This could be a positive or negative on what way you choose to look at it. I think the first show (pre Darkness) had it better due to it being more entertaining and random with Rito ending up in random places everytime. 'Darkness' s plot is more story and for me (who loved the randomness of the first show), it is a step down . And this carries on to the second season of Darkness. But it is still solid.The sound and art are nothing mind blowing but is the art is definetly an upgrade over the past seasons to me personally. And the music is catchy as usual.What this show really loses it points on is the characters. While it did the justice of taking, the pointless Haruna away from the Main character list, it came at the risk of Lala and Yui also becoming recurring characters. In the first season of Darkness, i feel like we saw more of them but now all we see is Mea. And i Hate Mea. She has been the focal point for so long, that it becomes a pain evereytime i see her do anything other than lick Rito. As good as Momo is, i still want more screen time Lala and Yui, especially YUI as she is the best character!! But I guess watching Momo and her harem plan will be okay for now.For both season of darkness, my main issue has been Yui and Lala not get enough screen time. However, the other characters (except Mea) are still entertaining and Rito's ecchinnes will never stop.Normally i will give this show a rating of 7 cause its just good on every level. But the enjoyment factor is just too much so i gave it a 8 overall.PS: try watching once the blue rays come out so you can watch it uncensored, to fulfill your complete thirst to the next, rather than it be episodic.

And this is also not a formal review as Darkness 2nd is a continuation of the series. I'm also assuming you've watched all of the episodes leading up to the current seasonFirst of all, In this season, we continue with the main characters shifting away from Lala and Haruna. The main focus of the series is on Momo, Nana, Mea, and Yami. And for only for a couple of episodes is Lala actually participating. There is a small bit of Lala...love for you fans out there, but the most you see of her is in the Last episode and the Specials.In terms of Mea, she really begins to develop as a character. We see a lot of exposition of her and a new character. We also see Yami develop as a character more towards the end of the season.Overall, If you have watched the previous seasons, its worth a watch as there actually is plot to the season, and you must watch the 13th and 14th episodes disguised as specials, love for you fans out there, but the most you see of her is in the Last episode and the Specials.In terms of Mea, she really begins to develop as a character. We see a lot of exposition of her and a new character.

It seems ridiculous to me, especially not to like the first two seasons and to like the darkness. I respect everyone\'s opinion, you may not like the previous ones but these 2 seasons are definitely not better than them. I also understand that the main characters have changed due to special circumstances, it wouldn\'t be a problem if it handle done well, but the series unfortunately couldn\'t do that.I have nothing against fanservice (i have watched many ecchi shows with enjoy) but the fanservice in To Love Ru-Darkness seems way pointless for me. Unlike the prequel seasons, they\'re made...just to be made and they\'re not funny.The anime tried to be To Love Ru, but really failed. I don\'t mind that the story shifted to diffrent charcters, but I do mind that it shifted to the wrong characters. It\'s called ""Darkness"", so I expected to find out more about Golden Darkness, and I did, the problem is that side characters just became main charcters. Momo and Nana are not part of the main character Lineup. The relation between Rito, Lala and haruna became irrelevant, which is pretty bad, considering that they were the main reasoning for the story. For some reason the also thought it would be a great idea to make Rito love Momo more than Lala and Haruna, eventhough they really aren\'t that close as they illustrate it.I think it would have been better if the series had only focused on the side characters instead of the main and side characters making this unfimiliar and weird story lineup. This just isn\'t a good series anymore and since xebec have broken up their won\'t be an attempt to fix this mess. On the other hand it is sad to see the series fade out likethis. I really do hope someone will buy the licens to the anime and completly reboot it, by fixing the mess these two dark seasons have made.If you decide to watch Darkness s1 & s2, you will see that it is actually a standard ecchi anime made to entertain the audience with the whole season of Rito falling randomly on another girl\'s pantsu. And also it\'s funny how the series pretends to have a good story. just to be made and they\'re not funny.The anime tried to be To Love Ru, but really failed. I don\'t mind that the story shifted to diffrent charcters, but I do mind that it shifted to the wrong characters.

Ok so, this is not gonna be a legit review of this series, I just felt like i needed to say some things about this series.After watching 70+ episodes of this series I can say that I just got tired of it. And I have 2 reasons as to why.First, The main character. i just can\'t take him seriously, you would think after so many episodes he would get used to seeing all of the girls\' naked bodies, but no. Also he doesn\'t realize that 90% of the girls want his D. Like, Lala...has straight up told him that she likes him, but he just doesn\'t make any progress with her because he\'s not sure about his feelings or some BS, like dude just go for the P. And I know this series is targeted for a younger audience but still, I think they could have managed it much better imo.And secondly, The anime just got wayyyy too repetitive. Like it was funny at the start, but every episode is almost the exact same, Rito falling headfirst into a girl\'s panties. That\'s it.But the good thing about this series is, The first season of darkness actually has a decent plot and also great ""plot"" so that\'s that I guess.Anyway, I dont wanna be salty about some echii anime on the internet, so I\'ll just leave it at that has straight up told him that she likes him, but he just doesn\'t make any progress with her because he\'s not sure about his feelings or some BS, like dude just go for the P.

To LOVE-Ru Darkness is a godsend to this series as it expanded on that premise with the establishment of a solid story. This second part was no exception, continuing from before with more focus on the plot revolving around Yami and Mea that it had previously set up.With the introduction of the unknown Master who finally came out of the shadow, this season explored the idea of friendship and feelings more abundantly than its predecessors. There was already quite...a mysterious presence in the hearts of some of the girls, some more and some less. Especially those who came from a non-Earth background. It's there, but it was pretty subtle to really grasp how serious their feelings were. So when the story decided to mingle around with this concept prominently, it created a deeper depth outside of the romance that had been there since the beginning, relatively speaking. Interactions with each other revealed the growing bonds as they slowly come to terms with their own true feelings. Their secrets or their emotions, it was all used to further develop the girls away from something that was just for entertainment. They actually have an identity. In a way, their portrayal was sensibly realistic for an ecchi show and that made watching them all the more fun because they actually grew in character while also having the pleasant amusing side to them. So that said, mindless entertainment was still a big factor in this season, mostly rooting from the harem keikaku in progress that inched the girls ever closer towards Rito. And with Rito's stunning skill of falling over in the most absurd ways at the most wrong times, there were a bunch of comical ecchi scenes in play that really defined this whole series from the very first episode. The situations of all sorts of awkwardness delivered in being entertaining while also solidifying how likable each girls are. Still some repetition, but it wasn't as annoying compared to the previous ones which was either due to me getting used to them already or the story additionally improved the characters enough where I don't mind them now. Or both.First thing that I noticed for some reason was the thinner line work. The softer look of the visuals felt pleasing to the eyes so I really liked the slight change there. Animation was consistent with maintained smoothness and I'm amazed by the continual improvements that came with each season. Somewhat greater vibrancy in the eyes with even more distinct shine on the curves meant that everything stood out brightly but not too over-the-top with unreasonable whitewash. This art style drew forms to the apparent focus of emotions presented throughout the story. You'll know how attached you are to the characters if their feelings also affected you on an emotional level. Whether it's the vigorous cuteness of euphoric nature that radiated from their expressions or their rarely seen sadness, seeing them placed a smile on my face and can hit me with all sorts of feels too. In the ecchi department, warmer hues of red and orange enveloped the scenes. Although not that obvious, these color choices represented the emotions of love, romance, and an exciting warmth that sprayed the air into something stimulating. It pretty much added more style and substance when these was shown so if you already loved the ecchi part of the series, then it's a no-brainer that you will also love the ones in here. Great soundtracks and passionate voice-acting let out all the character's personality into the atmosphere, molding it to match the current mood. Whether that'd be a fun or a more serious one, the sounds harmonized together in a pretty great way. A fun melody is the result of that creation. Hey, and that ending sequence was visually and acoustically nice to experience. Maybe that's because of the focus of Yami but every girls here are great too of course.To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd is a season of growing feelings, from both the characters and me as a viewer. Not only in a lovey-dovey manner but also with the prominence of friendship, family, and identity to add a bit of something, a bit of realism, into the characters to make them even more likable.

To be completely honest, the two seasons are similar enough that they've sort of blurred together in my mind.\xa0 The core focus in terms of characters in addition to Rito is still on Mea, Nana, Yami, and Momo. Mea's character development alongside her relationship development with Nana...is one of the main threads in the series, which also leads to both gaining some relationship development with Rito. Mea's relationship with her master Nemesis is also important, though it mostly only matters in terms of the finale. Oshizu's relationship with Mea, which had so far been one of extreme wariness, also gets some development into a strange sort of friendship. Yami doing her best to live peacefully and her relationship with Tear and Mikan to an extent get development over the course of this season, though the focus on her mainly comes at the end where it truly tackles who she is and what she wants to do and how Rito fits into all that. The finale itself focuses on wrapping up Yami and Mea's plot threads and does so in an epic finale manner with a single event spanning multiple episodes, which is something that hadn't been attempted by the series since the finale of the first season. Thankfully, unlike the finale to the first season, the finale of this season wraps things up incredibly well, racketing up the intensity a good amount, but keeping events focused and consistent with the rest of the series in terms of tone and atmosphere, and doing very well by the characters being focused on in wrapping up everything built up relating to Yami, Mea, and the titular Darkness really well.Momo is still very much carrying out her own plans, but in terms of an overarching plot thread it felt it takes a back seat to the one focused more on Mea and Yami. The previous season developed what the harem plan was and pushed it majorly forward with some key characters like Run and Yui that weren't a part of the plot thread involving Yami and Mea so it felt like it made major progress. It pushed things forward with Nana and Yami as part of their own plot thread, which while still progress didn't feel like actual progress in this regard due to the progress in this regard being indirect. There's also a push for progress with Haruna and Lala that is handled well, but both of their arcs are already over in a sense, with the only thing possibly remaining being for them to actually be part of a harem ending, which doesn't feel any closer to happening overall, so it doesn't feel like much progress was made there either. The only character that actually made noticeable progress in this regard was Rin, the progress of whose relationship with Rito was solid, however as its the only real progress that's occurred with Rito over the course of the series the relationship feels a bit weak for how late into the series it is. Thus while there is a good amount of content regarding Momo and her harem plan that's really well done in and of itself, it doesn't feel like the plan overall has moved any closer to a conclusion. This doesn't feel like much of an issue while watching as the focus is on the other plot threads, especially the finale, but afterwards it really feels like things were really left hanging.The art and animation are very well done as usual and mostly about the same as the previous season. The animation regarding actions seems to be noticeably improved from the previous season however. The comedy and random antics are still as amusing and well done as usual. The OP and ED are both decent enough in terms of visual and audio. The soundtrack is still mostly not that memorable, but certain more intense tracks during action and serious sequences stood out. is one of the main threads in the series, which also leads to both gaining some relationship development with Rito.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Review is mostly about Darkness seasons while having similar opinion regarding pre-darkness seasons.-----✦StoryTo put it in a most simple way.Love-Ru franchise is pinnacle of great borderline ecchi and harem.Now to give some extra comments. It\'s a very bright Anime with some darker subplots. It also offers plenty of characters and their development between various characters and main character himself. Even though it\'s harem story where romance is more of a fun element than drama, we still get plenty of dramatic moments, sad moments and as well very...sweet moments. Also I do love there is a quite big background story that now and then shows presence. Plus the whole ""harem plan"" story element is also great fun.Maybe this would go more under ""characters"", but as it plays a big part in the story I will have to mention our main male lead character. He is the pinnacle of naive, shy and unlucky lucky pervert character. Those characters usually are lead around by women and get into very erotic situations, where usually those characters end up essentially passing out from embarrassment. And in this type of ecchi AND harem Anime it is extremely pleasant part. As most characters genuinely love or care about our main character, It is essential for me that the targeted character would now use in underhanded or disrespectful way those feelings. Even though sometimes his shyness can get frustrating. I do still respect him more as I wouldn\'t have such strong heart to able resist all of those characters and situations our main character gets into. So in that sense how everything remains pure and loving PLUS very importantly VANILLA, I do like that our main guy can get serious to consider character feelings and struggle on a idea of harem. So respect to that guy. I would not simply able to keep my sanity in his place and that would end up destructive and ruin most relationships. If only complaint I have regarding him and his whole story and development between characters, then it would be that how the actual f*** he simply almost never got boner.. that is simply unreal. Personally watching this Anime was probably 90% of the time having blood rushing. But I still adored the purity and vanilla aspect to utmost highest level.As whole franchise I feel there surprising amount of actual storytelling and some progression between characters. One of the Anime that I pray will get fully adapted as I\'m really intrigued how it all will end up.Now, of course story being existent and everything is a nice thing. BUT the most important thing about this Anime is probably ""art of eros"" the fanservice, scenes and such are probably conveyed and presented in the most amazing way I\'ve ever seen. Giving us plenty of straight-on fanservice and obvious ""references"" regarding some things. But how they are done and shown are so much hotter than a large portion of actual hentai. But more about in the ""Art"" section.Point still remains, even though there is some romance, drama and interesting world plus actual plot. This Anime main focus and the most impressive asset, is it\'s fanservice/ecchi genre.✦Art & SoundArt art art... this Anime is pinnacle of ecchi genre. I do absolutely love this artist style. Character designs are pleasing, there all sorts of them. Animation is superb, colors are bright. And ecchi element is incredibly erotic. Bare skin is superb, body parts are superb, clothes are superb, straightforward erotica is superb, ""covered"" erotica is superb a.k.a use of imagination. Most definitely more erotic/sexier than a large portion of actual hentai. Even the most simple panty shots and such were extremely pleasing, whilst lewder panty shot moments were unbearable amount erotic. In in almost every scene, aspect no matter what element it was, it was either extremely pleasing to look at or extremely erotic depending on intention of the scene or still shot.Music & Ost was for the most part pretty impressive and good. But as well there were quite some tracks that had 0 presence at all.And voice acting, aside great lewd moments, there were plenty of Angelic voices.. Tearju and Yami for example. I loved their voices A LOT.✦CharactersA lot of different girls, a lot of great use of stereotypes, sweet amount of romantic moments, progression and development of characters and relationships between the characters.Main guy I mentioned in ""story"" section as I felt it was required.Aside that we got so many superb characters that I don\'t even want to discuss. I simply loved almost each and every of the character, whenever the character was part of the main cast or supporting characters.✦Enjoyment & OverallIn short. It\'s fun, bright, extremely hot. Is also quite sweet regarding romance and has some very sweet dramatic moments. Absolutely great art style and character designs. Superb cast and top tier use of stereotypes plus characters overall were simply a lot of fun and joy.Story is actually pretty nice with plenty of interesting points in it. But at the same time it is simply enough for straightforward fun.It will go into my list of favorites that\'s for sure. But It won\'t get full score from me for two primary reasons. One would be that ost/music could been a bit better and done better and another would be the story could had a bit more development regarding relationships. But if this Anime get\'s fully adapted and get\'s satisfying finale. Then such ""final season"" might get 10/10 from me.Absolutely bless ""art of eros"" type of AnimeAlso absolutely love pure/vanilla love and romance type of Anime.Well done pure and sweet romance with extremely lewd presentation.Respect to Rito even though he is simply a bit pathetic, still respect for not giving in to the lust and keep himself back even through fate constantly threw at him erotic situations, easy grab moments and such a fantastic and beautiful harem at him.I feel I forgot a lot of things I wanted to mention. But this review is simply long enough.TLDR: If you like vanilla romance, harem and top tier ecchi. Then this is most definitely one of the series to watch. sweet moments. Also I do love there is a quite big background story that now and then shows presence. Plus the whole ""harem plan"" story element is also great fun.Maybe this would go more under ""characters"", but as it plays a big part in the story I will have to mention our main male lead character.

BUT the most important thing about this Anime is probably ""art of eros"" the fanservice, scenes and such are probably conveyed and presented in the most amazing way I\'ve ever seen. Giving us plenty of straight-on fanservice and obvious ""references"" regarding some things. But how they are done and shown are so much hotter than a large portion of actual hentai. But more about in the ""Art"" section.Point still remains, even though there is some romance, drama and interesting world plus actual plot. This Anime main focus and the most impressive asset, is it\'s fanservice/ecchi genre.✦Art & SoundArt art art... this Anime is pinnacle of ecchi genre. I do absolutely love this artist style. Character designs are pleasing, there all sorts of them. Animation is superb, colors are bright. And ecchi element is incredibly erotic. Bare skin is superb, body parts are superb, clothes are superb, straightforward erotica is superb, ""covered"" erotica is superb a.k.a use of imagination. Most definitely more erotic/sexier than a large portion of actual hentai. Even the most simple panty shots and such were extremely pleasing, whilst lewder panty shot moments were unbearable amount erotic. In in almost every scene, aspect no matter what element it was, it was either extremely pleasing to look at or extremely erotic depending on intention of the scene or still shot.Music & Ost was for the most part pretty impressive and good. But as well there were quite some tracks that had 0 presence at all.And voice acting, aside great lewd moments, there were plenty of Angelic voices.. Tearju and Yami for example. I loved their voices A LOT.✦CharactersA lot of different girls, a lot of great use of stereotypes, sweet amount of romantic moments, progression and development of characters and relationships between the characters.Main guy I mentioned in ""story"" section as I felt it was required.Aside that we got so many superb characters that I don\'t even want to discuss. I simply loved almost each and every of the character, whenever the character was part of the main cast or supporting characters.✦Enjoyment & OverallIn short. It\'s fun, bright, extremely hot. Is also quite sweet regarding romance and has some very sweet dramatic moments. Absolutely great art style and character designs. Superb cast and top tier use of stereotypes plus characters overall were simply a lot of fun and joy.Story is actually pretty nice with plenty of interesting points in it. But at the same time it is simply enough for straightforward fun.It will go into my list of favorites that\'s for sure. But It won\'t get full score from me for two primary reasons. One would be that ost/music could been a bit better and done better and another would be the story could had a bit more development regarding relationships. But if this Anime get\'s fully adapted and get\'s satisfying finale. Then such ""final season"" might get 10/10 from me.Absolutely bless ""art of eros"" type of AnimeAlso absolutely love pure/vanilla love and romance type of Anime.Well done pure and sweet romance with extremely lewd presentation.Respect to Rito even though he is simply a bit pathetic, still respect for not giving in to the lust and keep himself back even through fate constantly threw at him erotic situations, easy grab moments and such a fantastic and beautiful harem at him.I feel I forgot a lot of things I wanted to mention. But this review is simply long enough.TLDR: If you like vanilla romance, harem and top tier ecchi. Then this is most definitely one of the series to watch.', 'Haiku review:Not magical girlHarem fun but seriousDegeneracyProse review for those to whom art doesn’t matter:They’re back and lewder than ever. “To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2” might, by the third episode, be called “Lick x Sis,” as in sister-sister action we learn that the only difference between the folds in the tails of our pink-haired space princesses and their other nether regions is the color. Swap the blacks and grays for skintones and we’re in full-on hentai territory here....I wondered if “To LOVE-Ru Darkness” would take this tendency as far as it could go. It turns out, there was more unprobed territory, so to speak.The first couple of episodes re-establish the strange world and that this is not our world in that there the girls are, for lack of a better term, psychotic nymphomaniacs who may turn on the other person or not. This may serve as a strong warning for viewers who employ the three-episode rule. It’s a commonplace for people to say this show isn’t for everyone, but they’ll know whether it’s for them in the first minute of the first episode. This series pulls no punches, though in keeping with the solemn code governing anime, the protagonist is an idiot.We are reunited with our old friends from the earlier series. They’re unchanged, though Lala is more thicc than I remember (though, in my defense, it’s been almost a whole day since I saw the original Darkness series). Stylistically, there were a few more (disappointing; they’re always disappointing) misplaced rays of foggy light as censor strips, though only a few; they’re better, I suppose, than the stupid stickers licensees use, but if they don’t want full nakedness then they ought to reframe their cuts to begin with, no? And this series there’s a new way of travel, in the form of spring-shaped tornado things that precede one of the various magical girls’ arrivals. It seems a little late in the game to introduce this stuff, but that’s not something unheard of in second-season, lower-budget anime. And they did seem to spend their money where it’s most effective, if you catch my drift.The writing seems much the same (in the dub; who knows what Sentai changed from the original Japanese – it’s not as if the issue has never arisen before), though there was one notable difference, at the end of episode 3. One of our girls is sneaking into the bed of the protagonist in the middle of the night, only to find another of our girls is already there. Did she go berserk and call him a pervert? She did not. She went berserk and called him “you filthy weeb.” I don’t know if this is progress, but it is certainly different – as is the idea that a weeb would ever be in bed with a willing girl.Strangely, MAL lists the series as having 12 episodes, but the one I watched has 14. This leads me to think that there’s a version out there minus two whole episodes worth of material aimed at, um, sophisticates. (The version I saw, a dub, included the occasional explanatory comment, as when a pun that would only be understood by Japanese viewers was part of the dialogue, so perhaps the longer version is unofficial, more’s the pity. The final two episodes, though, were heavily censored subs – meaning an almost completely white screen much of the time.)The series finally got around to a festival episode. It was not explained where they got yukatas that accommodate tails, but they weren’t wearing those or any other garments for a lot of it.Celine – who is supposed to be a plant! -- latches onto any available nipple in search of milk. There’s never a shortage of candidates. And there is a cabbage-chopping scene – don’t worry, established anime cabbage rules were followed – in which the protagonist and his little sister are inadvertently put nearly into imouto/onii-chan territory. That’s not the only time. Anime, wonderful as it is, can get weird. Oh, and there’s more hot tentacle action, too.The long-sought Master Nemesis appears – they didn’t even have to use master bait! – and our protagonist has her tiddies out and has face planted into her coochie before a minute has passed. Good job, though I’m beginning to think he slips and falls on purpose, like some grocery store liability lawsuit grifter. Best line of the series is not from Nemesis: “It’s become clear to me that the laws of physics mean nothing to you,” said to a coochie-gagged protagonist following a tumble down the stairs. (And I never dreamt I would ever write the phrase “coochie-gagged protagonist. I’d be a great title for a novel, don’t you think?) Close second, same character to protagonist: “I love all things perverted. And I love how depraved you can be, too.”Nemesis, who it turns out likes to get herself some tail, can make her boobies get big and small at will, but I think it may have just been the animators demonstrating that unlike other animators they can draw more than just the one size. While we’re at it, the panty wrinkles have by episode 5 become downright explicit – remove the lace edges and change the color and they aren’t there at all. And who the hell makes that sort of electric cat’s paw toy? And who would call it “adorable”? (Well, before its use, anyway.)The music is typical; the OP and ED are both apparently products of the computer program that randomly generates anime theme song lines (and a busy machine it is!), and they’re still longer than they need to be.But yes, Nemesis’s appearance means that there is a plot. What could it possibly be? How can it turn out? Will our beloved characters be destroyed? Will the protagonist have what it takes or succumb to performance anxiety when he must enter the breach?

She’s actually an...egotistic character who only cares about rito loving everyone because she’s not his fiancé.Something that also made me quite upset was mikan being part of the harem when she’s rito’s sister and also a kid… but don’t get me started with this.The characters that should’ve been the focus where cast aside and where just there for the fanservice (like the past seasons), we could’ve seen much more about the trans-weapons + tearju if they didn’t put them off.Also, i think this anime could’ve been more popular (lore-wise) if it didn’t have all those absurd and unnecessary fanservice, instead it became popular exactly for that crap.Overall, it’s a pretty much average anime if you just ignore the fanservice, they focused on the wrong character and on the wrong bit of the history but it’s quite enjoyable. egotistic character who only cares about rito loving everyone because she’s not his fiancé.Something that also made me quite upset was mikan being part of the harem when she’s rito’s sister and also a kid… but don’t get me started with this.The characters that should’ve been the focus where cast aside and where just there for the fanservice (like the past seasons), we could’ve seen much more about the trans-weapons + tearju if they didn’t put them off.Also, i think this anime could’ve been more popular (lore-wise) if it didn’t have all those absurd and unnecessary fanservice, instead it became popular exactly for that crap.Overall, it’s a pretty much average anime if you just ignore the fanservice, they focused on the wrong character and on the wrong bit of the history but it’s quite enjoyable.']"
Toshokan Sensou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3613/Toshokan_Sensou,"[""Toshokan Sensou (or The Library Wars), is another one of those odd anime that I seem to end up reviewing. The show has a nice premise which is reminiscent of Orwell's 1984 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 all rolled into one.The anime is based on a series of four light novels by Arikawa Hiro (entitled Toshokan Sensou, Nairan, Kiki, and Kakumei respectively), which were published from 2006 to 2007. The novels were later serialized in two mangas. The first manga was made by Yumi Kiiro, and published in Lala magazine from September 2007. The second was made by Furudori Yayoi, and was published Dengeki Daioh magazine...from November 2007. The twelve episode anime was made by Production IG, and released in April 2008 on Fuji TV's Noitamina (which is animation written backwards) timeslot.StoryThe basic plot for the novels is based on the &quot;Statement of Intellectual Freedom in Libraries&quot; that went into effect in Japan in 1954. The story is set 30 years after Japan passed the Media Enhancement Act in 1989, a law which effectively gave control of all published material to the government. The law was passed in an effort to censor any media that could be deemed as hazardous to Japanese society, but 30 years later blanket censorships, book burnings, and a culture of fear and exclusion have become the norm for society, as Media Enforcement troops are everywhere.Because of this, and because of a tragedy that occured 20 years prior to the beginning of the story, the libraries now have their own defense forces, and the main character, Kasahara Iku, joins the Kanto Library Defense Force as she was saved by a member of the that team some years back. The show follows her struggle to become a good librarian and a good member of the defense team.ArtThe art style is very much hit and miss. Although the characters are nicely designed Production IG have adopted a style that has quite noticeable black borders around characters and objects. This give the show a far more &quot;cartoony&quot; feel than it should possibly have, especially during the dramatic moments. This &quot;cartoony&quot; feel can be off putting to some people, whilst others may be oblivious to it.The backgrounds and settings are well designed, but overall they aren't anything special. The animation itself is usually quite smooth and flowing, although there are some glaring faults (the scene in episode 11 with a van crashing through a barrier made from two buses and receiving no damage is a prime example).SoundThe sound is okay overall. The OP is nice, if unmemorable, as is the ED. The VA's are quite good overall. Inoue Marina plays the role of Iku very well, and her voice suits the design of the character. The same goes for the rest of the VA's with their resepctive characters. The sound effects are pretty good throughout the show. Most of these are used in the more dramatic or action filled moments to good effect.CharactersThe characters weren't bad on the whole. Iku is a nice enough lead on the whole, although I found it a little off putting that she is a stereotypical &quot;jock&quot; (i.e. all muscle and no brain). She is determined and caring, but coupled with that is a short temper, reckless behaviour, a dislike of serious study and classrooms, and a endency to overreact. This can make her character confusing as it's sometimes unclear how the show is trying to develop her.The other characters (Doujo Atsushi, Shibasaki Asako, Tezuka Hikaru, etc), receive very little development throughout the course of the show, especially given the fact that the show is about Iku. This makes the show unbalanced as, although we are clear about what drives Iku, we are rarely shown any of the other chaacters' motivations.EnjoymentHere's the reason why I said this show is a bit odd. It never seems to settle on being one thing as it has drama, action, suspense, comedy, and even romance all mixed into it. he unfortunate thing though, is that it never quite pulls of the comedy, the romance is a little on the limp side, the drama is sometimes hammed up, and the suspense is normally easy to work out. Couple this with the cartoon style art and the show is difficult to take seriously.However, the show is enjoyable on the whole, especially if you don't treat it as a serious anime. It's effectively a coming of age story and as such it actually works on quite a few levels.OverallToshokan Sensou isn't a bad show on the whole. Yes, there are some obvious failings in the show, but it is still rather enjoyable in a no-brain kind of way. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a serious show, or to anyone who wants a comedy. Although the basic premise is a serious one, the show works better as a straightforward action anime, and as such it's not a bad way to waste half an hour (hence my overall score of 7).If you're going to watch the show then don't have any expectations of high drama, challenging concepts, or any kind of socio-political message. It doesn't require any introspection or deep philosophical ponderings, and the best advice is to watch it in the same way you'd watch Die Hard, Rush Hour, or any other action movie. from November 2007.

The premise was interesting so I decided to give it a try and was totally amazed. The storyline, characters, artwork, and sound are engrossing and completely draw you in. While the characters themselves may not be completely unique, their interactions with one another and the realistic emotional outbursts are i think rare among most anime.Most people don't really mention this but I also consider this a full romance. The relationship between the main characters develops more naturally over time. They are not sappy or fake but there was a lovely tenderness...and protectiveness towards one another that was great and heartfelt. And in this anime you definitely get a somewhat satisfying ending vs. most animes that leave things very open ended. I am hoping hoping for a second season because my only complaint would be that this anime was way to short.The storyline is smart with strong sociological undertones. The advantage is you can choose to really ignore the important issues if you want to you. You can enjoy the action, comedy and romance alone or you can also appreciate the underlying message and concept. Either way, I don't believe it will diminish your enjoyment of the show.So overall witty and lovable characters, great story, nice artwork.. this is now one of my top fav. animes of all time. and protectiveness towards one another that was great and heartfelt.

I watched the first episode and I was absolutely geared up to hate the whole thing and bring all my negative emotional baggage down on it.I failed.  I fell in love with this anime.It deals with a war very unlike Western wars, and with laws very unlike Western laws.  In the real world war is incredibly lawless and ugly, and law enforcement is terrible.  But this anime deals with an extremely civilized war with very strict rules of engagement, very limited weapons, and scrupulous regard for human life, so it's not like watching...documentary footage of real wars.  The war is also in effect a limited civil war, so it's not like any war story I can recall ever having seen before.This anime is short but extremely complete.  The visuals are gorgeous.  The character development, plot, and pacing are very well-balanced.  It packs a huge amount of energy into a very concentrated package.Obscure trivia note:The main character of Mahou Shoujo Tai Arusu was played by Kojima Sachiko, but for whatever reason, I keep thinking that she sounds exactly like Inoue Marina playing the main character of Toshokan Sensou. documentary footage of real wars.

It sounds intresting, but not good enough.The characters and the art help you through the series, in which the story develops nicely. The characters are done great, their backgrounds, relations and personalities, they really look like humans which just got animated, through their personalities that is.The art is okay, sometimes they could've drawn more realistic, some female characters look too much on their male co-characters. But that's probably meant to be that way,...since, when you get to know a softer side, you get to see how beautiful she actually is.But all-in-all, Toshokan Sensou (Library War) is an highly enjoyable anime if you like intresting story's, good/realistic art and romance or humor.

Every aspect is worked in it, and of course, don't forget the action that happens once in a while"", 'Toshokan Sensou seems like the kind of anime you want to watch just because of the premise: the story of the first woman to join a military force specialized in fighting against censorship. Sounds incredible, right? Well, sadly it fails to justify the idiosyncratic politics that frames the whole setting, as well to present any meaningful insight of such complex themes. Does that mean the show sucks? Not exactly. While the simplistic nature of the setting can be underwhelming, it\'s a completely functional field for the true crop of the story grows: the characters.Ultimately, Toshokan Sensou is a coming of age. Kasahara Iku must not...only overcome her immaturity towards her professional stance, but also with matters of the heart - as well a little plot involving her parents disapproval of her dangerous job. The narrative does an excellent job at progressing her character in a satisfying pace. You can see that she\'s steadying improving, but not drastically changing.The cast surrounding her is a lovable bunch, the show doesn\'t pull any punches in presenting them in a more calculated way. You\'re pretty much throw at their everyday experience while they\'re rapidly introduced by a little profile, which it\'s a good thing because you get the feel that these people are actually accustomed to each other and been living together for a long time, letting you appreciate how their dynamics change and evolves in the course of the story.Kasahara\'s interactions with her roommate Shibasaki are specially tasty, their contrasting personalities are not only matched by the dialogue, but by their seiyuu as well. Marina Inoue and Miyuki Sawashiro are such unique voices and deliver such stellar performances that you could watch just for it.Talking about the ladies, one specific aspect this show nails is their visual presentation, they are treated with utmost respect despite being plenty attractive. Which may not comes as a surprise since it\'s an early Noitamina show, but still a reinvigorating factor considering the ways things are nowadays.Despise romance being quite an important thing in this series, it never overwhelms the plot, Instead, it naturally flows and spontaneously happens at times. Not to say it\'s great, but it\'s not a hindrance either. It presents itself quite smoothly when it comes to supporting characters, in contrast the romance between the main characters is awkward and clumsy as it gets.

Battles and conflicts in general have strange conjectures but are diligent enough to make up engaging scenes.Toshokan Sensou ended up as a mixed bag, having problems that highly affects the show thematically, but doesn\'t compromise the moment to moment experience, which I personally find captivating and endearing.~A note on the movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa~In the TV series, there was a strange feature where characters sometimes would have bold outlines, making them look very cartoonish, which was not only inconsistent, but questionable considering the overall somber tone of the show.

Unfortunately, this concept is not expanded as triumphantly as it could, wastefully existing only in a micro perspective of the matter.The movie also progresses the romance even further with somewhat the merits and demerits as the TV series. Not a letdown, but also not a surprise. Overall, a nice resolution to a kind of a nice show. only overcome her immaturity towards her professional stance, but also with matters of the heart - as well a little plot involving her parents disapproval of her dangerous job. The narrative does an excellent job at progressing her character in a satisfying pace. You can see that she\'s steadying improving, but not drastically changing.The cast surrounding her is a lovable bunch, the show doesn\'t pull any punches in presenting them in a more calculated way. You\'re pretty much throw at their everyday experience while they\'re rapidly introduced by a little profile, which it\'s a good thing because you get the feel that these people are actually accustomed to each other and been living together for a long time, letting you appreciate how their dynamics change and evolves in the course of the story.Kasahara\'s interactions with her roommate Shibasaki are specially tasty, their contrasting personalities are not only matched by the dialogue, but by their seiyuu as well. Marina Inoue and Miyuki Sawashiro are such unique voices and deliver such stellar performances that you could watch just for it.Talking about the ladies, one specific aspect this show nails is their visual presentation, they are treated with utmost respect despite being plenty attractive. Which may not comes as a surprise since it\'s an early Noitamina show, but still a reinvigorating factor considering the ways things are nowadays.Despise romance being quite an important thing in this series, it never overwhelms the plot, Instead, it naturally flows and spontaneously happens at times. Not to say it\'s great, but it\'s not a hindrance either. It presents itself quite smoothly when it comes to supporting characters, in contrast the romance between the main characters is awkward and clumsy as it gets. Also, it\'s pretty stupid how the story constantly reiterate how ""they\'re so alike and do exactly the same things!"", it only comes as a very lazy way of bridging, Despise all that, they still make an adorable pair.Actions scenes compose a great part of the narrative, and while they\'re not essentially bad, they suffer from the lack of political nuance and actual stakes of danger and weight, people are constantly shot but blood is a rare sight to behold (except in a scene in the last arc, that ironically maintains the absurdity of the show in that regard).

The only thing that bothered me about it was that it was too good for only 12 episodes. I really wanted more.The story is interesting. Though not something genuinely unheard of, the way it portrays the humanity and realness of the events has turned it into something great. I found it realistic, funny, but sad also at times. What proved to me that it was a great series were the funny moments between the characters. Especially Doujo and Kasahara were just too amazing.I also liked that it had a very nice and sweet romance fragrance embedded...which started off with admiration and devotion.I watched it twice until now... which says something. Usually, I don't watch things twice. I really enjoyed this show and hope that through a miracle, I will see more than just that DVD special. I would really like a second season though I think I'm expecting too much. The only thing I'm a little sad about is that they kinda rushed the ending. Plus, I wanted to see a kiss. *sniff which started off with admiration and devotion.I watched it twice until now... which says something. Usually, I don't watch things twice.

The only thing I'm a little sad about is that they kinda rushed the ending. Plus, I wanted to see a kiss. *sniff"", ""To really enjoy this series, there are two hurdles that must be passed:1. Disbelief of the fact that these people are fighting to the death over books2. The extremely dull and lifeless openingWith that small disclaimer aside, Toshokan Sensou is an anime series that follows the beaten path in many regards, but does it so well that the lack of originality can be forgiven. Nothing is done here that hasn't been done before, and not every single element works, but it's certainly satisfactory as a brisk watch. Some series try to wow with deep drama, complex plots, and dizzying relationship webs. Others opt for...the simpler route of entertaining action, linear plots, and a few interesting characters mixed with good humor to spice things up. Toshokan Sensou borrows a lot from the second category.The synopsis is simple enough, while still being somewhat fascinatingt: In the not so distant future, the Japanese government has crippled the people's right to freedom of speech to prevent the spread of misinformation. To aid them in this unpopular task, the Media Enhancement Committee has been founded and enforces the government's ruling with little mercy.However, at the same time, the libraries were given the right to be militarized bastions of knowledge, where people can read whatever they want whenever they like. The libraries are tasked with keeping books away from the Media Enhancement Committee, sometimes resulting in open warfare between the two factions. It's a curiously dystopian setting, but it never feels hopeless or deprived, which is both a strength and a weakness for the series.And this is where Iku Kasahara, the main character, enters. The story follows her rise through the ranks of the Library Task Force and her increasingly tense relationship with her commanding officer, Lieutenant Dojo... all the while keeping it a secret from her protective and conservative parents.The characters, again nothing unique, are nonetheless well rounded and diverse enough to hold interest. Kasahara does well showing the burden of being the first female in the Task Force, as well as being in the Task Force in general. While she may be annoying at times with her overreactions, she's nonetheless realistic enough to let that slide.The others do well enough at sticking to their post, some even standing out long after the series is over, the GAR captain being a notable example.Animation and music are, unfortunately, nothing worth writing home about. It's all very solid, and I had no complaints, but nothing was done well enough to warrant much of a mention.While the character interactions are satisfactory and occasionally compelling, the combat lacks some of that spark due to the very Capture the Flag-ish feel to it. It's engrossing to a degree, right up until you remember that they're fighting over books, and only for that purpose. There's no true animosity between the Media Enhancement Committee and the Library Task Force, it's all just part of the job for both. The constant shifting between the conflict and Kasahara's personal life can be jarring at times.While a little character development is good for a primarily action series, it feels awkward and rushed in some places, obviously to cram as much of the material in the light novels in as possible. This is further sadly enforced by a small glimpse into the inner workings of the Media Enhancement Committee, which doesn't completely fulfill its intention of making them look slightly more sympathetic as punch clock villains.Again, Toshokan Sensou is a series where people are willing to fight to the death for books. If this premise seems too ridiculous for you, you might not take the well executed combat or plot devices seriously, and thus will cease to enjoy this. Other than that, there's hardly any objectionable content. Good guys win, bad guys lose, characters develop with a little comedy thrown in, dystopian doesn't necessarily equal horrible conditions... nothing that will offend.I certainly recommend Toshokan Sensou. It may not be perfect or particularly original, but it succeeds very well. If it had a little more focus and a slightly less silly premise, it would be a truly excellent series. A second series would've definitely been beneficial for it. So while it isn't groundbreaking, it does what it does well... if a little schizophrenically.I enjoyed it, and I see no reason why anybody who can get past the fact that they're fighting over books wouldn't.

Pretty fun for such a short little series."", 'I just came across Toshokan Sensou by browsing through some animé lists here. I\'m not Japanese, nor am I knowledgeable in the language, so I didn\'t really know what ""Toshokan Sensou"" meant until I read the translations: ""Library War.""My initial reaction was ""...what?"" simply because it\'s a combination of two words you\'d least expect to be together in a sentence, never mind a title. I also saw it was tagged as a romance animé, and I\'m a sucker for shows with a little bit of romance (think of Ed and Winry\'s scenes amidst all the twists and turns of the Brotherhood storyline) Then again, here...it was, and I thought it looked promising, so I gave it a shot. It surprised me by introducing a completely unique setting, plot and characters. It wasn\'t as stellar as other war or military--related shows (Code Geass, etc.) but it\'s still an interesting watch.Story: 9/10To be honest, this is really the most unique show I\'ve seen so far story-wise. It kicks off by giving us the heads-up on what\'s going on: media censorship is rampant in a fictional era in Japan, and the government is divided into pro-censorship and anti-censorship. Our characters belong to the anti-censorships, who chose to stand their ground and protect the rights of people for information and the freedom of expression. The show does well in exposing social issues regarding the media, which the show clearly focuses on.The soldiers and the guns were pretty much standard for me; what surprised me is that these trained soldiers also perform library duties. Yeah, you heard right: they\'re majors in military science and library science. (I meant that figuratively and literally too)Basically, it\'s people protecting sources of information armed forces-style. This setting alone already got me interested. Sadly, Toshokan Sensou has a major flaw: it takes awfully long for the story to be progressive enough to catch attention. I wouldn\'t have minded if they progressed the story a bit while introducing characters and explaining them, but the writers probably decided it was better to just give us some pseudo-filler episodes first. The first episodes were just some slice-of-life-style stories about the main character, Kasahara Iku, and her daily encounters with her friends and instructors. This stopped me from giving the story part a perfect 10.Art: 6/10I\'ll be honest: I didn\'t think their style was suitable for telling the story, at least in the comedic parts. The writers give us some funny moments that might give its viewers a good chuckle or two--I guess it was to keep things fresh--but they show it as if we\'d be on the floor crying out of sheer laughter. I think that chibi-style drawings for comedic scenes aren\'t fit for a military-themed show (about libraries), though that\'s just my opinion. I do commed them for their character designs, though. They don\'t stand out, but at least they\'re not that bad.Sound: 6/10Sound was... barely there. I didn\'t notice any good background music, but the ones that I did notice were at least chosen well; they really were suited for infiltration, rescue operation, and battlezones.Character: 8/10I was expecting some character development, being a part-romance show and all. I at least got what I expected, though not as stellar as I wished it would be. We\'re introduced to the aforementioned Kasahara Iku and Doujou Atsushi, her instructor. The rest of the characters follow suit, but I would really like to focus on these two, since they comprise the 95% of the romance this show claims to have. Kasahara is your usual sporty-girl type, just a little bit more knowledgeable in crossfires and VIP protection. Doujou is a strict instructor with a hidden soft side (does ""tsundere"" even apply to him?).They weren\'t characters as excellent as some other famous ones we know of, but the show managed to make the ending meaningful, which involves these two. I mentioned that the story picks up slowly (I was actually close to dropping this once) but the ending more than makes up for it. I really am a sucker for romances, huh.Enjoyment: 7/10Overall, Toshokan Sensou is an interesting watch that deserves your time--and needs it. If you\'re willing to watch the show \'till the ending, you\'ll see that it was also somehow worth it. Like I said, it isn\'t stellar, but it isn\'t bad either. I recommend this for those who have a lot of time and patience on their hands.

An excellent backstory and fine characters make up an interesting package called Toshokan Sensou.', 'Summary: Toshokan Sensou is an unfortunate case of a solid premise (what if libraries had their own militaries to fight off censorship?) wasted on uninspired material and a scattershot approach to genre that causes the tone of the series to careen wildly from one scene to the next.  The pieces of a good show can sometimes be found here, but it\'s ultimately a disappointment that never capitalizes on the ideas that it has.Positives:+ Intriguing premise.  Though it never really makes the most of it, the sight of people in military fatigues doing book readings for children at the local library before fighting off...jackbooted government thugs trying to do Fahrenheit 451 to their Clifford the Big Red Dog books is admirably goofy and unique.+ Some good side characters.  In particular, Shibasaki and Tezuka are interesting and I would have liked to see more of them, even though it wasn\'t as though they were sidelined or anything.+ Looks pretty good for being over 10 years old.  It\'s not perfect (see negatives section below) but generally looks solid.  The art style is very reminiscent of Archer as well, it\'s got a different look to it that you don\'t see very often.+ Ending was kind of nice.  I wasn\'t really feeling the love story between Kasahara and Dojo for most of the series, but they managed to hook me a little with some nice scenes in the last episode.Negatives:- Unlikeable main character.  It\'s very hard to root for Kasahara at points in this show.  She\'s incompetent and emotionally fragile, unable to handle simple criticism from a superior office or put up with a single day of mild hazing without crying.  She regularly displays poor judgment and puts others in danger because she doesn\'t think through the consequences of her actions.  She is constantly criticized for these things by her superiors and yet they still put her on an elite special forces team, despite the fact that she can\'t even reliably hit a large, stationary target during weapons training.  She messes things up constantly and is still shown favoritism and given duties and promotions far beyond her actual demonstrated capabilities, and then still whines about how her superiors are too mean to her when she fails.  She sucks and I didn\'t like her at all.- Tries to be too many different things at once.  This show tries to be a military action story, a shoujo rom com, and Fahrenheit 451-style social commentary all at once, and ends up not doing any of them particularly well.  The action scenes lack drama and the fact that dozens of people are shooting actual guns at each other for hours at a time and not a single person ever dies lends an air of absurdity to the whole thing.  The rom com aspect is not especially well done.  For some reason they decided to transport all the high school rom com tropes like blushing girls literally running away from their feelings into this series, which follows a military unit full of adults.  I fear for how well they will be able to defend freedom of expression from fascism if they can\'t even make eye contact with someone they have a crush on.- Uninspired and the social commentary lacks bite or purpose.  The Fahrenheit 451 type setting of this series is quite literally just a setting.  This series has nothing interesting or new to say on the subject.  The message is ""censorship bad, join your local library"" and that\'s it.  If you\'re watching this series expecting profound satire or political commentary, you will be sorely disappointed.- Strange animation problems.  Though the series mostly looks fine, there are some times when the character models get all wonky or look like they\'re moonwalking.  Kasahara in particular sometimes takes on a weirdly frumpy appearance when you see her walking around.- Lack of compelling villains.  The Media Cleansing Committee are just faceless thugs.  They seem sinister when they\'re first introduced in the opening episode, but only become less frightening with time.  They take L\'s constantly, never winning even one time during a confrontation over the course of the series.  They\'re Big Brother meets the Washington Generals.  They aren\'t threatening and you never feel as though they\'re a significant obstacle to the main characters.  Tezuka\'s brother occasionally shows flashes of being an interesting villain, but they never follow through on this and all of the tension dissipates when he exits the story for extended periods of time. jackbooted government thugs trying to do Fahrenheit 451 to their Clifford the Big Red Dog books is admirably goofy and unique.+ Some good side characters.

The seizing of Historical documents that portray the government unfavorably,  because if you don\'t know your history,  it\'s bound to repeat itself?  Yes.  A government military is created to hopefully stop thisArt:  Pretty Typical, much like Nodame Cantabile,  or Lovely Complex,...not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across.Sound:  Decent.  All there is to say.Character:  Characters exceed above all.  The character,  the main being...a tomboy? Eh, not not that.  Much more depth then just ""Tomboy.""  Not meta,  not loud,  a tombboy that truly just doesn\'t even know they are one.  Then,  of course we have what we are lead to believe is the love interest, but not much happens with it,  I would have liked for more to have happens,  but  eh..The ONE downside this anime had was that it was SO incredibly short, leaving no room for closure.  I would LOVE to see at least another 12 episodes.If it simply had 2 more episodes,  room for closure it would have made a 10, in my book. not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across.Sound:  Decent.

Libraries in the year 2019 have become militarized battle zones between the pro censorship group / against censorship group. You may first think this is really unrealistic but in the 21st century censorship is still a big problem around the globe. Books/movies/and other forms of media are deliberately censored/ blacklisted by governments. Aside from that the show is a cliched romantic comedy. Since it is a 12 episode series it felt kinda rushed as well but it is expected. If you think about it, this series would most likely...be banned in many countries lol.  Armed resistance against censorship.......... not very far from reality.Art: I loved the chibi artwork. It was very cute xP.  Although the animation wasn't stellar I personally liked it.Sound: I loved the opening and the ending isn't bad either.Character: Cliched characters but effective. Iku Kasahara, the female protagonist,  is a hotheaded girl that usually acts rashly on emotion and her beliefs rather than considering the consequences first. Atsushi Dojo ,her superior, and the main male protagonist is very protective of Kasahara and shows this through tough instruction and reprimand because he sees his old self in her. They soon find out that they are very like each other. The interactions between the characters are very heart warming and cute at times (because I'm a sucker for romance ;) )Enjoyment: I was looking for a decent anime to watch since I ran out of things to watch during the break. Despite the average marks I gave I personally enjoyed the series.Overall: Short, sweet and not too bad of a series. If you don't mind the cliched romance/comedy this is a great watch.STOP CENSORSHIP AROUND THE WORLD AND STOP SOPA!!!!!!!!!!Happy Holidays be banned in many countries lol.

Atsushi Dojo ,her superior, and the main male protagonist is very protective of Kasahara and shows this through tough instruction and reprimand because he sees his old self in her. They soon find out that they are very like each other. The interactions between the characters are very heart warming and cute at times (because I'm a sucker for romance ;) )Enjoyment: I was looking for a decent anime to watch since I ran out of things to watch during the break. Despite the average marks I gave I personally enjoyed the series.Overall: Short, sweet and not too bad of a series. If you don't mind the cliched romance/comedy this is a great watch.STOP CENSORSHIP AROUND THE WORLD AND STOP SOPA!!!!!!!!!!Happy Holidays"", ""Toshokon Sensou is a show about a war that takes place in the future between an army that enforces censorship on all forms of media and a force who ensure the safety of all books and media by creating a special task force to keep them safe.The show follows Kasahara Iku as she joins this Task Force, you will see her in her happiest times and her struggles with various people as well as finding love.Art/AnimationSome people might not like the art because it does use a thicker black border but personally i like it and it added nicely, the characters were all designed well,...the hairstyles and facial expressions were nice (i particulary liked Tezuka's (the younger brothers) character) The backgrounds are not anything brilliant but they fit nicely and are pleasing.The animation is smooth though i noticed gunfire hitting cars and vans in certain scenes seemed repeated.CharactersKasahara Iku is the protagonist of the show and the only character to really get any development, she joins the Library bevause of a 'Prince' from her past saved her, (how many time have i seen this before?) you can see her really grow from a below par recruit to a full fledged member of the squad. The other characters are all fun and get there moments, we only see a bit about Doujou when other charaters comment how similiar he is to Iku, Tezuka has the conflict with his brother and then there is Shibasaki who is a really good friend to Iku and helped herout numorous times, everyone else was nice and all had different personalities.SoundThe sound is pretty good, the opening is a really nice song and the ending is ok. The Seiyu's all performed there roles well and each actor fit there character, the background music was ok i noticed some techno/syth as well as some piano styles.OverallThis show has multiple genres and mixes them at different points, there's comedy, especially when Doujou tries to be nice, but the comedy never fully takes off and probably won't have you in stitches at any point, the drama is small and again never fully takes effect, there's also romance, this was my favorite part as the characters grew you can really see the romance blooming and the ending is really sweet. Oh and there's a whole tonne of action thrown in there.Toshokan Sensou is a fun enjoyable show that isn't too serious and will be enjoyed by a wide audience. the hairstyles and facial expressions were nice (i particulary liked Tezuka's (the younger brothers) character) The backgrounds are not anything brilliant but they fit nicely and are pleasing.The animation is smooth though i noticed gunfire hitting cars and vans in certain scenes seemed repeated.CharactersKasahara Iku is the protagonist of the show and the only character to really get any development, she joins the Library bevause of a 'Prince' from her past saved her, (how many time have i seen this before?) you can see her really grow from a below par recruit to a full fledged member of the squad.

You may be thinking, well duh, Luna. Get to the point! The point is: The actual director of this series, Takayuki Hamana, apart from the studio, hasn\'t worked on much.• This isn\'t always something that ruins a series. I mean, he did direct Beast Player Erin… which was a very concrete world-building series, but dry on all other aspects, like on...character building.• Library Wars suffers from the same issues, where the technical aspects are solid, but the characters, aside from the main two, don\'t get enough screen time. Even though there is a sweet romance between Iku and Atsushi.• I got bored of the same interactions of Iku being like, ""Hey, I\'m the loud, stubborn, impulsive tomboy."" And Atsushi responding with the atypical grumpy, male tsundere attitude. Often, having the habit of telling Iku that she\'s a monkey or that she looks better than usual, grumble grumble.• If a guy treated me like that in real life, I would for-sure dump him! ANYWAY, it was neat how the series was a callback to Orwell\'s 1989 and Bradbury\'s Fahrenheit with the media banning clause, issued by an oppressive government, but the show doesn\'t seem to know if it wants to be a childrens’ show or something for adults.• The characters use REAL guns in their war against the book burning faction, but no one actually dies. There\'s no mention of the government even taking serious action against the book-preserving faction EVEN AT THE CLIMAX at the end of the fucking sequel movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa, nor does any of the implied concerns ever escalate in the series.• I mean, c\'mon, even the infamously goofy Gundam SEED took itself more seriously with politics and there were protesters getting shot and killed by police because they didn\'t want genetically enhanced humans.• How am I supposed to take this (supposed) war against ideals seriously when the random people who are interviewed on the street in the Library Wars TV Series seem like they don\'t care about the armed feud between these people and the government?• Uh, people are shooting guns at each other over book censoring, I guess I\'m okay with it. I mean, I could understand if the people we\'re being silenced by the government, but the show makes no indication of this AT ALL!• One character gets shot thirty-two times and is still walking in the next episode, and of course when a character goes into a coma out of shock, they wake up! There is no realism and severity in this series, at least make a background character dieーfor christ sake!• I felt like I was watching a survival game or paintball match with how placid the atmosphere is, and it doesn\'t help that at the end of the movie, the law is changed so that the two factions can now only fight each other with… rubber bullets? What?• Girls und Panzer, which had girls in middle school sparring seriously in a tank equivalent of LARPING: got more real! Miho in Girls und Panzer even has PTSD from a tank match with her sister.• The matter of war being treated more like a game and the romcom aspect sticking out, made it impossible for me to take it seriously. If you like really nice animation, then it\'s definitely worth a watch but I felt the the beautiful visuals were wasted on a vapid, wishy-washy story that didn\'t know what it wanted to be, other than military fetishism.

I mean, it’s not every day you encounter a story about library war. However, as you watch it, you will surely understand the weight of the plot and what message it’s trying to give to the viewer. It shows how important it is for us to be informed and gain knowledge from books, magazines, internet, newspapers, tv shows, movies, and anime/manga. Without it, all of us would be kept in the dark of what really is happening to the world. But more importantly, it shows that we should fight for it. Having rules doesn’t necessarily...that it is the right thing to follow. Considering human beings by nature has a very different way of perceiving things. But what’s important is to fight for what you believe in which what the story is trying to tell us. It is also nice how well the romance part is incorporated to the main plot. With that all said, I still find it so weird that it is obviously a war but when the time is up they would cease fire and gather together as if they weren’t killing each other beforehand.I just love strong female characters. I am so fed up with typical female leads who are usually frail, weak, indecisive, so naïve, and always need a knight and shining armor. Compared from before, women have more balls now. So it is definitely inspiring to see women doing great in a man’s world. Plus, I just love how unique the relationship of the two leads have. It shows that being romantic doesn’t have to be overly dramatic, cheesy, corny, or lewd.It is very rare and unusual yet very original anime. Though, I admit that it is not exciting and entertaining enough to be remembered. I didn’t get involve with the story which is not an indication of memorable series.

If you are a little sick and tired of the regular run-of-the-mill, clichéd anime shows out there, then boy do I have a gem of an anime to recommend to you guys! Toshokan Sensou or Library Wars is the perfect solution to break up that anime monotony. It\'s an intelligently written, 12 episode series that\'s got a small cast so you don’t have to wrack your brains trying to remember 42 million characters. It\'s got comedy, action, romance and even some political intrigue! It\'s done by Studio IG, the same people who animated the Ghost in the Shell series. So visually it\'s very...nice, I recommend watching it in HD if you can. Eventho it\'s about a war don\'t expect heavy duty blood and gore, like I said this show is more comedy and romance with it\'s moments of high action and gunfire...and the best part is the story is original, which is what Japanese anime [on the whole] does best!#ARTI think the art is amazing in this short series, many times I found myself rewinding and looking at stuff and going “WOW!” Everything looked clean and very crisp and a lot of detail was given to many inanimate objects that lent credibility to the setting, for example, the appearance of the books and magazines in the book stores or library. A lot of consideration went into them having their own unique cover art designs and typeface...they didn\'t just make books a generic colour or they all had the same font. I dunno if it\'s because I watched in HD but I was so very impressed by just how detailed everything looked!! Especially in episode 6: the trains, the bridge and the underpass, the breath coming fron their mouths as they\'re speaking, and so on.There\'s also brilliant uses of lighting and shadow, angles and perspective, from wide shots to close-knit and cramped that really made you feel like you were a part of the action and emphasized dramatic moments. Personally I liked the thick ink lines around the characters, they were a pretty good marker about how tense or how comedic a scene was, and the more comedic or stronger the emotions were, the thicker the lines got which is way better than constantly going into CHIBI-MODE. The animation was smooth, top of the line stuff! Back to episode 6 again and the way the ""camera"" view bounced as Iku and Mikihisa [and us the viewers as well] were looking out the rear window at the pursuing car. Little details like that impress me but then I expected no less from Studio IG.#SOUNDThe sound was pretty standard to me. Nothing was terrible but nothing evoked any type of strong feeling from me. I watched the show in Japanese and so naturally I expect nothing to go wrong with it but since I don\'t speak Japanese...who can say? The OP and ED themes are pretty much your standard guitar pop songs you hear in most shonen anime.#STORYAnother BIG selling point for me is the story! I love, loVE, LOVE an original story!!! No, wars are not original per se, but this one is because it\'s a civil war about books! I don\'t know much about the Japanese political system, but I guess it would be something akin to the “Federal” government putting a ban on books and being able to barge in and confiscate mass quantities of printed works regardless of whether they had educational or literary value or not. However due to a tragic event at one library where 12 people were killed, the government on the “State” or city level felt they could no longer tolerate things as they are and so they\'ve armed their libraries in defence of ""federal"" intrusion...at least that\'s how I\'m able to process it.Library War isn\'t totally about this, it\'s about this one girl Iku Kasahara and her desire to defend these book stores and libraries and fight censorship, which connects squarely with the activist within me. But it isn\'t all heavy doom-and-gloom stuff, this is actually a funny series that reminds me very much of PlanetES, the way it kind of mixes the humour with the tenser moments. I know for some people it might not make sense for there to be war, combat, romance and comedy...but really this isn\'t new to anime for example Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo both have mixed fighting and tense moments with comedy. Full Metal Panic had romance amid all the gunfire and bloodshed....and a whole bunch of comedy!! So there should be no reason why a person can\'t process this anime in the same way.From what I understand, this anime is based off of a series of novels and as an avid reader myself, I can tell you nothing surpasses the level of depth and details a book can provide. Yet this anime does give it a good try though by capturing a lot of what the protagonist, Iku, was thinking and feeling. You will laugh at the funny parts and be anxious at the serious parts and that\'s what a good story is supposed to have you do.I do feel that there wasn\'t enough time to tell the whole story and some elements were either left open-ended or unexplored....and I do have to take points off of that, but overall this was an original and intelligent story and the anime captures that well.#CHARACTERSWith only 12 episodes [and a special OVA] to work with, there really wasn\'t a lot of room for character development for each and every character in the series. A lot of it was dedicated to the central character, Iku Kasahara, a somewhat earnest and idealistic young lady who possesses a strong sense of justice and vehemently opposes censorship [well at least as far as books are concerned]. She starts out with very romantic notions of how the war against censorship was being fought, that all she had to do was flash a badge and people will back off and respect her. We learn along with her that there is way more to it than that, that the battles against censorship are quite literally battles and sometimes your life is at stake. This to me makes her character and the story itself very interesting since this isn\'t about some hotshot know-it-all, there is some actual self-discovery involved.We also learn that there\'s a lot more to Mr. Cool-Calm & Perfect, Hikaru Tezuka, who does give Iku a hard time in the beginning but all isn\'t as it seems [I won\'t go into it beyond that] and he does eventually warm up to Iku.Instructor Dojo is probably my favourite character maybe because he starts out very angry and hostile but then you realise that most of it is really superficial, that he really is nice and that he really cares for Iku. He\'s short which I found very funny because his voice [and his stern face] makes him seem so much larger than his actual height. Also because of the way he\'s drawn, his frame being thicker than Iku and his waist being lower than hers. He was pretty much drawn with the same head size and upper body proportion as Hikaru and Mikihisa but his waist fell below the screen border which gave the appearance like maybe he was walking around on his knees or something. But I guess that it was meant to be ironic that he was that short.Overall each character, no matter how small the role, had some sort of depth or at the very least some credibility to them; from the good natured, always smiling Mikihisa to the beautiful and very intelligent Asako. There was not a character I didn\'t like, not even Satoshi, but I do think we weren\'t given the opportunity to like or dislike Satoshi because that character wasn\'t explored enough...I really do wish this was a 26 episode anime.#VERDICTWithout a doubt this should have had a second season and gone up to 26 or even 52 episodes! This type of inventive anime is now a dying breed and a must see for those of us that appreciate original and creative stories. I do think the ending was somewhat rushed with some loose ends still hanging, nonetheless I was still impressed by the lovely art and animation and the originality and intelligence of the story. nice, I recommend watching it in HD if you can.

First of all there’s none of the bad anime cliches I’ve grown to loathe over the years in it. Sure Iku Kasahara does her fair share of yelling about what’s right and just in this world, but most of the time that’s shut down by the other characters who remind her (and us the viewer) that the real world is more shades of grey than black or white. It’s not outrageous cyber punk nor is it rife with needless fanservice. It...features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions. It has action, comedy, heart and tense drama in a perfect blend. It’s like the perfect anime. And the characters are adults with realistic character designs, something of a rarity these days. But the real reason I loved this series so much is I loathe censorship. I find it has no real place in a civilized free society other than to stifle free thought and discourage ideals the government fears. If this bollocks really occurred I’d be among the first to sign up for the Library Force. Even in this series the criteria for what is and isn’t to be censored is vague and arbitrary. One person doesn’t like it so no one can ever see it again. This struck a personal chord with me for all the right reasons. My only complaint is, t’s short at only 12 episodes, features a strong female lead who isn’t objectified. It’s the kind of anime you should offer as a gateway anime to those looking to explore the genre. So watch it if you love freedom, watch it if you love anime, watch it if you're tired of cliched anime, watch it if you’re a human being. features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions.

The idea, although not unique, is handled in a very special way. It's a combination of slice of life and romance, with a few action and comedy moments.The main idea, - of two factions fighting and having legal permission to do so, - does seem a bit unrealistic. The pacing is really slow in the beginning. I had to wait for 4 episodes to finally get invested in the characters and the overall plot. But the rest of the series, including the movie, were worth it.Characters are just great, in...my opinion. To some they may appear average, but let's be honest: real people are like that too. And we see a lot of positive development which is very inspiring. At least it was to me. Of course, primarily it goes for Kasahara (the protagonist), but I also liked the fact that Dojo had to go through similar experience. Other characters are also interesting. My favourites are: Komaki, Orikuchi, Inamine and Kasahara's Dad.Animation is good for it's time and it doesn't really bother me in most cases. I like to focus on the plot and characters: and as I've said, they were nice.I never really noticed the music which is definitely not bad. But since nothing really stood out to me I'd say it's ok. The same goes for the opening and ending themes.On the whole, it was an enjoyable experience for me. The series manages to find the balance between the dark themes and the comedy moments. This adds tension to the story but keeps it light-hearted. If you're looking for something not too serious and you liked the premise: this might be the series for you. my opinion.

This was also the start of my admiration of Tomoaki Maeno when I had no idea who he was, the voice actor of our Doujou.Story, I don\'t even remember or know how I gave this a try but I do remember the fact that this wasn\'t my usual style, especially with army/military theme or cliche. I was able to broaden up my taste of theme even more. Book burning, restriction, censoring, librarians defending back,...media influence, by being a bit of a book/manga person I am, this cliche hit me right in the spot. Setting is realistic enough so it serves as an extra bonus.Art, no biggy as usual.Sound, the OP/ED songs were pretty easy going for me, the soundtracks were the same as well, I did enjoy it and it did keep the anime flowing decently so my 7\'s there.Character, the heroine, our Iku, she pretty much joined because she was inspired and in a nutshell, wants to meet her man who protected her. She starts shaping up from her mistakes, and I quite like her personality in overall except that one scene where she almost rebelled against her mom. Our hero, I relate to this because seeing a ""past version"" of you, is very nostalgic in a bad sense especially if you want to get over it (lol). The rest of the characters were very good too, I don\'t want to go on with this, they\'re crucial to the series after all. This gets my 8 for sure.Enjoyment, I definitely loved it with no regrets and rewatching is fun for me.Overall, my usual routine is to only suggest to a general viewer, or unless I know someone who\'s taste might be similar to mine and or I can see a theme to their taste.

The premise of the story was very interesting and unusual, so it was a little amazing how they still managed to fit so many cliches and predictable moments into the plotline.What I disliked the most about this anime was the main character, Kasahara. As the first female member of the pseudo-military library task force, she had the potential to be a really strong, interesting character. Instead she is incompetent, impulsive, naive, uneducated, disrespected, and frequently ends up in...situations where she has to be rescued by her male counterparts. Around episode 11 or 12 her character starts to become more mature and capable, but that is when the anime ends. If they were going to write her character the way they did, I would have liked to at least had more episodes occur after her character begins to develop. situations where she has to be rescued by her male counterparts.

It’s all very light and fluffy as the series focuses on the characters rather than dwelling on the whole censorship war that is the setting. Basically the premise is that this is a world were censorship of books and the media is a big issue and two factions are perfectly willing to spill blood over books and freedom of the press. Its in this climate that Kasahara Iku decides to join the Library Task Force to follow in the footsteps of...her ‘Prince’ who saves her and her favourite book when she was younger…..yeah I know it sounds rubbish, but believe me Toshokan Sensou is really entertaining!I got major Full Metal Panic vibes from the series – mainly due to the military setting and the emphasis on romcom rather than combat. Not that there isn’t any action, there is plenty, but its not the main focus. The characters are the driving force for this anime, Iku and her relationship with her superior Atsushi is deeply amusing in a Lovely Complex way and the supporting cast is also lots of fun. The only bad thing about the show is its too short. We’ve just got to know the characters and started to be interested in the background plot and then its over – with this kind of pacing it would have been better off being a 26 episode series rather than 12.ANIMATION: Excellent animation as one would expect from Production IG. I really liked the thick black outlines for the characters and the use of chibi’s to enhance the comedy. The action set pieces were really well put together and the backgrounds showed fabulous attention to detail. Unremarkable, but well drawn character design too. No complaints about the production quality at all.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I loved the ED in particular; the OP is pretty decent too. Background music is also good. Voice acting is excellent – everyone is very well cast, especially loved Iku’s voice.So yeah at 1st glance the concept seem a bit on the odd side, but Toshokan Sensou turned out to be a fun if forgetable show with an enjoyable script and nice character interactions. her ‘Prince’ who saves her and her favourite book when she was younger…..yeah I know it sounds rubbish, but believe me Toshokan Sensou is really entertaining!I got major Full Metal Panic vibes from the series – mainly due to the military setting and the emphasis on romcom rather than combat.

Doesn’t it sound familiar to Fahrenheit 451? Isn’t it relevant to the recent Act Japan voted in order to censor several works of fiction? Isn’t this a social-political heavy story around law-given liberties?And the answer is no, it...isn’t; it is just an excuse to place the main characters in a situation where they need to team together for the same goal. The whole premise is handled very lightly, it is hardly exploited beyond the obvious, and it is usually thrown aside for comedy and romance. In effect, it is just a lure to watch a romance with a pretext. And before you think of anything else YES IT WORKS! Romances work fine as long as they have something other than high schools (gah, how I hate those) and the characters have some sort of goal or objective that keeps them together (other than being forced to go to the same school every day that is and study hard to pass in the same college). So there you go, this time it is in libraries, and they are armed and trained to defend the bookshelves from opposing oppressors of free thought or something.As I said, it is just a cool premise; nothing too violent or important ever happens and it is mostly stereotypical comedy and romance. Which is just fine if you realize the target audience is GIRLS and not BOYS and thus there is very little violence and lots of romance. There is action too, but it is cartoony and aimed at destroying books and not at killing or injuring people. For the same reason, you must love books or be a strong supporter of liberties, or even the premise won’t work and the whole thing will backfire as being completely stupid. A WAR FOR BOOKS? And since it never tries to be serious or delves deep into politics and morals, it is a hit or miss if it works.Besides that the characters are you standard shoujo fair, the dynamic female protagonist who is otherwise frail and in constant need of her super handsome commander… and some others. Yup, it is basically a two-character show with the rest flavouring it with silly action and goofy comedy. It works to place everything in a context (other that goddamn schools) and to have a theme while everything unfolds predictably but also nicely and end rather satisfactory after 12 episodes. It is still very basic as a whole, and all secondary characters are left undeveloped and always easily acknowledged as either good (supporters of books) or bad (trashers of the former). It would be really cool to see some reasoning behind the baddies and some actual political implications but NAH nothing of the sort happens.I leave for last the production values which are nothing much in terms of background details or cinematics. To the most part everything looks ok and even crossfire scenes lack overall tragedy or excitement. There are also no exceptional music pieces or memorable voice action and the comedy is almost ever-present to make things appear even more simplistic with deformity and cartoony violence.So as a whole it is not a great show but if you get past the stupid logic of WAR FOR BOOKS then you get a nice time waster.

The title\'s main focus is on new recruit Iku Kasahara, who learns of the challenges that go into the fight against censorship with the defense force and putting up with the rigid training of her instructor Atsushi Dojo.To a good extent, Library War is focused on the regular operations of the Library Team Defense Force as they handle different...censorship cases against government military forces and supporters of the censorship policies they enforce. The premise of the series will seem quite similar to the dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451 in the censorship of books enforced between both works. However, Library War has a somewhat more lighter mood in comparison as it balances social commentary on issues related to censorship with the camaraderie taking place with Library Defense Force members. Episodes of the series mix around focus on exploring characters within the Defense Force, while also looking into the cases they take on when protecting libraries and anti-censorship public figures from government agents trying to enforce the censorship bill. Many of the characters get fleshing out and the series does quite well at showing off the challenges faced by the Defense Force with fending off censorship efforts and public opinion on the issue.In spite of its somewhat unique premise though, Library War does have its faults. Some characters like Dojo and Iku\'s roommate don\'t get much in the way of fleshing out and there are points where Iku\'s idealistic and impulsive character can be grating with her ""rush first, think later"" mentality to action. Also for a series dabbling into action, the visuals to Library War are average and the animation occasionally suffers from inconsistencies, poor clashing with the subpar CG renderings of vehicles and degraded details during more intense moments within the series.Still in spite of its issues, Library War is a solid series exploring anime\'s own spin of Fahrenheit 451\'s premise with a lighter mood and having more focus on those resisting the efforts of censorship being instituted by the government. censorship cases against government military forces and supporters of the censorship policies they enforce.

The best way to compare this anime is with the famous book Fahrenheit 451, but Japan style and I must say it works. The story is entertaining, it has dramatic moments, some comedy, the characters are deep enough to understand why they act and think the way they do. So I recommend it, I just have to add that it is better to watch it for the anti-censorship plot than for the romance, since...although the romance is there, it is the least important and is not as present as other themes.As a bonus, I suggest that for it to feel like a satisfying conclusion, you'll really have to see the movie, a sequel that delivers what one as a viewer wants. although the romance is there, it is the least important and is not as present as other themes.As a bonus, I suggest that for it to feel like a satisfying conclusion, you'll really have to see the movie, a sequel that delivers what one as a viewer wants."", ""WARNING THE FOLLOWING REVIEW IS BASED SOLELY OF THE OPINION OF ONE PERSON. PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS PERSON'S OPINION EFFECT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD VIEW THIS ANIME.Toshokan Sensou or Library Wars in English is a Japanese anime rated PG-13.It aired in the spring of 2008 and is mainly a genre of action and comedy. Library Wars may make you think about boring, but this anime is far from it.The story takes place in 2019 where the Media Enhancement Act censor all forms of media they feel is corrupt. To protect the libraries...and people a second organization called the Library Corps was formed with military Task Force. The story revolves around Kasahara, Lt. Doujou, Shibaski, and the rest of the people in the Kantou Base Library Corp. The story is one of the most original as I have never read nor watch a story quite like it. Props to the author who though of such a brilliant story. The story is fast paced, but gives you vital information so the viewers would not be confused. Sometimes the Library Corps are on the verge of losing and you could feel yourself rooting for them. As a story it brings out emotions and is relate able to people of all ages. The message is freedom and how even in this society sometimes we do not have it. I love the message and I feel other people would like it as well.The art is not like your typical anime characters and even though I am not an artist myself you can see the perfect outlines on some of the settings. The creator must have spent great time in the creation of the art because it looksoutstanding.The sound is great. I feel the VA(Voice Actors) in this anime did a superb job. You do not feel like they are reading off a script, but as if they are the characters themselves. I did not listen to the whole theme songs off this anime, but based off what I heard the theme songs seem catchy and fit the mood of the anime. Some theme songs are opposite to what they anime is about. As for OST'S I felt it gave the anime the extra edge to make the mood understandable.The characters were the only thing I was skeptical about. Not that the characters were bad, but I felt they were cliche. Kasahara was the naive girl who inspires people even though she is horrible at book work. Lt. Doujou was the commander that often fought and teased Kasahara, but always tried to protect her. I could go on, but there are too many cliche characters. Still even though they were a little cliche you would fall in love with the characters because they had characteristics that we all possess.Overall, I did enjoy the anime and finished it in two days.

I was looking for a good anime with a tsundere type character and a decent romance line.  This caught my eye mainly by the reviews on myanimelist.  So I watched it and it began to intrigue me.  It never pulled me fully in but it did introduce me to the manga which made me OBSESSED!I get it, manga will always usually reign supreme as it doesn't have the restrictions anime do.  However, there were some...key elements from the manga that were really ignored in the anime.  In the manga there are certain actions that pull the main two characters together and really get you rooting for them.  This anime had that but not in the same way.  Some bits felt a bit rushed and the whole relationship building the two main characters have was merely gone in the anime, to a point that you couldn't feel as invested in their relationship as you would in the manga.Either way give it a try and definitely...DEFINITELY go read the manga!  It's amazing and still continuing on!  We need a bigger fanbase as currently it is a pretty small group of fans for what is a wonderful story. key elements from the manga that were really ignored in the anime.

To think that books would cause a war, right? With shooting and bullets and guns and boot camp. Even with ""war"", it keeps a semi-light hearted tone, it\'s kind of hard to describe but to me ""stringy"" sounds good. It doesn\'t get gritty or bloody and it\'s not a rom-com, but it has slapstick moments, an in-betweener, I suppose.It\'s been said before with a handful of anime (I know Kuroko\'s Basketball had this problem) but it applies...here as well. Every episode starts with a recap of the synopsis (basically what I already told you) and then the OP and then a recap of the episode before it, which in this day and age we can just skip it but it\'s still annoying for it to take up the first 2-3 minutes.In just that first episode, you\'re introduced to the motivation, the key players, the goal and the opportunity to achieve that goal but also opportunity for learning. This series is based around Kasaharu, who falls victim to the Media Cleansing Act while going to the book store to retrieve the new issue of her favorite book series. Come to find out, that book is being banned so she protects it. It\'d be interesting to see her sneak out with it but no, someone comes by as a part of the Library Defense Force and claims the book/shop in the name of the great library.The story kind of continues from there and episodes do build off of each other by including plot threads but it\'s not a deep storyline or anything, it\'s light. The idea is that there are all these events that sort of give Kasahara reason to grow and change so that she may approach a certain situation in the last episode differently than what she would have at the beginning of the series, which is cool and all for that pay off but I feel like it could\'ve been a bit smoother and engaged in its narrative.Because other than Kasahara, the characters don\'t get a whole lot. As I said, the filler type episodes can have Kasahara team up with someone such as Shibasaki or Tezuka and they might get their own little thing here or there but that\'s about it. They introduce who seems to be a promising major villain that isn\'t even associated with the Cleansing Force but he doesn\'t show up until (I\'m pretty sure it was Episode 8) out of 12 and shows up very sparingly after that one ep. Now this could\'ve been taken farther with a S2, except there isn\'t one, this is just part of the story, both the manga and light novels go farther but honestly, I wasn\'t interested in it enough for an S2 anyway.In the end, it doesn\'t innovate the concept a whole lot, leaving it to feel pretty bland and shallow with its content, same with its visual style. It could\'ve had a message like ""love blooms on a battlefield"" or ""find beauty in a battlefield"" anything that could\'ve been built but it takes as broad strokes as it can. I like the challenging rules standpoint but it needs more. From what I see, people who read the manga and novels don\'t like it anyway so maybe it\'s better there. What I can imagine happened is that there are two different mangas (Love is War and Spitfire) which take two different tones and they figured why not combine the two for an anime since ran along side them but I honestly don\'t know since I haven\'t read them, that\'s just a theory. here as well.

The idea is that there are all these events that sort of give Kasahara reason to grow and change so that she may approach a certain situation in the last episode differently than what she would have at the beginning of the series, which is cool and all for that pay off but I feel like it could\'ve been a bit smoother and engaged in its narrative.Because other than Kasahara, the characters don\'t get a whole lot. As I said, the filler type episodes can have Kasahara team up with someone such as Shibasaki or Tezuka and they might get their own little thing here or there but that\'s about it. They introduce who seems to be a promising major villain that isn\'t even associated with the Cleansing Force but he doesn\'t show up until (I\'m pretty sure it was Episode 8) out of 12 and shows up very sparingly after that one ep. Now this could\'ve been taken farther with a S2, except there isn\'t one, this is just part of the story, both the manga and light novels go farther but honestly, I wasn\'t interested in it enough for an S2 anyway.In the end, it doesn\'t innovate the concept a whole lot, leaving it to feel pretty bland and shallow with its content, same with its visual style. It could\'ve had a message like ""love blooms on a battlefield"" or ""find beauty in a battlefield"" anything that could\'ve been built but it takes as broad strokes as it can. I like the challenging rules standpoint but it needs more. From what I see, people who read the manga and novels don\'t like it anyway so maybe it\'s better there. What I can imagine happened is that there are two different mangas (Love is War and Spitfire) which take two different tones and they figured why not combine the two for an anime since ran along side them but I honestly don\'t know since I haven\'t read them, that\'s just a theory.']"

I looked up info about it and decided to watch the first episode on a whim...and boy, am I glad I did! Seriously, what the hell is this anime?! Where did it come from?! And why is it so friggin' amazing?! Yoru no Kuni, meant to be some kind of animated promotional vehicle for the singer Aimer's newest album, directed by some dude named Ryo-timo (real name Ryosuke Sawa, who worked on shows like Noein and Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad), completely took...me and a lot of other people by surprise. I, and many others, thought this would be 11-13 episodes at most, though the episodes came out at a rather slow pace, but that was okay with us. Buuuuut then the announcement came that Yoru no Kuni was only going to have three episodes. Seriously, what the fuck?! This anime deserves way more than just three episodes!! Who the hell decided that was a good idea?! In case you couldn't tell, I'm pissed off because this, to me, is a very strong contender for one of the absolute best anime that ever came out in 2021.But enough bitching about this anime's short episode length, what's Yoru no Kuni even about? Well, in this anime, a mysterious avian being called Yoru inhabits the world of the night, and sometimes people get magically transported into his world while sleeping (Or Yoru goes into their dreams. The anime isn't very clear about it, and I think it's intentionally left to open to interpretation), and Yoru's job is to gently help them come to terms with whatever problem they're dealing with. It's basically like Infinity Train (The Cartoon Network show, not the Demon Slayer movie) in that the characters of the day have a problem, get transported to Yoru's dominion, and have to learn to come to terms with their problem, sometimes with Yoru's help, sometimes not. The story isn't very linear, but more episodic in nature, and each episode focuses on a different character, namely a little girl dealing with the loss of her pet, a middle schooler coping with jealousy over her friend wanting to expand their friend circle, and an adult woman who can't seem to hold down a job and is insecure about how her life will turn out.Of course, the obvious thing that stands out about this anime is...well, the animation. There's this almost painting-like style to it, with crayon-esque shooting stars, picturesque watercolor hillsides, luminous butterflies, swirly trees, and so on. Not only is everything lusciously animated, from character movement to the dazzling spectacles on display when the characters of the day come to terms with their problems, everything has its own unique texture, and not once does the world feel sterile or like a cardboard cut-out. Yoru no Kuni is a series about dreams, and I think in that aspect, it succeeds in creating a perfect, dream-like atmosphere, and the bright visuals don't so much dazzle you as they do careess your eyes with its storybook-like animation. The music is pretty good here as well. There isn't a lot of it, contributing to the series' emphasis on ambience and atmosphere, and the insert songs are all well-timed, well-sung, and are always saved for just the right moment, allowing for stronger impact and emotional catharsis when the characters resolve their issues.Being a shorter web series, Yoru no Kuni goes for a character-of-the-day approach, where every episode focuses on a different singular person, with the only main character among them being Yoru. While the human characters aren't exactly the most three-dimensional or layered, they feel realistic, and their problems are down-to-earth, relatable, and true to life, even within the context of the fantastical setting. Even Yoru, who we know the least about throughout the entire series, is likeable, as he's basically some kind of magical monster therapist who gives advice and helps when his charges ask, but never patronizes them and gently nudges them towards their resolution without being forceful or overbearing. He's simply there if they need him, and he helps them when they ask for it, acting as a sort of guide for them. The anime doesn't try to answer any questions about him, and there is a lot we don't know about Yoru. What is he? Where does he come from? What's his overall purpose? Why does he help these people? What does he even gain from helping them? Is he a cog in a machine, a part of something bigger, or does he help people because he wants to? Is it even out of genuine kindness or due to some ulterior motive?The series, being relatively episodic, doesn't have much in the way of a grand narrative. It's just an avian monster helping people with their issues. It really says something when any flaws it has don't really have anything to do with its overall quality. I want to know more about Yoru, the people he helps, and his world, and three episodes isn't anywhere near enough to tell this kind of story. Again, the fact that it's so short is its biggest drawback. I don't know whether it's short length is due to it being cancelled, budget constraints, if Ryo-timo was made to cancel it or if he wanted to leave it this way, other stuff behind the scenes, or maybe it wasn't popular enough. Who knows at this point? Neither Ryo-timo nor Aimer have mentioned anything about the reasons behind its short length, and I'm admittedly still pissed about it, but whatever the case, I'm glad we got Yoru no Kuni at all. In only three episodes it's able to do what most anime that have twice as many, maybe even more, are unable to. All of its characters are compelling, the animation is striking, the story that we have is really nice, and it's just a good, wholesome time killer you can use to waste half an hour if you feel like it. This kind of concept has so much potential for exploration and other ideas, and it's a shame it ended its run so soon, as I feel like more could be done with Yoru no Kuni. Then again, that's what fan fics are for!For what it is, though, Yoru no Kuni is a damn good piece of fine art that deserves way more appreciation than it gets.

I don\'t write reviews since I\'m too lazy to write, but this anime needs some attention, so this is my first review. (it\'s not gonna be that long)This is such a unique anime for me because it\'s not like any other mainstream anime such us today, and it\'s just shocking that it\'s not well known considering it\'s a short anime with such a fantastic narrative and heartwarming story.The third episode hit me like a truck, It\'s just so relatable. Finding the path on what you\'d love to do, you...work hard to be the best, but realized you can\'t beat talent and being average is just your limit. It\'s just the harsh reality you have to face and you have nothing to do but accept it. You question yourself ""Is the path I chose really the right one?"", you can\'t help but feel regret, anxiety and panic. Some people say it\'s going to be alright. just be yourself. I didn\'t listen until I\'d suddenly stumbled upon this anime. I teared up a little on how beautiful and amazing this anime is.I don\'t watch short animes but this is an exception, this is just a beautifully heartwarming anime for me.

It\'s not exactly breaking new ground, but what it does is impressive, showcasing some excellent visuals that evoke storybooks and providing a mental space for its characters to work through issues relating to acceptance, whether that includes acceptance of life events, of others and their choices, or of yourself in the face of rejection. And they\'re handled with appropriate depth and breadth as Yoru walks with varying ages of girls and women as they go through what are often difficult stages in their lives. Yoru is just kind of there...as a guide, meant to enhance the visual aspects without contributing much beyond little insights and expositing, but the character is functional, albeit a little simple. It\'s beautifully realized, the music, given that it\'s Aimer, is consistently strong, and some of the messages, especially from the third piece, are very strongly delivered.I\'m not super fond of the ""I worked this out in a dream"" type of story-telling, and while I keep in mind that these are shorts that are somewhat limited in their abilities to tell about what happens beyond a very short timeframe, things do feel a little too neatly wrapped up for the first two stories, especially, both of which I think are pretty but only just fine.But again, it\'s the third piece that does it for me. Following a character who has already had this experience far back in her rear view mirror trying to rediscover what she learned in the face of the more complex difficulties of adulthood was powerful and anchors the work well, driving home the message that acceptance, both of ourselves and of the lives we live, is a journey.This is one of the more underrated treasures I\'ve seen recently, and deserves more attention. as a guide, meant to enhance the visual aspects without contributing much beyond little insights and expositing, but the character is functional, albeit a little simple.

While other kids were playing sports or socializing during recess, I would often lie down at the nearest bench, and simply imagine. A fantasy world empowered by the wonders of magic. A desperate expedition to gather the remaining heroes and conquer the forces of evil. The limitless bounds of my imagination back then stretched as far as my creativity could go, conjuring up fantastical universes and settings.Then I received a game for Christmas, unaware of how it would completely change my life: Super Mario Galaxy. I watched Mario explore the cold and empty, yet warm...and comforting vastness of outer space, embarking on a voyage to the various galaxies all across the universe. I remember sitting down in the Observatory, simply gazing at the wonderous universe in front of me. Super Mario Galaxy showed me the power of imagination and how fictional media could breathe life into magical, mystical worlds. It was an experience like no other.Life moves on, though, and as I got older, that imaginative spark I once had had started to fade. I became swept up in ""adult"" issues and concerns, constantly looking towards the future while neglecting the once-cherished memories of the past. I was lonely and struggled to make friends, often electing to keep to myself.Eventually, I got back in the spirit of consuming more media, and turned my head towards anime and manga, hoping to find that imaginative spark that I had lost in the early years of my life. I eagerly churned through as much anime as possible: the highly-recommended ones, the high-scoring ones, the ones with interesting premises, etc. A few of these anime were able to re-ignite the spark, but none had been able to re-invigorate the imaginative fire that I had been yearning to revive for years. Eventually, I had come to terms with the fact that I\'d probably never find that one special anime for my heart.Then I heard that for the Spring 2021 season, an ONA was coming out on YouTube called Yoru no Kuni. The synopsis was vague and the poster art wasn\'t super up my alley, but as an avid shortfilm watcher, I gave it a shot. What I didn\'t know at the time was that I\'d finally find that one special anime that I had always been searching for, the anime that would ignite the embers in my heart and revive the imaginative fire that I had lost in my childhood.------------Yoru no Kuni is a series of short episodes, each of which are about a person who enters the ""Night World"", a place inside every person\'s heart. The Night World contains all the memories and things that the person had left behind in the past. Although the Night World is dark, it is truly beautiful, as every person who enters it comes to see. Yoru is the creature that guides these people through the Night World, as he helps guide the person through their intrapersonal struggles.The first thing to talk about is Yoru no Kuni\'s art style. Yoru no Kuni employs a very imaginative and distinct art style, feeling very dream-like with its pastel colors and warm lighting. It feels more like Nintendo (ex. Kirby, The Legend of Zelda) than an actual anime art style, which gives it a nostalgic feeling. Similarly, the lighting used in this show is captivating. The Night World never feels intimidating or scary thanks to the beautiful warm lighting employed in its shots, showing the beauty of the Night World. Though the Night World is dark, every person that enters it comes to realize its awe-striking beauty.The second thing to talk about is Yoru no Kuni\'s storytelling. Despite its short runtime, Yoru no Kuni manages to tell unique and emotional stories with each episode. The stories are intrapersonal, not interpersonal, which is crucial. In so much anime, characters\' struggles are often marked with interpersonal conflicts: someone has social anxiety or is introverted? It\'s because of bullying and/or abuse, and hardly ever due to the person\'s own psychological problems. Someone has depression? Probably because of bullying and/or a death of a loved one. Although anime and manga often approach these inner-emotion topics, they often take the easy route of pointing the finger on malicious/evil characters to get the audience to sympathize with the MC, but as a result, intrapersonal conflicts are neglected and ignored. People like me who\'ve never been bullied yet still has social anxiety and depression problems can often feel like that there\'s few media that can represent them.Yoru no Kuni manages to tackle these topics from a unique angle with how intrapersonal the character\'s problems are. These characters have no ""big bad/evil character"" or ""melodramatic tragic event"" at the cause of their problems: rather, their problems are moreso an inner emotional and psychological struggle. In Episode 2, the character we follow is not the wants-to-be-nice-to-everyone friend, it\'s the friend who\'s jealous, a bystander-type and has malicious thoughts, yet is still very sympathizable. These characters don\'t follow your typical Main Character insert/hero archetypes, and that\'s what makes them great: they feel human, like they could\'ve been any one of us.Third is the messaging, both from Yoru and the Night World. Yoru is the constant character between all episodes, as the eternal dweller of the Night World and everyone\'s hearts. Yoru has an initially-imposing character design, but one line in from the legendary VA Suwabe Junichi is all you need to know that Yoru is meant there as an ally, not an enemy. Yoru helps people with their problems, similar to Mushishi\'s Ginko or Natsume Yuujinchou\'s Natsume, but what\'s unique about Yoru is that Yoru doesn\'t directly offer solutions to the people he\'s guiding. Rather, he indirectly offers advice to help guide the person forward, giving unique guidance (ex. ""It\'s okay to run away.""). As I said before, these stories are intrapersonal, so Yoru helps the people along the way, but it is up to the person themselves to come to the solution to their personal struggle. The struggles are rarely resolved fully by the end of the story, but that\'s arguably the beauty of it: human struggles are rarely overcome by a single realization, but simply arriving at an answer is a big step forward.Fourth and finally, the personal nostalgia that this anime envoked in me. Ever since Super Mario Galaxy captured my heart 14 years ago, I thought nothing would ever re-capture the feelings I had playing that game. But it\'s here with Yoru no Kuni. The Night World of Yoru no Kuni is dark, lonely, and sometimes empty, much like the vast openness of outer space in Super Mario Galaxy. But much like SMG, Yoru no Kuni manages to find comfort and beauty in its dark world. Similarly, at the end of SMG, there\'s an ending cutscene with Rosalina that talks about the beauty of death: even though familiar things may end, new things will start anew, hence the cycle of life of our universe. Yoru no Kuni talks about a similar theme, the beauty of goodbyes: we see each person, right as they are about to leave the Night World, ask Yoru ""Will I see you again?"", and it hits me like a truck as I\'m reminded that this\'ll be the last interaction we\'ll see between the two characters for a long, long time (maybe never again). Yet the farewells here are treated with reverence and hope, not sadness and tragedy, showing how goodbyes can truly be the new beginnings.--------In short, Yoru no Kuni is my favorite anime of all time, quite possibly my favorite fictional media of all time as well. I thought nothing would be able to recreate the feelings that Super Mario Galaxy gave me 14 years ago, but I\'ve finally found it. At its core, Yoru no Kuni brings forth the power of animation and creativity and harnesses it to create a world and story that reawakened the imaginative euphoria I once had as a child. Thank you, Yoru no Kuni, for everything. Good night. おやすみなさい。 and comforting vastness of outer space, embarking on a voyage to the various galaxies all across the universe. I remember sitting down in the Observatory, simply gazing at the wonderous universe in front of me. Super Mario Galaxy showed me the power of imagination and how fictional media could breathe life into magical, mystical worlds. It was an experience like no other.Life moves on, though, and as I got older, that imaginative spark I once had had started to fade. I became swept up in ""adult"" issues and concerns, constantly looking towards the future while neglecting the once-cherished memories of the past. I was lonely and struggled to make friends, often electing to keep to myself.Eventually, I got back in the spirit of consuming more media, and turned my head towards anime and manga, hoping to find that imaginative spark that I had lost in the early years of my life. I eagerly churned through as much anime as possible: the highly-recommended ones, the high-scoring ones, the ones with interesting premises, etc. A few of these anime were able to re-ignite the spark, but none had been able to re-invigorate the imaginative fire that I had been yearning to revive for years. Eventually, I had come to terms with the fact that I\'d probably never find that one special anime for my heart.Then I heard that for the Spring 2021 season, an ONA was coming out on YouTube called Yoru no Kuni. The synopsis was vague and the poster art wasn\'t super up my alley, but as an avid shortfilm watcher, I gave it a shot. What I didn\'t know at the time was that I\'d finally find that one special anime that I had always been searching for, the anime that would ignite the embers in my heart and revive the imaginative fire that I had lost in my childhood.------------Yoru no Kuni is a series of short episodes, each of which are about a person who enters the ""Night World"", a place inside every person\'s heart. The Night World contains all the memories and things that the person had left behind in the past. Although the Night World is dark, it is truly beautiful, as every person who enters it comes to see. Yoru is the creature that guides these people through the Night World, as he helps guide the person through their intrapersonal struggles.The first thing to talk about is Yoru no Kuni\'s art style. Yoru no Kuni employs a very imaginative and distinct art style, feeling very dream-like with its pastel colors and warm lighting. It feels more like Nintendo (ex. Kirby, The Legend of Zelda) than an actual anime art style, which gives it a nostalgic feeling. Similarly, the lighting used in this show is captivating. The Night World never feels intimidating or scary thanks to the beautiful warm lighting employed in its shots, showing the beauty of the Night World. Though the Night World is dark, every person that enters it comes to realize its awe-striking beauty.The second thing to talk about is Yoru no Kuni\'s storytelling. Despite its short runtime, Yoru no Kuni manages to tell unique and emotional stories with each episode. The stories are intrapersonal, not interpersonal, which is crucial. In so much anime, characters\' struggles are often marked with interpersonal conflicts: someone has social anxiety or is introverted? It\'s because of bullying and/or abuse, and hardly ever due to the person\'s own psychological problems. Someone has depression? Probably because of bullying and/or a death of a loved one. Although anime and manga often approach these inner-emotion topics, they often take the easy route of pointing the finger on malicious/evil characters to get the audience to sympathize with the MC, but as a result, intrapersonal conflicts are neglected and ignored. People like me who\'ve never been bullied yet still has social anxiety and depression problems can often feel like that there\'s few media that can represent them.Yoru no Kuni manages to tackle these topics from a unique angle with how intrapersonal the character\'s problems are. These characters have no ""big bad/evil character"" or ""melodramatic tragic event"" at the cause of their problems: rather, their problems are moreso an inner emotional and psychological struggle. In Episode 2, the character we follow is not the wants-to-be-nice-to-everyone friend, it\'s the friend who\'s jealous, a bystander-type and has malicious thoughts, yet is still very sympathizable. These characters don\'t follow your typical Main Character insert/hero archetypes, and that\'s what makes them great: they feel human, like they could\'ve been any one of us.Third is the messaging, both from Yoru and the Night World. Yoru is the constant character between all episodes, as the eternal dweller of the Night World and everyone\'s hearts. Yoru has an initially-imposing character design, but one line in from the legendary VA Suwabe Junichi is all you need to know that Yoru is meant there as an ally, not an enemy. Yoru helps people with their problems, similar to Mushishi\'s Ginko or Natsume Yuujinchou\'s Natsume, but what\'s unique about Yoru is that Yoru doesn\'t directly offer solutions to the people he\'s guiding. Rather, he indirectly offers advice to help guide the person forward, giving unique guidance (ex. ""It\'s okay to run away.""). As I said before, these stories are intrapersonal, so Yoru helps the people along the way, but it is up to the person themselves to come to the solution to their personal struggle. The struggles are rarely resolved fully by the end of the story, but that\'s arguably the beauty of it: human struggles are rarely overcome by a single realization, but simply arriving at an answer is a big step forward.Fourth and finally, the personal nostalgia that this anime envoked in me. Ever since Super Mario Galaxy captured my heart 14 years ago, I thought nothing would ever re-capture the feelings I had playing that game. But it\'s here with Yoru no Kuni. The Night World of Yoru no Kuni is dark, lonely, and sometimes empty, much like the vast openness of outer space in Super Mario Galaxy. But much like SMG, Yoru no Kuni manages to find comfort and beauty in its dark world. Similarly, at the end of SMG, there\'s an ending cutscene with Rosalina that talks about the beauty of death: even though familiar things may end, new things will start anew, hence the cycle of life of our universe. Yoru no Kuni talks about a similar theme, the beauty of goodbyes: we see each person, right as they are about to leave the Night World, ask Yoru ""Will I see you again?"", and it hits me like a truck as I\'m reminded that this\'ll be the last interaction we\'ll see between the two characters for a long, long time (maybe never again). Yet the farewells here are treated with reverence and hope, not sadness and tragedy, showing how goodbyes can truly be the new beginnings.--------In short, Yoru no Kuni is my favorite anime of all time, quite possibly my favorite fictional media of all time as well. I thought nothing would be able to recreate the feelings that Super Mario Galaxy gave me 14 years ago, but I\'ve finally found it.

Ajin Part 1: Shoudou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30868/Ajin_Part_1__Shoudou,"['Polygon Pictures is the name of the studio behind this film, and the anime series Sidonia no Kishi/Knights of Sidonia. I bring them up because despite only having seen one completed series from Polygon Pictures (at the time of this review being posted) it was enough for me to make them my most hated anime studio. This hatred is derived from Knights of Sidonia, or as I refer to it Sci-Fi: The Anime since it’s biggest piece of sci-fi trite I have ever seen in any form of media. Every single plot point was predictable, it didn’t put a new spin on any established sci-fi...formula nor strayed from any common modern anime writing conventions, and it’s also the only piece of science fiction, and animation to ever put me to sleep. So before even starting the film, and Ajin anime series there was already the hurdle of low expectations. The only way Ajin couldn’t meet those low expectation would be if it turned out worse than Knights of Sidonia. Ajin went so below the bar of low expectations I could make a top ten list of the worst Ajin episodes in great detail by how much incompetence there is in each individual episode.This film is basically a recap splicing together the first six episodes of the anime series Ajin. You might be wondering what’s the purpose of this recap movie if there’s no noticeable alteration between the anime series, and film. Both use the same footage with the same dialogue rendering it rather pointless to seek out the other product depending on what you decide to check out. As negative as I was towards the recap movie, Sword Art Online: Extra Edition, A1 Pictures did the logical in creating new material exclusive to it. Ajin Part 1: Shoudou only major difference with the anime series are scenes not having Izumi Shimomura (Tosaki’s secretary) cheeks turning red when blushing in two episodes of the anime series. I would like to point out this film came out in late November of 2015, and between that time all the way to mid January of 2016 when the anime aired. Someone, or several individuals at Polygon Pictures felt it was important to slightly alter moments of embarrassment by having Izumi cheeks turn red when she’s blushing instead bumping up the framerate to not make the animation look like it is always lagging. Just like the anime series, this recap film purpose is to simply be dead air. The metaphorical coaster of anime so to say.Ajin takes the classic premise of the “Human Parasite” (as I call it) trope where the focus is on a main character who becomes something he/she, or the world hates. If you read, or seen Invasion of the Body Snatchers (my go to association with this premise) you know for a fact this premise under right hands holds infinite possibilities. Especially horror since it could thrive on creating psychological fear of these creatures that easily blend into our world. However, Ajin doesn’t understand the basics of storytelling so when it tried to reach higher than possible never once does it bother to set up the building blocks for a stable story.First issue for the film is simple; bad world building combine with bad context for exposition. In Ajin, it’s establish the entire world know the existence of Ajins, yet in a later scene in the movie a police officer is surprise there’s an Non Lethal Drug Gun specifically design to capture Ajins. Before you could be bother to ask what sense does it make that this weapon isn’t mandatory for all policemen to have in case of an emergency it throws another bad plot point at you. One being how high school students managed to find a leaked video of a Ajin being experimented on, and there being no mention of it in any news media outlet. The flimsy excuse of a student saying it could be fake cannot be assumed to apply to everyone else in the world which requires higher suspension of disbelief that does not come with the premise. In the anime series, the news media eventually discover this leaked video, but in the film the news media does not. Creating more plot holes that in sequel films Polygon Pictures will have to cover up instead of focusing on telling a story (not a good one at that).We also have the Elephant in the room to address in that paranoia, hatred, disgust, or any feelings towards the public views on Ajin goes without setup. Aside from the first discover Ajin being a gun for hire in Africa, and if Ajin are turned in you’ll be rewarded there is nothing much to grasp from the Ajins presence in this world. The film even brings up the fact other Ajins were discovered, but mentions nothing if the other Ajins are commonly violent toward humans. If that was the case, than it would make sense for Kei Nagai (our teenage protagonist) not to trust anyone in his surroundings. However, if the story didn’t establish the public mindset on Ajins existence than the idea of them being turned in for a reward could still be a reasonable source of distrust for Kei Nagai. A simple, and not hard to shoe in solution for this issue is someone mentioning an Ajin who got betrayed by his friends for money. If this was done than you could have a less inferior reason for Kei Nagai not to trust his friends in the beginning of the film. It’s even brought up the reward could be just a rumor, but even if the reward is just a rumor than Kei Nagai fearing being betrayed by his friends from a story he heard would make a bit more sense. My solution sucks, but it could hold itself together much better compared to betrayal for rumored reward Kei Nagai just recently discovered imply by the film.Reason number two this film is bad is because of main character Kei Nagai. I personally refer to him as Sam Blanderton since he has no personality, the writing pretends he’s a smart character, and has the plot armor of immortality. His younger sister describes Kei Nagai as a cold person so Vanilla Ice is also a suitable nickname for the protagonist. Jokes aside, you would also find Kei Nagai in that piles of jokes. Despite being told he’s a smart character, and studying to be a doctor he’s no smarter than the rest of the cast in Ajin that can’t phantom the idea of multiple people wearing hats (more on that later). Having never gone to medical school I can tell you it is possible to knock someone out unconsciously with your fists. I bring this up since Kei Nagai can summon a Black Ghost which are basically an invisible humanlike manifestation Ajins can use. For some reason, when Kei is being tortured about an hour into the film, Kei seems to have forgotten everything he learned. This is a character who the audience is told wants to be a doctor. In a scene where Kei is being tortured he is also pressured into killing scientists, which you would expect someone who has been studying to be a doctor to do the logical, and knock out whoever is torturing him in order to intimidate anyone who wants to torture him in the future. Not wanting to kill is one thing, but if you have the power to knock someone out unconsciously like Kei Nagai has with his Black Ghost where’s the conflict in the situation. Kei doesn’t have to kill anyone when he’s being tortured, yet he seems content that he could only kill despite the fact he’s been studying to become a doctor. Good to know that knowledge goes to waste.Kei Nagai acts however the plot demands him to without a consistent personality trait. In the film, Kei meets face to face with an old man who kidnapped his sister, but is okay with it since she wasn’t harm. (Tear out hair in anger). Yet, he is more concern with the idea of this same old man wanting to kill scientists who have been torturing him (Kei) for days none of whom he knows. Showing concern for their very livelihood despite torturing him. Just, huh? What makes this infuriating for me is Kei Nagai brings up the idea to handicapped those scientists while begging for them not to be murdered. So the series (along with this film) is telling me Kei Nagai gives a rat ass his sister got kidnapped who he known for basically his entire life, and shows more concern for saving people who tortured him for several days  to the point he’ll bargain to handicapped them to make sure they live. However, this completely goes against the established trait of Kei Nagai being a cold, but intelligent character which does not go well when you see this same intelligent character wear nothing to hide his face when out in public. This is never an issue since Polygon Pictures is too lazy to have background characters which is why there is hardly ever crowds of people in the film. What this means is that Kei Nagai is not a cold character since he bother saving random strangers who tortured him several days, and is not intelligent since he doesn’t use his medical knowledge in his situations to protect himself. There’s no moment of competency from this character since Kei Nagai either gets lucky by discovering a new ability to save himself when convenient, or needs to be save by another person.Finally, the reason the film is terrible, and the anime series itself is also terrible is pretty much everything else. Characters are one dimensional in the film with the only character using his head is Satou who is presented as the villain. Satou is refer by others as The Man in the Hat (even in the English dub for who knows why) because he wears a hat. Apparently, in Ajin, Satou is the only person in the entire world who wears a hat. This is proven whenever Satou is brought up simply mentioning someone is wearing a hat. Characters will immediately bring up Satou. Details like this makes it impossible to take Ajin seriously. What it tells me is a race of immortal beings is easily accepted in this world, but multiple people wearing hats is an entirely alien to concept those same people. Satou character also suffers the same issue, in this film, of having little character development, but compare to every other character he’s written the best. Satou is the only character who has a goal, and a motivation for what he does to a certain character. As you can assume, one character who’s passable doesn’t excuse an entire cast that’s disposable. Kei Nagai does virtually nothing to advance the plot, Kaito/Porcupine (Kei’s best friend) disappears after the second act without explanation, Eriko Nagai (Kei’s sister) is practically pointless contributing nothing to the narrative, and a slew of other unimportant characters amount to either explaining things characters in the world should already know, or just disappear after a while.Pacing is a mess rushing through everything. This issue applies to the anime series too, but in movie format it’s boils down to throwing set pieces at the audience face without substance. There’s nothing of value to gain from constantly seeing the main characters in danger if there is no reason to care for them. No tension, no stakes, and no investment in the characters will have you constantly looking at the time wondering how long this train wreck is going to last.On a technical level Polygon Pictures 3D animation is dated, even by 1990s 3D television standards. It’s embarrassing that the Donkey Kong Country 3D animated series from the late 90s has more expressive facial animation, and a better framerate. Donkey Kong Country can make the simple action of Gorillas walking, and dancing for that matter move smoothly. In Ajin Part 1: Shoudou, in the beginning of the film, Polygon Picture can not make the simple action of walking move smoothly. Through the film (and the anime series) it seems like characters are moving in slow motion. Polygon Pictures is capable of fixing of this, but are too lazy to do anything about it. There are two sequences in the film where two Black Ghosts are fighting against each other using the technique of slowing things down briefly then speeding things up. This simple demonstration of being able to change the speed of motion freely should also apply to the frame rate. It’s done deliberately so Polygon Picture have the technology not make to their anime series, and films look like they’re lagging at all times. Polygon Picture is so lazy the film closing credits is the opening sequence to the anime series with just longer credits. Bravo Polygon Picture.Ajin Part 1: Shoudou needed to be story boarded, and drafted at least once before ever entering production. If this was done than Polygon Pictures would have realize they have no motivation for people to hate Ajins which would have save them from a number of issues if it was addressed. However, even if Ajin did give a good reason for why Ajins are hated it wouldn’t do away with the idiotic plot filled with shallow characters, and a very lazy production. You could find better looking 3D animation from the late 90s than this film which came out in 2015 which is embarrassing. Whatever way you view Ajin in either film, or TV format it is an embarrassment display of Japanese animation, an embarrassment to 3D animation, and an embarrassment to storytelling. formula nor strayed from any common modern anime writing conventions, and it’s also the only piece of science fiction, and animation to ever put me to sleep. So before even starting the film, and Ajin anime series there was already the hurdle of low expectations.

Whatever way you view Ajin in either film, or TV format it is an embarrassment display of Japanese animation, an embarrassment to 3D animation, and an embarrassment to storytelling.', 'Ajin: Shoudou demands us to contemplate the definition of ""Human"" and the extent to which one needs to use his/her abilities in a way that is morally just.Despised by society, Ajin are humans who have regenerative properties and cannot die. Kei Nagai, a senior high schooler, learns upon surviving what would\'ve been a fatal accident that he is an Ajin with the special ability to summon a ""Black Ghost"". These Black Ghosts are dark, mummy-like figures (similar to the one in the movie\'s cover art) which seem to be controlled by the Ajin\'s unconscious mind. Yet, they are able to exert deadly physical harm to...people and objects, but can only be seen by other Ajin.The aspect that makes Ajin\'s plot interesting is that Kei, the MC, is hesitant to use his deadly ability for revenge and murder, and instead tries to use his ability to help humanity, unlike other Ajin. The story contains philosophical themes of morality as both good (remembering his childhood friends and family) and evil (Ajin with murderous intent) influences try to sway him in deciding how to use his powers. All the characters in Ajin other than Kei act more or less as foils which develop Kei\'s character by influencing his decisions.One of the more surprising features of Ajin is the use of computer graphics (CGI) to animate the character movements. The frame rate of character movement is reduced to match the value normally seen in other anime. I personally think that while this is a novel and innovative approach to developing anime, its use of CGI strays too far from the conventional standard we saw in Ghost in the Shell or Paprika; however it still does a very good job of conveying expressions and emotions. Additionally, the background and scenery art were very well done as well.In terms of sound, the BGM tracks were quite nice were helpful in setting the atmosphere of scenes. My personal favourite from the soundtrack is ""Yoru wa Nemureru kai?"" from the ED. The voices behind the characters are were well-known seiyu and I think each of the voices fit the characters nicely.When we compare the anime to the manga version, we see that it is more or less similar to the origin, with the exception of a few scenes from the manga which were not adapted. One characteristic that was kept was the constant shifting of the scenes from one setting to another, which I thought was really unique in that it allows the viewer to better understand the timeline of the events in the plot and the scenes that are taking place simultaneously of each other.Overall, the Ajin movie does not stray much from its Manga source and offers interesting themes of humanity and morality. I would recommend Ajin: Shoudou to anybody who has read the manga or if you are interested in anime with elements of supernatural horror, such as Tokyo Ghoul (which in many ways really is quite similar to Ajin).Ajin: Shoudou is the first work in the Ajin film trilogy. Part two is set to premiere in theaters in May of 2016.I hope you have found this review to be of help. people and objects, but can only be seen by other Ajin.The aspect that makes Ajin\'s plot interesting is that Kei, the MC, is hesitant to use his deadly ability for revenge and murder, and instead tries to use his ability to help humanity, unlike other Ajin. The story contains philosophical themes of morality as both good (remembering his childhood friends and family) and evil (Ajin with murderous intent) influences try to sway him in deciding how to use his powers. All the characters in Ajin other than Kei act more or less as foils which develop Kei\'s character by influencing his decisions.One of the more surprising features of Ajin is the use of computer graphics (CGI) to animate the character movements. The frame rate of character movement is reduced to match the value normally seen in other anime. I personally think that while this is a novel and innovative approach to developing anime, its use of CGI strays too far from the conventional standard we saw in Ghost in the Shell or Paprika; however it still does a very good job of conveying expressions and emotions. Additionally, the background and scenery art were very well done as well.In terms of sound, the BGM tracks were quite nice were helpful in setting the atmosphere of scenes.

Personally, I\'ve been waiting for this for a very long time. I have not read the manga (yet) and have not watched the anime yet (airing now).Story 9/10:The movie introduces the concept/world of Ajin, where some random humans happen to develop a mysterious super power, causing them many troubles and raising the ultimate anime question: ""Am I still human?"". Doesn\'t sound very original, right? We have seen this in many other animes like Ergo proxy, Parasyte, Tokyo Ghoul, etc...However, the storytelling of Ajin is what makes it very enjoyable. It is very dynamic, there is...no unnecessary information in it. Hopefully they will keep it filler-free for the upcoming anime too.Characters 8/10:The characters are pretty much the standard arch-types for this movie. The ""friend"", the ""Organisation"", ""the weak point"" - the sister, in this case, the ""veteran"" and so on.They seem to all have a background story that is not explained in detail due to the length of the movie. Hopefully, we will see their stories later on.Art 3/10:*heavy breathing* Well...when I first saw the teaser, I just had to do a facepalm. The CGI does not fit this show (or any show for that matter).Despite all of that, I must say, I still really enjoyed the film overall, due to the amazing story and execution.Overall 9/10:A very generic topic executed in a wonderful, very enjoyable way. Graphics could certainly be better but what can we do?I definitely look forward to the anime series! no unnecessary information in it.

I watched both the Movie and TV show just because, really. But if you've already watched one set theres not much point in watching the other unless you REALLY like this anime.Art:10/10I know a lot of people dislike it's art style but they made an exceptional decision going forward with this particular one.My main reason? The Black Ghosts.The way their concept was transformed into this style of animation is astounding. I don't believe they would have been captured as perfect as this were the style done as the average anime. The way the Black Ghosts fights were done were tremendously well done for this reason.Sound: 8/10Not much to say besides it sounds good, lol.The voice actors did amazing jobs and all the sound effects were very well done.Character: 8/10The characters were great.There is a lot of dislike for the main character at first, but once you actual grasp the kind of person he is, you'll begin to understand his reasoning for all his actions.He makes perfect sense.And the villain? Ohhh Satou, the most perfect character anyone could have ever dreamed of. He makes Ajin so much better than what it is. An absolute sickening badass.Enjoyment: 8/10I quite liked this movie, it was a lot of fun to watch, and I honestly believe everyone should try Ajin out.Overall: 8/10It was very good. the characters react in ways you'd except in each situation based off their personalities.Theres no point in comparing the TV show to the Movies though, essentially they're the same thing, just done slightly differently, it really all depends on how you enjoy watching your anime.

TL;DR will be at the endStory: 9/10As I said, the story is centred around a non-human, an Ajin. An Ajin is a species that is said to cannot die. Our MC is Nagai Kei who is raised to be a prodigy and strives to be a great human being, but once it is revealed he...is an Ajin, his story starts. Hunters chase him for the cash reward, the Ajin Investigators chase him for answers, and all of humanity fears him, except for his friend Kai who helps him get away.I really like this concept. I mean, a non-human species is nothing new, but in this case Ajin cannot die, but they can still feel immense pain. Some the scenes are really thought provoking and even a little heartbreaking.Art: I literally have nothing to say.You either hate it or love it. Ajin uses computer graphics (CGI) and is most definitely different from what you normally watch nowadays. Its use of 3D graphics can sometimes be unlikeable, but ultimately I think it gave Ajin something different. Some scenes truly are animated really well, especially fight scenes.This score is not included in my overall score because literally you either hate it or love it and this is not something I should be able to help you decide.Sound: 8/10The ost's are really intuitively perfect to set the scene. They just make the scenes 100% better and that's the point of a soundtrack.I feel as if they do overplay some of the soundtracks, and sometimes they do play it a bit too loud and that's the downside. I especially like the ending, which is actually the tv series's opening, which is catchy and dynamic.Character: 8/10What I really love about Ajin is the fact that the MC's shine but the side characters are not left in the dust. They not only help Kei shine, but they shine on their own. Kei's decisions are swayed by their ideas and they help develop our MC, but at the same time they stay true to themselves and their own ideas. The side characters could have more development, but you can't do much about that as the movie is only about 100 minutes and they have a lot to fit in. There are other movies coming out this year and the anime has just started so I don't think they will disappoint.Enjoyment: 9/10This is slightly biased as I started the TV series before watching the movie, but I didn't even realize 20 minutes of an episode went by when the ending started playing. I sat with my hands on my seat and my eyes glued to my screen; I was so engaged with what the story had to say. The graphics are a bit weird but the sound really enhanced the story which is amazing on its own.TL;DRStory:+A popular idea that is really enjoyed by the anime fanbase+Different from mainstream series that have the same ideas+Thought provoking scenes are always thrown at youArt:+/- It's CGI so you either hate it or love itCharacters:+MC's truly shine, and side characters help them shine even more+Side characters have important roles in the story-Besides Nagai Kei, not many characters have development^However the movie is only 100 minutes and the anime is airing now and the second movie will come out in MayEnjoyment:+Suspenseful and EngagingI definitely think you should giving Ajin a try.

XDSo this episode is a little 10 minute extra to the main series which chronicles the first encounter between Karasuma and Korosensei, as told from Korosensei's point of view.This is pretty much comic relief for followers of this series since season 1 ended in a somewhat abrupt manner. It starts off on a serious note with Karasuma locking horns with Korosensei for the first time in a dank jail cell as the slimy octopus states his various demands and what not, and then the episode ends in a somewhat unexpected manner. The art and soundtrack...are all consistent with that from the main series.If you are wondering whether this episode is important, then wonder no more: it does not contribute to the plot in any way, so you may choose not to watch it. There are no teasers, no foreshadowing whatsoever. However... if you have seen season 1, then I do recommend you watch this just for the sake of closure. are all consistent with that from the main series.If you are wondering whether this episode is important, then wonder no more: it does not contribute to the plot in any way, so you may choose not to watch it.

Bleach Movie 2: The DiamondDust Rebellion - Mou Hitotsu no Hyourinmaru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2889/Bleach_Movie_2__The_DiamondDust_Rebellion_-_Mou_Hitotsu_no_Hyourinmaru,"[""Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion takes place in the Bleach universe, as the title may suggest. It focuses mainly on 10th squad captain Hitsugaya Toshiro, so if you're a fan of him, you'll enjoy this movie, and if you're not, you might not find it interesting. If you're neither of the former, like me, you'll probably enjoy it too.The story isn't the most original story you'll see, as it follows the theme of revenge based off of a grudge from the past. Said revenge will be executed by obliterating everything. So there's nothing special in that department. Toshiro gets involved in this act of revenge...because he has a connection to the man who holds the grudge against Seireitei. One day, the King's Seal, a mysterious and powerful artifact, gets stolen from right under the noses of the squad protecting it (the 10th squad), and Toshiro ends up missing. Now, events that may change Seireitei begin to unfold. And that's where the movie starts off.It gradually explores Toshiro's past with the man who wants to take revenge on Seireitei with sporadic flashbacks, that doesn't make a lot of sense at first, but they become more and more clear as the events in the movie unfold, and you soon get to learn the reason behind this man's grudge against Soul Society. While this way of telling the story is not something unseen, it works very well with this movie, and does give it some extra tension and entertainment value.Long-time Bleach fans will probably enjoy this movie because we get to see many characters we've not seen fight for a long time fight. Among others, there's Zaraki at his craziest, Yoruichi and Soi Fon with their Shunko, and Ikkaku with his bankai. Of course, there's a lot of icy fighting courtesy of Toushiro.Another thing I believe long-time Bleach fans will find enjoyable is the animation quality, which is at the very least astounding. With awesome lighting effects, very fluid character movements and high attention to detail, it surpasses the normal quality of Bleach's animation by many levels. If I could, I'd set the score to 15/10.The soundtrack is awesome as well, with astounding tunes that fit right into the mood of the movie, amplifying the scenes and events as well as a soundtrack should. DDR's soundtrack is one of the few that gets the honor of being downloaded to my computer.All in all, if you're a Bleach fan, don't hate Toshiro, and if you don't mind a classic revenge-based story, chances are you'll enjoy this movie.To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) because he has a connection to the man who holds the grudge against Seireitei.

As a fan of Bleach, I dare not write this review until after I\'ve re-watched the movie twice to be sure I did not miss anything crucial. If you just want some recommendation from someone who have watched this movie, I would watch it if you\'ve read/watched Bleach before, otherwise you should skip it.Story:The main spot light of the story revolves around Hitsugaya\'s past when he was still a student in the spiritual academy and how he (and his friend) obtained their zanpakuto. The movie is full of holes to me for...a number of reasons. Please excuse my use of language in the following spoiler.1. How the hell can Hitsugaya bleed from the start to the end? His wound was never treated, in fact it got worsen after the encounter with Kira and Hisagi. Speaking of Kira and Hisagi, what happen to them after they got beaten the crap out of?2. How the hell can a noob (I am referring to Kusaka) take out the 8th squad caption, Shunsui Kyoraku, when he does not even have bankai? I understand it was a ""surprise"" to Shunsui when he took off Kusaka\'s mask. Don\'t say because Kusaka was in possession of the King\'s Seal, because if the Seal is that powerful, Kusaka would not be defeated in the end.3. Who the hell are those two arrancars following Kusaka? The story never mentions how they meet up with Kusaka and why the two decide to follow him on his quest for ""revenge"". Were they attracted to his personality, his ""dream"", or his ""beauty""? Nothing was mentioned at all!4. Why the hell can\'t there be two users using the same zanpakuto? The rule, as the excuse used by the central 46, was a very lame one to get the friends to start fighting. If it weren\'t for the central 46, this whole incident would never have happened. Come to think of it, I should be glad that Aizen took care of those good for nothings.The list can go on and even extend to some of the ridiculous battles but we\'ll leave it at that.Art:As to be expected from a movie, the quality of the animation is much better than its TV counterpart. Nice camera angles and detailed battle scenes definitely one of the movie\'s strong point.Sound:The production crew decided to reuse quite a few battle themes from the TV series that we are all familiar with. In fact, there was only one or two new themes beside the ending song. The music has a nice melody and suits the varies scenes that they are accompanied with. The only downfall for me was the ending which I had a very hard time accepting.Character:It was nice to see some of Hitsugaya\'s past and we definitely see his character develop as the story unfolds. Most characters in the TV series made an appearance, which was quite hard to do considering the number of casts. It was good to see some action from Soi Fon and Yoruichi, Byakuya, and Kenpachi.What was lacking was some background information on the two arrancars following Kusaka and how did Kusaka just manage to   get reincarnated in Hueco Mundo .Enjoyment + Overall:The story, those a bit slow at times, was very attention-grabbing. It was easy to follow, and made me think a lot at the same time.I would recommend this to any Bleach fan out there, especially those who like Hitsugaya.

It\'s not that the plot was bad at all; there were just a few random plot devices that were a bit strange, especially in the beginning with Ichigo\'s initial involvement in the story. If one compares it to the first Bleach movie (which of course is inevitable), this movie\'s plot was much better. There were a good amount of flashbacks which were done nicely as well.Art: You can really see the difference here between the TV series and the movie. There were some...excellent camera angles, scene changes, and special effects. At times, the camera took Ichigo\'s viewpoint; other times it took a grand, panoramic view of the scene. Of course, other movies have done that, but with such camera work/framing it gave the movie a more serious, artsy feel to it. It\'s good if you\'re like me and enjoy that stuff.Sound: It has all the major themes of the series, plus a choral piece that gave me shivers, and several distinctly Japanese pieces that set the tone of the film exactly right. The seamless blending of sound and sight was perhaps the best part of the movie for me.Character: Well, of course all of the Bleach characters are in character...with almost every soul society member and human (and quincy) making at least a cameo appearance. The villain was suitably well developed and somewhat sympathetic since he is featured in most of the flashbacks. Hitsugaya fans will enjoy getting a glimpse under his ""icey"" exterior during the flashbacks as well. I wasn\'t so fond of how emo he was, but it was at least tolerable and not too overdone.Enjoyment: The reason why I didn\'t give a 10 for enjoyment (and why the overall score is a 9) is because there\'s not very many good battles in the movie. Let\'s face it, one reason Bleach is so great is because of the epic fights. I went to the movie specifically in the theater to see that epic quality on the big screen, and was a bit disappointed. There were a few somewhat boring ""henchmen"" fights, and the final battle was kind of anti-climactic. However, I did like the fact that the climax took place in Soul Society, where the captains could show off their full powers (though again, you don\'t get to see anything new or really exciting stuff happen).In all, however,  I very much recommend seeing this movie, whether you be a die hard fan or new to Bleach, or even if you don\'t like the series very much. This movie takes most of the good points from the series and puts it into one and a half hours of good entertainment. excellent camera angles, scene changes, and special effects.

By the end, I can honestly say I was bored. View a breakdown of the various subsections below.The plot was not overly interesting. I, being a rather strict advocate of manga canon, was not overly enthused by &quot;One zanpakutou, two owners&quot; idea. In the movie's defense, however, I appreciated their portrayal of the Central 46 as strict and unwavering in their ideology. There were plot...holes, as well as various cliched themes which recur commonly in anime, which would not have required that much effort or good writing to fix.Ichigo going to Soul Society to fix all their problems for them is a theme which has been much overdone by this point, and frankly, is no longer interesting.The animation was very underdone. At several points during it I found myself saying aloud, &quot;Is this not a movie?&quot; Let alone other animes, Bleach itself has had better animation during certain episodes. A large portion of the movie had standard &quot;Bleach filler&quot; animation quality. Even the more high budget scenes could have been better.Why does Yoruichi pop into Soul Society whenever she feels like it?Character stereotypes were whored to the point of being annoying. Yamamoto was a thick-headed idiot until the truth had clearly come to light. Soi Fon was still a Yoruichi fan girl who seemed to enjoy ripping off her robes every time something provoked her slightly. Hitsugaya was cold and unfriendly. Ichigo yelling at people solved all their problems once again. Ikkaku would NOT use bankai in that situation. And of course, the enemy is ridiculously powerful by some unknown means or by very little effort.I did not particularly enjoy this movie. Compared to Memories of Nobody, I would consider it a near write-off. Memories of Nobody had a solid story, a worthy enemy, and emotional connection, all of which were simply absent in DiamondDust Rebellion.Fade to Black, I shall hope you don't disappoint me. holes, as well as various cliched themes which recur commonly in anime, which would not have required that much effort or good writing to fix.Ichigo going to Soul Society to fix all their problems for them is a theme which has been much overdone by this point, and frankly, is no longer interesting.The animation was very underdone.

Generally, though, it was alright, but I think Hitsu-haters will dislike this movie in general. But the fight scenes weren't as great as one would hope them to be.The art is practically what you'd expect to see in the anime, though some parts were awkwardly drawn out and looked kind of funny to me...Like the artists tried way too hard to make a Hitsugaya as...a child all cute and adorable.My favorite part about the movie was the music. The music was intense! Some of the songs were so pretty, like the ones from the flashbacks. But this one song had some weird opera thing going on and it kind of made me go, &quot;Um, okay?&quot;Character: Everyone's in character, obviously, but I disliked Hitsugaya's personality throughout the majority of the movie. Those of you who have seen it, I think we can all agree that he was actually ratther bratty and annoying at times. I think they did a good job with the villain, too, warping who used to be a good guy into a shady, plotting, vengeful character. Unlike the last movie, I actually liked the OC.I enjoyed the movie overall, though the &quot;final battle&quot; came as a real disappointment and could have been so much better thought out.

But it was pretty good other than that."", 'The Diamond Dust Rebellion is the 2nd Bleach movie. The story essentially revolves around the Captain Toshiro Hitsugaya,  stuff from his past and what happens when it returns to hunt him down, in fact, to hunt everyone and everything down.Actually, the story itself is very cliché and predictable (you can figure the whole thing out in the first few minutes of the movie), especially the Hitsugaya part.  I can undoubtedly assure that you have seen (at least once) this particular plot in another anime/animes (I know I have, it’s quite common), therefore I’ll just blurt it out: “Best friend returns from...the death to take revenge and destroy the world”, but of course because this IS Bleach, you just have to add Ichigo to the entire equation, and there you have it. So if you’re looking for some original story line don’t hold your breath.However if you’re a fan who’s looking for some extended Bleach action (92 min) with over the top animation, this is your thing. Yes, usually the movies have way better graphics and action sequences than the TV episodes, Bleach is no exception. Astonishing Animation is the way to describe it (wish the whole series could be like that).  And sure, even though I spent an entire paragraph whining about the lack of imagination in the narrative the truth is I enjoy the movie (I do like Bleach you know).The beginning is certainly slow, but not to the point it becomes painful to watch. Yet somewhere along the way it does capture your attention, and by the end you can’t keep your eyes off the screen, guess it has something to do with the amazing fighting scenes which involved captains and  vice captains (probably the part I liked the most) and the fact that almost everyone in Soul Society  made an appearance.So the good stuff:-It’s about Hitsugaya (he’s cute)-The animation is really good-You see almost the entire cast and some cool fights involving some them.The bad stuff:-The story IS cliché-It does have the most amazing load of holes in the plot and things that just not make sense-And most importantly: Why wasn’t Hitsugaya the one delivering the final blow to ""powerful"" Kusaka??  Why the hell was Ichigo the one who cracked Kusaka’s dragon head??!! Ichigo was  sort of a support character in here … still he is the one who defeats “god” Kusaka and gets the glory?? Besides, how could Ichigo defeat him that easily?? It does not make sense…  oh well it IS Bleach…(ok, enough of bashing Ichigo, believe it or not I do like him).Back to the review.Overall, if you like Bleach, you’ll like this movie.

Which had romance down to a T &amp; nothing else....Nope.Seems not.Story? The little bit of story that there is, is confusing as possible. Mainly because some things just make no sense at all. I can't tell you what those things are, for they are spoilers. But trust me, it does the fantastic Bleach fashion of raising random things &amp; never explaining, just pushes them to the back of the pile. Hell a guy has a fox head for fucks sake.Art = Terrible.

Captain Hitsugaya, assigned to watch over the proceedings, faces the thief but quickly becomes conflicted and abandons his squad during the fight. Now a fugitive on the run, Hitsugaya must avoid Soul Society while trying to discover the identity of the thief and what it is that made it impossible to fight him. Hitsugaya, Ichigo, and all of Soul Society will have to fight to pay for Soul Society's past mistakes.The second installment in the Bleach movie series is by-and-large an improvement over the first. DiamondDust...delivers with higher-quality animation, more drama, and more badass bankai fights. Scenery and character design (especially facial expressions) are superb, and fights are fast-paced and engaging. Audio is typical for Bleach, which is to say that it is outstanding (though the producers are slow to put out a dubbed version, one can expect that like Memories of Nobody it will be fantastic). DiamondDust has more fights and the battle is on a larger scale, involving more Captains and some new powers.Viewers will be treated to a plot that is unequivocally superior to that of Memories. While the common structure - bad guy appears, steals something that can be used for great destruction, and good guys go after him - is still present, most fans will love Hitsugaya's role as main character and will appreciate the attention given to his relation to the thief. Truer to the series itself, beneath the action lies a critique of societies that would blindly adhere to their laws.Despite the improvements, DiamondDust does have a few noticeable faults. While this time the enemy is a real match for the Captains, fights remain unsuspenseful and there is seldom any real sense of danger. Ichigo and Hitsugaya's final showdown against the enemy is extremely brief and makes it seem as if the studio had run short on time, budget, or both. And finally, Hitsugaya's story and reasoning for abandoning Soul Society felt forced and illogical. Still, this is a very well done film.

Strangely though, after watching the hour and twenty eight minute film I still don't understand the relation of the title to the movie itself...Nevertheless in one word, DiamondDust Rebellion is a fairly well enjoyable Bleach Movie.Story: Now we all know that the Naruto movies don't deliver anything special, (i'm using Naruto to compare because of the similarities to Bleach.) I think in contrast this movies overall plot was a bit better than what i've seen before, so i'll give it that. However the story didn't really...provide a great deal of depth or something that really surprised me so i'll call it average. This isn't really a bad thing though, there's a good deal of enjoyment to be found here asuming you actually LIKE the show itself. The movie does a good job at giving characters that we don't normally see alot a small little time to shine, without feeling completely shoehorned in. The plot focuses in on Toshiro Hitsugaya, in my opinion one of the show's stronger characters, and delivers a decent telling of a portion of his past. It did some unique things and had some nice flashbacks with cute moments involving Ichigo's past as well, but like I said if you're looking for a very deep and complex story you won't really find it here. There were quite a few times my friend and I were able to predict the plot fairly easily.Animation: I will admit the animation is one of the movies highlights despite the show's animations being just sub-par. The environment especially I think looked fantastic for a movie released in 2007. The overall vibe was very grim and Bleek and felt like a gloomy monday. There were some great looking nighttime sequences in the Soul Society and flashbacks with the sunset over a lake that looked gorgeous. The character animations looked great as well, looking very lively and their movements being very fluent and full. The animation did a very good job making karakura town very detailed and lush during parts in the forrest. Overall I'm very happy with the animation from the movie it surpassed my expectations by alot.Sound: The sound quality is what you would expect, everything sounds as it should from the show and everything's crisp and clean. The Movie included some OST's from the show which were nice to hear in a few scenes, and the soundtrack from the movie exclusively was nice too, it fit the overall vibe well. The movie's soundtrack did what it had to do and i'd have no problem downloading it to my phone and listening to it on the regular so rest assured.Characters: Now as I mentioned before the movie did a good job and including alot of the characters like the Lieutenants that normally don't get much screen time and giving them a reason to be there. Not for EVERY character here, but with most that's the case. The main antagonist was average nothing really stood out about his character design or his power, but what I do like is his past connection to captain Hitsugaya and while his power isn't UNIQUE, it's kinda cool to see him having something like that...without spoiling it i'm saying this of course. There were two other villians but for the most part they weren't really relevant they were just kinda there. I like what the story did with Toshiro, giving him a bit of a rebellious side which was nice to see. And how Ichigo had a connection with Toshiro as well.All that said I think there's plenty of enjoyment to be found here. The movie is far from perfect and it's not the greatest anime movie out but if you're a fan of the series I think you'll agree that it's a good installment of the series with the exception that it's not canon of course. There were plenty of moments that surprised me a little or made me laugh and watching all the members of the Soul Society fight is always fun to see. The story may be average but it's easy to overlook that when you're given beautiful animation and some well delivered action sequences. Giving the movie an 8 may be a little too generous, but nonetheless I enjoyed the movie just the same. As I said if you're a fan of Bleach you'll find enjoyment plenty here. If you're not this probably isn't going to change your mind but perhaps you'll like it anyway who's to say.If you agree with my review or found it helpful give it a thumbs up!

However, if you treat this as a non canon excuse for gorgeous fight sequences and more explosive action from your favorite characters, then heck yeah it's a ride. The fight choreography is, as usual, spot on, the voice acting is fine, the...characters are, for the most part, the same lovable group you remember from the series (with the exception of that cardboard cutout of a villain placed there just to create opposition to the good guys, and the sound was very fitting stylistically, as it always is for the show.The crime here is that without the story, the rest of it seems a bit empty. There was potential with investment, to create a great spin off story that would fit into the canon sub creation, and would simply deepen our understanding of various fan favorites, like Ice boy and his frozen dragon of awesome!All in all, the movie is a bit like cotton candy, which is great for a carnival but not so good when it makes up all of dinner.

It was only a matter of time until a fansub group (Dattebayo ftw!  w00t!) picked it up for release and man, was it worth the wait!  Just about every character you could think of from the main cast was in this movie and they all had just enough screen time to make this movie top tier.  Even the three new villains they created just for this movie were an awesome addition.  I especially liked...Ying and Yang as they didn''t look like your typical Vizard fare from the series.  The movie soundtrack had the usual guitar fare just like from the series, but I could have really done without that rather dull choir piece towards the end of the movie.  It just didn't fit in my opinion since every other track you hear during the movie was either a rocking out piece or one fitting to a dramatic scene.  The character and background artwork was very clean and polished throughout as well and the animation quality for fighting scenes, etc. was pretty good.  Studio Pierrot did a good job with this movie.  This is one Bleach movie I can definitely watch a few more times over since it's pretty well balanced.

A these two are the main characters for this film, A lot of fans took it as a surprise that such a pair wojld become the main focus for the second film.This film is mainly based on Htsugayas past with a departed friend.In the beginning of the film we see squad 10 escorting an item known as the king's seal. whilst the transportation between the soul society is taking place an unidentified sould reaper wearing a white mask appears with two young girls who resemble Arrancars. The girls are able to...control fire and lightning which no one expected, so its a bit like a sneak attack. Whilst the mysterious masked soul reaper wealds a sword just like Hitsugayas but claims its his.A fight breaks out inbetween squad 10 and the 3 mysterious intruders, and Hitsugaya abandons his post to chase down the mysterious soul reaper who soon leaves him badly injured.The news reaches the human realm, which we all know it'll mean our usual friends will found out the news soon enough to help out.The storyline does make sense and the flash backs of Hitsugayas memory add to the story line to make it more.... suspensefull.The graphics are once again up to date, the storyline seems fresh and new, the fighting seems are up to our usual standards and the voice overs are once again brilliant.I think that they've made the film speedy, action packed and added the unusual characters in to get more people intrigued in the bleach movies. Even though this is the second movie We're already being dragged and drawn in to the films that we now know will following on and be just as good as all of the others...One down side to the film is quite small... We all see what happens to the mysterious masked soul reaper at the end.... But we don't see what happens to his 2 little side kicks... You know the ones who control fire and electricity.I wonder what actually happened to them?.....Saturday 23rd Febuary 2013. 10:30 pm. ~AmyXxx control fire and lightning which no one expected, so its a bit like a sneak attack.

Typical filler material. They already used the ""missing shinigami is up to no good!"" thing in season 4 and in the first movie. They were just tossing all our favourite characters in at random to try and trick us into liking the movie. It was cool that Kenpachi just went wild near the end; very fitting for his character. However, it was just... not nearly as cool as it should\'ve been. It\'s like they were merely using Kenpachi\'s character to say ""this enemy\'s real strong"", then they tossed him aside like the useless puppet he was....Overall, it was pretty crappy, and I don\'t even remember half of it. Just a bunch of BS packed into some movie that isn\'t the least bit memorable. Bleach is insanely popular, so they were able to get away with it easily. This was almost as bad as all those emotionless One Piece movies... *shudders*Did the author have any idea what the hell these idiots were doing before they went ahead and made the movie? They did real well having Madarame show off his bankai even though he\'d actually rather die than let others know. Overall, it was pretty crappy, and I don\'t even remember half of it.

Both in terms of writing, and especially animation, it represents an improvement of leaps and bounds over its predecessor. Does it hold up today? In a sense, yes, in others, no.The production value comes off as perfectly adequate, but there is precious little here that will impress you by today’s standards. I remember being in awe of the animation at the time. Whether that was down to me being a dumb teenager who didn’t know any better, or it really was that impressive –...that is anyone’s guess. The point is that the visuals didn’t age as well as I would have liked.DiamondDust essentially adds 2 things on top of the Bleach canon. The first is a MacGuffin. It’s literally a textbook MacGuffin. I’m going to be frank. It’s stupid. There’s really nothing more to say about it. It’s just idiotic. It does exactly what a MacGuffin does, which is essentially anything and everything the plot needs it to.The second is an apocryphal backstory for Toushiro Hitsugaya. I thought that Hitsugaya’s character arc was so compelling, I found myself wishing it were canon. Indeed, there is a part of me that considers it so. It is rare for filler to garner that kind of response from me, with the notable exception of One Piece’s Condoriano. Naturally, DiamondDust Rebellion‘s lore has too many holes to be sanctified as canon, but what I’m trying to say is that even in spite of its flaws, it’s just that attractive as an idea.Toushiro is such a beloved character, you are likely to enjoy the movie simply by virtue of the fact that he is the deuteragonist.Where the movie fails is in its handling of Ichigo. There really isn’t any reason for Ichigo to exist in this story. The effort to include him and write him into the plot only served to confuse and convolute the narrative. I can only imagine an alternate version of the movie where Hitsugaya is the de facto main character. I almost want to cry over just how much better that version of DiamondDust should, would, and could have been. It could have easily been a prequel happening before Ichigo ever became a Soul Reaper.Alas, in the real world, in the version of the movie we’ve actually been given, Hitsugaya is nerfed and sidelined for 80% of the movie in order to give Pierrot enough time to convince you that, bro, trust me, bro, Ichigo is the main character, bro, he is totally necessary in this movie, bro, the plot would not work without him, bro. Inevitably, the story puts Ichigo on a path that leads to conflict with the Soul Reapers of Soul Society again, because that’s the only kind of conflict Bleach filler writers can come up with. Bleach fillers can’t exist in the absence of Soul Society treating Ichigo like dirt.Update on the Supreme Commander: Still useless? Yes. Still creating pointless friction just to be an asshole? Yes. Oh, look! Right on schedule – it’s bullshit o’clock! Please do nothing useful and then say something asinine just to piss me off. The story absolutely requires it.The 3rd act is also weak. Nothing happens, really. The plot just creates a big arena for Pierrot to masturbate in the audience’s faces showing off various characters’ abilities and shit, but none of it means anything, because they’re mostly just killing random, nameless fodder.The main villain’s definitive defeat is also supremely disappointing and he’s got to have the most unimaginative henchmen I’ve ever seen.At this point, DiamondDust Rebellion also does something with regards to its protagonist that so many stories do, and it’s got me fucked up to no end – hype without action. All throughout the 3rd act, all of the supporting cast will, ad nauseam, tell Ichigo that he has to go on, that it’s all down to him, because he has to be the one to reach the main bad guy and save the day. They act as nothing more than sidekicks paving the way for Orange Naruto. Why? The quintessential example of this is Ron at the end of The Philosopher’s Stone. “Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione – YOU!” Ehhh... Again... Why??? Is this an unofficial 4th wall break? Are they all aware that they’re just characters in a story? Do they know Ichigo is the main character?Still, in spite of its problems, like I said, DDR is a breath of fresh air in that it invents an actually compelling story related to a character we’ve got a preexisting attachment to. That means we’re not wasting 75% of the movie struggling to give a shit about some newfangled contrivance, only to then, as always, end with a smorgasbord of flashy moves we’re already familiar with.To fans of the franchise, it is guaranteed to be an entertaining 90 minutes. If, on the other hand, you’re not already familiar with Bleach, I don’t know that I would recommend starting here, seeing as you wouldn’t know who any of the characters are, but surprising no one more than myself, I will admit that it wouldn’t exactly be the worst place to start.

It's a pretty generic story, imo. Soul Society believes that someone has betrayed them and try to capture the culprit, without listening to anything that the person has to say and everything turns out to be a big misunderstanding, where Ichigo, as usual, comes to the rescue and saves the day.The art and soundtrack is alright, pretty decent. However, it was nothing that really blew me away, pretty average.The character development is pretty non-existent, considering that this is...a Bleach movie and, therefore, has nothing to do with the actual storyline. Nonetheless, we do get to see into the past of Captain Hitsugaya, a bit. It did feel, though, as if it lacked something.Overall the enjoyment factor of this movie, at least to me, was so-so. It was a movie that I could have waited for. It was not something that I had to see right away, after watching it.The basic story is that the Captain's past caught up to him and he wants to correct it, and, in turn, the entire Soul Society misconstrues his intentions. Ichigo saves the day and that's pretty much it.If you're watching this because you think that it will further advance the Bleach series storyline, then you're wrong. However, if you are an action buff then you should totally watch this because it has plenty of action sequences, but none that are too impressive.I would rate this a 7/10. a Bleach movie and, therefore, has nothing to do with the actual storyline.

The idea of twin zampakutous is probably why i gave it a 7 in terms of originality. Other than that, i felt that the story did not fit so well with the anime, in terms of the capabilities of the characters as some of the characters' personalities were altered slightly to fit the stereotypical story...of revenge and betrayal. It's as if there is no one stronger than Ichigo and he has to do everything. I would have actually preferred it if Hitsugaya got to have more action.&lt;SPOILER&gt; I mean for those who watched it already, how could the captain of the 8th squad be defeated so easily by a guy who hasn. even learnt his bankai?!&lt;SPOILER&gt;. I think the first movie invoked better emotions and feelings than this one. I felt no attraction to the show but at least the action is still good, i'll give it that much.The art was ok, not the best that i have seen in bleach animation though. But got nothing bad to say either so moving on...Sound was probably the best part of the show, the inserts were well timed to help create the atmosphere, i would expect no less of a movie anyway. I always liked the bleach inserts so maybe it's just me, some are recognizable from the anime...others not. (By inserts i'm refering to insert songs)The characters were of a good standard, of course the focus is on Hitsugaya and Ichigo, but the other characters are not neglected at all. I would say for such a wide cast of characters, they do fit them quite nicely into the story and for that i would give it 7. Because i can't help but feel that Ichigo is the one always being singled out as special even when it's not about him.I could only enjoy the show show for it's impressive display of action throughout, that's probably what kept me watching it. there was never a boring moment in the show as it carries along at quite a fast pace. However, the focus on ichigo and lack of comedy may have prevented me from giving a higher score.Overall, the movie had better action than the first movie but the constant need for ichigo to be the center of the story makes it a bit boring and unintersting. There was no special factor that makes it stand out so i would say it's just an average show.

The 1st movie was great and I am quite pleased with it but the second is ridiculous and here\'s why.Plot:The plot is boring and has been done so many times the word ""cliche"" can\'t do it justice. It\'s your basic revenge plot were the main character (Toshiro) gets in a big huff and tries to sort it out on his own.Animation:This is a movie right? I have seen...better animated filler episodes from this franchise.Sound:The soundtracks used were pretty decent can\'t really fault it there.Character:The main villain is a character from Toshiro\'s past. He is basically just your everyday run of the mill revenge character and if they spent a little more time developing his character (and his subordinates, almost forgot about them) it would\'ve gotten at least a 6. Also the fact that we barely get to see Yin and Yang\'s powers or learn anything about them really pisses me off. It would have made it so much more impactful at the end of the movie.Main things that annoyed me:1. Where the fuck did Yoruichi come from? Not a single mention of her anywhere in the whole movie and then BAM, Shunko.2. We are told right at the beginning of the movie that next to nothing is known about the Ouin then somehow Mayuri comes along and knows all of it\'s powers and capabilities (This at least could be understandable if it was Yamammoto who told us).3. How Ichigo has to be big part of the movie. If he had sat out of this one and left it to the soul society instead of going and saving the day I could\'ve enjoyed it so much more.4. What was that Zangetsu scene for?5. Most of all Ikkaku uses Bankai for no reason. His life wasn\'t in danger so there was no reason to reveal his Bankai, especially since it\'s supposed to be a big fucking secret.In my opinion this movie was just a cash grab. They chose a character a lot of people like and thought, fuck it lets make some money. If you\'re a big fan of Bleach and don\'t want to lose any respect for it, avoid this movie.Side note - This is my first review i apologise if i have missed any punctuation or used to much profanity.

Thanks for reading.', 'Movies deriving from a series are 99% of the time just filler episodes with better animation, more action and a lame story. Did this movie escape this formula and offered something different for a chance? … Hell, no. Be prepared for simply another filler mission, with predictable plot and pseudo-serious matters. Of course, chances are you watch Bleach just for the battles as neither the story nor the characters are deeper than a rain pond; so this will not faze you in the least.Animation and sound wise, the movie is very good. It uses cinematics greater than those in the initial episodes (how do I...miss those) and makes the story to look dramatic, like a good samurai movie. The level of lining detail is more or less the same, though there is a higher spectrum of colors and a much lower amount of static images and repeating frames. I must say that as far as atmosphere in a title like Bleach goes, the movie did a wonderful job.Of course, most will not care about this as much as the action part. Yes, there is action and it is freaking awesome. If you are into superpower battles, you will not be disappointed. Still, don’t expect any realism or decent choreography, as the whole deal was, and still is, just people yelling the names of their attacks and then their swords magically change shapes and spit all sorts of elemental spells. Thunders and lightings fill the screen and buildings crumble and dimensions merge and… Well, it looks epic, who cares about logic.Story and characters are, as expected, more shallow and uninteresting than in the series. Not by too much though, as all of us who know of Bleach are aware that there was never much meat around those bones to begin with. So, once again, Soul Society is in danger, all the captains attack and do a cameo parade of special attacks before Ichigo storms in and saves the day in the same fashion as always… Actually, the story is not very different than the Hueco Mundo ark. Same basic plot, same pattern in battles.I can only say that the shift of protagonist from the dorky lead Ichigo, to the white haired boy Hitsugaya was not very successful. Being a filler mission, it doesn’t matter how much they try to flesh him out. Sure, he is less pathetic than Strawberry Boy, but still, he is just another guy shy around women, wielding a magic sword. As for his tragic past and movie rival, it was quite ridiculous as you never quite see how his childhood friend managed to survive, raised a huge army of ghosts and invaded Soul Society like there was no protection at all. Or why the heck doesn’t anyone do something about the ever-present scheming leaders of Soul Society and just kills all those who try to change things. Anyways, Ichigo was still the one to beat the baddy, so what’s the point? Why don’t they just make a movie about Zaraki picking his nose and slaying monsters from beginning to end? It will be far more interesting and it will not even need a story. Anyways, as a whole it is about every character in the series showing off his powers before Ichigo predictably wins. Nice action, boring plot.Value and enjoyment … or the absence of them. I lost interest in shonen that are nothing more than brainless action and lame attempts at drama. There are far more interesting shonen, as there are far more dramatic and realistic samurai movies. This movie is more or less a waste of time.

It revolves around the fangirls favorite captain Hitsugaya Toshiro.  The plot much like the first Bleach movie is again full of holes, and nothing is truly explained.  The fighting is lackluster and the movie contradicts events in the movie and manga (Ie. Ichigo uses his Vizard form in Soul Society) the movie tries to redeem itself with a huge battle scene but I found it boring and ultimately found to movie quite boring. ', ""My first review! It's time for Becca-Boo's anime review~! Let's go!Overall, the movie was decent, had some funny moments and good moments but it was severely lacking in a good plot line.Story: 3/10Plot holes. Plot holes everywhere. I don't want to give any spoilers but there were multiple inconsistencies. The plot felt very confused because it introduced so many elements from the series that it remained unfocused throughout. The story being focused on Hitsugaya was refreshing and interesting but not well executed. Also, the logic displayed by characters was really bad. (Especially the head captain).Art: 6/10The quality of art and animation was...mostly just a small step up from usual. In some scenes, the characters were drawn awkwardly.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack is mostly enjoyable but sometimes seemed a little random.Character: 6/10The characters were mostly consistent with what is presented in the anime which is good. The villain was pretty stereotypical and lifeless.Enjoyment: 7/10I had some laughs, especially when Renji and Ichigo interact. c: Oh, and there's Kenpachi. Kenpachi just makes me ridiculously happy. XDOverall: 5/10Mainly disappointed with how this is written, but should be at least worth the watch if you like Bleach like I do. mostly just a small step up from usual.

The villain was pretty stereotypical and lifeless.Enjoyment: 7/10I had some laughs, especially when Renji and Ichigo interact. c: Oh, and there's Kenpachi. Kenpachi just makes me ridiculously happy.

The movie also has some very memorable fights and most of the worth mentioning soul reapers are in it and they have lines of some sort.The art in this movie, if anything, is better than that in the anime.  There are a lot of details and you can tell you're watching a movie and not just a very long anime episode.  The only real problem is...that it gets a bit blurry during fightsThe sound is the same, if not slightly better, lots of actiony things happening and the sounds suit the scenes.The characters in the movie are very well developed and all characters introduced early on have a relatively prominent role in the movie and are not just there to fill up the scene.  And also, as I said before, a lot of worth mentioning soul reapers are in it.I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  The art was done really well and I liked the way that it focused more on Toshiro than Ichigo for once, because I'm pretty sure everyone gets sick of seeing Ichigo from time to time.Overall the movie isn't perfect but it is a very, very, very good movie and definitely worth your time. that it gets a bit blurry during fightsThe sound is the same, if not slightly better, lots of actiony things happening and the sounds suit the scenes.The characters in the movie are very well developed and all characters introduced early on have a relatively prominent role in the movie and are not just there to fill up the scene.

There\'s even room for Ichigo bankai fans. I personally AM a Hitsugaya fan, so this is still a pretty good movie for me.Beyond Hitsugaya\'s illuminating presence, however, I found that the story was lacking in numerous ways. When you find out what\'s really going on, the plot seems very contrived (the council or whatever makes a decision and then abruptly changes that decision without any explanation of why, which is pretty important in my opinion - why was Hitsugaya chosen? What made him...better than Hisaka?). Characterization doesn\'t make much sense. Hitsugaya is also...randomly possessed? Wounded? What? (These were my thoughts through most of the story. By the way - Hitsugaya angst fans, this movie is DEFINITELY for you). They also start a sort of dissection of Hitsugaya\'s personality (Kisuke, Ichigo and Co.) and then just stop. It\'s really just RANDOMLY thrown in there.Also, this movie seems to be mainly a ""cameo"" movie. Characters like Kisuke, Orihime, Chad, and Uryu all show up (I can\'t remember if Yoruichi or the store people show up, but there\'s a likelihood they\'re in there). Almost ALL of the Soul Reapers show up. And watch for no apparent reason. This is formulaic for OVAs, which are typically filler between manga publication, but it\'s extra silly in this movie\'s case. At least in the ""Sailor Moon"" films, for instance, the cameo senshi mattered.I think my biggest beef with this movie is the plot holes. The main plot (the fact that there are two Hyorinmaru\'s) is never explained. Really. I mean, you could INFER that Hisaka and Hitsugaya have similar souls or personalities or something, which is why they\'re friends and why Hitsugaya is angsting so much (because it\'s hard for him to hurt his friend or because he could have been in Hisaka\'s place, etc.). But you really have to be thinking about it infer that. There aren\'t any noble words/sentiments given to imply that. Otherwise, the story reminds me of ""Ponyo"", where you\'re just dropped into half-formed plot. Their explanation is that sometimes there are two Zanpakuto that are the same. That\'s it. An explanation requires an explanans and an explanandum. WHERE ARE THE EXPLANANS HERE? There\'s no actual explanation - they just state the fact that it happens, done and done. So you\'re thinking: ""Okay...well...wait...what? Why? When? How?""Also, there\'s a point where one of the characters actually BRINGS up a BIG plot hole - why is Hitsugaya being accused of treason so soon? What did he do wrong? Why are all the captains and such being sent out after him? I guess this could be a possible nod to the premise of the first real ""Bleach"" arc: Rukia\'s incarceration and execution, which WAS considered over the top and no one really objected to it, which was weird (Aizen at least comments on all of this and it\'s explained). But of course, the problem in the movie is COMPLETELY ignored and they pushed right on.If all you want is a reason to see a bunch of soul reapers fight each other AND some arrancars (it actually ties in, I looked up; but their presence is still kind of random, in my opinion) then this is a movie for you. If you just want to see something ""Bleach"" related (and you want a cameo of your favorite ""Bleach"" character), then this is for you. If you didn\'t like ""Ponyo"", don\'t watch this.

It is always good to see all your favorite characters display their abilities that we may not see in the anime.

Unfortunately, this movie tried pulling out a fast one on us, but it did not click at all, with more loose plot threads and too little setup that it felt like an elementary kids' fight.The pacing was weird in this one,...it started very dully and slow, to the point of falling asleep somewhere at the beginning of the movie, like watching a Naruto filler hell, but then towards the end it speeds up the flow of events so much so your attention gives up processing anything that happens, knocking you back into reality “This is just a filler Movie, why should I care?”.Art (8/10):Definitely not the best I've seen from a Movie production, even back in the day. It just looks like a well-animated TV episode and nothing more.The characters are well defined, they look sharper and clearer than the usual blurry treatment they get from a weekly episode. The particle effects were spot on, probably the only shine in this mediocre work.Sound (8/10):When starting a movie, or any high production entertainment product, you'd at least expect the delivery to be on par with what you get from the regular of said product. I like voice acting in Bleach, I love the OSTs, I adore the ambient sound effects. Thankfully, all of that was present, but unfortunately, nothing new came out of it. Again, following the same trend of a well-animated filler episode.Characters (6/10):Well, that was an unfortunate turn of events.In every series, you have tat one character people put over the main characters, characters so cool they shatter that “side character” label and make it into countless fans' hearts, roll the dollars on merchandise, and even used to market their series at times, take into example “Kakashi, Levi, Law...”, in Bleach's case, that's undoubtedly Toshiro.To have a movie revolve around a fans' favorite is a clever way into marketing your series-related content that the fact it might backfire and just not work is staggering.The main villain made complete nonsense, it was painfully apparent how Toshiro is forced to act the way he did like nothing from his showings in the main series mattered. The villain was a doll, unrelatable, and just another typical vengeful figure that somehow makes the entire Soul Society bond to fight the greater evil.Enjoyment (7/10):This is a definitive upgrade from the first movie, no doubt, But not by a lot.It was definitely more encouraging to keep watch as all characters involved has had already been introduced properly and/or built-in relation to familiar characters, so not a lot of strange faces all introduced at once and you have to struggle and keep up with so many tongues rolling names.Again, the premise of revenge story has been done so many times in a lot of different shapes and flavors that it's practically hard to pull anything new to the mix, but more Bleach is always okay with me.Overlay (7.16/10):All in all, you're most likely not going to walk out of this movie mind blown, however, if you're looking for just another Bleach movie, this one has the best blend of fan service and filler crap that no one cares about. it started very dully and slow, to the point of falling asleep somewhere at the beginning of the movie, like watching a Naruto filler hell, but then towards the end it speeds up the flow of events so much so your attention gives up processing anything that happens, knocking you back into reality “This is just a filler Movie, why should I care?”.Art (8/10):Definitely not the best I've seen from a Movie production, even back in the day.

If your wish is to simply have more bleach this is certainly some of the more solid stuff the anime team created on their own.The cast of characters are utilized well and many get time in the spotlight without ever taking over too much. Despite this being ""Hitsugaya\'s movie"" as many fans like to say it still remembered that at the end of the day the main character is Ichigo. The movie even offers some interesting insight into Ichigo and how he...has chosen to deal with grief and loss (irregardless of how accurate that is to the manga) which was genuinely quite interesting to see Ichigo motivate another character for a change. Theres a lot of beautiful looking fights and a decent conflict for this movie. Nothing stellar or groundbreaking but certainly interesting for a bleach storyline as the movie involves the suspicion of treason from a captain. The investigation part is certainly more interesting of a way of filling out the story than what bleach normally does.Ultimately the movie is a solid experience that gives you exactly what you came for, some bleach that isnt hideous like the anime was at the time it released as a result of the movie being made. One really does not need to go out of their way to see it, but if you just wanna chug some bleach you could certainly do a lot lot worse. has chosen to deal with grief and loss (irregardless of how accurate that is to the manga) which was genuinely quite interesting to see Ichigo motivate another character for a change.

Meaning Inoue, Sado and Uryu get shafted like in most films in favor for Ichigo and the Shinigami. Meaning you have to prepare yourselves for a bunch of BAN-KAI releases eating runtime. Thus there is not a single memorable scene that stands out as many of the good ones are just inferior versions of the main story ones.As where this story could fit, it has to be before Ichigo fights Grimmjow the second time with the Shinigami being brought back to Soul Society for whatever reason and Aizen drinking tea or something. It may not really fit to the main continuity, but at least that would be the place where you can be sure when to watch this.The character arc of Hitsugaya is fine. Not something that impressive but him learning from Ichigo that he doesn't have to carry the burden alone is a good message nonetheless.Kusaka has a good backstory which will make you hate Central 46 even more but as a villain he seems rather underwhelming. There is justification for what he does but not how easy he archives his goal.We see a bit of Rangiku's struggle but she isn't that impactful to the film despite being second in command in Squad 10. Not to say she didn't do anything.Kyoraku, Nanao, Ukitake, Mayuri and Byakuya were also coming in clutch during the investigation and analysis about the identity and truth about Kusaka giving them a role besides just receiving information, reacting and defeating enemies with their Shikai or Bankai.Fights themselves are really underwhelming with the Captains just showing off like always. And some annoying cliches with Soifon being incompetent so she can be rescued.However, Ichigo's first encounter with Kusaka had some good use of sharing thoughts through Zanpakuto clashing, a decent use of the abilities of ones weapons and the enemies using teamwork in a visually pleasing way instead of taking turns which is usual for Bleach fights.Overall this movie was average. The fights weren't memorable. And characters that should get more focus didn't get the care they needed. It is a shame that Kusaka despite his backstory didn't leave much of an impact as a character since the plot device worked however the plot wanted it to be. Like the previous and later Bleach movies, it can't reach its full potential wasting lots of times for fan service. There are too many characters and a generic slaughter of weak characters by the high tier Shinigami.But the finale was still good for Bleach movie standards.

Zero no Tsukaima F,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11319/Zero_no_Tsukaima_F,"['Well, this is my first review, and I don\'t think I\'m good at writing them, but I\'ll give a try.I\'ve scored the three previous season to 7, mainly because it was repetitive, and there was not this thing that embraces your mind and take you to an other world.And then, I\'ve watched this season, the final one. And it is perfect. Louise is becoming more and more mature, even if she keeps her tsundere style which is still funny (although it annoyed me a lot of times, but hey, it\'s who she is after all). For Saito, it\'s approximatively the same, he\'s growing too,...and we really see their relationship evolving...About the scenes, there is a lot more romantic scenes than before, which is wonderful because their kind of different from the previous season, there is something that makes you feel good, and you\'re happy for them too in some way.Since I was also obsessed by the magic scenes with void magic and all that, you should know that there\'s also a LOT more of these scenes, and I found that they were much more impressive.I\'m also noticing the OST which is just full of epicness (special note for the song ""Passion"" which I\'m listening right now).I think they did a really good work, this season embraces the whole series, and every episode makes you feel wonderful and the two final episodes are just so much awesome that you can\'t accept it is already over, and then you see how it was just a nicely dream in which you will go back someday... and we really see their relationship evolving...About the scenes, there is a lot more romantic scenes than before, which is wonderful because their kind of different from the previous season, there is something that makes you feel good, and you\'re happy for them too in some way.Since I was also obsessed by the magic scenes with void magic and all that, you should know that there\'s also a LOT more of these scenes, and I found that they were much more impressive.I\'m also noticing the OST which is just full of epicness (special note for the song ""Passion"" which I\'m listening right now).I think they did a really good work, this season embraces the whole series, and every episode makes you feel wonderful and the two final episodes are just so much awesome that you can\'t accept it is already over, and then you see how it was just a nicely dream in which you will go back someday...', 'Zero no Tsukaima F is the final season of the series and it features a young boy Saito getting abused by his master Louise. Stuff happens, Saito is extremely indecisive about his relationship with Louise, stuff gets fixed. Nothing new is really found in this season and I won\'t go too much into detail about the summary because hey, you should have seen the previous three seasons before you watch the 4th one, no?So about the story.. heh. If you have seen the previous seasons, you\'ll have a pretty good idea what happens. Some stuff happens, maybe some random fanservice here and there, filler episodes...randomly thrown in out of nowhere, a problem occurs  and is solved with usually an unrealistic solution that probably has some plot holes. And by plot holes, I don\'t mean ""look very deep into the anime"" ones, I mean ""wtf how did they just do that it didn\'t make any sense at all"" kind of plot holes. It takes the fantasy genre to a whole new level and again, not in a good way (SPOILER example: Saito stealing a fighter jet from a military base in 2 seconds).  Some of it can be attributed to the fact that the majority of the season was rushed but all in all, they really did not need some of the fillers; it was just a waste of time. If you\'re one of those people that like to have an intricate plot with plenty of BAM moments, this is not the anime for you. The plot is lackluster and very predictable. The ending was a perfect example of this. Personally, I thought the ending was very predictable but it fits the anime. Having said that though, ZnT is NOT about the story. If you have been watching this for the story, then I got news for you, choose something else to watch. The story here is just there to have at least some ""meaning""  between each episode, nothing special.Al-right, the characters. The characters are again, nothing special. An abusive tsundere, some boobs, some more boobs, and a loli. This anime throughout the seasons has shown no character development, Louise and Saito were supposedly married at the end of season two but Saito is still an indecisive guy and Louise still blows him up. Usually this would lower the score as dynamic characters are always good but the thing is, it\'s what the anime is known for. This is why most people have continued to watch though the seasons. Sure, Saito will piss you off every time he ogles some girls breast because he completely lacks self-control or some other stuff that ticks you off. The non-changing character foils that have been constant throughout all four seasons is the selling point of this anime. You don\'t watch this to see some well thought out strategy like Death Note or the plain awesomeness of Steins;Gate, you watch this too see Saito getting blown up by explosions and the tsundere Louise being her usual self and the relationship between them. I will have to say that it will probably get tiring if you watch this in one go.The sound doesn\'t really do much considering most of the BGM is just reused from the previous seasons. In some cases, it certainly does help set the mood and I loved how they reused one of the openings during one of the final episodes. The energetic OP also adds towards the enjoyment of the anime; it fits the mood. Though the EP isn\'t bad, the usage of it is certainly questionable in some cases. Something some by Rie Kugimiya doesn\'t really fit certain situations if you know what I mean.The art wasn\'t really exceptional and doesn\'t take away from the anime itself. Not much to comment on this as it doesn\'t feature any special art style. The battle scenes were too short in my opinion.I\'m a Louise fan so this is probably biased but I really enjoyed the series overall. If I was to use by biased score, this would be a 10/10 just because I\'m a huge Louise fan. That\'s kind of the thing with this anime, either you\'ll hate the characters (I don\'t think many people expected much out of the story anyways) or come to love em. The story was really annoying at certain points because of the number of episodes that were just pointless. They could have easily just spent a couple of minutes or not even included certain parts (really didn\'t need a episode dedicated towards the crowning of a queen) of the anime. The ending however, was probably the saving grace for this anime. I personally value a conclusive ending opposed to some random harem ending. Overall, I think that this season manages to set up the end of the series only leaving some minor plot holes. Watch this with a grain of salt in mind.Feedback is appreciated as this was my first review. randomly thrown in out of nowhere, a problem occurs  and is solved with usually an unrealistic solution that probably has some plot holes. And by plot holes, I don\'t mean ""look very deep into the anime"" ones, I mean ""wtf how did they just do that it didn\'t make any sense at all"" kind of plot holes. It takes the fantasy genre to a whole new level and again, not in a good way (SPOILER example: Saito stealing a fighter jet from a military base in 2 seconds).  Some of it can be attributed to the fact that the majority of the season was rushed but all in all, they really did not need some of the fillers; it was just a waste of time. If you\'re one of those people that like to have an intricate plot with plenty of BAM moments, this is not the anime for you. The plot is lackluster and very predictable. The ending was a perfect example of this. Personally, I thought the ending was very predictable but it fits the anime. Having said that though, ZnT is NOT about the story. If you have been watching this for the story, then I got news for you, choose something else to watch. The story here is just there to have at least some ""meaning""  between each episode, nothing special.Al-right, the characters. The characters are again, nothing special. An abusive tsundere, some boobs, some more boobs, and a loli. This anime throughout the seasons has shown no character development, Louise and Saito were supposedly married at the end of season two but Saito is still an indecisive guy and Louise still blows him up. Usually this would lower the score as dynamic characters are always good but the thing is, it\'s what the anime is known for. This is why most people have continued to watch though the seasons. Sure, Saito will piss you off every time he ogles some girls breast because he completely lacks self-control or some other stuff that ticks you off.

New characters are introduced, but they don\'t take up too much time in favor of action and plot. Those first three episodes on their own could have made the entire season, to the point that if they had been released as an OVA on their own, I wouldn\'t have been surprised.... And perhaps they should have. With the fourth episode, we\'re treated to the typical cliches and...gags, with Louise wanting Saito on her own time but being her nasty, violent excuse for ""tsun"" the rest of the time. Admittedly, in the first episode, there was an argument that was fairly petty, but it was resolved surprisingly well for this series.Furthermore, the fact that Siesta, who was a fairly enjoyable character in the first season, and now even Tabitha, have been reduced to, essentially, characters that just cling to Saito just to cause an issue for Louise, not to mention the fact that Louise constantly takes THEIR affections out on Saito, almost as often as he\'s pledged his devotion to her (he does, admittedly, ask for it sometimes) just makes things all the more ridiculous.What\'s more, there\'s a plot device used to keep Siesta around, in that the queen asked her to be Saito\'s maid, but thinking about it - Wouldn\'t the queen know better than to do this after observing them for, oh, five minutes? Especially given that Siesta\'s self-proclaimed ""love rival"" is the queen\'s best friend, and as of season three, sister?Ultimately, the flaw with what follows the great first three episodes (or perhaps just great THIRD episode - the first had its share of these problems as well) is that this series is trying to be a harem when it\'s got an established romance, and isn\'t letting its characters develop like they should in order to keep the harem aspect going when it\'s been clear (and even canon) from early on that there is no point to having a harem here.Our protagonists have been saying from as early as the second season they love each other, we should not be arriving on the fourth season with the relationship still acting in a standstill, and with Louise acting in the same, petty way she has been all along, guided by shallow plot devices.Aside from the romance/harem aspect of the series, however, the plot seems to be shaping up to be as good as always, and development outside of Louise has been decent. We\'ve seen how Saito has grown since he\'s come to this world, and even how side characters like Guiche have taken to being warriors in their own way.Overall, I\'ll be watching to the end, but unless things improve drastically in regards to Louise and her relationship with Saito this time around, I think I won\'t be too sad to see this one end here. gags, with Louise wanting Saito on her own time but being her nasty, violent excuse for ""tsun"" the rest of the time.

The 4th season of Zero no Tsukaima, and let me tell you why I scored this so poorly.All through out the whole series Louise has not changed in any aspect what so ever. She still goes on with the same routine, ""oh I\'m going to trust Saito from now on"" and ends up frying his ass at least once in each episode.This season would have been some what bearable if Louise had some character development, but unfortunately that is not the case.This also goes for the other characters as well, almost NOBODY has really developed through the series. Because of this each...episode is just the same thing over and over again, and to be honest I\'m sick and tired of it. episode is just the same thing over and over again, and to be honest I\'m sick and tired of it.', ""I thought i would dislike this season after that mediocre third season, but surprisingly this is the best season of the entire anime, everything is improved and i for once didn't find Louise and Saito's realationship pointless and annoying.StoryOn this season, there's just two stories to follow, the mission that the queen Henrietta gave both to see what the Pope wants from them and the other story is the finally growing relationship between Louise and Saito, finally there's not hate-love between them, but more love, more romantic and that was good after a step back in season three.Art & AnimationThe art and animations really improved,...it was colorful and brighter, and smooth, it was the best of the four seasons, the overall was very good.SoundThe sound was the same, with little changes but still was good.CharacterFinally they developed Louise and Saito, and it was a big improvement, the other characters weren't behind on improvement neither, finally we get to know more a lot of their background, overall it was very good.EnjoymentThe only season that i enjoyed a lot and wanted every season to be like this, because i felt like they restarted and improved everything on a good way, the ending left me wanting more, because they finally are together and trusth eachother and i liked how Louise changed from being the kind of tsundere that i hate to a calm tsundere like Taiga when she was with Ryuuji. it was colorful and brighter, and smooth, it was the best of the four seasons, the overall was very good.SoundThe sound was the same, with little changes but still was good.CharacterFinally they developed Louise and Saito, and it was a big improvement, the other characters weren't behind on improvement neither, finally we get to know more a lot of their background, overall it was very good.EnjoymentThe only season that i enjoyed a lot and wanted every season to be like this, because i felt like they restarted and improved everything on a good way, the ending left me wanting more, because they finally are together and trusth eachother and i liked how Louise changed from being the kind of tsundere that i hate to a calm tsundere like Taiga when she was with Ryuuji."", 'Zero no Tsunami F is the final and last sequel to ""Familiar of Zero"" series.I am very excited to review this show as this was also a pathway for me to enjoy and love anime. Please start with season one.Zero no Tsunami F and it\'s prequel may be your classic harem with a Tsusendere and a average boy as your main character with lots of girls surrounding him but this is worth the watch. Giving this show a 8 was a solid score surrounding this series as a whole but could have exceeded my expectations even more.When looking at the 2 main...character which are Louise and Saito. You can really say that there relationship is funny, cute and overdramatic at certain times. When the manga was being adapted into an anime I was surprised that it lasted so long with four seasons completed. Tbh I think everyone had a thrilling ride watching this show.Knowing this was a romantic comedy with a magic theme that had been included gave it a refreshing feeling to the viewer as each sometimes episode contained a element of randomness which gave us a comedic and light refreshing feel towards the show.The anime begins by continuing to describe the adventures that follow the ""Hero"" Hiraga, Saito and the ""unique women"" called Le Blanc de La Vallière, Louise Francoise Better known as (Zero Louise) whom has a funny but cute relationship. Reference to the first season is where Saito appears from the human world to Tristein Academy.This anime includes other genres such as comedy and drama that is centred around the main characters. The magic and dramatic elements are given at unexpected moments but that builds up the enjoyment. This however creates a very unique and always different situations between the main characters, but when we observe this situation we can a new picture that is created when a new cloud always get painted over the old. When watching the show you know these characters have a sense of little or no maturity at all (Really pushing it Louise there) and gives them the ability to tackle new challenges with awesome but hilarious methods. This type of lifestyle gives a pretty accurate description of the whole anime and it is pretty different from your usual romantic comedy that we occasionally see from time to time.I find the pacing of the show to be slow/moderate in the viewers point but I am not judge. It tells us a story in a suitable manner that is executed with minor or no flaws at all. This allows the viewer to be entertained with none or little mood swings. If the series was any slower or faster I might have to change my thoughts on the shows progression.Being a romantic comedy anime, It all comes down to Familiar of Zero being able to give us comedic and straight in the face lines. The interactions between different characters gives us different moments in were we just laugh hysterically or cry. You can relate to the characters emotions shown by facial expressions and the uneasy movement they might produce. Being a comedic anime I am certain it will make you laugh and give dramatic moments where you will not feel at ease.Zero no Tsukami is a good way to enter a romantic comedy where you will be laugh away. When the audience try\'s to understand the characters I think they will judge them by there personality and how they interact and develop new bonds and feelings which tighten the show all together. This gives the audience a small feeling of the characters current emotions.The comedy and drama may not seem new to most but with the addition of random twists and characters gives light to a whole new drama. on Classical comedy being one of them, It depends if the viewer has enjoyed it in which it has altered the opinion of the viewer towards the series. However having some magic included will also draw the audience closer and will have a significant influence on there overall opinion of the show.Again having not read the manga I wouldn\'t presume that the anime is way off from its paper counterpart.Having magic integrated into the show gives it a new light.The anime try to tackle the development of relationships between characters through dramatic or random situations and through interactions and actions done by the characters which little by little develops more and more. The difference this show has compared to others of the same genre is how the characters are portrayed and overly influenced. We see the story from the main 2 characters however there is parts that give the views of the other characters as they encounter new challenges and develop new feelings towards them and others.Thus telling us Zero no Tsukami gives us an enjoyable watch to take in and remember.The design of the characters is well based given the date for this show and its prequel with little or some difference in facial features and expression.The setting is wonderful and gives us a magical theme by the use of different light schemes and scenery. The colour used is simplistic and elegant giving a bright view of the setting.Concluding this review. Zero no Tsukami was giving a different feel compared to its recommendations. I did not know wether I was gonna enjoy it or be completely bored and mad but I am glad I am safe as this turned to be an very good show whom anyone can enjoy no matter your age.Thanks for reading character which are Louise and Saito.

As for the story it's the same good ol story from the last three seasons it starts off with Saito dreaming about Louise and Siesta then he touches Louises boob then wakes up because in his dream he describes her boob as a flat plain and Siesta's as a Mountain range then Louise blows a hole through the wall with her explosion. I kinda figured i'd start that way, but to be honest I feel like Saito is more of a perv after every season progress. Also i'm starting to...find that when ever a romantic serious moment is about to happen something funny happens for relief.As for the sound&art it's still the same  from the other three seasons.In conclusion this series isn't perfect, but since I been watching from season one im hooked. I've enjoyed the pass three seasons of this anime and i'm looking forward to this fourth season.Although i've only watched one episode I think it's going to be a good one. find that when ever a romantic serious moment is about to happen something funny happens for relief.As for the sound&art it's still the same  from the other three seasons.In conclusion this series isn't perfect, but since I been watching from season one im hooked.

Explosion...again?AUTHOR\'S NOTE:With 4 seasons under its belt, Zero no Tsukaima has quite the history of being a popular anime. I\'m not a fan of magic/fantasy animes but the first season impressed me enough to continue watching the 2nd and 3rd season. The reason why I want to take the final season into account is to wrap Zero no Tsukaima up in a package and show you why it fell into oblivion in its final premise.STORY (5/10):It was expected. Before I even touched the first episode, I closed my eyes and used my clairvoyant magic to predict what this story would...be about. Miraculously, I was able to stay ten steps ahead of the anime, as it went on. An anime with such predictable plot can\'t be enjoyed, as viewers like twist and surprises (unless, you don\'t...?). I was able to hold my patience for the 1st season, but I had already grown tired of the repetitive storyline at the middle of the 2nd season. I had hoped at the final season, the writers would come up with a well-crafted ending. No, it was not a well-crafted ending, in fact, it left me sitting there unsatisfied and possibly annoyed. For the last season, the writers somehow mustered all of their powers to create as much plot holes as possible, in order to create their own disastrous ending. Even with two worlds they could play with (the real world vs the magic world), the writers could not handle such large responsibilities and decided to keep Japan out of the loop until the very end of the anime.There is no storyline in the final season. In 12 episodes, many of them were fillers, while the real plot felt like Groundhog Day, cases of villainy acts which are outdone by the magical words: deux ex machina. This anime should have been re-titled: ""Zero, the Duex ex Machina"" because that\'s all you are going to see in the battles in Zero no Tsukaima F.ART (5/10):A lot of laziness. Since the final season mostly focuses on Halkeginia, we see copy and paste backgrounds and recycled animations. What were the production team thinking? I highly doubt the art will impress viewers, especially if you have been watching the previous seasons. It\'s the same old, same old. Dull and inexpensive, even the Academy, which looked detailed and beautiful in the first season now looks like a Barbie playhouse.The action scenes aren\'t very moving either. And with half of the episodes being fillers, we don\'t get to see much action. In fact, the only notable scene in the final season is the final battle...though it\'s not impressive at all.SOUND (8/10):Ichiko and Rie Kugimiya must be amazing artists (they are), as they were featured in the OP and the EP for all four seasons. I\'ve enjoyed all of the OPs and EPs in the Zero no Tsukaima series and was pleasantly surprised that they were all sung by these two wonderful artists. The OP ""I\'ll Be There For You"" by Ichiko has an adventurous melody which keeps the viewers interested and pumped up while the EP ""Kiss Shite Agenai"" sung by Kugimiya is catchy and bouncy, which brings the anime to a nice close. However, it does get awkward when the anime begins to take its cliffhangers to a darker turn. The EP seems to disturb whatever emotions the anime tried to display.CHARACTERS (5/10):Saito Hiraga has been our main hero of Zero no Tsukaima for four seasons. Throughout these years, I\'ve tried to comprehend and analyze his personality and his growth. You want to know what I found out? He\'s a tortured boy, leashed and whipped by a girl who has a permanent, problematic personality called here in America...well, a bitch. Now, I know that may sound misogynistic but hear me out, ladies. I don\'t care how much you love your man, but if you have any of the personalities of the characters here in Zero no Tsukaima -- please get out of my face. That is extremely unattractive. And having to see Saito still fall for any of these characters is utterly baffling. Despite his mysterious charm towards Louise and the other weirdos in the anime, I applaud his loyalty and patience.Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is our main heroine. Despite her fancy, bourgeoisie, exaggerated name, her personality does not match to that caliber. If there was a game called ""Tsundere"", Louise would be the final boss. A complete super-ultra tsundere, she may become your favorite anime character (if you\'re an M) or you may want to slap her upside the head and tell her to shut up (if you\'re an S). However, she does a cute side to her -- just don\'t provoke her or speak of, think of, or touch another woman. Whether it was a misunderstanding or your true intentions, our heroine will pour down her wrath on you before listening to your reasoning, no matter how convincing they are.The villains in Zero no Tsukaima F are not interesting at all. Actually, if you technically take out the characters that have died off extremely quickly or allied with the hero/heroine, there is only one villain in the entire season, which is complete laziness on the production team\'s part.I feel like we are supposed to learn from the allies and friends more than the hero/heroine. They are willing to sacrifice limbs in order to protect the main characters and we see this in each episode consecutively. Whether they are love rivals, or ex-villains, they always give way to the main characters so they can shine.OVERALL (5/10):I\'ve had my share of fun in the first and second season, but it has become too bland. It\'s like taking a lick of a never-ending lollipop (Tootsie-pop, anyone?). The Zero no Tsukaima series has given us the perfect picture of a well-versed anime with a lot of potential, slowly rotting around the edges. Although I\'ve tried to recall the comedy and romantic moments, I couldn\'t fully enjoy the final season due to its poor execution.*cough* Louise is overrated. *cough* be about.

The Zero no Tsukaima series has given us the perfect picture of a well-versed anime with a lot of potential, slowly rotting around the edges. Although I\'ve tried to recall the comedy and romantic moments, I couldn\'t fully enjoy the final season due to its poor execution.*cough* Louise is overrated. *cough*', 'This is my first review, so lets start n_nZero no Tsukaima F, maybe the worst season of the ZNT series, plus non of al the Zero no tsukaima seasons were never such a masterpiece, but this season, oh, this!... i never expected such piece of... poop. By the way, let\'s start by sections.-Character: The same thing as the other season~ ""Saito-Kun i love you"", 2 second later ""Saito-Kun you stupid dog! EXPLOXION KJSJBHJKFDS!"" is really annoying and people get tired of the same thing, sometimes i wish that Louise would be less dumb and pick another one to, at least, make Saito jealous. Also, some...of the enemies that are in te OP, they just appear in 3 chapters and they piss me off, they don\'t do Nothing!they just stand there because yes. The same with others. I think the only extras who did something in the anime were Tiffa and Siesta... But just in an echii way. Characters doesn\'t exist in this anime: 2-Art & Animation: I really like the art, i\'ve seen better, but is still something that makes it special, but the problem in this anime is the animation. Sometimes it get\'s really lazy, maybe animations were made with sony vegas (ba dum tss): 7-Story: Is nothing new, i\'ve already seen Saito dissapear and then appear again in the previous seasons, a lot of boobs and and the Saito-lovers and blah blah... Really tedious, at least the fight scenes were enough enjoyable to make me put interest in the anime: 3-Sound: Nothing special, is not bad, actually is good, but is really forgettable: 6And finally:-Enjoyment: Did i enojoy the anime? no, is as simple as that, no, i didn\'t enjoy it. The scenes who were comedy"" it was just a box about to explode of fanservice. In all the anime i just laughed at 1 scene. the fight scenes were really ok, if those scenes weren\'t tedious i would enjoy it more.-Final Result: the anime is like this: First 8 episodes are fanservice-explosion-conflict-more fanservice- drama-conflict resolved-Fanservice-explosion That\'s all, the rest of the episodes are just drama-saito\'s gone-drama-saito\'s back- conflict resolved- fanservice again. Just like the Third season. It was a waste of time? Mmmmm... let\'s say yes: 3/10 of the enemies that are in te OP, they just appear in 3 chapters and they piss me off, they don\'t do Nothing!they just stand there because yes. The same with others.

Ya also I wanted to see what happened to them in the end! Did they have kids? how did the maid (is her name sista?) ended up? Oh and the elf chick tiffa! (I really hated her character...

I had not expected much from this show, this what almost felt to be half-assed show with nothing in it. Of course... that\'s when I first started. Looking back now, this show had absolutely been one of my favorites. How the jokeful beginning, although what back then I had thought to be (when i say beginning i literally mean the first episode) god awful had only contributed to the over all beauty of this anime. This...is one of the few animes that I felt had wrapped up very nicely. There was no""wait, can\'t there be an episode where they do this?"" Everything had been fulfilled in this anime. The serious moments had only been uplifted as the jokeful ones were meant to be. To be honest, I\'m glad there were this many episodes, around 50. Because with this, you can almost feel the full impact of the entire anime. The love between Saito and Louise, their moments together, how they grew to be fond of each other and literally couldn\'t live without each other. You could feel the steady tension, the rising emotions and feelings. It had felt like you WERE saito, as each episode (throughout the entire series) had shown you a little bit of their lives. Each and every part, their fights, when they didn\'t like each other, when they missed each other, when they loved each other, and everything. This had all contributed to the overall feel of the anime, leaving you with this almost heart ache when the serious moments do come. As I\'d like to point out clearly, you could feel the steadiness of the anime, like as if it never skipped. You don\'t see them liking each other out of the blue for no reason, you reason with yourself how they got to like each other and it makes sense. It\'s not a surprise when you see them admit and say ""i love you"" because you could feel the steadiness and pacing. After finishing this anime.... I do believe I must call it a flower anime, or some corny stuff like that. An anime that, honestly, in the beginning you don\'t even know why you\'re watching. It seems to be horrid and god awful and this shouldn\'t even exist. However, when you finally finish it, or the more you progress into it, the more you realize that every past action is simply meant to bring about the beauty in the next.

Well though out of how they fight, how the groups interact and connect to others, especially the ideas of the final weapon, what they used to fight. i it should have more feelings to it, than just fan service.the art was pretty ok.. giving it 7/10 probably is the best i could. the pictures and all were very cute and nice looking. the background, the characters designs were just great, but the most thing that i think is lacking are more of the smooth movement of the art. sometime i think the part of a character, such as the hair just move like a paper... note very sooth motion to it, and it doesn't quite look natural, or realistic to a normal hair, even though it's not normal hair anyway... the color and designs of all things were nice, but in my opinion it needs a little more smoothness to the movements of the characters.the sounds are great, 9/10. it has a nice soundtrack to it at the right moment, whether the situation gets in a bad, or a good mood. the sounds pretty much fits in most of all things in the anime, and it's very accurate in terms of how it would actually sounds in the reality.the characters could be good or bad depending on your own thinking, 8/10. as of that most character to me is pretty normal, but in every anime there are just some characters that just annoys the heck out of you, making you wish there's not just that character. but those characters are just a need thing so that it would probably make other characters looks better. Louise is just one of the character that just is annoying. this is probably debatable since there's a lot of different kinds of people in this world, and i think she is, is because of how she act, or what she say to Saito. i'm not a big fan of Saito that much too, since even though he have an important role, it doesn't even look like he's even trying in anything, such as, he barely even practice much. he does but not much, since if you had watch what happens in the near to last episode, he has shown to be pretty weak still. he's only strong probably because of the things that support him, such as his sword. so far the only person in Zero no Tsukaima that i don't quite like is just Louise, since she can be a lot of a bother, and of course her words are just both cute, but mostly irritating.overall i think this anime is worth to watch. if people like anime that has romance as its genre i think this might be a great anime. it's very enjoyable, relaxing and sometimes it just takes your minds of stuff, like for example i'm writing this review after finished watching this anime, and totally forgot to do the project that is due tomorrow. if you finished all the other seasons and finally going to watch this final season, i hope that you will enjoy the most of it, but don't get into it that much, that you might attempt to do the thing at the final episode with the plane and the moon.

( trying to not give away any spoilers )"", ""How an anime goes from good to very good.I rated the previous seasons as following:Season 1: 6Season 2 and 3: 7The main reasoning behind this, being that especially season 1, had insanely rushed material, and the plot felt lacking.Season 4 is a whole different thing, and I am going to explain why.The plot/story in this season starts off well made, and interesting. I rushed through this season faster then any of the others. I kinda feel that the whole plot and storytelling style grows on you. You kinda realize that this anime was never ment for slow-paced plot with huge details in how the...world works (Log Horizon is a grand example of this). It's also not all about the realization of the style, it's about the presentation of  the style in this season, that makes it better then the others.For one of the few times in this anime, I have actually understood most of Louise's actions. I have understood when she got mad at him. (Because, be honest, who didn't hate the guts out of that girl in the first 1-2 seasons? Atleast I did. I was actually so mad at her at times I was hitting my PC.) The example here comes from when Saito kissed someone he shouldn't have. And there was no explaining against it. After all, it's a harem anime, so stuff like this will happen, but I felt that the way Louise and Saito handled it felt rushed and left them both with a weakened relationship. This did not show at all, as their relationship is basically rising every single episode in season 4.Many people are giving this season a -1 for lackluster episodes. I am mainly thinking about the mid-episodes where Louise, Saito, Tabitha, and last but not least Siesta is at their mansion. These episodes, are episodes I really like. For me, a person who really falls in love with characters, these are golden. I really enjoy just watching the characters enjoy themselves, and I really enjoy watching Saito and Louise getting together. I personally give more positives due to the season having time for relaxed pure good-feel episodes with lots of HILARIOUS harem.In this season, I believe everything improved. Especially the humour. I was actually laughing quite a lot. If you have already finished the season, I am especially thinking of when Tifa enters the room and can't fit her dress on, Louise goes to help, and her dress just falls off whipping her boobs out. Saito's face really got me.Not just this, but now that Louise treating Saito as a dog became more rarely, it got humourus when she actually did. And as the season progressed in many ways, I also had the feeling that he deserved it. Not like he did in the first seasons, where in my opinion wished Saito to dump Louise and go away with Siesta.Siesta is one of the best developed characters in the anime if you ask me. Her personality is so easy to spot and is really amazingly developed in a way that you feel like you really, really know her. She is a very humourus character. I can't count how many times she made me laugh this season, and each laugh made me love her more. This one scene, when Louise and Siesta is talking about what I remember as potentional enemies, and Siesta brings up Tabitha's dragon. When Siesta impersonates the dragon, is the best Siesta moment in my opinion.  (If anyone has a YT clip or gif from this, please PM me as I really wanna see this again.)As it goes for the op song in this season, I have to say I am a bit disappointed. It did not live up to it's previous season 3 op, and of course First kiss from season 1. FIRST KISS KARA HAJIMARU!The ending was for me, settling. I love endings that leave you fed up (not in a bad way) with the anime. There are no questions to be answered, and everything went as you had hoped. This ending had that, and I loved every second of the last couple of episodes.As an ending to my review, I thank the developers of this anime for an amazing ride. I am very glad I picked this anime up, and I am very glad I continued watching after a lackluster season 1. This anime and especially season 4, have given me tons of laughs and tears.

Zero f begins by finishing off the cliff-hangers from last season, followed by a few light-heart comedic episodes, and finally develop into a final, climatic arc. If you are a fan of the light novel, the last arc is probably not to your liking, as it derives significantly from the book. However, if you have not read the novel, the arc  is quite satisfying, especially the ending....The ending is perhaps one of the most complete ending (as in no loose end) I have seen.Overall, if you have watched the previous three seasons, this season still retains what makes the series great, the comedy and the ecchiness. An improvement over previous seasons is an increase in character development (which will be more apparent if you have watched the previous seasons). If you have not watched any of the previous seasons, I suggest you give the series a try if you are a fan of comedy or fantasy.

I will address each of the following elements in order:Story (5)The plot of the final season is borderline nothing special to a disappointment. The character interactions are just basically repeated. The females that were all gaga over Saito continue to fight for his love and every episode has its share of big boobs. I was very disappointed in the way the story line tossed away the struggle against Joseph, King of Galia. Compared to the stories behind the previous seasons,...the final season seems like it's composed of 6 legit episodes and then 6 fillers.Art (7)The artwork is the same as it has been in the previous seasons. I never regarded the art in this anime a masterpiece, but I didn't hate it either. It's alright.Sound (7)The music does get very repetitive depending on the style of the scene, but the previous seasons of this anime have already prepared me to expect this so there wasn't any disappointment there. Given the mediocre storytelling, I guess the makers complimented it with mediocre sound choices.Character (7)Some new characters are introduces and they are as cliche as you will find them in any anime.If you have seen previous seasons, then the characters remain pretty much the same as they were.Enjoyment (7)It's definitely enjoyable. I don't think anyone was expecting a masterpiece out of this one.Overall (7)Viewers may find this season a bit disappointing if they were anticipating it. Upon closer examination, the final season is really what we all expected: a light, entertaining, cliche, conclusion to the Familiar of Zero series. Not too good. Not bad. Meh. the final season seems like it's composed of 6 legit episodes and then 6 fillers.Art (7)The artwork is the same as it has been in the previous seasons. I never regarded the art in this anime a masterpiece, but I didn't hate it either. It's alright.Sound (7)The music does get very repetitive depending on the style of the scene, but the previous seasons of this anime have already prepared me to expect this so there wasn't any disappointment there. Given the mediocre storytelling, I guess the makers complimented it with mediocre sound choices.Character (7)Some new characters are introduces and they are as cliche as you will find them in any anime.If you have seen previous seasons, then the characters remain pretty much the same as they were.Enjoyment (7)It's definitely enjoyable. I don't think anyone was expecting a masterpiece out of this one.Overall (7)Viewers may find this season a bit disappointing if they were anticipating it. Upon closer examination, the final season is really what we all expected: a light, entertaining, cliche, conclusion to the Familiar of Zero series. Not too good. Not bad. Meh."", ""This is a great ending, to one of the most enjoyable anime out there, the story is not the most complex, but it is simple and different, and it follows the previous seasons very well.

(spoilers obviously)This anime was a lot of fun to watch as far as the plot goes. good believable characters staying true to their character when events unfolded. You have saito, a badass mc with a dynamic harem who is actually decisive for once and can see why ladies fall for him...is what I would have said if he was actually the mc. No the mc is louise because she summons saito as her familiar and has the same...problems like your typical harem protagonist. She is weak, indecisive, undeserving, and most of all stupid. Sure saito gets the spotlight but the bottom line is he exists for louise. The fact he can and did die while louise has that mc plot armor to save her ass after making stupid decisions time and time again kind of seals the mc deal to me.Now before I get into why I just hate louise and how she ruins the entire series for me, I need to explain why I don't blame saito for some of the stupid things he does nor any of the other girls in his fake but rather dynamic harem. Let's start with Saito.Here is a guy who has been summoned into a completely different world to serve as some girl's slave. He took it pretty well and even lives up to the title as familiar. He even dies for this girl and her world while at the same time, even washes the girl's dirty pantsus. Don't get me wrong, dude has flaws and does things he shouldn't that hurts louise but at the same time, I understand why he does such things. Louise is no doubt, abusive towards him and constantly rewards his attempts to please her by overreacting explosions. By the 3rd season, she starts kicking the balls which is never ok towards the guy you love and plain to have children with. The girls who were throwing themselves at saito were serious threats to their relationship by rewarding him when Louise should have been the one to do so.Now to discuss why I don't hate any of the women throwing themselves at saito.  The nature of saito's harem is very dynamic and just doesn't happen for no reason. It happens over time with each female having believable reasons why they want to pursue him when they know he is serious about louise. Hell two of the ladies fell off the harem wagon due to other interests/wanting to support another member of saito's harem.  I have read many reviews/opinions/polls angry at these ladies for trying to get with saitobut if one saw from the ladies point of view, it makes perfect sense for why they would go after saito which is they all, at some level, think saito can do better.Queen Henrietta goes for him because louise doesn't treasure saito who could die at any moment like her childhood love did. Saito literally dies fighting against 70,000 dudes just to make sure they all escape and next week louise is casting explosion on saito as soon as he comes back alive to go home to her.Then there is Siesta the maid(best girl seriously) who knows she has to be aggressive if she wants to win saito. In a world where nobles treat her like shit, Saito is a shinning star in her world. He is a man that did not care what nobles thought of him and treated commoners kindly. Just about every commoner treat him like he is their champion for his actions and it doesn't help he has earned himself a title that puts him in the same, if not, higher standing to nobles. To her, she constantly sees a good man being treated horribly by a noble and wants to free him like he saved her from a bad noble as well.Tiffa is a shy sheltered elf girl that happens to cast phoenix down on saito. She didn't go for saito at first and the relationship between them was purely an innocent one. well more on her side than his but still. It wasn't till saito kept making an impression on her and helping her meet new people that feelings started to develop.  For a girl who didn't have her own familiar yet, she was envious that louise got such a great familiar only for her to treat him badly in her eyes. All she ever saw was louise casting explosion/kicking saito in the nuts. It's no wonder she wanted to go for saito too.Finally there is Tabathia/Charlotte who joined the harem wagon during the events in season 3 because of saito not only forgiving her, but also going to personally save her from her uncle. It may seem to make no sense for her to fall for saito but for me, it's all too clear and it leads to the final problem I have with louise. Tabathia knows she can be a far more capable partner for saito than louise ever was. Throughout the entire series, Saito pretty much did all of the work while louise constantly kept getting them into danger, Like running off into deep dark woods by herself, going to places where she is clearly the target, trying to beat people with her shit skills only for her to get captured making saito's job as a familiar way harder. During the time saito was training his knights, know what louise was doing? being pissed she doesn't get to spend time with saito instead of, you know, train to develop her new void mage powers. like 90% of plot could have been solved if she would have just trained.  Know why when Tabathia saves them, she actually does it? it's because she read some books and practicing her magic like lousie should have been doing. So in Tabathia's mind, louise doesn't deserve a familiar like saito and because she works hard, believes she can protect saito better because she has been doing it since season 1.That is why I give this anime a 6 because if louise would have just tried to be a better mage, tried to be less abusive, tried to realize that even though some fault lies with saito for not resisting these women harder, that he shouldn't be treated like that due to the women in question making moves on him, I would have enjoyed the series more. At least their relationship does mature a little in the 4th season but honestly, the story felt like, in the end, saito was going to get stolen and with very good reason.anyway I do say it's not a bad anime at the end of it all and one should give it a chance. problems like your typical harem protagonist.

Still left to wonder how this managed to get a budget enough to make 4 seasons of it.Season fours story stick to that of previous in the fact of when something happens it only stays for an episode, two if you're lucky. However the finale does hold out for almost an entire four episodes for the final climax of the season, a new record as far as this series is concerned. Doesn't stop the fact it seems like each episode could have been only 6 minutes long if you cut...out all the pointless scenes.Art, and the term is used loosely, has barely improved and in some areas it seemed to have gotten worse. Most notable on faces, half the time they lack any real emotion or they were so crudely done you cant see half of it. Then there's the little moments, such as hair waving when dancing, moves a hell of a lot more than it really should.Music went back to its season 2 type. Good proper pieces that didn't end in just a minute or two, it lasted though the duration of the scene or battle. It however doesn't stop that some sounds and light pieces are reused a few times too many and still the faint lurking sound of background static during slow silent scenes, should you have ears and headphone acute enough to notice it.Character brought in some new developments as there was one part it could have turned into a massive romantic drama scandal or taken a huge twist on the main characters love life. but it's quickly dismissed later on as if it never happened which is utterly mind boggling as to why something meant to be a serious thing is brushed off as a minor issue. And this doesn't happen just once, it happens a few times throughout this season, some worse than others but they're more or less treated the same way.Overall enjoyment when going into this season was low. Personal note, i just wanted it over and done with and ended up taking a two week hiatus from it. But upon returning to finish the final few episodes, it was pleasing to see that it actually picked up on its action, story and drama to the point where it actually got rather interesting. Apart form the fact of the realism when obtaining such high grade weapons, goes completely out the window and more dead things return from the grave than a zombie movie, it was a much improved ending other previous seasons as greatly acceptable considering the disappointment of its predecessors. out all the pointless scenes.Art, and the term is used loosely, has barely improved and in some areas it seemed to have gotten worse.

As the final season for this series , i gotta say that nothing change really . From the story plot , to the characters plot and mostly everything . It's like an episodic anime from season to season . That being said , it's still a good anime .Story:7After the event from last season , Saito now have to face Joseph , who is trying to have a war . After the most shortest battle ever with Joseph , war was stopped and peace is finally a dream come true ....Tifa , the elf girl who tried to summon her Familiar , summoned Saito instead . This is where the stories of the rune of God's Heart , Lifdrasir begins . The story plot have too many flaws that i don't understand why didn't they fix it . Laziness could be one of the answer here .Art:7Basically the same as before . Nothing has been upgraded or anything . Got some nice 3D animation which is nice .Sound:8Same voice actor and actress . They got some nice OST that have a thrill effect . Same goes with OP and ED . I like the OP better .Character:7Nothing change like before . They introduce us with some new characters like Luctiana , another elf girl who have some connection with Tifa somehow , Vittorio Serevare , another void mage who is known as the holiness or Pope and more . They also got some more ''Melons'' boobs than ''Lemons'' one which is obvious . That's all really . Nothing change at all .Enjoyment:8From what i have seen , i didn't enjoy it much for a few episodes of it . After some more episodes , i enjoy it just fine . The comedy is as funny as before . The romance are kind of uninteresting here . Why ? From my point of view , what they tried to do is like this . Make the lovers , Louise and Saito of course , fight in some way like making Louise find out that the Queen herself , Henrietta , kiss Saito and making Louise cry . After that , they make up . Not long after that , they fight again . The cycle continues . That is not what romance or love story is all about . I think Romance are only serve as a side dish here . Good thing the ending was a happy one . The harem is as always , Harem-licious . The fight scenes are okay i guess .Overall:7As a fan of Zero no Tsukaima series , i can say that this is a must watch but don't put too much hope for this one . It's one of those anime where you're either like it or hate it . I like it but i wish they could have been better . Can't do anything about it now because the series has ended .

But if for some reason your reading this and haven\'t i will say it is a must watch.Most people will think giving this a 10 is really overrating the anime. But the reason it felt necessary was how this last season made it all worth it. when you watched (or watch) the first...season you think ""ok that was pretty good, ill give the rest of the series a try"". Then season 2 comes around and you think ""well once again pretty good, but feels a little repetitive"". now season three rolls around and you like ""alright how many times are you gonna do the same thing, this is still entertaining but getting ridiculous"". But at this point dont make the same mistake i did and put off the last season. I cant really place my finger on what exactly it was, maybe putting all the time into this anime  and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. But of all the anime ive watch (which at this point is about 100) this is the most satisfying last six episodes i have ever seen. it makes you look back at the last three seasons and think ""ok, that was definitely worth it, and really not that bad in the first place"".  Most people who dont like this show cant see past the fan service or repetitive jokes, but if you can i promise it will be worth it. season you think ""ok that was pretty good, ill give the rest of the series a try"".

I just thought it was better to do this review on the page of last season , here ][ I also want to apologize for my bad English but I am French and this is my first review]First, I do not seem to realize that I watched four whole seasons ! I found it a lot, so you have to have time to spend . The positive point is that the characters and their feelings change over time, new characters arrive , the plot extends again,...and again ...It is very difficult to give an opinion on the entire 4 seasons of this anime, because I totally do not remember any of the episodes. If I had to give an overall opinion, I enjoyed this series, even if the theme and the characters were a little too "" medieval "" for my taste.[ SPOILERS ]I must confess that the first season, I really did not like the character of Louise ( I saw it as a kid a little capricious, still typing on his familiar ) . But the seasons , she became one of my favorite characters . Many times, she wanted to be nice to Saito, but she always found to fricoter with other girls (but sometimes there was a bit forced ) . I admired the attitude towards the Princess Louise Henrietta , she was extremely modest and very committed to his country. Like what, finally , she is a good person, who knows how to respect . After each of his personality .For me, Saito \'s still obsessed . Always watching chest girls, without even listening to what they have to say sometimes! I understand he is a normal boy from Japan , not having had an education aristocrat , but still. I did not understand either why all the main girls fall completely in love with him ... ( Tabitha fell in my opinion ) I guess it is because it is Gandalf and he saved the country and beat all the bad guys. The good thing about this character is that it has a determination and an outstanding courage, who rarely lose .For other characters, I have almost every popular , I think ( at the tall blonde sister Louise , it irritates me one! Always make moral lessons ... )After that, the love between the two main characters is real, despite the stories and deceptions. I found even more cute sometimes. The scenes in which they declared their love and everything, it was very romantic (even if it just after shouting at each ) . I must admit that, despite everything , I really loved the episode 12 of season 2 ... I found it sad ... and super exciting to the end! (even if it goes unfortunately twist) . This episod remain my favorite.For the end of this anime ( episode 12 , season 4), it was not really to my taste ... coincidentally, this is the day of solar eclipse. And then a plane with missiles, it does not fly like that is a snap! I found it a bit surreal .[ SPOILERS ]To conclude , I think Zero no Tsukaima (globally) is a kind of fairy tale version of manga, a little futuristic, with lots of fan service. In fact it is a bit like the story of a prince who must protect a princess (unless it is a familiar and often beaten up because he is cheating ) . Frankly, I do not regret watching this anime . The 4 seasons of Zero no Tsukaima , I give 7.5 (This note does not appear on this site, it\'s a personal note). Yes , this is exactly the note should . In this season , I give 8 ( this is the note that appears at the top because I \'m still on page Zero no Tsukaima F).I have great hesitation to write this review . I just wanted to express my opinion because I \'ve seen a lot of people did. In the end , I just think a long comment. Sorry if you find me boring or dull , but I do not like magazines too serious .

S1 and S2 are both good. S3 was terrible (it honestly felt like a waste of time and without purpose). S4 goes back to being as good as S1 and S2.S4 (F) Wraps up our plot. Ends our journey and overall will leave you...likely satisfied and if you've watched the previous seasons the ending is fairly guessable, but good.Why does this anime get a 9 overall from me?It was a fun anime to watch. I loved the plot in S1 and despite a bunch of overused humor throughout the series it was a decent watch.Characters were the best in S1 and S2, S3 and S4 leaves only small changes and is more about the plot and humor.Sound. Average. Nothing really to remember, but not terrible.Art. A fun and light style that works well and looks good.Story. Ok lets face it. The story in S4 is complete crap. I gave it a mediocre to be nice. Its not really the reason we watch this anime though.Overall Zero is a unique journey that many viewers will enjoy. likely satisfied and if you've watched the previous seasons the ending is fairly guessable, but good.Why does this anime get a 9 overall from me?It was a fun anime to watch.

Im one of those audiences that can really get into an anime, and the fourth season did a very good job in hauling me back in, after the second season let down and the third season sort of comeback, i had my disbelief\'s but I am more than glad I stuck with it!For those who are questioning if you should stick and watch the final season I am telling, no, I am begging you to continue and enjoy it. Yes, the previous seasons had their ups and downs but after recently...finishing the last season, let me say i can\'t find anything I did not truly enjoy about it. No stupid moments, no let downs, happy endings, the whole works, they delivered and I am so happy!I am going to be biased a little, as I am a big fan of harems and rom coms\', I don\'t know why but they just click with me, I am just saying that as I might get more than a little carried away here. I was definitely not expecting all of the various relationships through the series. With most harems, yes all of the characters have one or so episode about background story and how they fall in love with the main character, but I love how through all four seasons of The Familiar of Zero, everyone develops continuously, they aren\'t shoved to the side. Yes this does not have anything about the final season, so why talk about it?  I want to comment about how all the characters, and how they all end up happy with only one of the characters being paired up with the main character. In most harems, I find that all of the girls who are ""not chosen"" are left on the spot, with only an episode about how they are let down and not really touched on anymore. The final season did more than a wonderful job at concluding the romances through the various characters, and they are not left on the spot all alone just being a ""third wheel"" to the couple. Its hard to explain without getting into detail so I suggest watching and learn what the heck I am talking about!The final thing I want to comment on is the second final episode, I am not going to spoil it but something happens. It angers me very much the writers made it out to be the way it was, however, I also praise them on the wonderful work they did at how they did it and how they finished it with the final episode, I am very happy they made me jump my seat screaming at the computer, and I hope that future anime\'s that I watch draw me in, in such a peculiar manner that the Familiar of Zero F did.Overall well done, you have my thanks for another great anime! finishing the last season, let me say i can\'t find anything I did not truly enjoy about it.

What I mean by that is, if it dropped all the nonsense (fan service and repetition for instance) and focused on the story and such, it could have been amazing. It has some moments of clarity where it focuses on the story and the characters and when it does that, it is brilliant. (But it usually lasts just for...a few minutes and that's a shame.)Story:Long story short, the story is basically about a boy who finds himself in another world, in this place no one speaks his language and he has no idea what's going on or how the got there. An accident gives him the ability to understand this strange language and he learns he has been summoned as a familiar to a mage and since most familiars are animals of some kind and a human familiar is (almost) unheard of, he is being threaded like an animal. By another accident he finds out being a familiar gives him special abilities. Basically an ability to use all weapons. So far so good right? Wrong, creators of the anime doesn't know a thing about storytelling. So usually the show is riddled by moments what a 10 year old would consider kinky and funny. This usually happens on every episode, several times. On top of that, this usually ruins whats supposed to be emotional moments. An act of heroism, an act of sacrifice, and boom, same nonsense about being funny and kinky. This is one of the rare shows that would benefit from a fan recut. Take out all the nonsense, rearrange some scenes and focus on the story a bit more. But I digress. As far as I understand, if the anime fallowed the original material properly, most of these issues would be resolved, but alas it didn't go that way.Art:Art is usually good overall. Colors can get a bit too bright or too dull at times, but thats to be expected. Not much bad, nothing groundbreaking, just fine.Sound:I wasn't able to find anything wrong with the sound other than some characters sounding annoying, so moving on.Character:How do I put this... Characters are fine but incredibly inconsistent. They seem to forget all about their past, their motivation and their abilities all the time. Also, there are many moments where character development gets abandoned simply to put forward the harem side of the anime. Which is especially stupid since the protagonist  has already picked the main girl. Also, there is an issue with characters appearing once and being forgotten by the next episode. From what I gather, this is mostly do to anime not truly fallowing the original material where most of these issues not present.Enjoyment:You can actually enjoy this anime if you skip some of the terrible and annoying repetitive stuff. I tried watching it that way for the second time around and it really improved my enjoyment of it.Overall:This anime has great potential but fails to deliver because after a while it becomes incredibly repetitive. But if you have time to waste, it is a good enough anime to watch. a few minutes and that's a shame.)Story:Long story short, the story is basically about a boy who finds himself in another world, in this place no one speaks his language and he has no idea what's going on or how the got there.

I really didn't have too many expectations for it.My love for this series has grown since watching the first episode. Since then, I've finished the rest of the seasons and anxiously awaited each episode of the Final season as it came out. In my honest opinion, this was the best season out of all of them, mainly because it just met and exceeded every single one of my expectations.Story: 9/10Zero no Tsukaima F starts off where Princess no Rondo left off, but with a few new twists thrown in. First off was how...Saito managed to become the familiar of both Tiffa and Louise, due to an accident. This newfound power come in handy, as discovered when Louise uses her newest void power. However, it comes at a heavy price. Near the end of the series, Louise does something that, I'm sure, made just about everyone scream out in frustration. She sends Saito back to his world.Overall, I thought the storyline was pretty good, but there was definitively places where it seemed rather rushed, especially in the last episode. (I really can't see Siesta, Tiffa, Tabitha, and Henrietta getting over Saito choosing Louise THAT easily.)Art: 9/10If you've seen any other season of Zero no Tsukaima (Which I will assume you have), the art is the same. Nothing new, nothing old.Sound: 10/10The music in Zero no Tsukaima F is perfect in every way. The music itself, as well as the places where it's played, adds to the effect of the scenes very well. There is nothing at all to complain about here.Character: 9/10Being the last season, I really didn't think there would be any form of character development. I didn't know how wrong I would be. Louise decides, against her own feelings, and sends Saito back to his world. Saito, upon his return, actually (finally) conveys his true feelings for Louise, and asks for her hand in marriage (Cmon... we ALL saw that coming! :D). The only real complaint I have is in the end. I can see how the other girls after Saito would accept his choice, but not as easily as they did... (I'm not really complaining though, since Saito has to be with Louise. No exceptions.)Enjoyment: 10/10However sad I might be that this is the last season, I enjoyed Zero no Tsukaima F greatly. The mixture of fast-paced action, along with the new plot twists thrown in made the story extremely enjoyable. But, the part I loved the most was, you guessed it, the very end. Louise uses her void powers to bring them back to Tokyo! A happy ending for an amazing series.Even though I anticipated what would happen at the last episode, I still can't help but just go D'AWWWWWW in the final 5-6 minutes. I loved it, it was amazing, and there's nothing else I can say but this. GO WATCH IT! Saito managed to become the familiar of both Tiffa and Louise, due to an accident.

(not like in Futatsuki no Kishi)So everything has Ended.There's No chance for any more series,  meaby OVA about Saito and Louise days in Saito's World or Visit Saito's Parrents, but its only my speculations. Thats All "", ""This review is of the entire series of Zero no Tsukaima, so i will be taking into account the series as a whole.Zero No Tsukaima F is the final season in the series, and to start off, the story was fairly intriguing, though the male kead getting sent to another world isn't anything new, throughout the series you can see the main characters see their flaws, which in other anime of this type, they pretty much don't have.overall it was enjoyable, though roughly half of the first season felt like a slog, after that, it was all smooth sailing. because this is the...fourth season of the series there is a lot of development between all of the characters, and their environment, thought sometimes there can be a little bit of deus ex machina, the plot is interesting if you enjoy seeing the characters grow together, though one thing that this series gets wrong is they use Louise's tsundere tendencies as comic relief a little too often, though in some cases it's completely warrantedThis show is best experienced blind rather than knowing anything about the characters, world, or plot, as, if you gp into it while knowing too much of those things, it will feel a lot more boring than it is, simply because they beat around the bush a lot when it comes to the characters finding anything out. If you enjoy this kind of thing, and don't mind marathoning a show, it will be enjoyable. fourth season of the series there is a lot of development between all of the characters, and their environment, thought sometimes there can be a little bit of deus ex machina, the plot is interesting if you enjoy seeing the characters grow together, though one thing that this series gets wrong is they use Louise's tsundere tendencies as comic relief a little too often, though in some cases it's completely warrantedThis show is best experienced blind rather than knowing anything about the characters, world, or plot, as, if you gp into it while knowing too much of those things, it will feel a lot more boring than it is, simply because they beat around the bush a lot when it comes to the characters finding anything out.

This anime was an exception, I saw someone on a forum say that this was a really good romance/comedy anime (I\'m a big fan of this genre) so I was bored one day and decided to watch the first few episodes.Within the first 2 or 3 I was hooked on the...show, it has a really good sense of humour, the art style is really pleasant, each of the characters are really unique and interesting. In the first season there isn\'t a massive focus on the romance between the characters but there are a lot of nice, sweet scenes that give you enough to look forward to how it will go in the next few seasons. The first season\'s story is relatively the same, its not over the top with action and instead acts as nice introduction to all of the characters.The story picks up a lot in the following seasons, there is a lot of character development and universe expansion, you start to see a lot of the countries you only heard mentioned in previous seasons and it carries a lot of story over from the previous seasons.Seasons 1-3 were excellent yet somehow season 4 managed to be even better, you see some major character development from both Louise and Saito, their relationship advances leaps and bounds and even the story somehow gets better than it already was. I don\'t say this lightly, but the ending of season 4 is the closest thing to perfection I have ever seen in an anime so far.""The Familiar Of Zero"" is a truly excellent show that I would recommend to anyone.Overall I give the entire series a 9/10 show, it has a really good sense of humour, the art style is really pleasant, each of the characters are really unique and interesting.

I watched all of Zero no Tsukaima during the second half of 2017. It was the only thing I looked forward to watching after getting home from work. I re-watched it again not too long ago and was surprised by how much I still enjoyed it. I did think some of the jokes were cheesy but still enough to muster up...smirk.If you enjoyed the series so far, just keep watching. Also the ending was, in my opinion phenomenal. The music that they played too fit what was happening so perfectly. Hands down one of my favorite endings in anime for sure. smirk.If you enjoyed the series so far, just keep watching.

Zero no Tsukaima F feels just better than any other previous season, however not in every aspect.The plot makes much less sense than before. Fights seem to be forced, as creators didn\'t really have much idea, what can be done in this season. There are fewer fights overall and fight scenes are kind of more in the background than before. The story with the elves and dragon are absolutely from nowhere, making the whole story even more nonsense. A number of...miracles and lucky coincidences during the story have gone up to the ceiling, even for an anime. Don\'t get me wrong, I like how often anime story is ""too perfect"" or ""too good to be true"", but here it is done to the unhealthy level. As I\'m usually saying, I\'m watching anime to have a good time, not to point out every mistake in the story, so I didn\'t attach much importance to this fact.The whole story has its happy, cute ending, however, it feels a little bit rushed, while the middle episodes of the season are just fillers and give nothing to the plot. I feel like the last episode could be split in two, which would be much better for the overall story. The story is also way too much predictable (still!), but I think I am used to it now.The characters development in the last season is great. Louise is finally a ""healthy"" tsundere (if that\'s even a thing) and isn\'t anymore annoying, as in the previous seasons. They, with Saito, finally realize and show their feelings (as they should), which makes the whole thing much more cute and enjoyable.Art and sound quality are high. We see some changes in the art compared to the 3 previous seasons, but they are really minor, sometimes hard to notice (I still like the old art a little bit more than the new one). The sound was great throughout the whole series and there\'s no exception in Zero no Tsukaima F. It builds up the tension correctly, it makes the whole anime much more attractive. Nothing to add here.Overall enjoyment is high (surprisingly after 3rd season). In some ways I liked the fourth season the most from the series, but also I have this kind of melancholic feeling for the first one. Both have some flaws, both are good in many ways. If you are not a fan of the series, you wouldn\'t probably find this season interesting too. I liked Zero no Tsukaima from the very first episode and I don\'t regret any minute spent watching this series.Another fine anime to my ""rewatch"" list. miracles and lucky coincidences during the story have gone up to the ceiling, even for an anime.

Firstly as you'll understand what's going on and second, as this show gets progressively worse with every season.I can only rate it as mediocre at best and somewhat dissapointing.  It may have been a while since I watched the previous seasons but I'm sure this season relied more heavily on fan-service.  Which isn't always a bad thing, especially if you enjoy boob comedy (or lack of) and tsunderes, but if it's in lieu of a decent story...then it can get a bit weak over 12 episodes.  They probably shouldn't have bothered.So yeah, watch it if you like Louise, Tifa or Siesta, or their seiyuus but other than that, it's a bit poor and really, as a swan-song, it could/should have been better.I've given it 6/10; was probably being kind. then it can get a bit weak over 12 episodes.

The relationship that was built between Louise and Saito, the troubleshot Louise has in showing her love for Saito. Saito\'s love for her and his friends which Louise takes both the right and wrong ways.Continuing on to the final episode, The Dragon is on its way to the Magic Academy to eat the two Void Mages (Tiffa and Louise). Saito;...however, is trapped in the Human realm because Louise sent him back in order to save him! ""Sacrifices For Love"" which is a recurring theme throughout the whole series. Saito is down in the dumps and wants to go back and save Louise and his new ""home"". Luckily for Saito, there\'s a LUNAR ECLIPSE! Who would\'ve guessed! Using the logic from the past series, if there\'s a Solar Eclipse he go back to the human world from the Magic world, if there\'s a Lunar eclipse he can go back to the magic world from the human world.They never showed how Saito got that Fighter Jet besides him getting dropped off at the air base, so we can assume he got passed all the security peoples. So he flies towards the Lunar eclipse and VOILA he\'s back in the magic world, hooray! Louise is almost about to die, blah, blah, blah, Saito saves her, they kill the dragon, they get married, the end... Close cut ending nothing else happens.  BUT WAIT! Louise takes them back to the human world and they explore and have fun, finally they go to where Saito used to live, Saito rings the gate bell, the end.I think it ended abruptly, I wish they really showed the interaction between Saito, his wife (Louise), and his family. Hopefully they\'ll make a OVA showing this. I didn\'t really like the ending but one can hope that Saito gets lucky with all the girls, if you catch my drift ;) Forever Otaku... however, is trapped in the Human realm because Louise sent him back in order to save him!

I did not watch the first 3 seasons but i totally got the plot and all the characters. It was the first series i really felt like i could watch coming in at the end and still understand everything thats going on in the whole 4 seasons of this show. I really enjoyed watching this show. If you haven't seen it i would defiantly check this anime series out! The reason why i gave the story a 9 was only because...it didn't have originality through the whole show. There was of course love triangles and the damsel in distress moments most of the time. But i do believe they handled those moments pretty well. The art i thought could have been a little better but for the most part it was pretty well done. I gave everything else a 10 cause i really thought everything was put together very nicely. The plot had romance, drama, action, adventure, and comedy all in one. I will defiantly miss this show now that it has ended.

The start of the season the mc cheats on Louise like 19 times and has no remorse, which sucks. However, the last few episodes of this season are by far the best in the series by a whole lot. The ending is really good, by far the best part of the entire series, but it was weird that *spoiler* they killed off his sword, had it come back, and then...killed it again. I guess it just lives in his hand but that's a bit odd. Idk, this anime in general kinda sucked, but I liked it. The harem elements definitely made it worse, and they made me want to drop the show, but other than that it was actually pretty good and entertaining. It's just really hard to like the mc's when one is a serial cheater and the other is a sadist. killed it again. I guess it just lives in his hand but that's a bit odd.

My rating was a 9/10, but had to lower it to just 7/10 after recently binge-watching the entire series. DO NOT LET THIS REVIEW DISCOURAGE YOU FROM WATCHING THE OTHER 3 SEASONS! In fact, ""Familiar of Zero: F"" is actually pretty good until the 4th episode, so I would suggest to any first-time viewer: just watch until the...3rd episode! My favorite thing about the entire ""Familiar of Zero"" story is how well the side-characters (Kirche, Jean Colbert, Tabitha) are written and how every character goes through some growth, and any fan of good storytelling will appreciate the soft magic system and the worldbuilding in this show.My ONLY complaint is how the show couldn\'t quite stick the landing with a good ending. Part of this might have been that the author of the light novel, Nobura Yamagutchi, was struggling with cancer and eventually passing away in 2013. (The manga ran from 2004 to 2011.) I thoroughly enjoyed the show and absolutely devoured the episodes leading up to this final season, despite some of the flaws with the two main characters (Louise and Saito) in the story, but after the 3rd episode it felt like the story itself was meandering and couldn\'t find a good place to end. But maybe that\'s a metaphor for life sometimes... 3rd episode!

However having to watch the same fickle relationship with the same tsundere girl for the 4th season in a row started to get on my nerves.I get it that it\'s the core of the show, but come on. There\'s a limit as to how unbelievable you can make it and still get away with it. 4 seasons of romance, and Louise is still embarrassed over a kiss...despite almost marrying Saito a few seasons prior while sleeping with him every night? Still not sure Saito actually loves him despite being told so a hundred times, saved by him a hundred times, having been chosen over other girls a hundred times? Come on. That goes beyond comedic effect, that\'s just annoying at this point.I feel like they should have switched that tsundere bullshit off in S3 and focused on actually maturing their relationship instead of that excessive childish bullshit.Honestly, the last 2 seasons felt like they were all about keeping the tsundere effect for comedic purposes and to give more excuses to widen Saito\'s harem.

The story is well done, the relationship between Louise and Saito breaks its partially repetitive pattern and finally advances, and with some major tragedy in between comes to a truly beautiful happy end.The ending is so well-rounded that I'd say that is the optimal ending the series could've had, no need for more seasons whatsoever.**SPOILERS AHEAD**If you want...to be spoiled what happens in their relationship (very shortly); Saito gets another power which allows him to increase void magic (e.g. of Louise) at the cost of his own life energy. Louise confesses her love to him right before they part ways (she tricked him so he wouldn't risk his own life), but Saito manages to get back and after winning, proposes to Louise. They get married, and Saito shows her his world. to be spoiled what happens in their relationship (very shortly); Saito gets another power which allows him to increase void magic (e.g. of Louise) at the cost of his own life energy.

I found my self getting annoyed by some of the decisions the characters would make, the story has some very cheesy parts and was very predicable in some cases which annoyed me even more.

Now let me explain my ratingsStory(3/10)Just like all other Harem Animes the plot barely moves every season let alone watching how it slugs through its plot...every episode.

This review WILL contain spoilers for Season 4.Let me start off by saying I love/really like The Familiar of Zero series, if i didn't i wouldn't have watched the entire 48 episodes worth of it + the OVA and the other stuff in this series such as the 7 short episodes of the Tristain Love Theater. Side note, that's prolly canon, when and where and why it takes place no one can say, my review on it wasn't sure if it's...canon and pointed out something but given what S4 did, i feel its prolly canon. Anyway, with that outta the way let's start the review...The Familiar of Zero F (F for final because it's the final entry in the series) for me was a let down, and its ending was incredibly rushed. I've heard the manga for the series is much better and the anime changed up a lot, especially with people's character growth/personality, namely Saito, I'm unsure how true that is as I only saw it in a review and i ahve no intention of reading the manga (I'm not into reading books so its rare when i do) The The Familiar of Zero series itself has some contradictions and plot holes in its story and also after S1 changes how characters' personalities are. Whats more it pretends certain events never happen just to keep the characters mostly the same so yes, sadly there is little character growth for everyone which is a HUGH disappointment. For example, at the end of S2 Saito saves everyone by sacrificing himself. When he's brought back to life (Which the anime doesn't give much of an explanation involving how that ring did that and plot hole Giche cus he was revived too by that same person but that was never mentioned again), he returns to Louise, whom at the end of that anime has more or less admitted she loves him and can say such. In comes S3 and we're back to Louise: SAITO! YOU PERVERTED HORNY DOG! *EXPLOSION* Saito: AHHHHH! And this continues even through season 4... LOOK! I don't care WHO made this, or was responsible for crap like this. He gave his freakin LIFE for them, Louise KNEW this, was told HARD it was HER FAULT and SHE got him killed and NO ONE who actually LOVES SOMEONE that much would sit there and revert back to as if he didn't give his life and yes S3 confirms he did.At that point character growth SHOULD have happened but NOPE! In comes plot points that are mostly or entirely just there to add to Saito's growing harem. In S3 Saito legit cheats on louise and i called him cheating scum. S4? He redeems himself somewhat, I won't call him scum but i will call him a cheater and an idiot. (It happens twice) Further more if that wasn't bad enough, the villains behind everything are just, treated as if they are a side plot. That was SERIOUSLY disappointing and they went out with such a whimper it was sad and yes they did die, I kept expecting em 9and another character that died this season) to return but nope, they're dead... not to mention the motive and reason behind why the king did all these terrible things was so bad and sad and just, cheap. He has no reason besides he wants to feel sadness and emotion. His title clearly proceeds him, what an idiot king.As if THAT shit wasn't bad enough, let's tack on a world ending event plot that's shoe horned in in S4 and make it very cheap, pathetic and sad. Not to mention the final showdown was just, rushed. (I mean last we saw the elves' race was trying to KILL Saito and co, why are they now helping them? This is never sad and i DOUBT that world ending event would actually end the world once it gets what it wants...) This was just poorly done, as was the explanation for WHY Elves hate humans and why humans are scared of elves. Its never really explained properly and when it is somewhat explained, its only for the elves' side, not the human side (Theres a conspiracy/contradiction here)Let's also not forget the promise Saito made tot he water spirit to return her ring is never kept. Yeah, I seriously was on the look out for that as I had a feeling it wouldn't happen when it got stolen. In S4 its never shown that i noticed, certainly not used or mentioned. So maybe he returned it to her off screen but nothing shows this or confirms this. Maybe it was done in the manga? Either way, it didn't happen in the anime. Further more, last we saw of Louise' parents her father was trying to kill Saito, why is he now ok with them marrying each other? This and the wedding/honeymoon was SO RUSHED it hurt that it wasn't done properly, we need 2-3 more eps, maybe 4-5 for getting the ring back to the spirit... Side note really quick, I guess the wedding Saito & Louise has in S2 wasn't legit, since they mention getting married here in S4. Gotta love dem plot holes and retcons even though it was never actually retcon'd :PThe characters that DO GROW significantly are done mostly off screen. E.g. Why was Zerbert no longer attracted to Saito and why is she now all over and only about Colbert Sensei? How and why did whats his name (The familiar to his holiness) have interest in others and became friends with Saito (To him, to Saito to an extent he still didn't like the guy early on here) and ofc his holiness himself, WHY the frick did he sit there and not help Saito and Tiffa when they were abducted? That's never explained. So many plot holes and shit not explained or properly shown.I could prolly go on and on about this series many faults, but I won't. I won't explain what i did like about S4 either, but I did still enjoy it, however its faults seriously weigh it down and made it less enjoyable as a result. I rate, The Familiar of Zero F, a 6.0 and give it a Love score of 6.5, both out of a 10.0. I'm glad Saito and Louise finally got some actual character development in S4, even if it should've happened long ago. Ultimately I enjoy the characters and to an extent the world itself, but aside from that i can't tell you why i like this series, it certainly isn't for everyone and is certainly frustrating at times, but for some reason still enjoyable.Bonus: My most fav moment in this series was seeing Louise in a catgirl outfit and saying she'd be Saito's familiar for the night while saying meow at the end. That pose, reaction and words were just so CUUUUTE! canon and pointed out something but given what S4 did, i feel its prolly canon.

The characters their selves have weird motivations and don't feel real. The world is bland and largely unexplored or fleshed out. There is kind of a main plot, but it doesn't really come into play until later on. Without blood, death, or even injury it has no real grit. Nothing is really gripping for me and falls short.Art: 5/10Like the story, pretty bland. Noticed that the character's eyebrows can be seen through their hair, which seems kind of lazy to me. Animation is subpar too, with it being limited by time period and budget. Nothing bad though and, at times, it can be pretty interesting.My entertainment: 6/10While it was a bit painful to sit through again, it was just good enough to keep me entertained. This was one of the anime I watched when I was much younger, so there was a good amount of nostalgia for me. Plus fanservice. Always good to see.Fanservice: 6/10Shouldn't give this a high score here.

The story was never really anything special, generic bad guy number 35 has an evil scheme to unleash Chaos or the Darkness or whatever (I think it actually was one of those) and...the heroes beat him by believing in themselves and the power of friendship. All standard forgettable stuff.What I'm here for is Siesta continuing to be the best girl, and the occasional sex mirror tunnel. Minor spoilers I guess but my favorite moment of the whole season was when the queen gives the heroes a new house, being fully aware that said house has a secret sex dungeon room that connects directly to her bedroom via magic mirror. Apparently the last royal that built the thing had a lot of secret affairs, and this was how they got away with it. Protagonist-kun in that moment finally realizes the queen is speedrunning becoming worst-girl of the franchise and leaves her to go recommit himself to Siesta... sorry I mean Zero. I guess Zero is still the better option if it's the Queen we're talking about because she is just the absolute worst.I thought the ending was nice, him getting to go home but bring Zero with him seemed really fitting. It's also nice when a show actually has the decency to end and not just go on forever/10 or never get picked up for another season despite the story not being over.

It was a fun watch"", ""As this is the last season, I will use this as an opportunity to review the whole series as a whole (however, mainly touching upon this [4th] season). Minor spoilers included.My rating of the entire series has to be 7, since for what it's worth this is a good anime. The first season had us interested in what kind of world our protagonist was brought into and the kind of relationships he'd have with the rest of the characters. From then on, however, for me it was all downhill. This anime (keep in mind that I'm mainly refering to the second and third seasons here)...was an ecchi wannabe harem isekai. For me it was quite annoying that the MC kept on cheating on lemon-chan and ACTUALLY GETTING AWAY WITH IT.In any case, in the last season the male MC finally was hit in the head or something, however it got better. Even though he still did some of his previous wrong-doings, it was noticeably less. In this season the romance aspect between our two MCs finally bloomed. Hinderance was still there, and I was hoping every next episode won't just turn the 4th season to it's predecesors, but it (mostly) didn't. Here we finally see the female MC open up her cute side. The end of the anime definitely pushed me to rate this season a 9. Truly a wonderful way to end it, in my opinion. was an ecchi wannabe harem isekai.

Truly a wonderful way to end it, in my opinion."", 'Zero no Tsukaima F.The Familiar of Zero F.I actually had realistic hopes for the final season. Especially since the first 2 episodes were reasonably solid despite the fan service. But this season managed to teach me otherwise.My conclusion is now as follows. It\'s a perfect example of descending quality that was pretty weak in the beginning anyway. Season 1 was clearly the best here and it has lost more and more. I can\'t decide whether season 3 or 4 can now symbolize the worst of the series....The course of this season was a little different. Compared to the others, this season has had a solid first 2 episodes, whereas it got worse and worse until the end. The closing episodes of this season were therefore also the worst. Whereby it was exactly the other way around with the other seasons.Besides that, I think it\'s impressive that this season has managed to make the others seem completely irrelevant. By 1. The antagonist ""King Joseph"" received a completely irrelevant conclusion and almost looked like a side character. And 2. the implementation of the prophecy regarding the ""magician of the void"" has been an abysmal joke. I wont go into Detail here, but it was just waste of ressources.Spoiler !-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Story episodes - fan service - even more fan service> a minor event -> you suddenly see Tiffa\'s nipples ( the anime suddenly need it? -> final boss spawns completely without context and meaningless -> finale begins -> a plot Armor after the other> end.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--To be honest, I found it impressive and sad at the same time how massive the last episode was and the main thing was that something was brought to the table. They didn\'t even bother to explain anything and practically had the characters say ""I don\'t know how and why, but the main thing is that it worked"" - very aptly, honestly, that\'s how I felt for 4 seasons.-This is just some amazing level. Only few Anime can be this pointless after all.StoryYou will certainly remember King Joseph, who was involved in all events between seasons 1-3. And also of the prophecy of the magicians of the void. Well nothing was made of it. Not only that Joseph had a completely irrelevant finale, which made all his previous actions appear like filler episodes. No, the prophecy was a bad joke too. Likewise the final fight and the conclusion. To be honest, I can hardly say anything about this, I lack words to describe it.I don\'t know if the novel / manga had a different flow and was changed by the studio, but I really hope so.Animation / imagesNo significant or positive changes, remained the same level as with the predecessors. Apart from the fact that the first episode had a slightly improved animation style. With Tiffa\'s breasts, however, they have cut their budget unprecedented.CharactersIn the whole season there was one scene that actually made me proud. It was Louis\'s decision and mindset regarding Episode 11 and its plot. Completely understandable and I like the way she acted. It was by far her greatest highlight.Otherwise nothing has changed. The characters remained monotonous. There were still characters that I personally found likeable. Like Guiche, Kirche and ... even Tiffa, as long as she wasn\'t abused for her hardcore fan service again. Unfortunately, the character jokes remained enormously monotonous and offered no variety. The same thing was chewed on over and over again, just as in dialogues.At least 20x the same relationship problems between Saito and Louise with no real results. Saito makes out with other women, Louise gets angry, Saito gets angry (expresses amusing comedy scene irony) and follows the relationship crash.The new characters that you also see in the intro were completely irrelevant. By the end, they raised more questions than they could answer.MusicTo be honest, I find it a bit disappointing that the fairly solid Osts from Seasons 1 and 2 have so rarely been reused. One has often inserted into the alleged main scenes, quite monotonous East, which the scenes could hardly underline. Then I should have played the intro song more often as they did in episode 12, would have had at least influenced the atmosphere a little more positively. As a kind of puzzle / minigame theme that is inserted into character deaths.ConclusionYou can look at this title, but you shouldn\'t have any expectations. Let alone, if you didn\'t like the first season, you should generally keep your hands off it.Had this work landed in more capable hands, one could have created a very worth seeing anime from the setting and the plot.

This season alone was worth staying through the previous three. Every single thing has improved here.Now, to the categories:STORY:This season\'s story is the climax of the entire anime. This is what you came for. It took an entire 3rd season to set the stage for this. This is where the hypothetical narrator says ""Alright, enough joking. It\'s time for shit to get real"". Finally a different formula than the one used before.The story is aligned well and nothing is left behind, everything happens for a reason. No high-effort humor here, almost pure story and...a strong emphasis on character relationships (more on that later). The story also features great plot twists, and as the biggest guesser in the world when it comes to stories even I couldn\'t predict some of the twists happening.There are two things that lower my rating for the story:• Although it was very good, it didn\'t blow me away. I gave a couple of animes a 10/10 in story and it\'s just not the same.• Unfortunately, this season introduced something that barely existed in the other seasons - plot holes. One of them is in the season finale.Therefore, I wholeheartedly give this season\'s story the maximum rating for one that matches this criteria - 8.5/10.ART:The improvement from last season is noticed almost immediately. The location art got more creative, character design looks better, and the battle scenes feature the best animation in the anime.I\'m not too keen in this topic, though, and it didn\'t stand out from any other category, so I\'ll simply give it the same rating as the overall one - 8/10.SOUND:After four entire seasons, it happened: Some songs finally managed to stick. Great mixture of a couple of new tunes and the old ones that got too damn addictive.The voice acting is fantastic and in a way even better than before.The OP+ED are okay, but they made me kinda miss the ones from the first couple of seasons. Even though they\'re from the same artists they\'re not as fun if you ask me.The sound effects are awesome, had to mention that too.9/10.CHARACTER:If you complained about lack of character development in the previous seasons, then I have excellent news for you.Everyone are finally more rational and mature.Yes. Even Siesta. You\'ll be happy to see her this time if you missed her season 1 persona.The villains this season are a lot less dull than seasons 2 and 3, and there is now some spice as well. The ""final boss"" bored me though. It was rather everything that happened around it that made its existence good.It\'s impossible for me to elaborate any further without spoiling.8/10ENJOYMENT:It was very fun to watch!! I rarely watch OVAs and this is the first time I consider watching if there are any actual spin-offs that extend the storyline (and slightly humorous hopefully). I especially can\'t get goddamn enough of Saito and Louise.I could use a bit more humor this season but whatever!I binged the entirety of Zero no Tsukaima from start to finish in 7 days. This season alone in 24 hours. The only two anime I ever binged like this were Death Note and Vinland Saga and both got a 10 from me. Unlike them, though, I wasn\'t left speechless this time. Therefore I believe 9/10 is a fair rating.Final verdict - You CANNOT drop if you made it this far. You should absolutely watch this season.

This last season really satisfies me from watching this until the end and I don\'t regret watching it.This is my own opinion and perspective but LOUISE really deserves this ending...Why? It may differ from your perspective but out of all the characters, she is the one that is really the only one that is genuinely willing to do everything for Saito and it may contradict at some point in the story but she act...rather than talk only. It may be a controversial since she is a tsundere that always hit Saito but out of all girls, she just not always seduce Saito but act and prove it how much she cares for him(which always contradicts in what she says) because for me Love may not just be always sweet, sometimes having spice, bitterness, and problems makes it even better and that lacks with other character since most of them just used their b**bs to get near Saito. I just love and hate her character which makes me like her.Henrietta may love Saito in the eyes of other but there are some point in the story that she is not even willing to act or sacrifice for Saito just because she is the Queen.Next is the Maid girl, at first I kinda like her but god damn it, she always ruined the moment of the two and that is one of the reason I kinda hated girls with big b**bs that use it to ruin things(I don\'t mind if it is just for love but it always used for seduction, gaining advantage, and lust).The next is elf girl, Tittania. she is one of the most useful magic user in the story but she still has many things to learn to reach Louise level of power and love to Saito.Tabitha > Henrietta in terms of love for Saito. Willing to give up and sacrifice for someone you love because you know that he will be happier with someone else is much better than trying to get that man behind the back of your friend that is even willing to sacrifice her life for you before.So if I\'m gonna make a ranking for best girl in this series(not for Saito though) this will be my list.1. Louise2. Tabitha3. Kirche4. Tiffania5. Siesta6. Henriettabut for best boy, there will be only one and that is DERFLINGER.I know I\'m being biased here but I have a soft heart for tsunderes since they make the story more interesting since for me it\'s either become couple from the start and start their couple development, or become a tsundere and slowly develop their relationship.So with this, you may know who will I choose between Chitoge and Onodera.#FlatIsJustice rather than talk only.

What pretty much the guy that got the most highest vot said would be true. I would like to say that I am reading light novel so I kinda can't help but to compare.But anyway the anime was enjoyable, very very rush. I mean the episode1 to 3, who is suppose to be Joseph act was super rush. The light novel took 3 books to get to josep death, but the point is he got kill though not in the way but anyway that the anime and I know they had limited amount of...episodes. Anyway majority of the scenes didn't make much sense. I mean the best example would be site stealing the plane, I mean shit man, if this is the level of security in a air base, military must be really crap. .....Spoiler there for the novelMajority of the stuff doesn't actually happened like that from what I've read from the book, and it is the pop who showed sito world to only Harietta, Tiffania, and Louis. Also when Louis tried to send him home she didn't send him to his home but 6000 years In the past during the era of the founder. Also Julio becomes an enemie, the pop wants to take over the elfe lands. Louis forgets her memories of sito ( read novel for the reason), sito sward doesn't get broken by the dragon ( from what I seen , the dragon was not part of the story but again not all volumes are translate) sito news ward is a katana. Harieta is a real bitch after showing her true color to use sito as a tool of war. Sito do get married to louis in volume 18 but by then the anime would have had another season. Tabith does become queen but some shit happens and escap her kingdom and was replac with Joseph daughter (yes he have a daughter) and planning for world domination. A new void user appeared.Anyway read the novel a lot more shit happens. Only season 1 & 2 of the anime stay true to th storyAnyway, the anime compared to the light novel would be like a 2 or 3.   But by itself, I guess a 7 mayb lower but it still pretty much got to the point of the story so it's was pretty enjoyable.As a super recommendation, read the light novel. It takes time to come out but those guys at bakatsuki still do a great job. The story have a lot more interesting stuff going on thant what all zero no tsukaima anime series showed in all season.

This unique story of a good calibre tells a interesting tale at an amazing pace. The art to me is personally is as great as this type of anime could be, however that could be Bias. The characters are well-rounded and have many flaws and strengths, although any part that focuses on the more minor characters is slightly worse than the main story.The characters are very relatable and grew well in their development, which is quite a feat...in these highly unusual scenarios. The world ending cataclysm was quite intriguing as it has many parallels to real life history. The villainy had good powers but could have been more in-depth in his backstory and reasoning.I feel anyone with good taste will enjoy this anime and all it has to offer to the world at large, including non-anime watchers.

Each episode is introduced by Fujiwara no Teika himself in a modern setting and tells the background of each poem and a little about the poet's life, lacing it with humour and an intelligent script.It is worth remembering that the characters were real people and...most were renowned in their lifetime including Sei Shonagon who wrote the Pillow Book and Murasaki Shikibu who wrote the Tale of Genji.

The people were royalty or aristocrats from the Heian Period and had to live by a strict code where they were told who to marry or how to live so each episode is about doomed love and the poems often reflect this.Also the opening and ending songs a very good and the animation is nice though not spectacular, however, this is probably because most scenes are in the royal palace or in aristocrats homes.I will admit is not to everyone's taste but if you are looking for an anime which is a bit more intelligent than most it might be for you.

Uta Koi, for the most part, portrays animated adaptations of stories concerning the lives of famous traditional poets in feudal Japan having their own differing experiences with love that influence their writing. Each of the stories provides enough fleshing out of the characters to let you know of their upbringing and unique romantic dilemma, many of whom involve differences in age and/ or social standing, the latter of which being a huge deal in feudal times. It made for quite the interesting watch since it let me know a little more about Japan's literary history.The series...also mixes in some comedy with its romantic stories, mostly through Teika's easygoing narrations as he introduces the stories being portrayed in each episode of Uta Koi. The comedy mostly relies on anachronisms with Teika and the other poets making appearances at points throughout the series when relevant to the story being portrayed in said episode. I found this style of comedy to be hit or miss and an absolute waste for one episode when it was used as complete comical filler. Fortunately, it doesn't get too intrusive in the other 12 episodes that are telling their romantic stories.In terms of visuals, scenery and character designs are fairly standard in quality and being rather limited in its animation. Like Gankutsuou, Uta Koi implements stylized methods with its scenery and characters by implementing a design pattern onto the kimonos of characters, clouds and even rain drops. While still sticking out quite prominently in moments where characters are moving about, it isn't as annoyingly glaring as when Gankutsuou resorted to this approach.Uta Koi will certainly not be for everyone considering the title's strong focus on poetery, Japanese history and episodic storytelling. But if you have interest in these elements of storytelling and genres, then Uta Koi makes for an entertaining watch as you experience the love woes faced by famous Japanese feudal poets who lived centuries ago. also mixes in some comedy with its romantic stories, mostly through Teika's easygoing narrations as he introduces the stories being portrayed in each episode of Uta Koi.

Expet some scenes that are really well animated, and absolutely beautiful and memorable....Sound (8.5/10)The opening is really good and fits perfectly well to the show, you easily get the spirit. The ending is surprising but nice. And the ost is present but discreet I guess, at least I have nothing to say, it doest its job, makes a good atmosphere. The voices are perfect, with many famous voice actors as good as always. The poetic lines are nice to hear and fits persfectly with the rest of the show.Character(9/10)The characters are great, worked, and have a great psychology that you might not suspect they have at first, but beware they do. You get the josei vibe if I may say, the realtion between them (love or not) are great, and tho it may seems because of the episodic episodes that you wouldn't have time to have character developement, you actually do! And it's not forced at all, it's very fluide.Enjoyment (10/10)Watched in one day, I just couldn't stop, I kept wanting to see more of the romantic, sad, poetic atmosphere. The atmosphere is great. I wish there were more shows as good as this one.It has all I wanted : historic, interesting and good characters, beautiful art, a poetic vibe sometimes melancolic, some romance, some comedy too (I haven't talked much about it but the context story is pretty comedic and the good thing is that it doesn't even bother, it fits well to the rest). If you like those things I believe I you might love as much as I have.Overall 9.5/10A must for romantic fan. But the show is more than that as I said. Imo it is incredibly good in its category. I haven't given it a 10, not because it has some big flaws, just its episodic there isn't one big story so...its not a good reason actually. I guess its just that I don't see myself singing the opening or kya-ing about the show, but I think that's because its not really made to have this kind of fan actually. Its a show you appreciate alone, for its poetry, beauty, melancolic side.I say give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed, its so worth it!!

At the same time, it did make me want to read the original set of 100 poems, which are available here:I will say that the art is good, but not the best - it could have been a shade better. Also, the story had its moments when I wondered what the tone of the anime will be. Although it carried its...concepts well, it lacked discipline in some places. Which was sad, because the characters were not constructs in any form - in fact, in a subtle way, it portrayed what medieval Japan was like, especially to live in that time and its hierarchical society. Its enlightening, actually.While I won\'t say that its the best anime I\'ve seen, I feel it has its merits as a good anime which gives food for thought. And I would definitely recommend it to be seen at least once - especially for those who want to experience ""love"" in a mix of poetic, and metaphoric aspects. Its nice, its fun for its 13 episodes, and the morals that they share in this anime are such that we can relate with them, from metaphoric or conceptual grounds anyway. concepts well, it lacked discipline in some places.

He titled this group of poems the “Hyakunin Isshu.” 43% of these poems happened to be about love and came from nobles as well as lower classmen. Uta Koi focuses around the stories behind 12 of these romantic poems. Therefore, each episode is its own individual story that centers around the love between two characters.Characters – It feels strange to call the cast of this anime “characters” because they are all based on real people. There are so many different people you...are exposed to and it’s a pretty cool thing to see. You’re bound to find a character that you like and each person comes from different backgrounds. From Empresses to economical officials, there are tons of different people depicted in this anime.Art/Animation – Traditional Japanese garments are so intricate and that is what the majority of the characters in this anime wear. Most of the women look mature and beautiful, but many look too similar. This created confusion and led to some mix-ups. The men were a bit more distinguished and had more noticeable characteristics. However, sometimes I felt that the artwork was a bit like drawings from a coloring book. There were not too many details in some scenes and there was a strong black line outlining each of the characters as well. It was slightly unappealing and felt a little “cheap.” A low-budget was clearly evident for this series.The animation was very stiff and looked unnatural at times. What bugged me the most was that the designs on the characters outfits stayed in place and did not move along with their movements. Kind of hard to explain in text, but it is very noticeable once you watch the series. Also, the rain didn’t look like rain falling. Instead, the “raindrops” were just circles expanding and shrinking on the screen.Sound – There was barely any musical tracks played in this anime, which was very disappointing. For an anime that was lacking in its art and animation, it would have been nice to have some nice songs played on traditional Japanese instruments playing in the background instead of bland, quiet scenes. The ending song was also very unfitting for this anime and stuck out like a sore thumb. A hip-hop song as an outro to a historical anime? I don’t think so. Was not an appropriate fit at all.—————————————————————————————————————————————Pros – Its definitely cool to see how even thousands of years later, legacies still live on. Before we die, we always wonder if anyone will remember us and if our names would ever be mentioned after death. This anime shows that indeed they do. I also enjoyed the focus on the poems written by these individuals.It was also enjoyable to see each poem have such emphasis. They were also analyzed or put into “simple” terms, reminding me of the No Fear Shakespeare books that basically translated all of Shakespeare’s works. Definitely helped out in the understanding of these poems because some can be difficult at times. The symbolism used combined with my lack of poetry skills would have left me confused in this anime without those translations.Also, knowing the stories behind these written poems was possibly the greatest thing about this anime. Poetry is always fun when the audience knows the story behind it. Each story was romantic and depicted their era very well. Problems such as nobility and honor were real problems back then. They could forbid the relationships between two people and this anime shows that. It’s very realistic for the majority of the anime and made the characters feel more “human”.Cons – The humor in this anime was not funny, interesting, or relevant. Our narrator, Fujiwara no Teika was often floating in space, playing on the beach, cosplaying the Tokyo Tower, playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, or being a ballerina. It took the seriousness out of the show and was peculiar at times. Episode 6 was so awful, I don’t know where to begin. It wasn’t about a love story, instead it was about a race between all the characters we already have met. It was extremely random, made no sense, and was quite dull.Also,- Animation could have been stronger.- Not very memorable.Overall - Uta Koi was a sweet revival of such timeless poetic pieces. The stories of romance were all heart-warming and lovely. The major downfall was that they were not memorable. Even now I am having trouble remembering all of the stories. I definitely recommend marathon-ing the show because taking breaks between this anime will lead to you forgetting the stories of certain characters for sure. Many of the stories dealt with forbidden love just with different people. While they were still nice to watch, it was a bit repetitive. Also, if you aren’t into Japanese history, some viewers may feel a bit lost or bored watching this show. The stories are nice, but I just don’t think that they will appeal to everyone who happens to watch.Rating - 7/10 (for those who are interested in Japanese history, poetry, and romance)OR6/10 (for those who aren’t really intohistorical anime or poetry) are exposed to and it’s a pretty cool thing to see.

However, such events should not always be considered faithful to history, as many of them didn´t happen, or happened differently in reality. But it doesn´t really matter. The core of this anime isn´t the portrayal of actual events, but rather the spirit of poetry in the Heian Court, which is successfully rendered....Love poems were the way to court women, and poems came along with a lot of other things which are beautifully shown in the anime: care for calligraphy and presentation (poems were usually sent together with a flower or a branch, for example), the excitement with which the poets waited for an answer, the screens that separated women from men in their encounters. The anime also shows the main characteristics and themes of heian poetry, such as the grief caused by impossible love.It is divided into two sections: the first half deals with the early Heian poetry and the Rokkasen (the six best waka poets), Ariwara no Narihira and Ono no Komachi being the two characters that are more deeply developed. The second half deals with the late Heian Period, and introduces several poets, but –for some reason- there are more chapters devoted to Sei Shonagon, author of ""The Pillow Book"". I would have liked to see more of Murasaki Shikibu, who only appears in one chapter.The manga is episodic. Each chapter tells a different story, but some characters are protagonists in more than one story, and those who are main characters in one of the episodes, may appear as secondary characters in another one.These chapters are all presented by Fujiwara no Teika, the anthologist, whose poetry is shown in the last episode. At least one of the poems of the Hyakuninisshu is recited and explained in every episode, together with other poems by the same authors, not included in the anthology.Characters – 10As most stories are told within a sole chapter, some of the characters appear briefly and there isn\'t much time for development... but there are characters, such as Narihira, Komachi, Yasuhide and Shonagon that appear in several episodes and are more deeply developed. There is little known about the real lives of some of these poets, especially the ones of the early Heian period, but there are many legends surrounding them. Much in the anime is based on these legends.The best character, in my opinion, is Narihira. No matter how little we know about the real Narihira, I definitely can imagine him behaving as he does in the anime. I am not that sure about Murasaki Shikibu. She appears too little and I don\'t know how faithful to reality her story was. I would also have liked to see a chapter devoted to any of the poems in her novel ""Genji Monogatari"", which is the work she is mostly remembered for.The characters are restrained by the rules of the Court as well as political an social issues, especially women. The anime reflects successfully the ways of the Palace and the distinct feature of most of the poets\' personalities, as history has come to remember them.Sound – 9The opening and ending songs are both good, and although there isn´t really a traditional feel to them, for some reason they go well with the story. I usually like the strange mix between the old and the new. It gives a refreshing and original touch.As for the seiyuus, I must applaud that most female characters don´t sound childish and annoying. And there are a lot of male characters with beautiful voices. The only one that might feel a little exaggerated at times is Yasuhide, but then again, he is one of the characters that brings humor to the story. I liked Narihira´s seiyuu especially.Art – 9The art has been frequently criticized for being flat and lacking in animation. I particularly loved it. It is true that there isn´t much animation… but I found it very original and appropriate for the story, with emphasis on the outlines and on color. It was strange to see blond and red-haired Japanese poets, though.Enjoyment – 10“Chouyaku Hyakuninisshu: Uta Koi” is definitely underrated. It may be because of its topic. But those who like poetry, or Japanese traditions and esthetics, should watch it. Those who aren´t familiar with Japanese poetry but like love stories or historical plots should also give it a try. It is very interesting. Furthermore, despite the tragic and sad nature of most of the stories, there is a great deal of humor in the anime. 10 for enjoyment.

While it is true over 40% of the poems consist of love genre, it would be much appreciated if they would pick other genres just for a different mood instead of feeling slightly in repetition (although no two man's life is ever the same). However, considering each episode individually, to how the poetry came about, it was worth every second regardless.Why is it that good? It is a diary of of the struggles of real people: of love, dreams, ambitions and hope. Everything we can relate to. All we can take for. We see how they empower themselves and be strong beings as time does not separate our anxieties and worries. It is that easy to forget.The narrator was sometimes slightly over the top annoying: where its purpose was to deliver enough information minimally comically but given the josei setting: it wasn't fitting, at least I don't find it comical when the suspense is built or after the anticlimax.

I was originally intrigued due to his historical setting and context. I’m a huge fan of history in general, especially for areas of the world I’m not that familiar with. Once I got started in this show, though, it was the individualized art style and emotional punch that kept me going.The art in this show is unique to say the least. Not to everyone’s taste, however I found much enjoyment in it. Usage of thick lines and geometric type backgrounds give the anime an artistic sort of feel, like we’re looking at...an ancient painting or woodcut. I’ve heard that’s what the goal was; in my opinion, mission accomplished. Colors are beyond vibrant. The usage of such intense color stands out all the more against those thick lines I mentioned. This series is a work of art, hands down. While not to everyone’s taste, for the tone and subject matter of this anime, it’s very appropriate.Sound is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the OP, even though there’s a part of me that feels it doesn’t belong with the tone of the series. It’s still catchy enough to hook you in, though. The ED though was out there. Having a rap-sounding song round out each episode was jarring, to say the least. It didn’t feel like it jived with the tone nor story of the series. Nothing stood out OST-wise. It met the needs of the show conveying emotion where needed, but I won’t be rushing out to by the soundtrack. I do have to give a shout out to the voice acting, though. So many big and recognizable names!! I watched the sub so I got to listen to the greats like Ishida and Koyasu. Hearing familiar voices in a totally new story made me smile.Told in an episodic format each episode being self-contained stories, each one though ties into the others with recurring characters, themes, and mini-arcs. There is no epic nor grand story here, no battles for supremacy or struggles against tyranny. In my humble opinion, what makes this anime stand out is how gentle the stories are. Though set in a timeframe that was FAR from gentle with death at young ages and an extremely stratified society, each tale still conveys a sweet relationship-driven tale, be it romantic or platonic. Your emotions are drawn in by each doomed or uplifting story, feeling for each romance/friendship that won’t work out or each that does.Our characters are real figures from the Heian period, the great poets of the era. While each is not in every episode, the audience can’t help but be drawn into their relationships and struggles as each episode progresses. One doesn’t need the characters in every episode to get to know each one in depth. I felt like I could feel each character’s struggle and emotions as if I had an entire season to explore them. With no particular favorite out of the bunch, I think I felt closer to our female ones, though. Their struggle stood out especially to me, given how history has been unduly cruel to our gender. Heian era Japan was no exception, with women placed behind screens and their intelligence downplayed to light poetry and motherhood. It’s amazing that some of their poetry and stories was admired enough to last through patriarchal suppression.Where this series really stands out though, the main reason it’s been added to my favorite list, is the emotional impact it carries. While infinitely gentle, this series still packs a punch to the heart. I like that it illustrates that every relationship doesn’t always have a happy ending, as is true historically. With such a stratified society as Japan, romance is all the harder. Even so, our characters find a way to express their love and devotion in other ways: glances, stolen kisses, moon-gazing, and poetry. Each doomed love is captured in the beauty that is ancient Japanese poetry. So simple yet each verse/sentence conveys such a powerful message. The whole package together creates an anime aura that strikes into the emotional heart of the audience.Yet for all that emotional heaviness, there’s also a bit of light hearted fun added to the mix. Occasional staple anime elements of SD faces and sweat drops add a touch of humor against all the doomed love. I liked the occasional jumps into modern day and alternate scenarios in the beginnings of some episodes and in the middle series episodes. All together, they give a touch of funny to counter balance the pain of the other elements.While the sound elements may not be up to par with the rest of the series, this anime was a pleasant surprise for me. I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much nor be as emotionally invested as I was and did. Art was absolutely gorgeous, if not your standard anime fair. In my mind, that makes it stand out all the more. Characters and emotions draw you in, making you click that “next episode” link all the faster. I’d definitely recommend this anime to any fans of emotionally driven shows with unique art and concepts. This one will stand out for me for years to come. an ancient painting or woodcut. I’ve heard that’s what the goal was; in my opinion, mission accomplished. Colors are beyond vibrant. The usage of such intense color stands out all the more against those thick lines I mentioned. This series is a work of art, hands down. While not to everyone’s taste, for the tone and subject matter of this anime, it’s very appropriate.Sound is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the OP, even though there’s a part of me that feels it doesn’t belong with the tone of the series. It’s still catchy enough to hook you in, though. The ED though was out there. Having a rap-sounding song round out each episode was jarring, to say the least. It didn’t feel like it jived with the tone nor story of the series. Nothing stood out OST-wise. It met the needs of the show conveying emotion where needed, but I won’t be rushing out to by the soundtrack. I do have to give a shout out to the voice acting, though. So many big and recognizable names!! I watched the sub so I got to listen to the greats like Ishida and Koyasu. Hearing familiar voices in a totally new story made me smile.Told in an episodic format each episode being self-contained stories, each one though ties into the others with recurring characters, themes, and mini-arcs. There is no epic nor grand story here, no battles for supremacy or struggles against tyranny. In my humble opinion, what makes this anime stand out is how gentle the stories are. Though set in a timeframe that was FAR from gentle with death at young ages and an extremely stratified society, each tale still conveys a sweet relationship-driven tale, be it romantic or platonic. Your emotions are drawn in by each doomed or uplifting story, feeling for each romance/friendship that won’t work out or each that does.Our characters are real figures from the Heian period, the great poets of the era. While each is not in every episode, the audience can’t help but be drawn into their relationships and struggles as each episode progresses. One doesn’t need the characters in every episode to get to know each one in depth. I felt like I could feel each character’s struggle and emotions as if I had an entire season to explore them. With no particular favorite out of the bunch, I think I felt closer to our female ones, though. Their struggle stood out especially to me, given how history has been unduly cruel to our gender. Heian era Japan was no exception, with women placed behind screens and their intelligence downplayed to light poetry and motherhood. It’s amazing that some of their poetry and stories was admired enough to last through patriarchal suppression.Where this series really stands out though, the main reason it’s been added to my favorite list, is the emotional impact it carries. While infinitely gentle, this series still packs a punch to the heart. I like that it illustrates that every relationship doesn’t always have a happy ending, as is true historically. With such a stratified society as Japan, romance is all the harder. Even so, our characters find a way to express their love and devotion in other ways: glances, stolen kisses, moon-gazing, and poetry. Each doomed love is captured in the beauty that is ancient Japanese poetry. So simple yet each verse/sentence conveys such a powerful message.

Crayon Shin-chan Movie 22: Gachinko! Gyakushuu no Robo To-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21395/Crayon_Shin-chan_Movie_22__Gachinko_Gyakushuu_no_Robo_To-chan,"['*****CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*****As a die-hard fan of the Crayon Shin-chan movies, this movie generated more gross sobbing out of me. For those who have been following the series, or rather the movies, it really is not hard to see that Shin-chan\'s dad, Hiroshi, is a great father. He\'s the Japanese equivalent of Homer Simpson; not particularly talented, not very special or spectacular, but is a hard-working man who would give anything for his family. He may not be the best person, but he is a great father. He is the one who brings the tear out of the viewers during the movies through his expression...of fatherly love.This movie, which is all about Hiroshi, touched on two topics: the eternal ""what if I was a clone?"" and the just the topic of a father itself. The ending was fairly obvious and easy to predict. However, the fact that robot Hiroshi, a father who values his family more than anything, had to let go of his family was heartbreaking. The last scene where he speechlessly challenged the human Hiroshi to an arm wrestle at the verge of his death drilled a hole in my heart. Even though he was finally accepted by his wife, his family, in the end, he was still just a robot. This fact was all the more painful to take because of how well the loyal viewers have seen what Hiroshi had gone through as the father of the Nohara family.This movie was not as adventurous as the rest of the Shin-chan movies, but it certainly did its job in showing the audience about Hiroshi and his position as a father. Even though the plot line of his creation was not very impacting, I personally think it made it easier for the story to be focused more on Hiroshi and less on the adventure aspect of the series. of fatherly love.This movie, which is all about Hiroshi, touched on two topics: the eternal ""what if I was a clone?"" and the just the topic of a father itself.

You might think the series is just a childish show for kids. And you would be right. Only except for the few hidden gems which come from the movie series. This movie is also one of those hidden gems.The story starts with the Nohara family visiting the 20th century museum. Although it seems like a harmless museum at first, it is run by a Ken who is obssesed with making Japan revert back to the 20th century. The very next day, adults start to act like kids and...they all head to the museum. Leaving their childs at home. Shin chan and his friends have to stop Ken and save Japan from reverting to the 20th century.The story may seem stupid and childish and if you think about it, it actually is. But trust me, this movie is really good. It leaves a lot to think about. Our parents were once kids too. And we always hear about the ""good old days"" from them. If they could go back to the ""good old days"" would they? The part with Shin\'s father recollecting his memories shows it best. It is a really emotional and great scene. I won\'t say much more(cause I\'m not good at English or Writing at all). But trust me, you have to watch this masterpiece of a movie they all head to the museum. Leaving their childs at home.

Doraemon Movie 15: Nobita to Mugen Sankenshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2676/Doraemon_Movie_15__Nobita_to_Mugen_Sankenshi,"[""My overall take: One of the darkest and most gripping Doraemon adventures; just don't think too hard about how certain things work...In this movie, Nobita and his friends essentially play a fantasy role-playing game in their dreams. This was a childhood favorite of mine, and I had a good time seeing it again. It boasts an arresting adventure, an intimidating villain, and one of the best roles for Shizuka in any of the Doraemon movies. It also ranks among the darkest Doraemon entries, with several antagonists and even main characters being killed onscreen. That's fine though, because the entire escapade takes place in a dream,...right? Not quite, because the machine facilitating it has a setting to reverse the dream world and reality!As fun as this movie is to watch, the interactions between the dream world and the real world raise many questions. How was the villain's bird-like minion able to enter the real world before the game had even been activated? Why does the robot who retrieves the Dream-making Machine in the end look and sound like the bird person? Why is Nobita's school suddenly on top of the hill in the closing scene of the movie? So many mysteries... To make things even more confusing, the resemblance between the bird person and the robot, as well as the the placement of the school on the hill, were not present in the manga version of this story, so they must have been deliberate creative decisions added by the filmmakers. (Yes, I've seen the obvious fan theories about how this all indicates that the main characters never escaped from the dream in the end.) On the other hand, maybe that kind of surrealism is exactly what you should expect from a story a like this.In any case, there's no time to dwell on that, because there's an upbeat ending song! All's well that ends well? (For real, the end credits song and illustrations are cute.) right?

First things first: although I cannot speak to their cultural representation, the character designs of the Indigenous African people in this version are substantially improved compared to the caricatures in the original.On the whole, I think this is a competent remake that keeps most of what made the original film good, being a decently engaging family-friendly adventure movie that makes good...use of the established Doraemon main cast. The biggest narrative edits mainly amount to giving some of the movie-exclusive characters more screentime and character focus, which for most part I don't feel strongly about, but they don't harm the movie in any notable way. This is a movie that not only gives a good sense of what to expect from Doraemon films, but is also fairly enjoyable on its own. If the story sounds interesting to you, I'd obviously recommend watching this version over the original. use of the established Doraemon main cast.

That works in its favour though because pacing is much better which this season is adapting far better than the first season. First season was decent at best and wasted a lot of episodes on norma and digitalis when they should have been cut shorter for mildian and sun jewel imo.But set that...aside, the second season seems to be paced better, leaning to the slower end but not dragged out.This is the soul society arc for Edens zero and when shit hits the fan for our main characters.

After watching season 1 i was waiting for the season 2 but for me it\'s a total disappointment. The second season starts Very quickly and we see the villain. they doesn\'t explain who is he ,where did he come from? what is his motive!! Just a bad guy who wants a times skip powur. First time i was like oh strong how they gonna defeat him? But after episode 10 they easily defeat him like he is a a bad guy from filler episodes. I watched like 10 episodes and there were no good action...scenes no new power up. Just the main character shouting ""don\'t hurt my friends"".Its pretty boring and wasted my time. The main thing is it doesn\'t tell us what do we want to know!! if I have a power gravity i would have create a black hole and totally destroy that world😂.Comparing to the season 1 it\'s very bad and boring. scenes no new power up.

It’s a shame that it’s been so overlooked, but it really deserves the praise. It’s got such a unique and interesting world, great characters and it doesn’t shy away from dark themes. A must watch for any action and adventure fan.I liked Edens Zero season 1, but I felt at some points it dragged on and had a lot of empty space. Season 2 is an end to end roller coaster of emotions. There’s almost nonstop action and Shiki and his friends are constantly having to overcome new challenges. The antagonists...feel imposing and the stakes are well done. There’s a true sense of gravity(pun intended) to every battle. The world building also opens up a lot more in this season. We finally get to see other parts of the cosmos and get a sense of how vast this universe is, including all the various species, people and abilities out there.What gets me the most excited about this story is that Mashima has an incredible way of making you feel like you’re on an actual quest with these characters. We’re not just watching things play out, but actually being immersed in the story. The best way I can describe it is as the old Toonami anime from back in the day. You know how you’d come home from school and turn on the tv to watch anime. It just felt like you were part of the story with the characters. That’s Eden’s zero for me. Few shows in recent years have had that. Dai no Daibouken, Black Clover, but I think EZ might do it the best. It is really easy to fall in love with this story and characters.I really appreciate that they weren’t afraid to test character deaths out in this season or showing blood as characters get shot. It just really feels like a more intense experience that subverts some usual shonen tropes. The first half of the series with Drakken Joe as the antagonist is genuinely nerve wracking at times. I remember thinking to myself “how are they going to get out of this” at several points and just being amazed at how Mashima-sensei wrote himself out of situations.The action scenes are way better this season too. JC staff just seem to have upped their game completely production wise here. Pacing, art, fight choreography it’s all really solid. No complaints on the technical aspects.Edens Zero S2 takes the series to a different level in my opinion. It’s definitely a more serious approach to the story and expands upon the lore introduced in season 1. Every single character has time to shine and grows substantially.

That will be the Prelude to the Aoi Cosmos' war (which will be the main focus if the producers decide to continue with Season 3).Obviously, new revelations come as they go, and Shiki and Co. face new friends and enemies on top of the same challenges that led them in this space-continent journey, which has not seen an end to itself.

Also, Shiki's pursuit to find Mother's remnants is just as strong as the heart's objectives would allow, and with frenemies like Drakken Joe's elite force of the Element 4 (each contributing to the stability of the Dark Alchemist himself) and returning characters like Skull Fairy's Space Pirate Elsie Crimson, the battle of the Aoi Cosmos slowly creep in, enlarging the playing field amongst a lot of the players involved, as Shiki and Co. realise that they're not on their own this time with Edens Zero and (eventually) the Element 4 on their side fighting for the peace of the Cosmos, which rages the fight between humanity and robots.Without the promising Yuuji Suzuki, director Toshinori Watanabe was called upon to continue the former's good work, and although he has quite the resume to his name, he kept the format largely intact as how the late director would've wanted it to be: good pacing and action-oriented settings, with Hiro Mashima's progressive character development making up the lack of attention that Season 1 got 2 years ago. To be fair, the sequel had noticeable improvements over the prequel, though that difference I wasn't able to notice since it retained the same intriguing elements from 2 years prior that kept my attention glued to the small screen, so that's an OK thing.Along with J.C.Staff's continuous good work under Toshinori Watanabe with decent to good production values, the OST was sadly one area that felt kind of average.

At first I thought it will just be just another youth summer adventure stories which turned out to be absolutely wrong.Two long-time friends, separated after graduating middle school, reunites the next summer.

And it\'s worth the time, considering things got bleak real fast after that.What happens is basically, things went full circle.

This may be the main theme of the movie. The start was beautiful. I was tearing up because I could sense this story would be special, but at the end it didn\'t turn out like I imagined.The setting revolves around the countryside, which really makes me appreciate the calmness of the place. The characters were very likeable and very fun to watch. Seeing the trio Roma, Toto, and Drop laughing and crying reminds me about true friendship. It just felt like going on an adventure with them.The first part of the movie was pretty good, but the...middle part got kind of boring. Nothing was happening. It was just the trio going around and talking. The main problem I have with this movie is that the characters keep talking and talking about deep and motivational things for the rest of the movie. After hearing so many ""wise"" phrases, I felt like everything they said was meaningless. What was the main message they were trying to portray? Saying meaningful quotes again and again when nothing is happening really removes its meaning or impact. It was like watching a lecture of wise quotes, or to be more exact, like seeing two friends talking to each other. Basically, nothing was happening. I as a viewer could not relate to what they were saying because there was no event or plot point that made me witness their struggles. It was just three friends ""ranting"" and saying sorry throughout a great portion of the movie.Still, the way they transmitted the message is very good. The ending is beautiful and confusing at the same time. This movie could have been a great one if there were more things going on and less deep talking.Also, please don\'t expect this anime will be at the level of Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho.

Goodbye Donglees is pretty good, and I think you will definitely like it and get inspired.To summarize, Goodbye Donglees is a very simple story. It made me laugh and tear and encouraged me to start doing the things I\'ve always wanted (in other words, finding the treasure).

I need to rewatch that series some time, and with the news that it's FINALLY getting an English dub and home video release, I'll actually have an excuse to do so! After the show's success, the team behind it decided to try their hand at another project, a movie called Goodbye Don Glees. The movie tries to go for the same initial premise...and appeal as Yorimoi did: Dorky kids on a down-to-earth adventure to a real world location that has great personal significance to them, with even the marketing going into this. But what the marketing tried to sell the movie as and the movie itself are two very different beasts, and as much as I hate to say it, Goodbye Don Glees wasn't necessarily the home run that Place Further Than the Universe was.The story centers on three young boys—Roma, Toto, and Drop—who are a tight knit group of friends, naming their little group Don Glees and spending time together in the countryside. But they don't exactly have the best reputation and are often picked on. One day, Roma spends all his money on a cheap drone with intent to use it to take a video of fireworks the next town over, or if not that, the fireworks Don Glees set off for the night. But that night turns out to be a fateful one as they're hit with one misfortune after another: Their fireworks don't go off, the drone goes missing, and later, a forest fire occurs. Worst of all, the townspeople believe that Don Glees are responsible for it. But the kids think the missing drone might have proof of their innocence, so they decide to go on an impulsive journey into the mountains to find it and clear their names.From what I've heard, the original Japanese marketing made a big deal about the characters going to Iceland, which only happens in the last third of the movie. 85% of the movie is focused on the trio of boys and their quest to find their missing drone in the countryside. Now, these parts of the movie are legitimately great, with the animation really going all out in conveying the natural beauty of the woods and the countryside. Of course, the animation quality isn't limited to just the backgrounds. Similarly to Place Further Than the Universe, a lot of attention is paid to how the characters move and how they express themselves through body language, like the way Drop sits or the way Toto hunches over when he feels insecure. Speaking of the characters, the main trio are a delight to watch. They actually feel like real dorky kids from the way they move, talk, and get into scrapes, and their designs change believably near the end of the movie. It helps that a lot of their banter and interpersonal conflicts are pretty naturalistic without bordering on cheese. I honestly wouldn't have minded if the whole movie had just been about their adventure through the woods. Low-key, slice-of-life movies have their place! I mean, the Laid-Back Camp movie exists, y'know!But as much as I want to love Don Glees as a movie, if the rating didn't clue you in, it has quite a bit of issues holding it back, with the main one being the really rushed, shoehorned in third act that feels like it's only there because the staff felt like they absolutely had to escalate the movie's plot by the end. The third act never felt like it was properly built up, and when the characters are made to go to Iceland, it just zooms through the process of exploration in favor of throwing in a very heavy-handed emotional climax at the end, with the shift into said third act being so intense and dramatic that it feels like you got hit with a case of whiplash, eschewing the rest of the movie's down-to-earth charm. It also results in a certain twist coming across as a lot more predictable, even though it was foreshadowed well in advance. Say what you will about Place Further Than the Universe doing the same thing, but there, the writers actually had the time and wiggle room to properly show the process, build up to its own emotional climax, and used every tool at its disposal to have it make an impact. Furthermore, the drone and forest fire subplot doesn't get much in the way of resolution at the end, because it just gets dropped in favor of the Iceland trip. Also, the character of Chibori is woefully underutilized. From what I've heard, the Japanese marketing also made a big deal out of this character, but she really only gets one scene in the whole movie and is just there to be a prop for Roma's development. Yeah, she's mostly just a waste of animation and has no character beyond supporting Roma.So basically, bad marketing made the movie tank, and I'm not exaggerating. Apparently in Japan it did pretty badly at the box office, which sucks because other than the flaws I mentioned above, Goodbye Don Glees is a fairly cute movie that really showcases director Atsuko Ishizuka's talent, alongside that of the rest of her team. Plus, it's getting an English dub and a home release in the US this month, so you'll be able to watch it legally fairly soon. So while I do admittedly like Place Further Than the Universe better, if you're looking for a fun, wholesome movie to watch, I'd still recommend you watch Goodbye Don Glees, even if its third act feels very heavy-handed and out of place in what's supposed to be a fun slice-of-life adventure. and appeal as Yorimoi did: Dorky kids on a down-to-earth adventure to a real world location that has great personal significance to them, with even the marketing going into this.

Some of the shots are breathtaking on a big screen.Sadly beyond the visual craft of the film it really begins to struggle. Coming of age stories between a group of friends centred around a supernatural theme of death is one of the biggest tropes in anime, so at this point if thats going to be the premise of your movie you have...to do it well. Anohana is one of the best examples of this trope I can think of, with even the directors own series A Place Further than the Universe treading very similar themes.With this kind of film its vitally important for any of the emotional beats to land that the audience is invested in the main characters friendships. Don Glees misses this by throwing us in the middle of the story so we never see any development between the characters, we're just told they're good friends before the main plot of the film begins. For the next hour of the film they get up to hijinks and occasionally spurt out pseudo-intellectual musings on the meaning of life. For any of these things to mean anything it would have helped if we even saw how the three characters first met and formed their bond.It's a repeated mistake of this film that the audience is repeatedly told things instead of shown, meaning we have to take it on word that there is a dynamic between these three worth investing in rather than seeing it grow organically - making this film and its themes feel shallow while it strives for death. There's also an overabundance of musical montages, no doubt to try and prise an emotional reaction from the audience that the film never earns from its story alone.As stated, if you're into stories about friends facing hardships and growing up then you'd be much better seeking out Anohana. I'd argue Goodbye Don Glees isn't even the best example of this story released in 2022, as Sumer Ghost explores similar themes in a much better way. to do it well.

But, It was difficult to understand because the story progressed with little explanation of the situation. And, How many people in Japan are experiencing the scenery of old shops in the countryside?""ANDI was very disappointed with the promotion method using ""yorimoi""(A Place Further Than The Universe[Sora yori mo Tooi Basho]).- A journey to find treasureFirst, I would like to write a Good point.It was a good movie that recalls past experiences. The countryside scenery of my hometown, the memories of traveling in the past, and my precious memories. I\'m a creator, I\'m a creator, so I...thought about creating something that wouldn\'t forget my past memories. I appreciate the movie.- A story in which emotions are difficult to moveThree teenage boys walk on a mountain road. They complain about the journey. They talk about friendship. They speak their wishes. It was a long, long, long time.After a long time, I get to the emotional scene in the last 10 minutes. Finally stories get together and finished. With a nice background picture.I felt that there was little explanation of the story and the background of the character. Whether it\'s a picture or a word. I think it\'s the choice the director has made. By not giving focus to the character, I think I tried to show the story with other elements. But it was hard for me to understand. Of course, there were some points that I could understand and sympathize with. Youthfulness. But when they walk down the mountain road, there is no reality. So I got lost between reality and non-reality. (Three boys were lost way too)- Expression of the countryside in JapanThere are many expressions of the countryside in Japanese animated films. Especially this time, the expression of the countryside was unique. Even though it\'s summer, it\'s showing decadence with its colors. This time a small country shop is drawn.There was a shop like this in my countryside, which reminded me of my experience. When I was a kid, I bought ice cream and bread. It\'s already closed. Of course, the store doesn\'t sell the latest toys.However, how many people have met such a store in Japan today. Population outflow from the countryside does not stop.I could sympathize with it, but what about the others? I am wondering how Japanese directors will express the countryside of Japan in the future.- Disappointing movie promotion methodThe latest work by director Ishizuka, ""yorimoi"", is highly evaluated. A TV series that I really love. As someone said, ""You can get the impression of the final episode in every episode.""This time, ""yorimoi"" was heavily used for advertising. As a collaboration project, four ""yorimoi"" characters made a commercial that they wanted to see a movie. Make a character clear file.Above all, I was disappointed. I got a free ""DonGlees!"" booklet when I visited the movie. It also features ""yorimoi"" two pages of the booklet. It\'s the same production team, but it\'s an unnecessary page. I also want many people to see ""yorimoi"". However, ""yorimoi"" and this work are different. What I want to tell everyone: I want you to appreciate this movie without comparing it to ""yorimoi"".- Doraemon?In the past, I went to a talk show by director Ishizuka. So I heard that she likes Doraemon. I also love Doraemon\'s movies. My thoughts. If this was Nobita\'s adventure..

So you\'d assume that I have strong feelings towards this movie. But I kinda don\'t lol. Yes, I gave it a 10/10 but that\'s because I personally could relate to it a lot with the story and the characters.  And it\'s just so heartfelt, entertaining, and looks amazing especially in certain scenes. But I know that it\'s definitely not for everyone and a lot of people won\'t enjoy it to the degree I did. I\'m mainly writing this because of how little the amount of...people who have watched this there are. It\'s downright criminal. It\'s a very good movie on par with a lot of other anime movies I\'ve seen with more than triple the amount of people who have watched it.So I\'m assuming if you\'re reading this you kinda already know at least a little of what the movie\'s about. But basically , Goodbye Don Glees is about a group of 3 friends who\'s group is called The Don Glees who go on an adventure to find their missing drone. Then while on their journey, they discover something about one of their friends that changes the whole course of where you thought the movie was originally gonna go. That\'s all I can say without spoiling anything.Now, all that being said, there is one thing they could\'ve done better... and that would be the character development. The characters were all unique in their own way and had good and diverse personalities but the thing that they really should\'ve expanded on is how they all got to meet each other and SHOW how they interacted in the past rather than just SAY ""yeah we\'ve been friends for a while."" That alone would\'ve made the movie so much more emotional because you would feel the strong connection and dependency they have to one another and that would have had a real impact when approaching the climax of the story.They could\'ve spent some 10 or 15 minutes extra on developing this. The movie runtime is relatively short being only 1 hour and 34 minutes. So adding 15 minutes for the purpose of developing their friendship would not have made the movie feel as if it\'s dragged on whatsoever.That\'s honestly the only problem I have, and it kind of makes me mad because if they would have done that, it would be a perfect movie.Definitely give it a watch, you\'ll at the very least be entertained by this heartwarming adventure. people who have watched this there are.

Well, 48 hours of reflexions followed. What to say... Goodbye, Don Glees! is a work with a recipe apparently well known by the general public: an idyllic setting in the Japanese countryside, a group of friends, a little adventure, drama, romance and so on. Makoto Shinkai\'s productions are the perfect examples. And yet... The great strength of this one is the powerful breath offered by the reading in the background. It is really the great asset behind which the stakes of the film unfold....A writing greatly mastered by Ishizuka Atsuko as an emotional conductor whose talent I took pleasure in discovering.Cyclical and mysterious. This is how the opening scene starts. Two friends on a night road with their bikes, pedaling with all their strength in the direction of a specific point: an airport. A luminous, liberating gateway to another world. Isolated in their idyllic Japanese countryside, it only reflects the growth of these young shoots in a vast world known only in appearances. By honoring this mundane life, far from the concrete and stifling buildings of Tokyo, it is ultimately a duo of marginalized people who move, rejected by all, living in expectation and hope of a time that seems frozen in their eyes trying as best they can to live like the rest. Seeking their own experience, each summer they realize their own explosive and luminous festival. But just as the sparkle of fireworks is lost in the big sky, these friends will be split up by the paths of life.Poetry characterizes the strength of such a work in every aspect. Everything rests on this background breathing kindness, humanity. While the end of adolescence marks the beginnings of a reflection on the step to take in the adult world, this duo under the name Don Glees, decide to maintain despite everything this illusion of lost time, of a youth marked by tribulations. Joined later by a third member who will make tip over definitively what they have in each of them tried to stifle. Regrets, questioning, the metaphor finds its place perfectly and runs in a touching way. The great trek that is improvised as the adventure of a life, lost, looking for their way, turning in circles (we come back to this cyclic idea, that of life in short), straining their nerves, their deepest convictions for each of them, and especially to rethink their place in this world: what do they really want? Does this ready-made life, in this perfectly maintained setting, suit them?In short, the echoes of an existential crisis are felt in a most human and realistic way. Their quest will lead them to face various points and obstacles: the adult figure they are trying to escape, that of the ""others"" and the pressure they can represent on their conscience, the surprise also to see that by deviating from the paths of fortuitous surprises waiting for us at the turn (sometimes hairy in some cases), the haunting of regrets in particular linked to a love of adolescenceRunning after a drone that is the catharsis of their life impulses, being able to access another point of view, celestial, of a whole universe that stretches their arms and seems within reach. The starry contemplation of the sky, the place of the universe, the photography reinforces the idea of approach and discovery of a world which fascinates and terrifies at the same time under all its angles. The beauty of the world is everywhere and yet seems hidden in many ways. They see themselves taking an old abandoned road, dilapidated. Here again, the idea of taking paths other than those desired by society, of learning from one\'s mistakes, of learning from them is perfectly transcribed. While to their great displeasure, this one is drowned under the waves forcing them to turn back desperately, this only demonstrates once again the image given: despite their attempt to go to the end of their convictions, the path on which they were moving has suffered the trials of reality. The race against time, against death, trying to keep afloat their youth that they thought until then acquired.The real turning point and to my great surprise was caused by the scenaristic twist on which the movie lies (at first fearful at the idea of undergoing a cliché and scenaristic facility seen so many times through this kind of movies, it was not. And that\'s why Don Glees was able to pull it off). Forcing them definitely to draw a line on this fictional bubble in which they have protected themselves so much from the outside world. And so, as a legacy of a painful past friendship, they leave Japan for the wild and enchanting surroundings of Iceland with the sole purpose of carrying out the existential quest in which they are all involved in their own way. What they will learn from it will change them in the depths of their souls and will allow them to reaffirm a place and a meaning to their existence that they had previously found difficult to grasp.Don Glees is a deeply touching film with an initiatory and human flame, about a trio of teenagers who truly discover what existence is. If Happiness has its own meaning for each of them, they will at least feel grown and changed forever through the encounters and the numerous adventures that will forge them. It\'s hard not to project yourself in it and to see yourself in it (teenage and at the same time adult one). The excellent song ""Rock The World"" accompanying their steps by the band [Alexandros] reinforces this picture of life. If the CGI can be slightly felt, the animation is still fluid and the poetic beauty is mixed with the artistic one. The ardor and wanderings of youth are the perfect expression of this film to show to any teenager lost in this world. As for me, I\'m thinking of going to Iceland for a while, chasing my shadow as a former lost teenager. Morality of the story: go after it and believe in your dreams.

That's all I can describe in this movie! It's insane how I didn't know the existence of this movie nor do I hear people hype it out! The story about a group of 3 friends that called themselves as 'The Don Glees' are going together for adventure to search for a drone as their proof of their innocence after being blamed for burning their hometown's forest. But along the way, they are seeking a more incredible journey to a great place and treasure.Their original plan was to take a beautiful picture of the firework through the drone, but misfortune happens. I LOVE how...this movie takes time to get us familiar with the characters, we get introduced with their secret places for the group, their plan for the summer festival and to their deepened friendship. Getting into this movie blindly with no expectation is probably the reason why it affected me so much. I have my doubts about the twist at the end, but it's far more beautiful than I expected. How the final part were executed is so well done, it makes me emotional 😭This movie is not meant for a 'exciting' or being too 'adventurous' its more about  character-driven type of story. Hence, you will find a lot of the characters interaction, them having deep conversation about their dream, and struggle. It does contain, bullying and academic pressure but just briefly. I personally love all the beautiful words here. Kinda reminds me of the old anime movie vibe!The animation is so beautiful, such a visually pleasing, 10/10!! However, I wish the movie could be a bit longer, and they could include how their friendship started, how they interact in the past. It would have made a much bigger impact at the end. Nevertheless, I still love it so much. Highly recommended if you want a heartfelt, great friendship, and entertaining movie to watch! 9.5/10  🌟 this movie takes time to get us familiar with the characters, we get introduced with their secret places for the group, their plan for the summer festival and to their deepened friendship.

The booming music when Drop and Toto pretended to be hot ladies to impress Rouma\'s classmates. Rouma struggling to scramble over the dirt hill in front of the police and if you squint, you\'d see that Drop pulls him up right before they turn around. Spraying the ""bear"" hairspray into all of their...eyes instead of the bear in question, with the hairspray causing their hair to stiffen into a temporary comical shock. Amazing animation and art. Especially Drop\'s scooter scenes, forests, and waterfalls. Shame that the actual characters were drawn simplistically compared to the backdrops, although that could be a charm in someone else\'s criteria.I\'d say that one of the high points of the movie was the overarching elements of youth, regrets, and the theme of friendship.《The people accompanying who I wanted to see me accomplish this at 15.》Picking up that call for Drop, Toto and Rouma calling Drop by mistake from Toto\'s bad handwriting... Ironically, doctors have a stereotype of illegible script that sometimes ends in blunders with distributing the wrong medicines to patients. Which brings me to the next example. Toto\'s biggest conflict is his doubt of truly wanting to become a doctor in the future as per his father\'s suggestions, despite being brought up to study all his life. What kind of guy brings his exam cram book in his backpack trekking up a gigantic mountain covered in sweat and dirt, it being his first time reported missing? The same guy who ends up burning it in the fire for added tinder with a half-hearted smile on his face. Successor or not, he lets go a bit of his uptight and scornful attitude after fighting with Drop due to Rouma\'s hurt over calling the ""Don Glees"" adventures as tacky and snotting his brains out regretting those words. None of these three are popular among their contemporaries, I\'d go as far as to say that they are all each other\'s only friends. Rouma is picked on, Toto seems a loner, and Drop doesn\'t attend school. The short time they spend together, from a duo to a trio, was so significant that they breakdown at the end and wreck the whole secret base apart into flames.No Drop? No Don Glees.The best ending song possible was picked to suit ""Goodbye, Don Glees!"". It seems written or commissioned for the movie itself from the lyrics... Would have been a better impact if a short visual sequence played in the credits of their lives rolling on with blooming from the sun hitting the view, but them riding their juvenile bicycles trying to catch up to Drop who rides first out of the screen was meaningful as well. I wonder why there was so much English. The majority of the songs with vocals were sung in English, including ""Twinkling Little Star"". Don Glees is ""Don\'t Glee""... That... A\'ight...The trailer I saw a while ago made me believe it\'d be a full fantasy movie, somewhat like a rag-tag team of goofers accidentally getting transported into another world. While fantasy is one of the tags, and there\'s a few questionable bits like how bears weren\'t supposed to live on the mountain, can\'t really be sure which parts in particular were actually fantastical or not. Speaking on that note, much of the movie does not rely on blatant exposition to tell a story. Similar to how the two original duo are led to explore outside of both of their comfort zones beyond their small countryside town and Tokyo because of a variable factor, I think the movie was purposefully left so open. Rouma coming from Tokyo, Toto wanting Rouma to come along back to Tokyo, none of them going to Tokyo... winding up in Iceland. Anyways. At least while I was watching it, you get clues here and there that Drop was bound to die. Rouma feeling as though they should take Drop back down the mountain because he was worried that there might be something wrong with him. Beside him, Toto arguing that he would not mildly say ""Then, let\'s go home!"", because Drop wanted to do something that would satisfy him even if he died right now. \'It is better to see this until the end.\' Type. Drop continuously being shown as this smiling little shit bathed in sunlight and repeating his jealousy of the two having a long pre-existing friendship was suspicious enough. As if he knew of his mortality, that he could not apply himself in his lifetime to attain it. It\'s a good thing I didn\'t enjoy his character so it didn\'t hit me a smidge when it happened (lol). But we\'re not told of how. My assumption is a terminal disease or some sort of illness (?). Or a vehicular accident. The news came abruptly. Maybe the manga reveals it.Overall, bittersweet coming-of-age film of three misfitted kids searching. My final score is 8, mitigated from a 7 in owe to the familiar rural setting, atmosphere, and animation. I was not absorbed by the story. With the movie being on the shorter side at about an hour and a half of run-time yet still foregoing fine details, viewers who dislike free thought endings and abstract ideas will most likely find the movie insufficient. There\'s hefty dialogue accompanied by the adventure, the adventuring taking a backseat for long talks and flashbacks. eyes instead of the bear in question, with the hairspray causing their hair to stiffen into a temporary comical shock.

The pacing could throw you off, but its message was incredible. Finding each other's treasures among themselves was a nice touch. I was hoping that Drop was fleshed out more as a character. You pick up things along the way which are apparent. This could've done much better if it had been in an episodal format. In terms of visuals, it's great. The way it captured the setting around them was beautiful.The ending sequence was a great callback for the characters. I watched this...with nothing in mind and thought it was a film about friends and their chemistry. It shows their development throughout their journey, and the characters' lives and struggles feel grounded and relatable. I like the lines that Drop says to both Roma and Toto. I could say that it struck me differently that I felt more emotional by the end. with nothing in mind and thought it was a film about friends and their chemistry.

Seems like a far more atmospheric version of Rob Reiner\'s 1986 ""Stand by Me""My perspective, comes from a man who spends 15$ on a ticket to an hour and a half film, classified as a ""Special Event"" past...special event my ass.Even as an avid Japanese cartoon enjoyer I find myself rarely getting to experience the luxury of the big screen, with minimal thought I purchased myself a ticket, I truly thought ""Don Glee\'s"" was going to be something special, let me tell you why.Atsuko Ishizuka is a director that touches the connection between...humans and nature, the atmosphere and our soul, friends together amongst an overwhelming world. She touched I and many others with her exceptional 2018 ""A Place Further Than The Universe"" excellent in every regard, all condensed in it\'s short but beautiful 13 episode runtime. From a synopsis I assumed I would get the same experience as I did with ""A Place Further Than The Universe"" in ""Don Glee\'s"" in which I received in a hell for leather degree.The first hour of this film feels like a rehashed coming of age kids movie, nothing exemplary, as mentioned before I think it\'d be fair to compare it to ""Stand by Me"" watered down to garnish a PG rating. It\'s characters are tropey to the bone, making everyone\'s dynamics dry, making it damn near impossible to relate to the cast of such a humanistic story. It deviates the impact and meaning of the film, in which comes to light in the last 10-20 minutes of the film...The ending of ""Don Glee\'s"" is excellent, but completely unrecognizable compared to the previous hour + wasted in order to get to such a magnificent ending. Very little dialogue is held, there\'s a deep sense of understanding, every moment is spent carefully, like a really good short film. I wish ""Don Glee\'s"" was just that, A short film covering this ending segment, it\'s not though... And so after all the excellence there was a lack of glee within me when I had wasted 15$ and an hour and a half of my time.As for objective points, The animation is fluid very picturesque with it\'s scenery a style obviously intended. There\'s noticable cut corners though Still backgrounds, CGI vehicles, and some repulsive renders of characters found in such scenery. The soundtrack is obnoxious, painful even, tracks often being over dramatic or not even fitting to the scene. English vocals that struggle to convey what it\'s true intentions are, and most devilish of them all TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE FUCKING STAR, I SWEAR TO GOT I WILL COMMIT MASS GENOCIDE IF I EVER HAVE TO LISTEN TO THESE BROKEN ENGLISH MOTHER FUCKERS SING TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR EVER AGAIN I SWEAR IT, I PROMISE IT I WILL DO IT-I pray that season two of ""A Place Further Than The Universe"" doesn\'t resemble this disappointment of a film humans and nature, the atmosphere and our soul, friends together amongst an overwhelming world.

Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6573/Darker_than_Black__Ryuusei_no_Gemini,"['I had a rather a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process taken up by the scriptwriters of this show. They had an almost infinite pool of ideas to work with, from the origin story and reasoning behind the Hell\'s Gate manifestation to endless detours that could have been taken up using the Contractors and Dolls as parables for sociological issues plaguing current society; the possibilities were endless. It seemed that with all the mysterious themes being left in a shroud of ambiguity and the multifaceted approaches to tackling them just on the cusp of being explored, any route could have been taken...that would have resulted in a decent sequel. Taking a shot in the dark with any one of these ideas should have yielded something worthwhile. But for reasons beyond comprehension, instead of trying to provide a solid answer to its mysteries or even using it to flesh out its world\'s lore, they threw that all away. And for what you may ask? Well, lolis, forced comedy, talking squirrels, character resets, raging alcoholics and a sleuth of more idiotic plot twists.Still wondering why and how the Heaven/Hell Gates appeared? Still wondering why they brought on an augmented sky that warped into the new one? Still wondering why contractors and dolls became a product of this? Still wondering why their lives are correlated with fallen stars? Still wondering what the motivation of the syndicate was? Still trying to decipher this show\'s bullshit?... Well, join the club. In this second season, the writers said ""fuck it"" once again, as they followed up the events of the first by managing to create something that felt terribly dated from the moment it rolled off the assembly line. It\'s a husk of the show\'s former self in every regard. The story, despite being more streamlined this time around, was still very uneventful. All it does was drag us along to a nonsense-filled finale that will likely leave all its mysteries and hackneyed bullshit permanently unanswered. It\'s the kind of narrative structure when the intent felt like reverse-engineering gone wrong. This is studio Bones after all. A studio that\'s become infamous for thrusting their own concepts up their asses.The 1st season of DTB went from passable action romp to inflated pseudo-concepts by the final stretch of it. And as if that wasn\'t enough, now it felt like the staff gave up on having decent coherency among its pseudo-thematic jargon and settled for whatever came to mind instead. So this time around, even the pseudo-concepts don\'t make sense. Like a rough draft of a script passed along a circle of ""fuck its"" and shoulder shrugs, as they rake in the money, tossing what little ideas they had towards the finished product without so much as batting an eye.Speaking of tossing shit together, the art seemed to have become a victim of complacency as well.I don\'t know how this is possible, but with fewer episodes to worry about and more years to perfect the art style, the 2nd season felt like it brought no visual improvements to the table. By a side by side comparison, very little was made better, instead, a 2-year gap in its production cycle seemed to have left it in a state of stagnation. It\'s like the animator team made it back in \'07 and just let it gather up dust until it was time to release it. And when placed against other titles made in the same year, it just pales in comparison. And this isn\'t to say that studio Bones couldn\'t do any better. They\'ve already proven that they could improve their visual and animation efforts as time goes on. Just looking at the visual output between Eureka Seven\'s 1st and 2nd season shows that. So seeing how little they cared about improving their craft for DTB\'s sequel felt like a cheap blow. It\'s a mediocre patch-job that doesn\'t deserve any credit whatsoever.And while I can\'t offer it much credit, an aspect of this season that might register with some was the new choice of music.The great jazz/blues fusion soundtrack of season one took a backseat to a more contemporary House-electronic sound. It\'s not a bad soundtrack but when compared to the prequel\'s, it feels out of place. It inadvertently strips the show of its familiar charm and alienates it further from its predecessor. The neo-noir backdrop feels out of place when the smoky croon of a Jazz track is replaced by what\'s effectively a rave-party anthem. It simply sucks the atmosphere out and replaces it with something more ""in the now"" as opposed to the timeless feeling. Since musical taste is subjective, I won\'t harp on it any further and leave you to decide where you stand on it.But what isn\'t a decision that needs much debating over was the new cast.With fewer contractors, more people characters in their place, there\'s still no decent characterization to be found. They made a big deal about contractors having no irrational emotion in season one but there\'s very little differentiating them from other people when they all remain one-note. Also, that sense of maturity that the first season carried for its characters was thrown out the window and replaced with bombastically over-the-top eccentricities. This causes a HUGE tonal shift in how the show is presented and perceived. Similarly to what the switch in musical tones did, this too was a decision that watered down the poignancy that occasionally flicked through in season one. Now, everything was glaringly carefree. They even changed the classy cat to a flying squirrel. LIKE SERIOUSLY? FUCK YOU DTB!The biggest issue comes with Suou, our new protagonist. She takes up more screen time than necessary and is only good for two things: being an inconsistent character that flip-flops from one tonal speed to the other, or loli fanservice. And if that wasn\'t bad enough, she was degraded to becoming a contrived plot-device halfway through the series.Hei isn\'t even the same badass we use to love. The writers added over-bloated angst to his characteristics and made a man who was already lacking in emotional range, to begin with, to be presented as a complete nut job of polarizing extremes. In place of the calm and collected demeanor he once had, we\'re instead given a raging alcoholic who slaps little girls in his spare time and drinks himself silly when he felt like it. Of course, he still kills contractors like the cool electric Batman we grew to love but his conflicting characteristics with his supposed ""emotionless state"" makes it harder for anyone to care for him anymore. He simply became a puppet of the poorly written screenplay, being inserted whenever the writers saw fit.But perhaps the worst replacement was that of the side characters introduced for this season. The cast included a tranny bartender with a lolicon obsessed son, Misaki the walking plot-device, antagonists that border on luny, and a sleuth of people that aren\'t worth the mention. Needless to say, the cast here was far inferior to the show\'s previous standards. They served no other purpose than being aggravating tagalongs that no one ever wanted.And really, this season itself was just that: an aggravating tagalong that we\'re forced to accept as a continuation. Instead of getting a decent successor, we\'re instead given a half-baked effort that couldn\'t stand on its own. Bones dropped the ball in every conceivable level.Enjoyment: 3/10Disappointment... I found nothing here but unsubstantial fights and cheap attempts at fanservice. This is NOT how you do a sequel to a neo-noir action romp. It doesn\'t even work as pure schlock entertainment. Apparently, even Pizza Hut said ""oh hell no, fuck that"" since they too were nowhere to be found, wanting nothing to do with this uninspired continuation.Overall: 3/10There are bad sequels then there\'s DTB\'s sequel. A sequel that literally scrubbed the show of its previous identity and STILL didn\'t answer any questions. As it is now, I can only recommend this to completionists. An underwhelming mess that sullied what little credentials the series was desperately clinging onto. that would have resulted in a decent sequel.

An underwhelming mess that sullied what little credentials the series was desperately clinging onto.', 'Somehow the high expectations I had awaiting the sequel to a fantastic series were not fulfilled. Ryuusei No Gemini isn’t exactly a sequel to Kuro no Keiyakusha, but more like a separate arc in itself. It would be unfair to compare both of them as they vary in their style and storyline. For starters, the series are not bi-episodic; instead revolve around a single storyline involving a Eurasian female protagonist. Hei’s involvement through the series although significant, has not really been up to what it ought to be.Storyline: 7/10Suou Pavlichenko is a 13 year Eurasian girl whose life suddenly changes on a fateful...day when she meets up with Hei. Involved in the mess of politics and war between the contractors, she seeks out on her own quest to find her missing twin, Shion. Alongside her is Hei, a drunk bastard who completely lacks the mannerism and politeness he once had. The personality change might have been necessary in this series as it made things a bit interesting, but it didn’t seem all that good seeing him like that. The storyline, in its individuality served to be interesting though. The protagonist goes through a lot of ordeals throughout her journey. The series also has some graphic and violent killings which made it a little gory at times. The birth and evolution of the contractors was something we had vaguely seen in Kuro no Keiyakusha. The involvement of many groups (CIA, FSB, MI6 and Section 3) could have made for better viewing had they had more air time. They left it a bit incomplete and it felt as if these names were only included to attract attention without proper motive behind it. Also the “Syndicate” that pretty much ruled in Kuro no Keiyakusha was nowhere to be seen, again a disappointment as the whole mysteriousness behind them suddenly disappeared. Altogether though, despite its shortcomings it was somehow good how it ended up being. I guess it may be due to the protagonists’ whole journey from havoc to happiness. As for the name “Gemini of the Meteor”, it wasn’t nearly as important to be kept in the title IMO.Characterization: 7/10Ryuusei No Gemini had a plethora of characters which made it quite an entertaining prospect to watch. Starting off with Suou, a determined and strong girl entwined between living a life as a human or a contractor. It was touching to see the ordeals she and her school friends went through. Much like a supporting character, July was an example of some nice character development, and his relation with Suou was charming to watch. Hei’s laid-back sake drinking attitude failed to impress me the slightest. And the fact that he was not able to showcase his powers during most of the series made it lamer for me. The agents of Section 3 were pretty good, namely Hizaki and Genma. Hizaki’s remuneration involved kissing someone after the usage of her power added to the humor. Madam Oreille was yet promising character shown but somehow failed to make much of an impact in the Anime. Lot of interesting characters I would say. But somehow they were cramped up in a short series which somehow failed them I believe. They should have been given more time for their characters to be known properly rather than just through some cameo roles.Art: 9/10The original characters were already pretty awesome in how they were made. The new characters were also very nicely put out. From the Russians to the CIA to the Japanese characters, all looked very original. Also the new characters gave the storyline a refreshing experience. The fights were well coordinated and typically good to watch. Hei’s new look was intriguing; Suou’s character was pretty nicely done too. The agents looked good and the whole background of the Anime from Russia to Tokyo was beautiful. The characters are all very nicely drawn and the animation stands out to be pretty good as well.Sound: 8/10Sound was another good factor for Ryuusei No Gemini. The OP was a treat to the ears. I particularly liked it. The voices of the characters were also very good. Suou sounded very sweet whenever she used to shout “Tanya”. As there was a mixture of cultures, it’ll be interesting to see how these voices correlate in the dubs that will be out later on. The ED was average I would say. The best thing however would be the background score during the fights. The whole beat-box thing or whatever that was being played surely pepped up the interest to watch. I loved it.Overall: 8/10Seeing this series individually without comparing to the previous one and you’ll find that it’s actually good. Although not as epic as Kuro no Keiyakusha, Ryuusei No Gemini offers an entertaining experience with some interesting character portrayals. Combined with good artwork and sound, it is a definite recommendation. Just don’t try and compare it with the first season and you’ll definitely like it. day when she meets up with Hei.

This season was balls to the walls, shamelessly awful.The defining feature of the entire series: how they manage to draw every character with dead eyes throughout the series, yet expect us to enjoy ourselves. The defining scene: horrible side character creation 1, dreadlock kids, sobbing and venting to horrible side character creation 2, his crossdressing dad, culminating in being more likely to make you laugh than cry as he sobs and...whines into his cake. The defining question: how they expect us to believe Hei can still kick everyone in the world\'s ass with no powers and reduced to ""living the good life"" (that one was a minor meme joke, do not worry if you did not get it).There are already other reviews that detail exactly how the plot is (stupidly) aimless and bereft of basically most of the useful details it should have, so I am not going to rehash that. What I will touch on is how the plot is awful with the characters it uses: it introduces lots of new characters, all poor creations that are impossible to care about; it has a lot of short, impossibly one sided battles; it gives random annoying flashes to some apparently crazy event involving Yin, with absolutely no real explanation as to why they happened; it has random, annoying flashes to these blonde twin girls, who speak in tittery, annoying voices and ""say mysterious things"" i.e. nonsensoleum; it has cop lady chasing desperately after Li, despite the fact that she has no real insight to anything in this series, never does anything, and just wastes our time; it has former cool cat Mao back as an awful, ridiculously (poorly drawn) cartoony flying squirrel like creature (they called it a mamonga or something, whatever). Get the picture?This version of Darker Than Black just tries to establish how SAD and AWFUL everything is for everyone, and it definitely does a good job of showing viewers an awful time. Of course, just like people are unwilling to be objective about Code Geass 2 since they loved Code Geass 1, similarly no one will be objective about Darker Than Black 2 since they loved Darker Than Black 1. I cannot wait until the OVAs come out to ""connect the seasons"" and people act like it redeems all the flaws. whines into his cake.

Darker than BLACK - Ryuusei no Gemini, the sequel seemed to forget these.*Mild Spoilers Ahead*This anime would have been great if it was a stand-alone, but it was unlucky enough to have expectations to live up to its predecessor. The main character, Hei - once a calm, collected, cold-blooded killer now stars as an umkempt drunk who abducts small children and beats them....Mao, the cat who had previously died, is now a flying squirrel and stays as one even though he had many oppertunities to possess a cat. Yin has turned from a near-silent doll into a... wait, nothing at all was explained about that - but she made a lot of contractors commit suicide so that she could... that wasn't explained either. Kuro no Keiyakusha kept the plot a complete mystery until the end, but Ryuusei no Gemini didn't really explain it at all.So, our old friends from Kuro no Keiyakusha have had their characters changed drastically, but what about the new faces? Maybe they will make up for this? A loli with a rifle; a pervert who can turn into a golem and a lesbian with a lightsaber... personally, I didn't find them very original to say the least.Enough of bashing the characters though - onto the story. The series was half the length of Kuro no Keiyakusha, and the two episode long arcs were discarded. I was dissapointed by this since too many things weren't explained, even for Darker than BLACK. The last episode really needed to be two, maybe three, episodes and again explain a few more things. It was a cliffhanger disguised as closure.Overall, a decent anime. If you do plan on watching it, have Kuro no Keiyakusha ready to watch again so that you can get rid of the bad aftertaste - Ryuusei no Gemini doesn't live up to the original and makes you think less of some once great characters.

Bones have made some pretty big changes between seasons: setting main cast of characters, story, etc. It's better to look at DTB2 as more of a spin-off of the original DTB: if you liked season 1 because of the idea of the series (contractors et all), then you will most likely enjoy season 2. Now, onto the review:StoryIt is VERY different from the original DTB. First of all, it...seems to be one continuous narrative instead of two-episode mini-arcs like in the original season. I happened to like the mini-arc format, but BONES obviously knows what they're doing: the story is as rich and detailed as ever. Like season 1, the story is centered around contractors, humans who have super powers but need a remuneration afterward. Instead of focussing on Hei, most of the spotlight is on Suou, a Russian/Japanese girl whose brother is a contractor.ArtSome very big changes since season 1. Most notably is Hei's appearance: his mask is scratched, his coat is tattered, and he hasn't shaved in a while. In addition, the animation is sleeker, and the contractor's abilities are truly awe-worthy.SoundLike the first season, the sound is superb. The OP is definitely different, but in a good way, and the EP is one of my all time favorites.CharacterHei takes a minor role so far in the series, which I actually prefer due to the ability to see more stellar characters. Suou is the focus of the series, and she is one of my favorite characters in all DtB, including 1st season Hei and Huang.EnjoymentLike always, DtB never ceases to surprise me. I absolutely love the new characters and contractors already introduced, and I expect there to be more as the series progresses. July, the MI6 doll in the first season, also seems to have a larger role than in season 1, which I think is awesome. And, like the first season, it is really fun to piece together each contractor's power and remuneration. seems to be one continuous narrative instead of two-episode mini-arcs like in the original season.

I absolutely love the new characters and contractors already introduced, and I expect there to be more as the series progresses. July, the MI6 doll in the first season, also seems to have a larger role than in season 1, which I think is awesome. And, like the first season, it is really fun to piece together each contractor's power and remuneration."", 'Before you read this one, I would let you know that I am just a newbie when it comes to anime and I am not totally good when it comes to anime terms and words. Also I am not a good reviewer like the others in here. But, still I like to write a review for this and I will deliver it in a simple way based on my own opinions.Whats new in this series? A lot of changes. Yes a lot of changes, that would includes the characters, appearances, mood, settings and the story itself.What word might really fit in this series is the...word ""Explore"" yes, DTB-RNG really explored a lot in many aspects to make this series really great. Though it\'s just disappointing because it only has 12 episodes and there is no Season III for it unfortunately.Okay, here\'s my score for this.Story 8/10 : This is quite different from the first season in terms of what is currently happening in the story, also you would never know that it is the continuation of the first season if you don\'t read the synopsis. In fact I can say that Ryuusei no Gemini can stand alone without watching the first season and probably reading the synopsis of this season is enough to understand what happened from the start. What I mean in here is DTB-RNG made some changes being able for the 2nd season to stand alone. But of course it has the linkage between season I and II which is really great, though there are some aspect of the stories that until now really intrigued me.Aside from that one of the greatest investment regarding in the story for this series is by adding some new faces on the story and where does the story takes place.Also the abilities of each contractor are really fun to watch this time since the other abilities from the previous season are common.Art 9/10 : Character\'s art were delivered very clear and they were matching according to their characteristics & statistics. While some of the scenes out there are not properly delivered when it comes to art.But the X-factor of this when it comes to art is the adaptation of the country\'s dressing style and including it\'s culture and that\'s really impressive.Sound 9/10 : For a music lover like me, well this one is the 2nd highest basis for my criteria. Well, I can actually say that DTB-I has a great quality when it comes to SFX and other sound elements but, it\'s kinda lazy for ears. But, on this series it has been improved more than the previous season. Especially, if you will notice there are a lot of changes with Hei, not only with the personality but, also on how does he speak and reacts in different circumstances. Opening theme of Ryuusei No Gemini is really great, the music is titled ""Tsukiakari No Michishirube"" and it was performed by Stereopony a pop rock band in Okinawa that is already disbanded on 2012. What the most unique in here is Suou I like the way on how she deliver her words and reactions, perfectly matched with her characteristics and also the accent regards on their culture. One more thing regarding with the sound is the beat-box at the point where Hei showed himself and I was really surprised with his appearance, made me think ""Oh wow This is really cool!!""Character 9/10 : I am intrigue with the character changes in here especially Hei, a food lover that can probably always win with boodle fights turns into a drunk old looking guy also his polite personality disappeared and turns into a girl slapping guy with a black heart. While at some good point still, Suou Pavlichenko is the one that is totally unique and really, really good in the series. Character development for Suou is really good the way she speaks and the way she acts.Enjoyment 8/10 : I can\'t say that I totally enjoyed this one especially it is all about syndicates and crimes so I am expecting a lot of actions unfortunately something happened. Since there is an unexpected event that can be added to the thrill that you\'ll need to find out to watch this series. Other than that, regarding in all aspects well I can say that you can really enjoy this one.Overall 9/10 : I\'d rather say that I really enjoy this series and you might ending up wanting for this one to have a Season III.Note : This review never intend to please everybody so if you want to criticize this one you are actually welcome to do it and let me hear some words from you as I want to learn more. word ""Explore"" yes, DTB-RNG really explored a lot in many aspects to make this series really great.

Darker than Black 2 continues in this fashion but with quite a different approach. While the first season was mostly episodic, consisting of various story arcs with two episodes each, the second season is follows a continues storyline that is however developed quite well in my opinion.It might...seem a little bit cheese and typical in the beginning, but the story soon begins to ravel up and develop a bit of a darker feeling and the missing elements tying up to season 1 are also implemented, without however spellings things out to the viewer. There are always a few plot twists or single episodes that seem quite silly or pointless, but the greater story develops quite well. It is however not resolved completely and will likely continue into a third season in a similar fashion. I wonder whether we can ever hope for a complete unraveling of mystery, though I doubt it.The characters are very likeably and only partially reoccurring from the first season. The new characters might seem a bit unfitting at first but I like the way they develop. There is also a huge amount of character death, but in a different way compared to its prequel. The music and art continue in the fashion of season 1, the greatest controversy probably being the new opening and ending, though I personally liked them. The change of flavor is noticeable but not off putting.Also despite being a sequel it will probably also be very watchable for people who haven't seen the first season. The feeling is very similar but the direct links, despite being present, aren't major to the story.Darker than Black 2's greatest plus is probably it's enjoyment factor. The story, despite being interesting, is still not all that original and often a bit silly, but the atmosphere of the anime just keeps you glued to the back of your seat wanting to know what happens next and most importantly how it will play out. It may not be a historical masterpiece but is definitely worth watching.So yeah, jump in and watch it. You might even like it if you didn't like the first season to the different approach. I highly suggest giving it a chance.Overall 8/10. seem a little bit cheese and typical in the beginning, but the story soon begins to ravel up and develop a bit of a darker feeling and the missing elements tying up to season 1 are also implemented, without however spellings things out to the viewer.

Even though I watched episode after episode hoping for something to happen all I ended up with was frustration.Kiko in the first season stuck out enough and now there is the cross-dressing father and his idiot son plus strange characters appearing without barely an explanation. Sure DTB is a series where you have to think about the hows and whys but we are still pretty much left without a hint about contractors and dolls.There is a story to it but it feels lacking provably to the way it evolves. There definitely are good parts in it...and plenty of them but there is also lots of stuff that could of had been done better. The ""rifle materialization"" scene with Suou is repetitive and feels like it\'s being used to waste time. Although Hei\'s ability is not what it used to be if feels like he is not even himself and somehow is very fortunate of the outcomes of his problems.A least some characters have their own uniqueness to them and we learn a few things about them and their history.It\'s not terrible by its self, but it is when you are expecting something along the lines of the first season.Hopefully Darker than BLACK - Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden will somehow make up for it. and plenty of them but there is also lots of stuff that could of had been done better.

This anime is SUPERB in varieties of aspects such as story, art, sound, and characters. It really lacks nothing. This anime is action oriented anime and if you are looking for an action oriented anime that has to do with supernaturals and superpower with awesome story-line right now, this anime is just for you.  Although, watch the 1st season first! ', ""If “Darker Than Black” was a band than their follow up album would be considered selling out. “Ryuusei no Gemini” is nothing like the first season coming across as an entirely different anime. It panders to the audience, the action is over the top, the soundtrack is less memorable, and the direction of the entire anime is different. Not all the pieces connect properly, but it is a decent follow up to the first season of “Darker Than Black”. It never reaches the same heights of season one, but it does have its own strength that makes it worth watching including an ending that is...best described as unsatisfactory.Oh, there will be minor spoilers. While not intentional and kept vague as possible, it takes place a whole year after the first season of Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Gaiden four part OVA. It’s recommended you avoid this review for that purpose alone. I suggest seeing the previous season and OVA’s before reading or entirely ignoring this review.Good: Different direction and different strengths“Ryuusei no Gemini” from the first episode tells an overarching story. Focusing on two leading characters, Hei and Suou Pavlichenko, each with their own unique storylines. Hei story arc deals with finding Yin while Suou storyline deals more with finding answers about her family and her past. These two characters have different goals allowing the core of the main story to progress smoothly. Providing a different viewpoint from their adventure. How Hei goes about achieving his goal is vastly different to how Suou goes about reaching her goals. Suou goal is more personal vocalizing her thoughts in any situation without hesitation. Understanding how she feels throughout the entire season is plain as day. Hei is more tormented and defeated with his storyline in vein of a redemption story. Attempting to finish what he originally couldn’t because of his emotions.The first season of “Darker Than Black” went for capturing noir and “Ryuusei no Gemini” goes for capturing the action genre. Accomplishing this by having a major revelation or action scene occur in every episode attempting to imitate the effect of a cliffhanger to encourage the viewer to see the next episode immediately. There is rarely ever a moment of safety for the heroes wherever they go. Someone is always behind them chasing them down. Another added inclusion from the change in direction is the material is allowed to show more emotion. Characters in general across more lively in the series without the usual restrictions emotionless contractors are written in.One noticeable difference from “Ryuusei no Gemini” from the rest of the series is the comedy plays a bigger role. Jokes are thrown into every episodes instead of spread out through out the series on special occasions. Its favorite kind of jokes involves everyone confusing Suou for her twin brother. There’s a recurring gag involving Genma Shizume making flirtatious remark at Suou unknowing to him she’s actually a girl. It’s a funny recurring joke since it doesn’t reuse it frequently and offers other forms of humor to keep it varied. Mostly from Mao who despite a change of appearance hasn’t lost his ability for spouting sarcastic remarks.The supporting cast is larger in “Ryuusei no Gemini” getting the short end in characterization. This is very noticeable from the first episode when it decides to bring in characters from the first season only sideline them. Within the first episode, a specific character that had a big role in season one gets killed off quickly. The supporting characters that do influence the story generally don’t have much of a screen presence. Little characterization is mostly to blame resulting in a support cast to be only known for a single a trait. Mina Hazuki is a badass when she’s in combat, but the most memorable aspect about her personality is she’s a lesbian. Genma Shizume is a comedic pervert whose terrible at his job. There is not a single scene when he’s shown doing his competently on the field. Another character is Norio who first appears in episode four with a storyline hinting he would play some important role in the story. Norio is forgotten about past episode six and his time in the series is superfluous in the main story. Some other characters fade into the background because they operate behind the scenes, but never is their influence felt.The ending is a major drawback this season because Suou whole motivation is to find answers. Her arc takes as much time to tell as Hei's does. This gives “Ryuusei no Gemini” a whole different direction of solving mysteries so leaving unanswered questions is a negative. By the time episode twelve finishes despite every bit of information being told to the viewer what happened it won’t turn out satisfactory. Hei is the only character who could serve as the backbone for the entire anime series from beginning to end. Details of what occurred to Hei is left in the open interpretation department which is more than a disappointment given at this point Hei is a strong three dimensional character. Leaving an open ending for Hei journey unlike the rest of the cast members makes it that much more unsatisfying.Mixed: Good Leads, Unwhelming Supporting CastHei in “Ryuusei no Gemini” is at his lowest point in the franchise. Gone is the carefree side of his personality coping with his inner depression with alcohol. He’s frequently serious in nearly every scene which is a change of character for Hei. In general though, Hei doesn’t get much added to him in terms of characterization. However, he does face new conflicts to overcome this season. Hei might not be the same person he was at the start of the franchise, but is still a well written character. He’s smart in situations that require him to think on the spot to survive. Despite how he turned out he does is sympathetic towards other characters, but expresses it differently from before.Mao goes from a wise cat to a flying squirrel who asides from giving some sarcastic remarks and comedic relief has his importance to the story minimize. No longer does Mao gather intel for Hei or his group and instead helps out the heroes directly in small ways. He’s more active on screen sometime blocking people views or being some sort of distraction. Such moments don’t appear often enough to change the fact his importance to the story is not what it use to be. In return, Mao does receive characterization when fans finally get to see how he looked in his human form. It might only last a single episode seeing his past human self for the first time is a treat for fans.Suou Pavlichenko is a red hair, 13 year old Russian girl photographer who becomes a sniper. She plays a major role in the story seeing everything in the world of contractors for the first time, but for any viewer following this anime series in order will already know everything Suou does not. Her character will be more relatable for anyone who has not seen the world of “Darker Than Black” at this point, but adds to seeing first hand the evolution of a human turning into a contractor. She’s a decent character...Studio Bones thought otherwise in how she’s used. In 11 out 12 episodes Suou appears naked at some point or appear in some scene that provides fanservice. Yeah, one entire episode out of twelve doesn’t use Suou in some way to pander to its audience. To name a few instances in the first episode there is a (are they ever not) pointless shower scene, episode three she’s in a cabin drying wet clothes only being cover by a blanket follow by interpreted bad position, in episode four there is Suou dancing which would be fine if it weren’t how that moment was framed, in episode eight swimsuits, and can’t forget the anti-tank rifle summoning sequence (in which Suou appears naked) is always shown in its entirety every time it gets summoned. These are a couple of examples of how the anime treats her which is honestly far worse than anything Hei ever does to Suou in the anime.Like mentioned earlier the supporting cast is larger and some get sidelined. Misaki Kirihara from season gets sideline whose involvement in the story is unneeded. Her role in this season is minimize uncovering a conspiracy behind the scene that doesn’t do add much for the story. What ultimately ends up happening to her in the aftermath of the finale is far more relevant than anything she does before it ends. Due to the length of the anime the characters don’t receive the needed attention to have their own arcs or be fleshed out beyond introduction. Which why the likes of Yoko Sawasaki, Genma Shizume, Mina Hazuki, and Michiru are kept very simplistic from start to finish. The only exceptions to this are Dr. Mikhail Pavlichenko and Shion Pavlichenko because they are connected to Suou storyline. Throughout the series, there are flashbacks that reveal important pieces of information fleshing them out from when the season begins. Once it’s over, Dr. Mikhail and Shion have more to define them unlike the rest of the cast that remains the same.Good: Bones Studio Aces Their AnimationThe animation is done by Bones Studio like the rest of the anime series. Animation in “Ryuusei no Gemini” allows Studio Bones to show off what they can do. Having a more diverse cast in age range compare to the rest of the series. There’s a fair mix of children and adults where previous entries mostly had adult characters. As usual, all characters have unique designs that can be told apart easily even if all the characters hair color were the same. In movement it moves smoothly with no hiccups regardless what’s on screen. Backgrounds once again are detailed, though this time mostly contained in industrialized cities. There’s no environment that is unique to “Ryuusei no Gemini” specifically. However, it does claim the honor of having the best action sequences in the entire series.The action scenes have flashy effect with over the top powers use in battles. There’s no usage of 3D in these action scenes as Studio Bones spares no expense for them. Battles are flashy sporting particle effects of all kind from sparks when two melee weapons hitting each other, to an explosion with intense flames, to anti-tank rifle that pierces through concrete or metal, and whatever effects to its disposal. Episode three has a sequence where a stationed train is hit by another train causing train carts to start flying through the air. It does not use 3D in any frame of that sequence which looks great when seen. Unfortunately there isn’t another sequence in the rest of the series that tops that spectacle, but the other action scenes aren’t any less impressive because of it. Every action scene has a flashy effect unique to that specific action sequence. In one episode it has a character merging with a vehicle manipulating it for combat. Goofy sounding as that description is in execution it’s actually creative while not being a one sided battle.Throughout my reviews for the “Darker Than Black” franchise I always suggested seeing the anime with English subtitles and this season is why. In the English dub, Suou dialogue receives the most alteration of any character changing the tone of several scenes becoming grating to listen too. Alison Viktorin who voices Suou delivers a solid performance, but some of her dialogue does her a disservice making her come across as a little brat. Another factor that prevents her performance from being decent is she doesn’t sound like a thirteen year old. That would be easy to overlook, but she has a few scenes where she has to loudly vocalize her complaints. Due to the English script changes it varies from Suou coming across sympathetic or just wanting to see Hei hit her. As much Alison Viktorin is capable in the role playing off her cast member just fine, the English script gets across something else than originally intended.In the Japanese cast Kana Hanazawa voices Suou who sounds more like a thirteen year old. Her performance is more subtle in vocalizing Suou’s emotion. Unlike Alison Viktorin who voices the same character, Hanazawa comes across as sympathetic with her delivery of the dialogue. She makes Suou sympathetic and likable. The closer the anime gets to the ending the more range Kanazawa is allowed. Her chemistry with her co-stars is spot on especially when together Sawaki Ikuya and Hidenobu Kiuchi coming together naturally.Hearing Kent Williams deep voice coming out of a small Momonga (fancy name for a Japanese dwarf flying squirrel) is quite odd. Like in season one, Kent Williams is spot on with his sarcastic remarks being the most hilarious in the English dub cast. Hearing such a small animal talk in such a deep sounding voice sticks out. In the Japanese cast, Sawaki Ikuya voice never becomes noticeable when playing the same character. While I prefer Kent Williams playing Mao in the series, Sawaki Ikuya has a voice that better blends into the character. Never does Ikuya voice become a distraction making it easier to become immerse with the character.As usual (no surprise) regardless of who is heard both Hidenobu Kiuchi and Jason Liebrecht shine in their portrayal of Hei. The direction of the anime is different, but the changes does not affect how they portray their characters. Both of voice actors retain Hei characteristics managing to make the transition between seasons seem seamless. Creating a performance that works with the changes of the series. There’re no hiccups in how they portray Hei. The supporting cast in both the Japanese and English dub cast play their characters in a straightforward manner. With more comedy, it’s more difficult to distinguish any standout in the supporting cast. Doesn’t really offer much range when half the cast has to deliver comedy.If you had to choose between sub or dub I would recommend English sub for the entire franchise and English subtitles for this season. The Japanese cast performance are consistent throughout the entire anime franchise where the English dub stumbles in important areas as it goes on. There’re also some script changes in the English dub that goes against what was originally intended to get across. The English dub isn’t bad with Kent Williams and Jason Liebrecht reprising their roles they excel in portraying. Making the English worth alone for their performances, but they are the only aspects of the English dub that remain strong in every iteration.The soundtrack done compose by Yasushi Ishii this season which forgettable. Like in the four-part Gaiden OVA, the soundtrack is a mixture of rock tracks, techno, and lighter sounding tracks for the more personal moments in the series. None of the tracks stand out on their own without the accompany of visuals. Within the series, it works while simultaneously being forgettable. Instead of strengthening a scene, it just fades into the background. The opening theme “Tsukiakari no Michishirube” by Stereopony is a pop/rock track. Optimistic lyrics  with Aimi Haraguni lack of conviction don’t go hand in hand, but is a decent opening song that works fine for the intro. In spite how the series actually is, it’s a great fit for the intro. Same goes with the ending track “From Dusk Til Dawn” by Abingdon Boys School. “From Dusk Til Dawn” is pop sounding using acoustic guitars and synthesized strings. It starts off soft going to the sounding more melodramatic when it ends.Personal Enjoyment: More entertaining, but not as goodI was more entertained seeing “Ryuusei no Gemini” over the original season since it started with an overarching story and maintained it till completion. It also delivered on the action scenes all which never failed to be a feast for the eyes. However, it was entirely different in tone, pacing, and direction from what season one provided. Everything that made season one great was lost or downgraded in “Ryuusei no Gemini”. Season one characters get sideline, there was allot more pandering, contractors powers got over the top, and the ending wasn’t entirely satisfactory. I wasn’t expecting “Ryuusei no Gemini” to be the way it was, but at the same time I am not upset it did something different (ironically playing it safe) than rehashing itself. Instead of delivering something out of my expectations it deliver it exactly what I expected from it in the first place. For better and worse, it was still an enjoyable ride.Anime Series Overview:In retrospect “Darker Than Black” is an anime series that has something different to offer in each iteration. Season one contains strong writing and great characters. Taking it sweet time before it develops it main cast, but a great first season all the way through. “Darker than Black: Gaiden” four-part OVA offers the best mixture of both season containing the strong writing of season one and the great action scenes of season two. It’s also the most rushed with only four episodes to its story. “Ryuusei no Gemini” is pure entertainment that noticeably panders in order to reach a greater audience. Losing traits that made season one great and in return going in another route succeeding for different reasons. It’s not the follow up one would expect the first season to receive, but has its own strength. I have to sound like a broken record at this point writing about this series multiple times in a single month. If you read all my reviews of this anime series or just this one thank you very much.Story: 2/3Characters: 2/3Production Values: 2/3Personal Enjoyment: 1/1Final Thoughts:Disappointment would be the defining word for this follow up season to “Darker Than Black”. It’s nothing like the first season and all the characters from season one get sideline for a new cast most of which aren’t developed the same degree of one-shot characters in the first season. It’s not quite the follow up some fans might have wanted, but it’s a decent anime through and through. All the characters story arcs get concluded, the action scenes are fast with great choreography, and ends the series on a positive note. Where Darker Than Black ended up with “Ryuusei no Gemini” will be varied when viewers reach the end, but the journey to get there was one thrilling adventure that’s worth taking. best described as unsatisfactory.Oh, there will be minor spoilers. While not intentional and kept vague as possible, it takes place a whole year after the first season of Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Gaiden four part OVA. It’s recommended you avoid this review for that purpose alone. I suggest seeing the previous season and OVA’s before reading or entirely ignoring this review.Good: Different direction and different strengths“Ryuusei no Gemini” from the first episode tells an overarching story. Focusing on two leading characters, Hei and Suou Pavlichenko, each with their own unique storylines. Hei story arc deals with finding Yin while Suou storyline deals more with finding answers about her family and her past. These two characters have different goals allowing the core of the main story to progress smoothly. Providing a different viewpoint from their adventure. How Hei goes about achieving his goal is vastly different to how Suou goes about reaching her goals. Suou goal is more personal vocalizing her thoughts in any situation without hesitation. Understanding how she feels throughout the entire season is plain as day. Hei is more tormented and defeated with his storyline in vein of a redemption story. Attempting to finish what he originally couldn’t because of his emotions.The first season of “Darker Than Black” went for capturing noir and “Ryuusei no Gemini” goes for capturing the action genre. Accomplishing this by having a major revelation or action scene occur in every episode attempting to imitate the effect of a cliffhanger to encourage the viewer to see the next episode immediately. There is rarely ever a moment of safety for the heroes wherever they go. Someone is always behind them chasing them down. Another added inclusion from the change in direction is the material is allowed to show more emotion. Characters in general across more lively in the series without the usual restrictions emotionless contractors are written in.One noticeable difference from “Ryuusei no Gemini” from the rest of the series is the comedy plays a bigger role. Jokes are thrown into every episodes instead of spread out through out the series on special occasions. Its favorite kind of jokes involves everyone confusing Suou for her twin brother. There’s a recurring gag involving Genma Shizume making flirtatious remark at Suou unknowing to him she’s actually a girl. It’s a funny recurring joke since it doesn’t reuse it frequently and offers other forms of humor to keep it varied. Mostly from Mao who despite a change of appearance hasn’t lost his ability for spouting sarcastic remarks.The supporting cast is larger in “Ryuusei no Gemini” getting the short end in characterization. This is very noticeable from the first episode when it decides to bring in characters from the first season only sideline them. Within the first episode, a specific character that had a big role in season one gets killed off quickly. The supporting characters that do influence the story generally don’t have much of a screen presence. Little characterization is mostly to blame resulting in a support cast to be only known for a single a trait. Mina Hazuki is a badass when she’s in combat, but the most memorable aspect about her personality is she’s a lesbian. Genma Shizume is a comedic pervert whose terrible at his job. There is not a single scene when he’s shown doing his competently on the field. Another character is Norio who first appears in episode four with a storyline hinting he would play some important role in the story. Norio is forgotten about past episode six and his time in the series is superfluous in the main story. Some other characters fade into the background because they operate behind the scenes, but never is their influence felt.The ending is a major drawback this season because Suou whole motivation is to find answers. Her arc takes as much time to tell as Hei's does. This gives “Ryuusei no Gemini” a whole different direction of solving mysteries so leaving unanswered questions is a negative. By the time episode twelve finishes despite every bit of information being told to the viewer what happened it won’t turn out satisfactory. Hei is the only character who could serve as the backbone for the entire anime series from beginning to end. Details of what occurred to Hei is left in the open interpretation department which is more than a disappointment given at this point Hei is a strong three dimensional character. Leaving an open ending for Hei journey unlike the rest of the cast members makes it that much more unsatisfying.Mixed: Good Leads, Unwhelming Supporting CastHei in “Ryuusei no Gemini” is at his lowest point in the franchise. Gone is the carefree side of his personality coping with his inner depression with alcohol. He’s frequently serious in nearly every scene which is a change of character for Hei. In general though, Hei doesn’t get much added to him in terms of characterization. However, he does face new conflicts to overcome this season. Hei might not be the same person he was at the start of the franchise, but is still a well written character. He’s smart in situations that require him to think on the spot to survive. Despite how he turned out he does is sympathetic towards other characters, but expresses it differently from before.Mao goes from a wise cat to a flying squirrel who asides from giving some sarcastic remarks and comedic relief has his importance to the story minimize. No longer does Mao gather intel for Hei or his group and instead helps out the heroes directly in small ways. He’s more active on screen sometime blocking people views or being some sort of distraction. Such moments don’t appear often enough to change the fact his importance to the story is not what it use to be. In return, Mao does receive characterization when fans finally get to see how he looked in his human form. It might only last a single episode seeing his past human self for the first time is a treat for fans.Suou Pavlichenko is a red hair, 13 year old Russian girl photographer who becomes a sniper. She plays a major role in the story seeing everything in the world of contractors for the first time, but for any viewer following this anime series in order will already know everything Suou does not. Her character will be more relatable for anyone who has not seen the world of “Darker Than Black” at this point, but adds to seeing first hand the evolution of a human turning into a contractor. She’s a decent character...Studio Bones thought otherwise in how she’s used. In 11 out 12 episodes Suou appears naked at some point or appear in some scene that provides fanservice. Yeah, one entire episode out of twelve doesn’t use Suou in some way to pander to its audience. To name a few instances in the first episode there is a (are they ever not) pointless shower scene, episode three she’s in a cabin drying wet clothes only being cover by a blanket follow by interpreted bad position, in episode four there is Suou dancing which would be fine if it weren’t how that moment was framed, in episode eight swimsuits, and can’t forget the anti-tank rifle summoning sequence (in which Suou appears naked) is always shown in its entirety every time it gets summoned. These are a couple of examples of how the anime treats her which is honestly far worse than anything Hei ever does to Suou in the anime.Like mentioned earlier the supporting cast is larger and some get sidelined. Misaki Kirihara from season gets sideline whose involvement in the story is unneeded. Her role in this season is minimize uncovering a conspiracy behind the scene that doesn’t do add much for the story. What ultimately ends up happening to her in the aftermath of the finale is far more relevant than anything she does before it ends. Due to the length of the anime the characters don’t receive the needed attention to have their own arcs or be fleshed out beyond introduction. Which why the likes of Yoko Sawasaki, Genma Shizume, Mina Hazuki, and Michiru are kept very simplistic from start to finish. The only exceptions to this are Dr. Mikhail Pavlichenko and Shion Pavlichenko because they are connected to Suou storyline. Throughout the series, there are flashbacks that reveal important pieces of information fleshing them out from when the season begins. Once it’s over, Dr. Mikhail and Shion have more to define them unlike the rest of the cast that remains the same.Good: Bones Studio Aces Their AnimationThe animation is done by Bones Studio like the rest of the anime series. Animation in “Ryuusei no Gemini” allows Studio Bones to show off what they can do. Having a more diverse cast in age range compare to the rest of the series. There’s a fair mix of children and adults where previous entries mostly had adult characters. As usual, all characters have unique designs that can be told apart easily even if all the characters hair color were the same. In movement it moves smoothly with no hiccups regardless what’s on screen. Backgrounds once again are detailed, though this time mostly contained in industrialized cities. There’s no environment that is unique to “Ryuusei no Gemini” specifically. However, it does claim the honor of having the best action sequences in the entire series.The action scenes have flashy effect with over the top powers use in battles. There’s no usage of 3D in these action scenes as Studio Bones spares no expense for them. Battles are flashy sporting particle effects of all kind from sparks when two melee weapons hitting each other, to an explosion with intense flames, to anti-tank rifle that pierces through concrete or metal, and whatever effects to its disposal. Episode three has a sequence where a stationed train is hit by another train causing train carts to start flying through the air. It does not use 3D in any frame of that sequence which looks great when seen. Unfortunately there isn’t another sequence in the rest of the series that tops that spectacle, but the other action scenes aren’t any less impressive because of it. Every action scene has a flashy effect unique to that specific action sequence. In one episode it has a character merging with a vehicle manipulating it for combat. Goofy sounding as that description is in execution it’s actually creative while not being a one sided battle.Throughout my reviews for the “Darker Than Black” franchise I always suggested seeing the anime with English subtitles and this season is why. In the English dub, Suou dialogue receives the most alteration of any character changing the tone of several scenes becoming grating to listen too. Alison Viktorin who voices Suou delivers a solid performance, but some of her dialogue does her a disservice making her come across as a little brat. Another factor that prevents her performance from being decent is she doesn’t sound like a thirteen year old. That would be easy to overlook, but she has a few scenes where she has to loudly vocalize her complaints. Due to the English script changes it varies from Suou coming across sympathetic or just wanting to see Hei hit her. As much Alison Viktorin is capable in the role playing off her cast member just fine, the English script gets across something else than originally intended.In the Japanese cast Kana Hanazawa voices Suou who sounds more like a thirteen year old. Her performance is more subtle in vocalizing Suou’s emotion. Unlike Alison Viktorin who voices the same character, Hanazawa comes across as sympathetic with her delivery of the dialogue. She makes Suou sympathetic and likable. The closer the anime gets to the ending the more range Kanazawa is allowed. Her chemistry with her co-stars is spot on especially when together Sawaki Ikuya and Hidenobu Kiuchi coming together naturally.Hearing Kent Williams deep voice coming out of a small Momonga (fancy name for a Japanese dwarf flying squirrel) is quite odd. Like in season one, Kent Williams is spot on with his sarcastic remarks being the most hilarious in the English dub cast. Hearing such a small animal talk in such a deep sounding voice sticks out. In the Japanese cast, Sawaki Ikuya voice never becomes noticeable when playing the same character. While I prefer Kent Williams playing Mao in the series, Sawaki Ikuya has a voice that better blends into the character. Never does Ikuya voice become a distraction making it easier to become immerse with the character.As usual (no surprise) regardless of who is heard both Hidenobu Kiuchi and Jason Liebrecht shine in their portrayal of Hei. The direction of the anime is different, but the changes does not affect how they portray their characters. Both of voice actors retain Hei characteristics managing to make the transition between seasons seem seamless. Creating a performance that works with the changes of the series. There’re no hiccups in how they portray Hei. The supporting cast in both the Japanese and English dub cast play their characters in a straightforward manner. With more comedy, it’s more difficult to distinguish any standout in the supporting cast. Doesn’t really offer much range when half the cast has to deliver comedy.If you had to choose between sub or dub I would recommend English sub for the entire franchise and English subtitles for this season. The Japanese cast performance are consistent throughout the entire anime franchise where the English dub stumbles in important areas as it goes on. There’re also some script changes in the English dub that goes against what was originally intended to get across. The English dub isn’t bad with Kent Williams and Jason Liebrecht reprising their roles they excel in portraying. Making the English worth alone for their performances, but they are the only aspects of the English dub that remain strong in every iteration.The soundtrack done compose by Yasushi Ishii this season which forgettable. Like in the four-part Gaiden OVA, the soundtrack is a mixture of rock tracks, techno, and lighter sounding tracks for the more personal moments in the series. None of the tracks stand out on their own without the accompany of visuals. Within the series, it works while simultaneously being forgettable. Instead of strengthening a scene, it just fades into the background. The opening theme “Tsukiakari no Michishirube” by Stereopony is a pop/rock track. Optimistic lyrics  with Aimi Haraguni lack of conviction don’t go hand in hand, but is a decent opening song that works fine for the intro. In spite how the series actually is, it’s a great fit for the intro. Same goes with the ending track “From Dusk Til Dawn” by Abingdon Boys School. “From Dusk Til Dawn” is pop sounding using acoustic guitars and synthesized strings. It starts off soft going to the sounding more melodramatic when it ends.Personal Enjoyment: More entertaining, but not as goodI was more entertained seeing “Ryuusei no Gemini” over the original season since it started with an overarching story and maintained it till completion. It also delivered on the action scenes all which never failed to be a feast for the eyes. However, it was entirely different in tone, pacing, and direction from what season one provided. Everything that made season one great was lost or downgraded in “Ryuusei no Gemini”. Season one characters get sideline, there was allot more pandering, contractors powers got over the top, and the ending wasn’t entirely satisfactory. I wasn’t expecting “Ryuusei no Gemini” to be the way it was, but at the same time I am not upset it did something different (ironically playing it safe) than rehashing itself. Instead of delivering something out of my expectations it deliver it exactly what I expected from it in the first place. For better and worse, it was still an enjoyable ride.Anime Series Overview:In retrospect “Darker Than Black” is an anime series that has something different to offer in each iteration. Season one contains strong writing and great characters. Taking it sweet time before it develops it main cast, but a great first season all the way through. “Darker than Black: Gaiden” four-part OVA offers the best mixture of both season containing the strong writing of season one and the great action scenes of season two. It’s also the most rushed with only four episodes to its story. “Ryuusei no Gemini” is pure entertainment that noticeably panders in order to reach a greater audience. Losing traits that made season one great and in return going in another route succeeding for different reasons. It’s not the follow up one would expect the first season to receive, but has its own strength. I have to sound like a broken record at this point writing about this series multiple times in a single month. If you read all my reviews of this anime series or just this one thank you very much.Story: 2/3Characters: 2/3Production Values: 2/3Personal Enjoyment: 1/1Final Thoughts:Disappointment would be the defining word for this follow up season to “Darker Than Black”.

If you saw the first season then I don't know how anyone can say this season was just as good or better than the first one.  In my opinion the first one was much better.The story was decent and even though I do have a few complaints about the story it did keep me mostly interested in what was going to happen next.  I wished more things were explained in the story.  I mean yeah I did kind of expect some mystery like in the first season but...come on in this one barely anything was explained.  The only thing that was explained in full was how Mao lost his body.  I just finished watching it and I'm not sure what exactly the ending was all about.  I kind of understand but in the same time I'm still trying to get it all.  When I saw the ending I was like wait what, that is why Suou existed... and yeah I could go on and on about it but I don't want to spoil the ending.  The story was decent since it kept me interested, but to be honest after watching the first season I felt quite disappointed about this story.The characters were kind of disappointing to be honest.  The only character that personality stayed the same was Mao(the squirrel) who used to be a cat and Misaki who is in Section 3 now.  Hei who used to be the lead protagonist in the first one lost his charm.  It is like he got super depressed after the first one.  Maybe being separated from the doll Yin(which is also not explained) has made him all sad.  Even if life did make him depress why is he beating up on children now?  Even though towards the end he does recover some personality it still wasn't the same Hei I liked back in the first season.  Suou who is the lead female protagonist in the story was good.  The only thing I can complain about her was how lame her power was.  Awesome she can make a big gun materialize which she still has to clean and take care of...?I did enjoy watching this for the most part.  Sure there were a few plot holes here and there(even more than the first season) that were never explained and my favorite character Hei is a drunk who beats up on children now I still weirdly enough kept wanting to watch to know what was going to happen.  It wasn't bad but it definitely did not deserve a 10.  Even if you didn't see the first season therefore didn't have to compare it to that one it still wouldn't deserve a 9 or a 10.  In fact it would probably just make you even more confused.Overall I give this a 7 even though in my head it keeps going between a 6 and a 7. come on in this one barely anything was explained.  The only thing that was explained in full was how Mao lost his body.  I just finished watching it and I'm not sure what exactly the ending was all about.

It does not follow the usual two episode arc style, as in the first season. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it transforms into your more stereotypical shounen anime, which might appeal to many. Sadly, I am not one of them. Due to the complete shift in genre, Darker than Black, Gemini of the Meteor is no longer a...slick Ocean’s 11 sort of anime, but rather a more brutal and Contractor version of Karate Kid, with a pro Contractor showing a young one the ropes. The music and animation are on the same plane as last season. However the ending is a tad confusing even after watching the OVA. Those who were absolute devotees of the original DtB should watch it regardless of its transformation to know the fate of their beloved characters. Others keep away![ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]Alright, let me get one thing straight – This is not Darker than Black. Maybe technically it is, but in reality, it is not. This show would’ve been better off being named just “Gemini of the Meteor”. You can almost consider this anime as a completely new one, featuring Contractors and the cast of Darker than BLACK. If you’re looking for the exact same thing you liked in the first season, then this show is not for you.That aside, let’s gets started with the synopsis. It has been two years since Hei destroyed the Saturn System in Hell’s Gate and a LOT of events has occurred after that and before the beginning of season two. To understand all the changes that took place, one has to watch the OVA. But, I recommend you watch the OVA after you’re done with the second season. I’ll give a brief description on what happens in the time gap without giving any spoilers. Yin is separated from Hei. Hei is a bearded drunkard who works for the CIA. Misaki is fired from her old job and hired in an organization called Section 3, which is made up of Contractors. Oh, and one last thing – Hei is no longer a Contractor.In Dtb:GoM, you follow Suou, a Russian girl who speaks Japanese. I suppose that makes her a Eurasian, but whatever. Young Suou is a normal girl, who goes to school and lives with her father in the mountain. However, her brother is kept a secret from the world as he is a Contractor and in Russia, all Contractors must be enrolled in the army. One day, her life is turned upside down when her best friend turns into a Contractor and Hei appears at Suou’s house. She is then chased by nearly eight contractors and the Soviet army, yet she manages to escape from them all. If every little girl can get past the Soviet army, I really don’t know why they’re called a superpower. Anyway, moving on, Hei and Suou unite and thus begins their journey to go to Japan. The pacing is overall, good, but if you start watching this season immediately after the previous one, you might find it a bit confusing as you would be used to the bi episodic arcs. GoM contains only 1 storyline, which spans 12 episodes. And this storyline does not involve any undercover work, womanizer Li or well-defined side characters. And this is why I said this season is nothing like the previous. But that is not to say it is a bad anime. In fact, it is very entertaining. Once you get over your initial disappointment, you will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The plot is actually good and it has enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. There are some moments when you honestly go “Whoa, I did not see that coming…” and that is proof that the script is very strong. Although the second season was very different from the first, it did have one similarity, DtB’s trump card – the emotional connection. You are able to truly feel the character’s emotions and this one factor is enough to propel you from the first to the last episode of the series.As I mentioned earlier in the short review, there are no major improvements in the visual department, which is still not a setback as the first season boasted one of the best graphics.Music is once again solid, with a few more sentimental and soft tracks added. This was a really neat addition as it helps emphasize Suou’s loneliness beautifully. The OP was a great track, with a good beat and definitely worth listening to every time. The ED on the other hand was very generic and doesn’t deserve and special credit. The voice actors have done a solid job, especially Suou’s.Now, as far characters are concerned, Hei has undergone a major change. He’s grown his hair out, got a beard and has a bottle of sake (alcohol) glued to his hand. When he decides to take Suou under his wing, he trains her using a remarkable method – If she doesn’t get it right, smack her in the head till she does. Simple isn’t it? (And this “unique” training method was the reason I compared it to Karate Kid). The character development for both is very typical tsundere. Basically, if you like shonen, it’s difficult to go wrong with this anime.The Bottom-line:Darker than Black:Gemini of the Meteor is a highly enjoyable anime if you just forgive the generic characters and shonen transformation.(P.S – MILD SPOILER AHEAD – The animation clip of Suou using her ability is an absolute DISGRACE to the slickness of the franchise. I found myself banging my head on the wall every time the anti-tank rifle stuck out of the semi naked kid.) slick Ocean’s 11 sort of anime, but rather a more brutal and Contractor version of Karate Kid, with a pro Contractor showing a young one the ropes.

While this is just as good as the last season, it is different. I cannot stress that enough, and for some it will be a deal breaker.EDIT: After complaints I decided to expand this review. I'll put out spoiler alerts if they come up.Story: Excellent, it seems to be a character driven story, and the characters are excellent. The problem is if you don't care for a certain character, then you don't care for the story, so you have to be invested in the story. That being said, somehow, even a character...that I was annoyed with, just like the protagonist actually made my eyes tear up with the excellent direction, voice acting and overall execution.In this story, there are special people called contractors. They're called that because they lack emotion, think logically for themselves, can use superpowers, but at a price. They might have to break a finger, or bake a cake. Hei is an interesting character that you'll care a lot more about later on, even though at first you think he's an absolute jerk, which he basically is.Art: Also excellent, the scenes are even better than the first season which is a definite plus, although, I wasn't terribly fond of the CGI bugs. Whenever there's a fight, everything is fluid and drawn very well. There isn't any sort of exaggerated physics except in some close up deaths, which is more for a shock factor.Sound: Excellent, I liked the English voice overs, although it should be noted that most of the time characters talk in monotone because they're contractors or they're trying to explain something in the same about of talking space as the Japanese version. Still, when something emotional happens, just like the last season, you can feel it in their voice.Character: Perfect. I cannot stress this enough, there is so much character development, even in one episode. The writers did an outstanding job.Enjoyment: Perfect. I've watched it over and over again. I really would love a Season 3.Overall: I'm giving it 9/10 because while I absolutely love it and would rate it 10/10 personally, it is closer to a 9/10 simply because some people will find the story unsatisfying with how it ends. that I was annoyed with, just like the protagonist actually made my eyes tear up with the excellent direction, voice acting and overall execution.In this story, there are special people called contractors. They're called that because they lack emotion, think logically for themselves, can use superpowers, but at a price. They might have to break a finger, or bake a cake. Hei is an interesting character that you'll care a lot more about later on, even though at first you think he's an absolute jerk, which he basically is.Art: Also excellent, the scenes are even better than the first season which is a definite plus, although, I wasn't terribly fond of the CGI bugs. Whenever there's a fight, everything is fluid and drawn very well. There isn't any sort of exaggerated physics except in some close up deaths, which is more for a shock factor.Sound: Excellent, I liked the English voice overs, although it should be noted that most of the time characters talk in monotone because they're contractors or they're trying to explain something in the same about of talking space as the Japanese version. Still, when something emotional happens, just like the last season, you can feel it in their voice.Character: Perfect.

The twists in the story is enjoyable while still maintaining the viewer's hunger to watch for more. One thing about the Anime is that you can never cease to be amazed how superb the animation was done.The story takes place after the first season which is more like a continuation of the original series. If you haven't seen season one yet - i strongly suggest you first watch the first season before continuing to read this review.The opening and ending tracks of the anime were also a notable feature in the series...itself wherein other anime don't really give much concern about how the intro and ending soundtracks will affect the anime throughout.The new characters to the season has a major role in the series, more like a big plot twister. I deeply enjoyed the new characters altogether and the thing with the syndicate was far most the less intrigueing part of the Series.I hope you guys will enjoy the Anime as well as i did and yet again I can say that it will be one of your best time spent on watching this! itself wherein other anime don't really give much concern about how the intro and ending soundtracks will affect the anime throughout.The new characters to the season has a major role in the series, more like a big plot twister.

I also made it so that this review contains the least amount of spoilers possible.After watching the first 2 episodes I was instantly hooked on Darker than Black. It\'s totally a great amine, and would probably be up in the top 10 after done airing.If you haven\'t seen Darker than Black yet then I highly recommend it. I usually watch drama/romance anime but this got me, this got me good. Darker than Black bases off of these special people named contractors, and yes these...type of people like in most anime have special abilities, but this is where it becomes different and unique; the contractors have to use remuneration, or something that has to be done to use these so called contractor powers, this could range from making origami to ripping the hell out of your hair.Another thing I love about this anime is how they add in little details like when a meteor falls a contractor supposedly dies. This is not the case with the main character though (watch anime, trying not to spoil), even when he loses his meteor he still lives. Other details would be: flashbacks giving information in the gap between the first and second season, changes to the characters because of factors from the first season, and making more of an emphasis on ""remuneration.""Now the sound in Darker than black is superb! The opening tells a story in itself, it basically tries to input the message that when you become a contractor everything that you have, your dreams, and everyone that you hold dear will be lost, and that you have to keep moving forward. You will find this true within the anime as you progress through. The background music in the anime fit it very well, it was fast paced and complimented the action greatly. The voice actors fit each and everyone of their characters and are acted out very well. The only thing I had disagreement on sound was that the ending had pretty much almost nothing to do with the anime.The art has also improved a considerable amount. In season one of this anime the effects were great and artwork was well done. Now in season two of Darker than Black, the artwork has been given more detail; effects being notched up, lighting and shading more present especially in the effects, and even a 3D perspective is added in.Now the characters in the anime change drastically from season one. This is most likely from the problems aroused from season one. You see big changes from the main characters. One of them transitions from a cold-blooded killer working for a syndicate, to being a alcoholic working for the government. Other major character developments are that innocent people became involved and actually became the once normal living people into emotionless contractors.Overall I enjoyed this anime and gave it a 9. The originality, art, and the new ideas coming from this anime convinced me to give it a 9. Hopefully by the end of this season (which I don\'t want this anime to ever end), I will go over this review again and most likely give it a 10 if this anime keeps impressing me. type of people like in most anime have special abilities, but this is where it becomes different and unique; the contractors have to use remuneration, or something that has to be done to use these so called contractor powers, this could range from making origami to ripping the hell out of your hair.Another thing I love about this anime is how they add in little details like when a meteor falls a contractor supposedly dies.

The second season made Hei  a drunk and a lot less of a badass in my opinion. The story was confusing and boring, it made Mao a freaking squirrel, and brought us Suou, a really annoying girl with a really dumb contractor ability. The only reason i probably finished this anime was b/c it was darker than black and i decided to keep going to see if got any better but it didnt,...Would not reccomend to anyone even if you did enjoy the first season.

Hei encounters Suou Pavlichenko the protagonist of the story and protects her because he wants to get to Shion Pavlichenko, her twin brother. Suou soon becomes a contractor. You follow Suou on her transition into being a contractor and how she tries to come to terms on learning her life is...forever changed and dangerous.

Just a violent drunk child abusing hobo. Suou? A brat. Mao? An annoying squirrel; he barely even features in the story. How did he even survive anyway? He was supposed to have died in Season 1. Yin? Now a suicidal godlike being. I never liked Misaki anyway, she became...obsessed with this one random guy for no apparent reason. It\'s like she has no life outside of chasing Hei.

Other reviewers have hashed out just how terrible the plot is, this is here to tell you DTB season 2 might as well be called anther show.Following Darker than Black season 1 my reaction to this show was ""what the **** did I just walk into?"" The first season of the show established a paranormal world with a gritty undercurrent of syndicates, corporations and political alliances. There were assassins and undercover operations and some wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff. Okay, that\'s cool. But primarily the first season of the show was SERIOUS.DTB season 2 is NOT...SERIOUS. There is a magical girl transformation scene that is in the first episode. The animation studio spent a budget on this and decided that hot damn they were going to make use of this underage bait fanservice, and proceeded to use the FULL transformation sequence every single time the main character decides to use her ability. Other contractors blatantly yell out their powers like they\'re in a half baked shounen show. This is so far removed from what the first season did, it\'s entirely like just firing up a completely different anime.The characterization is dreadful. Returning characters from season 1 are either unfaithful to themselves or are just inconsistent messes. The new characters are boring and hard to take seriously because of magical bullshit.Can\'t really complain about the art or sound, but it\'s obviously not improved from the first season. Oh but the transformation sequence is baller though. They blew their load on animating the **** out of that, and then didn\'t do any other touch ups to the art style.Overall this show feels like the mother of season 1 ran off with Sailor Moon and Naruto, got impregnated by them, and came back and had season 2. They may share a surname, but from the first look (episode 1) you can tell they\'re not really related.Avoid if you like DTB season 1 at all. SERIOUS.

Oh and I loved the opening, just so you know...Characters were pretty good, but they don\'t explain themselves well... Why was Hei a drunkard? Does it fit his character?

It was entertaining, had a good story and enjoyable characters.Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini is enjoyable as well, but not as enjoyable as the first season. It feels like a completely different series. Like someone has taken the characters from Darker than Black and put them into a different Tv show.  So I will list some pros and cons of this series.Pros1. The action is good and Hei still kicks ass.2. The story is good and quite interesting. Quite different from Darker than Black but still enjoyable.3....The characters are quite well done, the new ones and old ones.4. I really liked the intro and outro music, this is just personal taste here but it is really good and fits nicely with this series.Cons1. There isn't that much action, and what little action there is, is over quite quickly. Now I'm not saying there should be non stop action, but the fight scenes they did have could have easily been dragged out a bit to make them more exciting.2. The story was confusing as hell for me. Now this comes down to a fault of my own, I didn't watch the OVAs that connect Darker than Black with this series. So because of that I was very confused in a lot of parts and couldn't quite figure out what was going on. So anyone reading this, watch the OVAs otherwise you won;t have a clue what is really happening.3. It was really nothing like the first Darker than Black, which I mentioned above. So anyone who is a real diehard fan of the first season might not like this one as much, though casual watches will enjoy it. I'm not saying fans of the show will hate it, but don't go into it expecting it to be the same as Darker than Black.4. Since I didn't watch the OVAs this series felt a bit to short for me and could maybe have been a couple episodes longer. Because of the shortness of it, you don't really care as much for the side characters in it.In conclusion, this was still an enjoyable anime. It had some really great moments in it and is a good anime to watch when you have a day off and just want to chill out. Even if you forget to watch the OVAs like me it's still pretty good, just a lot more confusing. The characters are quite well done, the new ones and old ones.4.

I made an account just so i could whine about how dissatisfied i was with this follow up series. To avoid spoiling anything ill just talk about this in a very critical way. The first season had a episodic type feel (2 episode arcs) and that worked well for its story telling. This season moved away from it and had a full continuing story that revolved around a new character. I was annoyed by this child that i wanted to stop watching, im not sure what her character was suppose to represent but it didnt add any depth at all to the themes...darker than black had in the first part. I probably can troll on and on about how much i disliked the presentation of the plot but to culminate all that, it ends on a very confusing, abrupt manner. The style and art was like the first so i dug it. The fights and inventive powers the contractors had are always cool, but the centralized story wasnt developed enough for me to give a rats arse. I hear they are making 4 ovas about WTF happened before, but i would have wished they had shown those things before instead of after. Too many questions unanswered with too many loose ends to have my satisfaction. I hope they make another series and instead of killing off the entire cast from before build on them and make the story have more depth and feel. darker than black had in the first part.

It is very hard for me to choose a favorite, but if forced to pick just one, it would be Darker than Black. Every aspect of it is tightly woven to create this incredible tapestry of imaginative concepts, enjoyable characters, heady philosophies, mystery and suspense, beautiful art, emotional music, and most of all the story has a very deep, important and relevant message to deliver to viewers about society and the consequences of treating minority groups as subhuman and unequal. There is immense social value to the story outside of just...entertainment and art.Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor takes everything beautifully crafted by the first season and smashes it with a mallet. Unfortunately it does not find its way back together to form a cohesive story. The returning characters from the first series are portrayed in ways completely counter to everything that\'s been set up for them in the first season and there is no believable reason for it. It actually destroys some of the characters\' images so badly they are no longer likable in the full context of the story, despite they were incredibly enjoyable characters in the first series. For example some have gone from caring individuals to abusive degenerates. Not to mention some characters who we were glad to see make it through the first series get expelled quite unceremoniously from the second, which is really disappointing, while some characters whose fates were hinted to be somewhat conclusive in the first series are brought back, making their story arc climaxes in the first season seem meaningless or much less effective.For the most part, the abilities of the contractors are far less imaginative in Gemini and border on cliche. As for the story, it is boring, trite and convoluted, with an ending that seems random, makes no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions. There are some very unsettling themes such as child abuse and pedophilia, and when you see such potentially harmful themes in storytelling, it\'s important for the writer to handle them tactfully and clarify the significance of them in the context of the story. There\'s really no tact or significance to be seen here. It seems careless and thrown together.If you want to know the positive things about this series (there are so few), some of the action scenes and fights are entertaining to watch. Seeing returning characters can be fun for a moment but watching where the writer has the audacity to push their storylines quickly becomes disappointing. My favorite part of most episodes was the ending credits because of the beautiful song ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" by Abingdon Boy\'s School (who sang the opener ""Howling"" in the first season). It\'s one of the few things in the series that invokes enjoyable emotions or a sense of beauty, sadly. I had a bad feeling when I saw that Yoko Kanno would not be scoring this series. She only signs on to quality projects, as far as I\'ve seen. I knew that either the budget or time constraints of Gemini of the Meteor had likely prevented it from being able to achieve anything like what the first series did before I even saw it. Shame I was correct. I don\'t know if Kanno was offered and declined the role as composer, or if she was out of the budget altogether.My biggest warning to those who have seen the first season and loved it and are considering seeing the second is this: If you watch this show, a lot of what you will see will go against what you saw in the first show and will warp your perception of events in the first show, potentially harming the experience next time you watch the first season. For many viewers, myself included, it is sort of a slap in the face. I have trouble believing that the same writer wrote both shows because the first is so evocative and intelligent, while the second attempts to convert the series into a magical girl anime and is riddled with controversial fan service that deconstructs the first series in quite unwelcome ways. The first series was a self-contained story that needed no expanding upon, so to even create a sequel risks a lot. It\'d be like a sequel to Cowboy Bebop, which if I\'m not mistaken, the creator of the series actually said the reason he wasn\'t interested in a sequel to that show is that it is better to leave people wanting more and quit while you\'re ahead.I watched Gemini of the Meteor before ever hearing any opinions about it from other people or reviews, so I had no idea whether or not it was well-received when I watched it. My opinion emerged independently from that, and while it is disheartening in a way to know so many find it genuinely poor quality, I\'m glad in a way that so many others can see how awful this anime really is because it gives me hope that the integrity of quality storytelling like we saw in the first series is valued and defensible among the anime community. Sadly, Gemini of the Meteor really manages to take the humanity out of Darker than Black, and if you ask me the humanity of the first season\'s story is the most important thematic element that gave the series it\'s freshness and substance. entertainment and art.Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor takes everything beautifully crafted by the first season and smashes it with a mallet. Unfortunately it does not find its way back together to form a cohesive story. The returning characters from the first series are portrayed in ways completely counter to everything that\'s been set up for them in the first season and there is no believable reason for it. It actually destroys some of the characters\' images so badly they are no longer likable in the full context of the story, despite they were incredibly enjoyable characters in the first series. For example some have gone from caring individuals to abusive degenerates. Not to mention some characters who we were glad to see make it through the first series get expelled quite unceremoniously from the second, which is really disappointing, while some characters whose fates were hinted to be somewhat conclusive in the first series are brought back, making their story arc climaxes in the first season seem meaningless or much less effective.For the most part, the abilities of the contractors are far less imaginative in Gemini and border on cliche. As for the story, it is boring, trite and convoluted, with an ending that seems random, makes no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions. There are some very unsettling themes such as child abuse and pedophilia, and when you see such potentially harmful themes in storytelling, it\'s important for the writer to handle them tactfully and clarify the significance of them in the context of the story. There\'s really no tact or significance to be seen here. It seems careless and thrown together.If you want to know the positive things about this series (there are so few), some of the action scenes and fights are entertaining to watch. Seeing returning characters can be fun for a moment but watching where the writer has the audacity to push their storylines quickly becomes disappointing. My favorite part of most episodes was the ending credits because of the beautiful song ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" by Abingdon Boy\'s School (who sang the opener ""Howling"" in the first season). It\'s one of the few things in the series that invokes enjoyable emotions or a sense of beauty, sadly. I had a bad feeling when I saw that Yoko Kanno would not be scoring this series. She only signs on to quality projects, as far as I\'ve seen. I knew that either the budget or time constraints of Gemini of the Meteor had likely prevented it from being able to achieve anything like what the first series did before I even saw it. Shame I was correct. I don\'t know if Kanno was offered and declined the role as composer, or if she was out of the budget altogether.My biggest warning to those who have seen the first season and loved it and are considering seeing the second is this: If you watch this show, a lot of what you will see will go against what you saw in the first show and will warp your perception of events in the first show, potentially harming the experience next time you watch the first season.

What I\'m trying to say is that these reviews are biased.In my opinion, I think that everyone, after watching DtB:RnG, should just let everything sink in for a couple of days and then write a review. This is because everyone should seriously admire the beauty of DtB:RnG because for a 12-episode season, it was seriously in depth and captivating.Trust me, I liked the first season of DtB WAY better than the 2nd, and I want a 3rd season as much...as the next guy. However, I can see how good the 2nd season was and why BONES wished to end it here.Story:The story of DtB:RnG takes place a few years after DtB did and now it is about Hei trying to stop Yin from awakening and letting the ""Izanami"" come out. The storyline for this was great except it raised a few questions. One question for example is: Why is Yin the doll that becomes Izanami? Why can\'t it be literally any other doll out there? If the story really is following the Izanami/Izanagi Myth(Mitaka documents), who is Izanagi? Who is Katsuguchi? Other than this, the storyline was well thought out and it did well enough for to entertain the DtB fans and inspired them to keep watching.Art:The artwork took a HUGE turn because it was WAY better than the first DtB. The sinister/dark/gloomy look of Russia and Tokyo were good, but not great.Sound:The soundtracks especially the ending credits were good. However at times I found myself giggling at how ""immature"" the music was when someone was talking/when a serious scene was going on.Character:Ah, this raised the most criticism in DtB:RnG. Now instead of Hei/Yin being the main protagonists, a new Russian girl by the name of Suou is the MC. When I first knew about this, i was furious. I almost dropped the anime. However I\'m glad that I didnt because only for the first like 2 episodes it only focuses on Suou. After about 2 episodes, you completely forget that Suou is the main character because Hei gets as much screentime as an MC should be getting. I personally really liked Suou because as a 13-15 year old, she was strong and tough as nails to be getting along with the new Hei. Even in depressing situations she never seemed to give up and she was always strong. On the other hand, even though most people HATED the new Hei, I really liked him. The new bum-drunkard Hei is still the same Hei in the end except he becomes a more harsh, unshaven, long hair-dont care Hei. This didn\'t bother me because lets think for a moment. Hei lost most of the things he ever had in the 1st season of DtB. Now in the 2nd season, Hei lost  the only thing he had left: Yin. It makes sense that he would become a depressed bum after literally losing everything he ever had. However, as the time goes on in DtB:RnG, the relationship that Hei and Suou develop is beautiful and its mainly because of Suou that Hei slowly reverts into the Hei that we know and love.Enjoyment:Overall, DtB:RnG was very pleasing to me. Even though the usual feel of DtB is gone, DtB:RnG still maintains the strong characteristics that DtB had.Overall:In the end, this anime, if given time to understand it, was great. The possibility of BONES producing a 3rd season is close to 0 since it has been 5 years since DtB:RnG was produced, and the ending of DtB:RnG was very satisfying because it ended in a way for the viewers to interpret the future however way they want to. as the next guy.

I don\'t know what the author was thinking when they thought of giving us the future then hey don\'t worry there\'s 4 OVA episodes that\'ll come soon and it\'ll explain the confusion. Well that doesn\'t always work. I understand that it is exciting when you show the results then you go back on show how everything led to this result but YOU DON\'T DO IT FOR A WHOLE SEASON!!!!Overall I don\'t really want to say the second season was disappointing but rather confusingly disappointing. They made this season so gloomy and changed the characters personality 180 without really giving a good reason and then at the end it was like hey remember Yin the one you was wondering where the hell she was in the whole season well shes...bad??DTB was one of my fav animes and the second season really screwed it over but It\'s hard to admit that since it is a good anime overall. To anyone who watched the first season I advise you watch the in-between season before you watch the second season so the level of frustrating would hopefully be less. in your thoughts like how there are some characters that are missing and no one mentions them and how the hell is this related to the first season??unfortunately my friend this season will leave you with far more questions than answers. especially the ending.

The music is once again absolutely brilliant and the animation is quitre strong.The ending was a little bit confusing and unsatisfying for me.

But I think they are wrong and this season is truly great after the 4 OVAs was released. Bones made a risky move with this show: first they gave us a vague and messy show and then they give explanations.Story: 8There are 2 parallel stories in this show: The adventure of Suou and the story of Hei searching for Yin.

There are only a few contractors, but their powers are interesting and cool, like Mizuki\'s energy saber or the Magician\'s true magic...

Then... images of 13-year old girls started cropping up, later it was revealed that one of these teenage girls would be featured in the series as a main character. Personly, Suou, her twin brother and her friends ruined the whole season for me.Whether Bones found out that teenage girls, like myself, who hacked their parental controls and faked their age to watch the first season, then thought that because teenage girls like the series better than the males for whom the anime was originally made...for that they would actually put silly little girls in a violent assassin/cop science-fiction anime. The reasons why so many girls watched the series is because it wasn't made for them, they didn't want to see a bunch of jolly femnale teenagers go depressed, if they wanted that they only had to watch some shoujou anime, not a shouen.The season disapointed me, but I still watch it, good God I own it on DVD. I enjoy watching it, though I would much rather watch the first season. There were points in the 12 epsiode season where I really, really enjoyed watching it, mainly, they were the episodes of momment that had a lack of young females, but there was even scenes with then I liked.Story.When I first read about Darker Than Black season two I thought that it would explain more about Hei and his mysterious life in South America with Amber and Pai before Heaven's war. However, we never actually found out more about that matter, which, of course, disapointed me.Still I like the idea of organisations at war with each other, which what Darker Than Black is mostly about, first season and second season. The mystery in the series always kept me on the edge of my seat every time I watched it for the first time.Art.The art and animation was brilliant as most animes from Bones are. The anime has high quaity animation and art without doubt.Sound.The voice acting was good in the Japanese versions, but the first season was dubbed by Funimation (like most of Studio Bones anime are), which probably means that the second season will be poorly dubbed by them too. Such a shame.The music featured in the anime was good, yet the two songs that were in the opening and ending I disliked. But hey, we're all entitled to our own say.Character.Well, some of the characters changed a lot, most Hei, who turns from an assissin bishouen to a drunk and homeless tramp. By the  second episode I wanted to reach out into the animation and cut off his pony tail, it just annoyed me so much.Characters like Suou and her friends, being typical defenseless character irritated me as they could never stick up for themselves. Except for Suou and her brother, who seemed to kill anyone who got in their way them ran back crying to either Hei or their father.Enjoyment.Okay, so after all my ranting about the season, I still enjoyed it very much so.

The ending of the first season was sort of messed up I was SO happy to hear it was coming back  BUT...I saw the first episode and i thought, ""What the heck? What\'s up with hei? Why\'s Suou the main character? What the hell\'s going on? I don\'t like this.""And then I watched the 2nd episode, 3rd episode, 4th episode, which is all that\'s been aired and I must say, it is as good as the first season. There are a lot of mysteries to be solved yes, but the action scenes are amazing,...Suou\'s not bad and the new contractors are SO KICK ASS.Since it IS DtB, so far the plot has a lot of loose ends, but its still excellent and I know that as the show goes on, we have loads more in store.The opening and ending are very nice, the seiyuus are brilliant, the animation is pretty good, it has interesting characters though compared to the first season, a bit more flamboyant, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch the episode.If you haven\'t watched Darker than black, go SEE IT NOW.If you have but haven\'t started with this season, SEE IT NOW XDOverall: 10.

The original Darker Than Black series was phenomenal, they used an intuitive way of telling a story though a bi-episodic manner (bar the last few episodes), but apparently a standard over-arcing storyline using a singular episodic structure reigns supreme. It would be ignorant and stupid to say that a bi-episodic structure is what would have made this a good series, as this specific story just couldn't be told in that way. Still, the fact remains that they decided on removing what, in my opinion, was one of the key features that made Darker Than Black a fantastic series....I'd like to mention at this point that I only saw the first two episodes before I had enough and dropped it, so don't bother reading the rest if you don't think my opinion is 'valid'.Phew, okay, second point. Hei. In this series they creators seemed to think that Hei's character is something that people wouldn't mind being moulded to suit a certain situation. We see Hei in episode 1(?) talking to a member of the FBI getting work or something similar from him. This angered me because why the hell would Hei work for the FBI, it just isn't coherent from the last series. After Hei's removal from the Syndicate in the last series I would have expected him to go freelance or anything but work with the FBI. It's like if he worked with MI5, it just wouldn't (and shouldn't) happen, why? Because it's just not something that is coherent or easily justifiable. Also, giving away as minimal spoilers as possible, messing with a main character like they did at the end of episode 2 is just, dumb, illogical, and an insult to fans.I don't want to end on a bad note when it comes to something Darker Than Black related as the first season is something I love and recommend regularly to people, so I'll talk about what I liked about the series (or, at least, what I saw of it). They managed to keep a magnificent art style to the series with very fluid animation, and they upheld a reputation of providing exceptional opening and ending themes. What was also good is the fact that they left a lot things in the first two episodes that could have had a huge impact later on in the series providing a 'Woah, that was fucking cool' feeling in audience members.So, I'll conclude by saying that this series demonstrated more reasons as to why this is the biggest disappointment to Darker Than Black fans in the first two episodes than reasons as to why this is worth actually watching. I'll try Darker Than Black: Gaiden to see if this franchise has redeemed itself.

To start the story was about a little girl becoming a contractor she either puts up with getting slapped around by our main leading character or staked by lolicons, so child abuse seems to be the general aspect of this story and Hei being betrayed as a drunk child beater ticks me off, he's my favorite character! The story dragged through pointless crap, got to the point where I justed started skipping through it.  I honestly don't know what they were thinking this new...girl was just annoying. girl was just annoying."", ""Review on rewatch. S02 of Darker than Black exists only to show us to be careful what we wish for when we ask for another season of something good. The world would be better off without this. It takes the most interesting and cool character of the first season (Hei), neuters him, gives him alcoholism as a cheap has-been trope, then focuses on a new character nobody cares about. Everything that was interesting about the first season, from the noir vibe, to scifi intrigue, to funny or gripping side characters -- all this goes out the window with terrible writing.This stands right up there...with Haruhi Suzumiya's Endless 8 as far as biggest middle finger to the fanbase goes. If you want more of what makes the first season interesting, I'd try Psycho Pass or something else. S01 would've been better off as a standalone, including the OVAs which just open the door to the nonsense of S02. with Haruhi Suzumiya's Endless 8 as far as biggest middle finger to the fanbase goes.

I don't there's any issue with that however, due to the fact that there's no reason anyone should be watching the second season first, and because there's quite some differences compared to the first season.Where the original series got to drag on at leisure with it's episodic structure, having very little progress at all for most of it's run, the this series was only half the...original's length and had to stick to a strict timetable to be able to tell it's story. Where the first season could develop a great array of good characters with detailed backstories due to this, the second season by comparison was able to create better main characters due to their development with the main story, but the side characters for the most part were left very unfinished and were offered absolutely no closure on.Overall I greatly preferred the structure and main characters of the second season and due to that found it even more interesting to watch than the first season I already liked plenty. I believe the short length of the season prevented it from reaching it's potential, and especially the ending was highly unsatisfactory.I liked how the series established a good number of strong characters right from the beginning, and did so through showing their personalities in action. This is an improvement over the first season and a necessary one at that. Due to not having the luxury to create in depth backstories for every character like in the first season they had to make strong first impressions to establish them instead - it's also arguably just a superior way to introduce characters, period.This lead to some unfortunate consequences also, however. The characters were introduced perhaps even too fast, stealing the focus from each other frantically all over the first episodes. This was another consequence of the short length, presumably, as was the fact that most of these side characters ended up receiving no development at all despite being at times very important to the story. A good number of them ended up dying off surprisingly quickly, used seemingly just to develop the main characters, while the others were completely forgotten. In the end, I think a lot of them should have been ditched completely to create an even more focused experience.What this resulted to was establishing the actual main characters even better, making them more interesting - if not likeable - right from episode 1, compared to the first season where they all had long arcs to establish them but barely actually developed at all. This set up a very good ground to build their bonds between each other, which were the driving forces of the entire plot. This is probably the best part of the entire anime, the fantastic development of the characters in the middle episodes of the season.Sadly none of the characters received what they deserved with the end of the season. Most of them were simply forgotten completely in favor of trying to desperately wrap up a decent ending. What the main characters got in turn were was some incredibly vague and surreal garbage that starkly contrasted what had been established of the world thus far. While the supernatural is an important part of the story, the general feel of the series is also focused on cold hard reality in which the characters live in. I have similar conclusions on the first season, but the incompleteness made it even worse in this case.Again, there's no way around the fact that the series needed more episodes. The ending was incredibly rushed, but even beyond that the series is missing many important parts. The side characters were left husks despite strong characterization, the main plot was very vague and ended as soon at it was established, and a lot of the attention to detail that was present in the first season is gone now, due to the simple lack of screen time.The production of the show was all around good, and overall even better than the first show. It did however lack a lot of the attetion to detail that made the first season so interesting, as well as the humor was almost completely gone - probably since it didn't fit the tone of the story as well.In conclusion, I really liked the show. Thinking as a whole, I think the first season was a way more satisfactory and complete viewing experience, but I honestly think the second season showed a lot more talent on the writers' part at least. The original was entertaining, something I'd watch when bored, but the focused experience and interesting characters of the second season really grabbed me, compelling me to watch it all in one go, always wanting to find out what happened next. Sadly the conclusion was less than satisfactory. I'd say it's about as good as the first season, with both lower ilows and higher highs, and overall being more to my liking in style. original's length and had to stick to a strict timetable to be able to tell it's story.

I had mixed prejudices about this anime before i watched it, i read some reviews saying it was so poor in comparison with the first series, but at the same time i couldnt wait to watch the sequel as the first series was so brilliant.  I purposefully waited a while before watching the second series because i knew i would make too many comparisons if i didnt.  I have judged this anime in its own right, it would score lower if i was rating it as a sequel.Story - 7 - I really loved...this story, it wasnt necessarily the sequel to series one as it didnt pick up where the old one left off and revolved around a completely different story.  However i thought it was a great story arc with the exception of the ending which i feel fell into place a little to brutally and didnt make complete sense.  That aside it was fantasticly compelling :DArt - 7 - Maybe a bit generous on the art mark, its pretty generic stuff nothing spectacular but what i love about these series is if you're paying enough attention you see logo's of real companies all over the place woven into the scenes.  (Look out for the Sony laptop)Sound - 9 - OP and ED were great, Abingdon Boys School impressed me yet againCharacter - 8 - Some awesome new characters as well as new sides and developments of old characters.  I really empathised with the main character Suou, not because I necessarily knew how she felt but because as characters go she was well crafted. I dont want to go into too much detail for spoiler reasons but some of the development of old characters was interesting and horrifying at the same time.  Cant wait for season 3 to build on all of this.Enjoyment - 10 - As i left DTB alone after season 1 to avoid being overly critical of this series i can honestly i thoroughly enjoyed it.  It makes a great stand alone story in its own right so long as you dont have too many expectationsOverall - 8 - I said at the begining that this was based on Ryuusei no Gemini alone and i have to say its a great series on all aspects so long as your expectations arent too high this story, it wasnt necessarily the sequel to series one as it didnt pick up where the old one left off and revolved around a completely different story.

Even that very word is foreign to me.""A Review of ""Darker Than BLACK: Ryuusei no Gemini"":So, I assume any interest in this show comes from having watched the first season already, so I\'m doing this review on the basis that you\'ve seen Kuro no Keiyakusha.So this show feels like a very good continuation of the Darker Than BLACK series, and yet, it feels entirely unique all the same. That\'s not because the main characters are shifted around or because this season is half as long, but it genuinely feels different in overall tone. However, some things remain the same, such as some bland...characters and crucial parts of the story not being explained well (which were the two things that greatly plagued the first season). That being said, the story, in my opinion, was much better than season one. It\'s not that season 1\'s episodic format and mini-arcs were bad, but having one continuous story feels like it fits the story of Darker Than BLACK much better.Lots of characters from season one make a reappearance and they\'re essentially the same, and the new characters honestly don\'t bring that much to the show, except for the new main, Suou, who is pretty much the driving force behind the show.Sound and animation are very similar to season one, as they definitely should be, with the soundtrack adding a lot to the story (though I don\'t consider it nearly as good as the first season\'s) and the animation being very dark and atmospheric, though it does feel SLIGHTLY brighter, but that\'s probably due to a lot of the show taking place in snowy territory.Overall, Gemini of the Meteor is a competent second season that fits the first very well, being both radically different and very similar. It does suffer from the same things as season one, but it does so to a lesser degree and it works very well.Positives:+The opening theme ""Tsukiakari no Machishirube"" is PERFECT and instantly became one of my top favorites+Interesting story that develops heavily off of season one+Sound and animation are solid throughout+Some characters, such as Suou, really drive the show and make it more interesting+Quality show from start to finish, unlike season one which took some time to get used toNegatives:-The ending was completely unexplained and confusing-Lots of characters are dull and uninspired-Half the length of the first season, which wouldn\'t be bad if the ending didn\'t feel so rushedIf you enjoyed season one of Darker Than Black, you may very well enjoy this season. Then again, you may not, as both season feel different in very prominent ways. The only thing I can say about this show is to give it a shot, because whether or not you liked season one, you may enjoy this season. I don\'t know; it\'s really 50/50.And that\'s why Darker Than BLACK: Ryuusei no Gemini gets a 7 out of 10 characters and crucial parts of the story not being explained well (which were the two things that greatly plagued the first season). That being said, the story, in my opinion, was much better than season one.

I don\'t know; it\'s really 50/50.And that\'s why Darker Than BLACK: Ryuusei no Gemini gets a 7 out of 10', ""It slightly pains me to write this review because I have to write it completely based off this season alone, which dropped my overall Darker than Black score for me. And please note that this review in no way is based off the first season as well.Darker than Black is set in a world where these mysterious and deadly things called Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate appear and with it came along humans with super powers (called contractors because they each have a toll to pay for their power) and dolls, who are lifeless humans. There are many different organizations that are trying to...uncover the truth of the Gates and part of one of them is Hei, the main protagonist. Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini still follows this plot but now everyone is racing to get ahold of Izanami and Izanagi, the new turning points to the story.Story 6/10 - I couldn't grab hold of what was happening during a lot of the anime. The characters were jumping from place to place and a very weak plot was followed during this point. The storyline then picked up towards the end but it was still quite confusing and everything seemed a little rushed. The ending itself just left you mind blown (in the worst way possible) and the details leading up to it seemed random and pety.Art 10/10 - This is an area where this anime cannot drop at all. As the rest of the series, the art was exceptional. The scenery was always well done and the amount of detail put into the background always shocks me. The fighting scenes are always done well and just seem oh so cool.Sound 7/10 - The sound was decent and could have been a lot better. At the start, scenes which lacked complete excitement were over played with heart racing music which made the misplacement really easy to pick up on. Sometimes emotional sound tracks played while the scene lacked emotion which again was easy to pick out. But as per the first season, the OP and ED were amazing and really suited the style of the anime.Characters 8/10 - The characters in this season took on a girly aura, there seemed to be a lot of feelings and love which felt out of place. We saw a whole new side of Hei this season and new characters were introduced. Most characters played a short role but their character art and personality were still unique. Shou was the main character in this season and she is portrayed as an innocent young girl which is different to see in such a dreading future and she is shown to see spots of happiness. We also get to see a deeper side of July.Overall, I give Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini a 7/10. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first season or the OVAs but it was still a good watch. There were enjoyable scenes but I feel as though it had a lot more potential. uncover the truth of the Gates and part of one of them is Hei, the main protagonist.

Yes, I understand Darker Than Black is not a romantic drama, but if you\'re going to add romance in there, add it well or leave it out altogether. Don\'t turn the main character into a lolicon just because you want him to stay ""cool"" and ""nice"". I personally don\'t think there is...anything wrong with the characters themselves, neither with their development. In fact, Darker Than Black has many entertaining and well contrasted characters along with in depth development of the main ones we really care about. It\'s a show that greatly involves the audience to the point of affecting them. It\'s also not one-sided. Most antagonists get their deserved consolation. Even the minor characters are well developed. They are not just there as plot fillers. Compared to the first season, this season has less action but more of a story to it. I like this contrast between the two seasons. The relaxed pace makes the story more realistic.This season doesn\'t explain many unanswered mysteries in season one, however. I kind of like it since it would mean that this series won\'t end yet, and we still might see even more interestinc characters along with their stories that would unravel the mysteries one by one.But, if they add more to this harem, I won\'t even consider watching it.Darker Than Black would be much more honest as a story if they stop introducing more girls to the series and focus more on unraveling the mysteries from now on (if they don\'t make season 3, I would rate this show a 5, seriously) I usually prefer action thriller with a touch of romance, but not this time. I don\'t think it\'s possible now to introduce any love after basically killing off the girls in the harem one by one and then introducing more to compensate. anything wrong with the characters themselves, neither with their development.

Perhaps I had high expectations, but when have the sequels ever beat the original? Darker than Black's universe easily could have brought epicness and awesomeness in a second season; instead, my hopes are dashed and I am left wondering: what happened?Story: 7/10WHAT HAPPENED HERE. This isn't a second season; it should be the first season of a different show in the same universe. The main character is now a side character and is replaced by a Russian girl?? I don't understand. I wanted to...like the direction the story went, but it was just....bleh. And not to mention nothing was memorable. No scenes, no places, no plot twists - it all melded together like a gushy banana. No one wants a crushed banana. Besides the fact that nothing really stood out, the story chugged along anyway, grinding my nerves down to dust.Art: 9/10The artwork was, as expected, gorgeous. There never really was a time where I doubted what world this was, and how depressing everything is. Happiness is as rare as safety, and they kept the artwork stellar the entire time. This was where the show really shone; from here, it goes downhill very quickly.Sound: 8/10The sound was good as well. The intro and ending were both fresh and new from the first season instead of recycled, and it was a nice addition. Still, the original soundtrack was better. This one wasn't bad, however; the moments where epic music was needed, there was epic music. The voice acting, was, as usual, stellar.Character: 6/10I....I was disappointed here. Hei becomes this.....this pitiful excuse of what he used to be. Mao...what happened to you? The main character was whiny. And her power was so unorthodox from what everyone else had. There were hiccups and random unnecessary scenes here and there, and the characters themselves seemed static and unchanging. No one was memorable enough to really remember if and when they stopped appearing in the story, and continually I had trouble trying to remember the minor characters because there seemed to be so many of them. Overall, it was a disappointing cast.Overall: 7/10This fell far flat from my expectations and I was thoroughly disappointed to where the story led to and eventually ended on a weird note. The storyline seemed to stray far from the original, and the characters remained flat and irritatingly normal most of the time. I was expecting bigger and better - but I got a slimmed down version of what should have been something extraordinary. I stand by my score. like the direction the story went, but it was just....bleh. And not to mention nothing was memorable. No scenes, no places, no plot twists - it all melded together like a gushy banana. No one wants a crushed banana. Besides the fact that nothing really stood out, the story chugged along anyway, grinding my nerves down to dust.Art: 9/10The artwork was, as expected, gorgeous. There never really was a time where I doubted what world this was, and how depressing everything is. Happiness is as rare as safety, and they kept the artwork stellar the entire time. This was where the show really shone; from here, it goes downhill very quickly.Sound: 8/10The sound was good as well. The intro and ending were both fresh and new from the first season instead of recycled, and it was a nice addition. Still, the original soundtrack was better. This one wasn't bad, however; the moments where epic music was needed, there was epic music. The voice acting, was, as usual, stellar.Character: 6/10I....I was disappointed here. Hei becomes this.....this pitiful excuse of what he used to be. Mao...what happened to you? The main character was whiny. And her power was so unorthodox from what everyone else had. There were hiccups and random unnecessary scenes here and there, and the characters themselves seemed static and unchanging.

That\'s when I felt that everything clicked, and I felt like I have solved the mystery of the show.Wikipedia definition of yin and yang:In Ancient Chinese philosophy, yin and yang (/jɪn/ and /jɑːŋ, jæŋ/; Chinese: 陰陽 yīnyáng pronounced [ín jǎŋ], lit. ""dark-light"", ""negative-positive"") is a Chinese philosophical concept that describes how obviously opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how...they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.[1] In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).[2]The very reason that the anime plot itself seems so mysterious is because this whole anime is an embodiment of the meaning of yin and yang. It\'s the author\'s attempt at creating a story revolved around the philosophy of yin and yang.~~~~~~~~~~~***Spoilers ahead***~~~~~~~~~~~My views about the plot of this show:The very essence of this show is the author\'s view of life from a traditional Chinese point of view, i.e., the principle of yin and yang, as mentioned before. The idea of yin and yang is not a simple one to comprehend, but once you know that the show revolves around that idea, things suddenly start making a lot more sense.What relation does the Astronomy Department have with contractors\' superpowers, much less what\'s going on with the Gate? Once you know that traditional Chinese beliefs regarding cosmology are intertwined with the philosophical concepts of yin and yang, you begin to see why the author chose to do things the way he did.The same logic applies everywhere else:Contractors and normal people. One apparently does not feel emotions and the other does. One has no dreams and the other has. Opposite in many ways.The past and the future. Both are themes that were constantly brought up in the show. One is changeable and the other is not. Stars of the past and stars of the future. Opposite in many ways.The old Earth and the copy Shion created. The filthy world we live in and the dark truth of it all, versus the ideal world Shion envisioned for those he loved and cared about. Opposite in many ways.Shion is the only one who figured out how to make sure that all those who have lost something due to the inevitable prophecy have a way of finding the things they have lost. Contractors have lost their humanity not because they gained new powers or lost their emotions, but because the rest of humanity has rejected them.For that reason, Shion sacrificed himself to create a copy of Earth where all the contractors will finally be able to live a normal life as humans rather than the killing machines that their governments and secret organisations forced them to be.Some final thoughts on this show:This may be a bit of a stretch, but I think that the very idea of clarity versus mystery is one of the main topics tackled by the author in his attempt to give a shape to the philosophy of yin and yang. I always wondered why the show had a mystery genre tag even though the show is not your everyday detective show where someone solves seemingly impossible cases, albeit the show actually having a detective who did barely anything for a few episodes.The mystery of what is behind everything that happens in this show is the author\'s attempt at creating a setting where yin and yang have free reign. At least that\'s the way I see it. In my opinion, the ultimate embodiment of yin and yang in this show is not something tangible that you can explain to someone in a matter of minutes and have them say ""ah now I see the point""; they would have to watch the entire show and think for themselves and reach a conclusion of their own.This is what I think the author was trying to ultimately achieve when making this story. The lack of proper explanation for everything was done not to confuse the viewers, but rather to convey to them the basic idea of yin and yang and have them reach their personal conclusion.

Her brother becomes a contractor after he is hit by an explosion caused by a meteor.  Hei is still there, but he doesn't seem to be as central as he was in season one.  All together, the story is good so far, but it doesn't really create anything new from season one.Art: Great design, some of...the characters are drawn carelessly though.Sound: brilliant soundCharacter: It really depends on what types of characters you like.  I found that Hei has changed from the previous season in that he's no longer funny, and I feel no attachment to him whatsoever.  Seems to be more apathetic.  But, the problem really lies in Suou.  Unless you're a big fan of tsundere stereotypes, you will likely dislike her.  I found her to have no depth or interesting features whatsoever.  It could change though.Enjoyment: Even though it doesn't seem as fast-paced as the previous series, I'm still enjoying it thoroughly.  But, seriously, Bones seems to enjoy killing off every single one of the characters that I like.  The only character that appeals to me now is Hei.  However, like I said before, if you don't mind anime stereotypes, the other characters aren't terrible.Overall: My opinion of this anime COULD change, but I doubt it.  I'll probably end up finishing it anyways. the characters are drawn carelessly though.Sound: brilliant soundCharacter: It really depends on what types of characters you like.

Maybe it's difficult to watch a show again knowing what happens already, so maybe that makes it boring for me.But for Darker than Black, there is rare exception. I NEVER get bored of that anime. Even if I know what's going to happen, it's always exciting to see it on screen or to try and notice something I didn't see the first time. I've rewatched the anime four times already. It's just that good of a show :') It's also one of the first animes I've seen, so that kinda gives...it a bigger advantage other other animes I've watched.However, I don't know how on earth I managed to bear through this second season. The second season is the complete opposite of what was a masterpiece of a first.I haven't seen the second season in almost a year now, but I'm fresh off of my fourth binge on DtB's original. I do vividly remember watching the second season though. I remember being very disappointed and having to take frequent breaks during episodes because it was just so boring and oddly paced. The story didn't really make sense at the time, either. I had to look up the plot on Wikipedia to get a better grasp on what was happening since it was too rushed and jumbled up. The theme and atmosphere were flipped on its head and lost that iconic charm to it that the first season had.The main character was pretty annoying and kind of gave me Mary Sue vibes. It just seemed centered around her too much, when who I was really there for was Hei, November 11, Kirihara, and the rest of the iconic cast. But it seemed like they didn't get enough screentime, so that was kinda depressing :'( Even if they did, the characters were still changed drastically. Hei's personality is totally flipped, so he isn't that cool and badass Chinese Batman anymore, but instead, a lame and abusive alcoholic. and MAO IS A SQUIRREL?! WHAT? That was also an odd change.Overall score is a 5. I think newcomers or people who don't compare it to the first season would find some enjoyment in it. But people who are die-hard DtB fans will probably give their hopes up on this one.Rant over. it a bigger advantage other other animes I've watched.However, I don't know how on earth I managed to bear through this second season.

It threw me off a bit, because in the first half of the first episode, I didn't see Hei at all. I thought .. what?! I then thought that it'd follow the manga (a remake, like FMA: Brotherhood with a storyline that relates closely to the manga) because shown at first was a girl.What I liked about this season is that it's a bit more progressive--appropriately paced, compared to the last season where sometimes it's just flat before...the last two episode... Another reason, is that this season is not as bloody as the last, silly, right? What I especially like about this continuation is that Hei is more relate-able, I hope that was not spoiling.What I didn't like about this season is that... less Hei's action, more Suou, though I understand that it is a necessity of the storyline.Overall, I really like DTB2. the last two episode...

While it is a sequel, the story can stand on its own two legs. However the fact that the plot is sometimes rushed and that many things are unexplained (holes in the story) keep it from getting a higher score. My personal feeling is that while it was engaging enough to keep me watching it, I doubt the impression that story leaves me with wont last, unlike some other anime.Animation: 8/10The character design and special effects were pleasant to look at. There were a few scenes where the drawings got a little sloppy, however as a...whole, the animation is consistently of good quality. Nothing really stood out for me, be it in a good light or a bad light, so I think that means it has at the very least done its job.Characters: 8/10I thought the new characters and the old characters are done in a interesting manner for a sequel. However, going back to the idea that there are a lot of questions unanswered in RG really takes away from a possible score of a 9.Sound: 8/10Tsukiakari no Michishirube (OP) is my favorite piece of music in this show. While the rest of the sounds of RG were unintrusive and almost non-existent, the opening really gives it extra points. Further, the voice acting was well done for this show.Enjoyment: 7/10There are a lot of questions left unanswered in this show. However it did keep me interested and watching.

I guess Im disappointed because the first season was so good and you automatically think the second is gonna be just as good, sadly it just was'nt up to par....It's not that I did'nt like Hei's new Street Bumb look, or all the fight scene's ( which were just as good as the first season) I simply dont like all the unexplained question's.

The return of Mao and July becoming a main character is a bit intresting and made the absensce of Yin easier to deal with. I don't want to spoil but some of the twists they throw...in seem like they are just there to try and get me more invested in the character instead of the actual story. The ending leaves something lacking as if they wrote themselves into a corner and tried to make everyone happy with it. Although I'm happy with the main ending of what happens to most characters, but the ending of Hei and Yin is just left up to you to figure out and can be taken down so many roads making it hard to understand. The overall would be improved if DTB got a season 3 or at least an explination on the ending I could easily forget about replacing the main with an argumenative girl and give this series an 8 or 9. in seem like they are just there to try and get me more invested in the character instead of the actual story.

The second season continues that proud tradition, and adds in some JRPG-level plot contrivance to spice things up. Also pedophilia.The headline to take away from this review is that the show is still good. I found myself binging the series almost in one sitting, The new contractors introduced in the show all have interesting abilities and enough was done with returning cast members to keep them interesting. Certain fight scenes still stick out in my head for being lavishly animated and ambitious. The focus of the show...being on a new character offers us a chance to see the world of contractors from the perspective of somebody who (at least at first) lives on the outside of that world. The issue I have with the show\'s driection doesn\'t stem from the fact that it suddenly became shit. More specifically, the fact that I\'ve gotten so ingrained in the show\'s world makes the decisions it takes with its story strange and questionable.This is the part where the spoilers happen. Skip to the last paragraph if you want to avoid excessive rambling.Between the events of Season 1 and Season 2, the world of Darker than Black takes a hard right turn into what I can only describe as ""some real JRPG bullcrap."" Remember Yin? The emotionless Doll who\'s main defining moment in the first season was her slow and tragic humanization? Well, I guess the writers wanted a bit of a mulligan on that. Turns out that one episode I like where we finally get a glimpse into her humanity didn\'t happen because Dolls are actually more complex than the writers originally led you to believe. It turns out the reason why she has emotions is because she\'s Izanami, the Shinto creation goddess, and her evolution into a floating, soul-harvesting, world-destroying specter was prophecized by some random Japanese guy we haven\'t met, some thirty years before the first Gate even showed up. Yup, there\'s prophecies now. The Syndicate were the good guys, actually? If you really think about it? They weren\'t trying to kill all the contractors because they were evil, they just wanted to stop some 50 year old poem from coming true! Obviously!The show tries to humanize contractors by showing us multiple characters who either become contractors in the course of the plot, or who have done so recently. However, it raises more questions than it answers. Apparently, perfectly happy and normal teenagers turn into the clinical definition of psychopaths, literally overnight and with no transition between the two. Our focal point character changes personality so abruptly, it almost happens off-screen. She still shows signs of emotions and caring about things, and she seems to be chagrined at that. She actively complains that she\'s not as ""rational"" as everyone seems to think all contractors are. The seasoned contractors around her, who\'ve admitted in the past to still feeling emotions, seem to take this as proof that she\'s a super special girl and not that (as I\'ve already said) the mechanics of this world are more complex than the writers originally led us to believe.Did I mention the JRPG level bullcrap? The main character is a twin with super special powers that lets her do a magical-girl style transformation from ""girl"" to ""girl with anti-tank rifle."" Her brother is a super-specialer boy who\'s contractor power seems to be ""making the plot more confusing."" The whole thing ends with a frankly ridiculous sequence about... the main character losing her memories? And it\'s very sad? And then something something another world, something something Yin in a suit with short hair, something something Hei realizes his true potential.They brought Mao back, and now he\'s a sugar glider. It was clear that the original artist really liked cats, and drew them with a charm that can only really speak to a love of the things. The artists for this show struggled a lot more, when it came to drawing sugar gliders. Mao only exists in this show to be a wacky funny cartoon character (but, you know, only engaging in ""rational"" slapstick).There\'s a non-binary person in this show. And that\'s all I\'m going to say about that.I have a problem. When I like something, I tear it to shreds. I would not have gotten this close and this in depth with my problems with the show, if I didn\'t ultimately like what I was looking at. To try and sum it up quickly, Ryuusei no Gemini is a fine and good continuation of the series. It stumbles pretty hard at points, especially towards the end, but when you get past the pseudo-philosophy it is still a damn fine thriller. People who can shut their brain off more than I do should very well like it. For the people like me, well... at least it\'ll give you something to think about, for a few days. being on a new character offers us a chance to see the world of contractors from the perspective of somebody who (at least at first) lives on the outside of that world.

Her brother is a super-specialer boy who\'s contractor power seems to be ""making the plot more confusing."" The whole thing ends with a frankly ridiculous sequence about... the main character losing her memories? And it\'s very sad? And then something something another world, something something Yin in a suit with short hair, something something Hei realizes his true potential.They brought Mao back, and now he\'s a sugar glider. It was clear that the original artist really liked cats, and drew them with a charm that can only really speak to a love of the things. The artists for this show struggled a lot more, when it came to drawing sugar gliders. Mao only exists in this show to be a wacky funny cartoon character (but, you know, only engaging in ""rational"" slapstick).There\'s a non-binary person in this show. And that\'s all I\'m going to say about that.I have a problem. When I like something, I tear it to shreds. I would not have gotten this close and this in depth with my problems with the show, if I didn\'t ultimately like what I was looking at. To try and sum it up quickly, Ryuusei no Gemini is a fine and good continuation of the series. It stumbles pretty hard at points, especially towards the end, but when you get past the pseudo-philosophy it is still a damn fine thriller. People who can shut their brain off more than I do should very well like it. For the people like me, well... at least it\'ll give you something to think about, for a few days.', 'this is a rant overall and not much of your typical review so in turn it got spoilers aswellmy gripes :1)story wiseso many unresolved things and uncertain ending leaving u not satisfied  and a very bizarre stoyrtelling ,this is written while having watched the ova they made AFTER the 2nd season then going backpractically shion had the power to not only copy the whole world with its inhabitants body\'s  but also copy a full sized moon and somehow like hid them in it or smth ?thats the part im not following completely maybe he created both a new earth and a new moon...but earth was obstructed by the moon ??)so their final plan,their absolute trump card were just to abandon humanity and just copy everyone and send them away in a capsule ...souo\'s resurrection didnt mean anything at the end,just brought her back dramatically to be among hei\'s harem perhapsthey implied that either a) everyone\'s memory preserved in the me system will eventually fade away without a similar meteor core and then they go on just saying yep it will work without it,with no core in sight on any of the cloned humans or no alternative explanation given so are they just gonna forget everything and be soulless dolls after a while,is that a triumph for humanity in the end ?

The design of this singular arc is to purposefully leave you in the dark for the sake of plot development, and then watch Gaiden after not strictly for an explanation, but further plot development. The creator's developed the story to flow this way and i intended to have you enjoy it as such, i only say this because the person who recommended it to me told me to watch Gaiden first, and then all plot twists of Gemini were ruined for me.That said, the actual series is quite the departure from the original and...follows a more linear plot and focuses on a new protagonist. Of course Hei is still present and a main character, but he is not the lead this time around.The actual series is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, the problems that people have with it are not the plot or characters, but simply their change from the original series. The appeal of Contractors, Dolls, The Wall, and all the mysteries and alluring aspects of the first series simply aren't as apparent here, and that's why people don't like it. It is by no means bad, but it's true that if you like this series, it's for different reasons than liking the first.I must say though, that the characters and story are excellent, and that the mysteries of the world of Darker Than Black are not gone or replaced but they decided to add more to those aspects in a different way rather than providing explanations for the still unanswered questions of the first series. By all means enjoy the series, because i'm sure fans of the original series will love Gaiden, but this must be watched first. follows a more linear plot and focuses on a new protagonist.

Example of this is the cross dresser who owns a bar because of his wife left him.U may ask what this has to do the plot...the answer nothing.My biggest Gripe with this anime is how they showed this anime before the OVA leaving the viewer to wonder what happened in between to Hei and Yin.Also how they turned a badass character Hei to a drunk who beats on little girls.If your a Fan of Darker than Black Skip this Season because it messed out on the charm of what made it good (Characters,Little Story Arcs, Action) to give a gritter story that falls on it face hard.Instead read the Manga that is what i call a true sequel to the anime that i love.Darker than Black: Shikkoku no Hanahttp://myanimelist.net/manga/14975/Darker_than_Black:_Shikkoku_no_Hana the answer nothing.My biggest Gripe with this anime is how they showed this anime before the OVA leaving the viewer to wonder what happened in between to Hei and Yin.Also how they turned a badass character Hei to a drunk who beats on little girls.If your a Fan of Darker than Black Skip this Season because it messed out on the charm of what made it good (Characters,Little Story Arcs, Action) to give a gritter story that falls on it face hard.Instead read the Manga that is what i call a true sequel to the anime that i love.Darker than Black: Shikkoku no Hanahttp://myanimelist.net/manga/14975/Darker_than_Black:_Shikkoku_no_Hana"", ""i know a lot of people are upset about this because they came in with expectations and they saw the first series. but i stumbled upon it and had never seen anything from quite this genre. so as a story completely ignoring the first series it makes the central focus a girl trying to reunite with her brother. we see a diverse and multi-dimensional group of characters enter the story and while nothing is really finished (apart from arguably her story to find her brother) i think the disappointment in the characters match up with the audience which means there's no clash with how we...feel and how the charactors feel making the ending more palatable at least in my case. besides i had got my bitter sweet ending i didn't need an answer because sometimes nobody really knows why things happen. besides with the story they were trying to tell here if they crammed in info on the gates and sky it would just become tackie feel and how the charactors feel making the ending more palatable at least in my case. besides i had got my bitter sweet ending i didn't need an answer because sometimes nobody really knows why things happen. besides with the story they were trying to tell here if they crammed in info on the gates and sky it would just become tackie"", 'So as a fan of the first Darker than Black series I was very happy to find out that there was a sequel, a continuation to a great series! I had jumped into it right away, without reading anything on it. I was confused, where was Hei and Yin? He doesn\'t show up right away? Okay I can deal with that...wait, he\'s a drunk? Why the hell does he look like that?!And with disgust I had dropped the show after three episodes, vowing to never watch it again and pretend that it was never made.....until I decided to suck it up and watch it two...years or so later.I\'ll admit, it wasn\'t that bad.Story: 7/10Now I wouldn\'t say that the story in Ryuusei no Gemini was a direct continuance from the original. It\'s sort of it\'s own storyline with throw-ins from the last season with many of the same characters and names (IE The Syndicate). There is a two year gap between the first and second seasons and many things have happened to both Yin and Hei that are never directly answered (although there is a gaiden arc between the seasons, but I haven\'t seen it yet). Instead we are just left in the dark and are supposed to deal with it. Which may or may not be good, if you consider the fact that Hei comes into the show looking like a haggard empty shell of his former self that has a drinking problem, and WE DON\'T KNOW WHAT MADE HIM THIS WAY.If you\'re expecting a lot of Mao, Hei, and Yin action-- or any answers to questions you had in the first series then you will be sorely disappointed. Ryuusei no Gemini focuses on Suou, a 13 year old Eurasian/Russian girl; she is THE main character, the star of the show. Hei and Mao are kind of nothing more than mentors and guides for Suou to become the gun wielding emotional teen girl that she is. Yin doesn\'t show up until near the end, and she is incorporated into the plot in a way that you wouldn\'t expect.This is rather disappointing because the first series had enough to go on to continue it, to try to answer some of the questions that it left unanswered. However, instead we get a separate story and a new main character that is vaguely (barely) connected at all. Ryuusei no Gemini is also considerably shorter too, which definitely gave no room to expand on anything but instead forcing us to gun through the plot.Don\'t get me wrong, the story was good--on its own. If you let go of practically everything from Kuro no Keiyakusha then you should be alright. But if you are really holding onto anything from the first series, then you\'re going to be left feeling ""what the fuck did I just watch, and what does this have to do with anything?"" or at least, that\'s what I thought.Art: 9/10As always the art was great. Keeping true to the style of the first season Ryuusei no Gemini introduced some interesting looking characters as well as brought back characters that are easily recognizable. The animation was pretty great, but unfortunately not as heavily involved as in Kuro no Keiyakusha. This is because there are less actions scene compared to the first season. Mixed with the different color schemes and style, you can see just how tired and different Hei has become, and just feel when the mood is supposed to be dark or lighthearted (which the story/character interactions failed to complete) .Sound: 8/10In terms of heart pounding sound to get you pumped up for the upcoming scene, Ryuusei no Gemini did a great job with it\'s techno/electronic soundtrack, which seemed to fit the mood perfectly. The opening theme kind of didn\'t do it for me. I know I know \'but it was upbeat and refreshing!\' you are telling me, I get it. I\'ll admit, it does have a certain charm to it, and I could probably listen to it over and over again.But my question is- do I want an upbeat opener for an anime that is supposed to be dark, dramatic and mysterious? The opening for Kuro no Keiyakusha in my opinion, captured the overall feel for the show and how it would turn out. This on the other hand, made me feel like I was going to watch some dramatic slice of life/shoujo anime. Overall, I skipped the opener practically every time. I have nothing to say about the ending theme, as I most often skip those (because I\'m binge watching, I don\'t want to waste my time on ending credits, dammit!) but I can tell you that it\'s by the same band (Abingdon boys school) that did the opening theme for Kuro no Keiyakusha-so there\'s that.Character: 6/10Hei! Why!? Hei was the single most reason I dropped the show in the first place. I HATED the fact that he had sunk so low, that the man known as BK-201, the Black Reaper, had turned into this drunken mope who slapped Suou around. But now that I came back I can see the importance of making Hei be like this. Even hero\'s fall, and anyone can hit rock bottom. Hei was our fallen hero, and it hurt to see him like that...but as the show went on, he became less and less of an important character and his problems were swept under the rug by the star, Suou. If Ryuusei no Gemini would have focused more on Hei and the Syndicate then him being the way he is would have been powerful.Speaking of Suou, I kind of hated her. Yes, I get the fact that she\'s going through a bunch of tough ordeals in the series, and she\'s trying to struggle with who she is and how she\'s supposed to be. But it was because of this that I felt like I was just watching a girl go through puberty. And as we all know, puberty is never fun.Other characters seemed rather unimportant to me. They were either there just to serve as a plot mover, a shit stirrer, or for cheap laughes (which there was a lot of). Many new people come and go in Ryuusei no Gemini, and a lot of them had potential to be great. Unfortunately, the time constraints of the show gave them no time to expand on any particular background story, leaving most of the cast two dimensional, and largely unsatisfying. Largely, I felt absolutely nothing for the vast majority of them.Enjoyment: 7/10This is a tough one for me to rate. I was holding onto Kuro no Keiyakusha for dear life, and ended up largely confused and unsatisfied with the ending. But the ride along the way was actually pretty great. I wish that they would have given Ryuusei no Gemini a longer season, because it might have made the show even better.Now time for the Happy Panda and Sad Panda award; this is my little quirk where I point out the best and worst part in the anime and give them an ""award"".Happy Panda goes to: Hei!Even though his story had become overshadowed by Suou\'s I have to say I was deeply moved to see him hitting rock bottom and climbing his way back up. It goes to show that you can kick a hero down, but they will find a way and a reason to get back up.Sad Panda goes to: Suou\'s gun transmutation scenes!If you\'ve watched the show already then you know what I\'m talking about. The first time Suou\'s giant gun slides out of her chest it was kind of cool. But does that really need to happen EVERY TIME she uses it? I don\'t recall wanting to watch a sailor moon/shugo chara esque transformation sequence.Overall:37/507.6/10= 8/10My advice is this:DO NOT WATCH THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER KURO NO KEIYAKUSHA!!!You will be left disappointed and angry. Give it some time, let it cool down for awhile before trying to watch this. You\'ll enjoy it more that way. And keep in mind that you should look at this as a separate arc, rather than a direct continuance. years or so later.I\'ll admit, it wasn\'t that bad.Story: 7/10Now I wouldn\'t say that the story in Ryuusei no Gemini was a direct continuance from the original.

The story was so fragmented I can\'t make any sense out of it. It answered  some questions from the previous Darker Than Black but it wasn\'t enough. It felt like they made it so mysterious that it ends up not making...sense. The story was absurd and it was so absurd that it\'s almost unrealistic even for an anime series.

He was the best character and the main protagonist in the previous anime. Now he\'s like a doll. He lost his powers for more than half of the show and it wasn\'t fun watching him. As for Suou, she has some character development. She\'s a very complex person because she\'s a contractor but she is experiencing changes in her emotions. That\'s what you call puberty. She\'s really confused about herself especially near the end of the series. I find it unrealistic that a 13 year old girl was plunged into all of this chaos and confusion and she\'still managed to cope with it. Though she\'s very interesting overall. As for the other characters, some contractors were introduced in one episode and dies in the next. Misaki is the same as ever. July, however, is starting to evolve and it\'s always cute to see Suou and July together. It\'s absurd to see Mao as a flying squirrel. A former assassin that became a cute flying squirrel. Of all the animals, why a flying squirrel? Anyway, I liked the characters overall, just a little disappointed over Hei.Enjoyment 8/10I think it was fun overall. The fight scenes were fresh and as interesting as ever. The complicated position that Suou is plunged into is definitely fun to watch as it goes on. The new characters and the nice character designs is absolutely wonderful. The music and the sound are interesting and electrifying (in a good way). I had to watch it twice to figure out the plot but everything was unforgettable.Overall 7/10Overall, it\'s a good anime, though not extraordinary. It may be a disappointment to those who expect a better anime than the previous Darker Than Black. Although, if you don\'t compare it to the previous anime, Ryusei no Gemini makes a fairly decent anime. It just didn\'t live up to my expectations and I felt horrible and good at the same time after watching it. My emotions were bittersweet.

July, however, is starting to evolve and it\'s always cute to see Suou and July together. It\'s absurd to see Mao as a flying squirrel. A former assassin that became a cute flying squirrel. Of all the animals, why a flying squirrel? Anyway, I liked the characters overall, just a little disappointed over Hei.Enjoyment 8/10I think it was fun overall. The fight scenes were fresh and as interesting as ever. The complicated position that Suou is plunged into is definitely fun to watch as it goes on. The new characters and the nice character designs is absolutely wonderful. The music and the sound are interesting and electrifying (in a good way). I had to watch it twice to figure out the plot but everything was unforgettable.Overall 7/10Overall, it\'s a good anime, though not extraordinary. It may be a disappointment to those who expect a better anime than the previous Darker Than Black. Although, if you don\'t compare it to the previous anime, Ryusei no Gemini makes a fairly decent anime. It just didn\'t live up to my expectations and I felt horrible and good at the same time after watching it. My emotions were bittersweet. It made me happy but there is still this gaping hole inside me that was looking for more  Still, it\'s an unforgettable anime and it will still be a legacy of Darker Than Black.', ""Darker than black: Ryuusei no Gemini is the second season of the first Darker than black.

Unless she breaks away, becomes something completely different, and writes her own story. That is who ""Ryuusei no Gemini"" is.Story: 9/10Being just 12 episodes, she wasn\'t quite able to fill in all of the holes presented when she first came into existence. Certain questions remained unanswered, and evolution was distorted in order to keep face (I\'ll explain that in a sec). But don\'t get me wrong, the anime didn\'t present plot lines and then abandon them, the...holes are only present within the gap between the two series. Overall the plot within the show is actually very well done, it relates a tale of a girl who never wanted the spotlight, but got it anyways, of her struggle to justify her own existence, of a broken man seeking a new purpose, of a child who never got to be one. It\'s almost as if the anime itself is arguing it\'s existence through it\'s story.I expect the biggest problem people seem to have is that Hei isn\'t the main protagonist, but you\'re just going to have to get over that love affair, he got his season already!Art: 10/10Outstanding. Just as good as the first. I expect one of the reasons many sequels stink is because they are unwilling to have a half season, and have remarkably lower budget that the original. Not this anime, she seems to have sacrificed the concept of a full season for a more complete feeling about the anime. A very good decision on the part of the staff.Sound: 10/10My personal preference is always the English Dubbed (provided the voices fit).

For the series to include Hei and justify Suou\'s personality, they seem to have misrepresented the process that takes hundred-thousands to millions of years. But Evolution occurs in steps, so it is still somewhat believable, and there\'s a certain plot device to slightly justify the hasty change. That there is the only flaw among the characters, however. Everything else is executed wonderfully. The back stories of each of the protagonists, Hei, Suou, and July (despite what the MAL page would have you believe), are done remarkably well, they are able to tie many loose ends and answer many questions left open by the first series, not that they needed answering!Enjoyment: 9/10Now I definitely saw a great many things I would do differently, but that was before I began thinking of this series as a stand alone arc.

I was lucky enough to watch Gaiden before beginning this serious so I didn\'t have as much trouble wondering how the situation got to where it did.The positives:July got a real role that he didn\'t have in S1. He was very cute, adorable and Yin-like and seemingly took her role in the series since she was given the absolute shaft. More random contractors with epic abilities and badass fight scenes. The return of Misaki!! Im so glad she didn\'t just disapear. Mao the squirrel.The negatives:As a dedicated fan to the HeixYin...ship, I was extremely disappointed with how things ended for them. The both became side characters and their reunion in the last ep was underwhelming and no one can be sure what actually became of them. The pseudo-shoujo atmosphere around this season. This time around we welcome a completely pointless main character: Suou. She provided us with a maho shoujo transformation scene and hours of blabbing in what should have been a show about Hei. The ending. What happened. To avoid spoilers I\'ll just say, ""why?""Given that the above tends to sound really negative, Ryuusei no Gemini is actually a great watch. It has AMAZING op/ed sequences that make up for Suou being a screen whore and some of the characters have great development like Mao, July and Misaki.

(For example, if the copied Earth is different in only one respect and that respect is not having the Black Gates, then why isn't there a July and a Suou there already? Why *send* them there?) "", ""After I finished DTB: Gemini of the Meteor I was surprised that so many people disliked it so much. I was able to exhale after reading the reviews on here.Story: 7.5/10 (but no half numbers of course -_-)I always walk into movies late, so I was able to sorta-kinda catch onto what was going on- something went wrong and changed the charries. (More on that later.) Alot of people would say it became more of a girl's anime, which I can see, but at the same time the changes in the characters kind of contradict this. It wasn't as extraordinary as the first series, to...be sure, but the sequels are never as good anyway. Held my attention very well and kept me wanting more, I was disappointed with the ending though, especially since BONES has said there won't be a 3rd season.Art: 10/10As always, the art blew me away. Character designs were awesome, and as always, my main eyecandy is that these characters are believable- no muscle-men or girls whose eyes take up half their faces. The visuals alone can evoke emotion, sound or no sound.Sound: 9/10I liked the soundtrack during the anime very much, although when I tried listening to it out of context I couldn't recall which scenes each song was used in, which IRKS ME GREATLY. Probably means I should rewatch. Voices were fine for me, I loved Suou's voice actor particularly because she reflected her youth and was pretty good with the constant indignation.Character: 9/10I actually LOVED these characters, especially because of their flaws. Hobo Hei was unexplained without the OVAs but I kind of accepted him after the first episode or so. The lack of his powers was a little bit annoying but the fact that he was able to hold off contractors without them put him on a more level playing field that I appreciated- and the humanness of him knowing when to run. Suou was a little repetitive but captured an element of teen angst that was interesting as an onlooker- easy to sympathize with, too. I HATED Mao's new body, though. Although it had its flying quirks, he could have been something like a hawk or bat or SOMETHING other than the ex-pet flying squirrel. The villains were decently developed- and as always, I love how they're not EVIL-evil, except for Izanami, which was probably the last twist I would have expected, but enjoyable.Enjoyment: 8.5/10 (written as 8)After tearing through the slightly irking beginning (which I later appreciated for context) I was captivated and loved it up until the end. The teen romance factor? Realistic and interesting- if you're stuck in an extremely stressful, miserable situation with one person, chances are unless they're incredibly unattractive in body or character that something or other will get fired up there. At the end I sat staring at my computer for a good few minutes before finally mustering up the will to go anime-searching again. I REALLY hope BONES changes his mind about a 3rd season, because there is nothing that could bring this thing up more. Only other flaw I saw was the repetition of certain things- although the quick flashbacks were powerful reinforcers for the storyline, some of Suou's lines were a little bit annoying after recurring more than once.Overall: 8.5/10 (or 8)Flawed characters are much more interesting to me than perfect ones. Although not as good as the first, it provided a fair extension for those of us that were hungry for more, even though it leaves you with a much deeper dissatisfaction. Although a couple of things could have been cut out (as always) I would definitely recommend this to anyone who saw the first season- WATCH THE OVA. IT ALL MAKES SENSE AFTER THAT.

So, watch the OVA, ""Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden"" before  this (Gemini), as the story will be more profound and make a lot more sense.  Seriously, The OVA is literally is described as ""Telling the story of...what happened to Yin and Hei between the first and second series.""REVIEW:I just finished watching this season of darker than black and I must say I don\'t understand all of the hate and claims that the show changed or switched moods from something darker and more mysterious to something more cartoonish and occasionally even dimwitted. That is not even remotely true.If you watched and enjoyed season one of darker than black, then you know that occasionally they did throw in an episode or two of comic relief, and yes, even some slight fan service, and I feel that in this season they pretty much carried on the same tradition.More importantly than that, and this is one of the chief complaints against this wonderful continuation of DTB, is the idea that Hei\'s character has changed too much and is no longer an enjoyable protagonist.I\'d actually argue the opposite. His depth as a character is finally more than a Batman-esque, thin excuse to be mysterious.

People should be more open minded and stop expecting everything to be spelled out for you, because that is just lazy writing.I love that there will always be a sort of air of mystery to this show, and that we will all likely make theories as to what actually occurred, or what the writers meant.

I LIKED this show. The main idea of the plot was very good so it would be very difficult not to, however, when compared to the original series/season, they somehow pulled it off and made a rather 'below par' storyline with countless plot holes obviously with the so often encountered over complexity of anime causing so many points leaving you like '...but...why...?' even for those who have seen the first series, this also creates the problem of so many characters being rolled in and off the screen that few backgrounds are truly developed to the fullest extent...( if at all).But, these things set aside, the art style I think of this show is one of the best I have ever seen with detail that does help to immerse a viewer in the right conditions. I also couldn't fault the sound perfect synch runs we what I think of as accurate sound effects ( I don't exactly know how stabbing someone sounds)I personally enjoyed this more than would be expected from my statements, mainly due to the fact that I found all of the characters to be humerus or quite relatable (Google says it's a word) at points both, and then those who didn't had a tendency to die.Overall I say this wasn't particularly bad, but after such a large time skip, you would have expected much more of an explanation for how everything is at this point, I would recommend that they develop a prequel story to explain all of this, although perhaps only as a spin off,as the series ended with a cliffhangerThank you for reading my review, hope you found it informing or agreeable ( if at all).But, these things set aside, the art style I think of this show is one of the best I have ever seen with detail that does help to immerse a viewer in the right conditions.

I like hei a lot as the protagonist peak guy.', ""Summary: Darker Than Black's 2nd season is a better, but very different show than the 1st.  Those tuning in expecting to see more of Hei being a cool guy and fighting villains like Batman will be very disappointed, as he becomes a secondary character to Suou, a middle school girl with all kinds of connections to contractors and an apocalyptic prophecy.  It becomes something like a tragic magical girl story fused to the general neo noir structure and setting of the 1st season.  However, the 2nd season benefits greatly from a focus on a single main story rather than the series of...tenuously connected mini arcs that was season 1, and Suou is a more interesting character than anyone in season 1 was.  Unfortunately a vague plot that leaves you with more questions than answers prevents it from being what it could have been, but it is an improvement on the original, though people that enjoyed the first season will likely disagree strongly.Positives:+ Suou is a good character.  She's interesting, sympathetic and a tragic figure that isn't drowning in melodrama.  I was very into following her arc, the development of her character, and how she reacted to some Big Secrets From Her Mysterious Past that I won't spoil.+ The focus on a single storyline, in contrast with season 1, is a blessing.  Season 2 allows you to stay with characters for the long haul and follow their progression.  Rather than a series of unmemorable one-off stories and characters, there is more depth to season 2 because it has the time for it.+ Art and animation looks outstanding for being more than 10 years old at the time I write this.Negatives:- Vague plot and ending that answers few of the questions raised throughout both the first and second series.  There really aren't even enough clues to do informed speculation or theorizing on some of the big questions, like what are the Gates?- Yin's disappearance and transformation is never satisfyingly explained.  It would be one thing to remove her from the series the way they did if they showed the backstory of what happened between her and Hei and what caused her to turn into what she did, but you never get those answers, and they are never even really hinted at.- Hei's transformation into Daniel Craig James Bond.  The last thing I needed was another gritty, broken down former hero that's a jaded alcoholic wrestling with his personal demons now.  I don't mind that they made a significant change to his character from the 1st season, but I have had enough of this archetype and wish it had been anything else.- The weird pedophile guy that could turn into The Thing from Fantastic 4.  Did we really need a pedophile and a serial child killer in the same series? tenuously connected mini arcs that was season 1, and Suou is a more interesting character than anyone in season 1 was.  Unfortunately a vague plot that leaves you with more questions than answers prevents it from being what it could have been, but it is an improvement on the original, though people that enjoyed the first season will likely disagree strongly.Positives:+ Suou is a good character.  She's interesting, sympathetic and a tragic figure that isn't drowning in melodrama.  I was very into following her arc, the development of her character, and how she reacted to some Big Secrets From Her Mysterious Past that I won't spoil.+ The focus on a single storyline, in contrast with season 1, is a blessing.  Season 2 allows you to stay with characters for the long haul and follow their progression.  Rather than a series of unmemorable one-off stories and characters, there is more depth to season 2 because it has the time for it.+ Art and animation looks outstanding for being more than 10 years old at the time I write this.Negatives:- Vague plot and ending that answers few of the questions raised throughout both the first and second series.  There really aren't even enough clues to do informed speculation or theorizing on some of the big questions, like what are the Gates?- Yin's disappearance and transformation is never satisfyingly explained.

If you havent watched the 4 episode ova before watching this, you might feel different, but him acting the way he does makes sense.  He is a man who has lost everything,  I found the first half of this anime extremely good, and only started to dislike it towards the end.  My main problem is the new main character suou, and the amount of loli fan service that there is.  why does every time she use her ability does it need to...have a naked anime girl transformation? and why the fuck does she fall in love with Hei even though HE USED TO BEAT HER? which again, makes sense for hei to do so.  idk, this isnt really a full review just my scattered thoughts about it. i dont think that it is god awful like some people say, but i still prefer the original series. have a naked anime girl transformation? and why the fuck does she fall in love with Hei even though HE USED TO BEAT HER? which again, makes sense for hei to do so.  idk, this isnt really a full review just my scattered thoughts about it. i dont think that it is god awful like some people say, but i still prefer the original series."", ""If anyone was expecting more of Hei acting moody in a neo-noir-styled city, they would be incredibly disappointed. Going a 180 on the neo-noir influence of the first season, and the modern-episodic story structure, the second season of Darker than Black has many surprises, some pleasant and some very questionable, at the very least, it never ceases to entertain, at least for me.Now that we are in 2021, Darker than Black: Gaiden is pretty much compulsory viewing before you start this second season. While I have no idea what the director and writers were thinking releasing the second season before Gaiden as a lot...of plot points and story beats become a lot clearer once one has viewed the Gaiden OVA. Hell, Gaiden also strengthens Hei's motivation and character arc. Gaiden covers much of the details about Hei and Yin's conflict which this second season somehow assumes the viewer to pick up on these things through subtle and vague story reveals. While this sort of approach may work in a arthouse work where plot details are deemed less significant over experience and contemplation, Darker than Black has always been conventionally story driven where the emphasis on narrative detail has always been important. So yeah, Gaiden is a must-watch.So, the noir stylings of the original have been traded for a more conventional, but still relatively mature tone. While I was quite attracted to the original's atmosphere, I still found the second season's tone to be quite agreeable. Mostly because the dramatic storytelling and writing remained at a nice and consistent standard. The second season introduces us to a deuteragonist in Suou. A seemingly wet behind the years gal who becomes entangled in a prophecy-conspiracy-plot with Hei. Though her introduction was at first incredibly conventional - the kid being taught by the weary veteran at the very least, the mature writing was good enough for me to be entertained. It was nice to see that this conventional story eventual twists to be something more interesting and contemplative. Still, Hei's personal story which is tied to the motif and narrative of prophecy and fate, feels inadequetly explored. Mostly because a lot of time was spent developing Suou's character and her theme of identity over others. As a result, Hei's ending feels underdeveloped as if it were baiting a sequel. (which we probably and sadly won't get)While I did feel that the overall more conventional style in which the series concluded fit the tone of the series as a whole a lot better than in the original, in the end, it felt incredibly unsatisfying. This is likely because I was (and perhaps many others) were in for the ride for our good pals Hei and Yin, only to find that any clarity of their well-being has been tossed out the window for mystery and ambiguity. While this might perhaps be an interesting development in another kind of story, the focus on Hei's character throughout much of the episodes makes it incredibly questionable why such a conclusion was even thought to be favorable. Still, I was quite intrigued and satisfied with Suou's ending despite the bait and switch conclusion, which honestly while it felt rather out of the blue, still felt nice as it was contemplative while still being somewhat cathartic for her character.Regarding music, the neo-noir jazzy sound has been replaced for a more electronic-house styled sound. While I really did love the original's noir inspired music, I quite enjoyed the new sound. Still, I have to admit that it was way less connected to the atmosphere and style of this second season than the noir sound was with the first.Viewers who wanted more of the same or who have not seen Gaiden would likely find this sequel to be poor. I can't blame them for the series could have attempted for a smoother transition, but still, if the second season was more or less the same as the first, would a second season even be necessary? The first season may not have ended things as nicely as I would've liked, but it at least felt complete, as if the entirety of Darker than Black could've ended there. So, I really admire the crew's boldness and willingness to experiment and give a relevant reason for a second season.Concluding, discarding its neo-noir influence, this Darker than Black sequel takes risky turns on the curved road. While it did make its destination, the path remains more or less in shambles of some kind.

Digimon Adventure tri. 1: Saikai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25687/Digimon_Adventure_tri_1__Saikai,"['I can\'t express my disappointment in this. Maybe my expectations were too high coming into this, although I lowered it after hearing some bad things about the studio that produced this, but it\'s unbelievable how some aspects seem to be WORSE than the show from ~15 years ago.The story is interesting so far. We start out with the re-introduction of our characters excluding the Digimon 02 characters. (What happened to them anyways? What were those scenes in the beginning supposed to mean? We still have a few more parts left so I won\'t comment on it for now) Anyways there\'s also this secret agent...group whom we\'ll hopefully get to know more about. We don\'t have a lot of information about what\'s going on and I think it\'s okay to leave it like that since this part is probably supposed to serve as an introduction for the main plot.In contrast to this part\'s title ""Reunion"" which is supposed to be impactful for us viewers since the characters make a return after over a decade, the reunion I saw here didn\'t give me personally any feels. I also disliked how they only showed the reunion between 3 pairs and left out the rest. Anyways, the kids are teenagers now and of course a change in their thinking can be expected. Taichi, who used to be the courageous one and always lead the group into new battles, falls in an inner conflict which is totally fine. But then the final scene just completely nullifies Taichi\'s development as a character as he seems to show little emotion about the city\'s partial destruction and even letting Alphamon escape. Well if there\'s something interesting about the characters it would probably the potential formation of love interests.The visuals in this show is also very appalling. A lot of still frames are to be seen and the characters\' faces sometimes are weird. However, what disappoints me the most is how they didn\'t even bother animating the digimons\' evolutions beyond the champion level. Like what were they thinking when they made this decision? I don\'t know if it\'s only me, but a big part of the nostalgia comes from the EPIC evolution scenes. Nevertheless, I think the battle scenes were pretty good although the lack of sound annoyed me a little bit. (just lots of boom & crash sounds) HOWEVER, the final battle was just absolutely trash. The build up was very nice with Taichi trying to overcome his inner conflict and you\'d expect a really cool battle between our villain and Omegamon, but nah Agumon and Gabumon just digivolve one stage after another (WITHOUT BEING ANIMATED) after seeing that their attacks have no effect on Alphamon. Anyways we finally come to the battle between Alphamon and Omegamon! Sword and axe crossing each other 2 or 3 times and cannons being shot around 3 times and then Alphamon makes his way out and that\'s it. Yeah. No comment.As for the sound, they used a remake of the original OP and some of the OST from the original show if I remember correctly and I found it very positive. The usage of instrumental of the song as the OST was also pretty nice.All in all, though, it was still very disappointing and I hope to see something better in the upcoming parts of the movie. group whom we\'ll hopefully get to know more about.

Almost anyone who grew up watching anime will heard of this from somewhere. Even if you haven’t, Digimon is a series that was well-known when it first debuted. (and still is!) The franchise was introduced to the world that focuses on entities, known as Digital Monsters. These creatures are made of data that exists in their own parallel world known as the Digital World. However, their universe also crosses over the real world where chosen humans (known as Digidestined) are partnered with certain Digimon to fight against evil.First things out of the way, this movie takes place after the second season also...known as Digimon Adventures Season 2. Previous knowledge of the franchise is important to gain a better experience from watching the movie. This is because the kids that we’ve known from the previous seasons are back but also grown up. Their high school years takes them with a youthful development over their characters. And while all this seems normal at first, the story quickly turns abnormal.The story itself is consistent with the premise and overall style of Digimon Adventures. Contrary to Digimon Tamers, it retains a lighthearted mood in the real world. Thus, expect some amusing comedy coming from the cast. We meet the main characters including Taichi, Yamato, Izumi, Mimi, Joe, etc. What I find appealing about them is that although they changed physically, they still retain their personalities and are the characters that we can continue to adore.  Their relationships with one another implies there’s a growing feelings between a few pairs; in other words, beyond just childhood friendships. At the same time, the characters show what they’ve learned and are open minded with one another. That same can be applied to the Digimon partners as they still remember who they are and relationships remain strong despite the time skip. And that’s another prominent aspect of Digimon I really find enjoyable – the relationship between humans and non-human characters. It emphasizes how they can co-exist despite their different nature. And it also shows why exactly friendships can be so important between them no matter how long time has passed.Despite the fine developments of the overall movie, there’s still problems I found that should be addressed. The introduction of a new female character is something that can be controversial especially since her personality isn’t anything unique. In the role of the movie, her presence lacks anything memorable for the role she plays. Speaking of characters, there’s some other prominent characters from the second season that seems to be omitted from the movie. The presence of a secret organization can be a fragment of what some fans can remember from Digimon Tamers. Unfortunately, they don’t seem to be anything unique about them and in fact looks stereotypical. And finally, there’s a lack of coherence about the main threat of the movie. I mean, it’s hard to tell in the end what the characters are fighting for or against. Perhaps this could a better focus for the sequel.Originally, I had some issues with the animation style after seeing the previews. However, I can say with confidence that the movie lives up to its promise to deliver action. Whether it’s in the real world or in digital style action, the performance is aesthetic and retains smooth choreography. In addition, the Digimon are also well designed with their original features. The parts with the Digi-evolution can be a mixed bag though when examined carefully but still is decent in overall terms of quality. The easiest part to notice is the different art style produced by Toei. It does have some lack of the old school feel when compared to the original series. After all, the kids have grown up and they have developed both mentally and physically. From my standpoint, the way the characters are designed can be easily attached to once you get into 10 or so minutes of the movie. It hardly is bothering as the movie itself retains the feel of what Digimon really was.It’s more than a nostalgic trip. Digimon Adventures Tri: Saikai (Reunion) is here to remind us that the franchise is still going strong even after all those years of childhood memories. The Digidestineds are back from who they were before and their partners are here to kick some ass as well. What can be improved for the continuation (Chapter 2) should be the storytelling about the antagonists. And in addition, the new female character needs a bit more of characterization. But for now, this is definitely worth waiting for. After 15 years of Summer vacation, the kids are back. known as Digimon Adventures Season 2.

I loved the character design and the sound track is very nostalgic. (love the new digivolving sequence, and didn't get tired of it at all).  One of the things that I don't like about the first movie was that the story and character development is very lacking in terms of dynamic. There wasn't a moment in the whole movie where I was like, yep, this is what it meant to be. I love the fact they trying to emphasized on my favorite main character Tai, but I...felt the story and conflict are very unjustifiable and dramatized. If you want to attract older audience, make the story darker and realistic, but if you want to attract younger audience, make the action scene more dynamic. From what I have seen, it's like they trying to balance these two elements only to barely pass in both of them.  Speaking of action, I love the first fight scene between Greymon and Kuwagamon. But during the last fight, Gabumon and Agumon evolved to Omegamon in the course of 20 seconds makes my 23 year old common sense tingling. Why didn't they do that when they were fighting Kuwagamon....and the fight scene is developed way worse than when Greymon fight against Kuwagamon. It's suppose to be the fight of the movie, and they just rushed and telling the audience time is up, better luck next in the next movie. Overall, I give the first movie an 8/10, the art and sound is very good, the story and character, not so much. Then again, this is just the first movie, out of six. Movie 1 did not break me, and it does have a hook wanting me to watch for more. They still have rooms and opportunity to improve, so let's continue watching our childhood hero to grow up again. felt the story and conflict are very unjustifiable and dramatized.

Digimon Adventure, as it is officially called, aired in 1999 and became an internationally well-known anime that spawned several films and spin-offs with the latest being Digimon Xros Wars in 2010. Other than Digimon Adventure and its direct sequel, Digimon Adventure 02, all Digimon series take place in separate universes. This new film, however, plays three years after the events of 02.Some time after its initial announcement, Digimon Adventure tri was revealed to be a six-part film series rather than a TV anime. Moreover, its release...date was pushed from summer to November 2015. Needless to say, fans were disappointed by the fact that it would air in November and worried they might have to wait a long time until they can finally watch it due to it being a film. However, Crunchyroll unexpectedly simulcasted Digimon Adventure tri, making it available for the entire world even before it aired in Japanese cinemas.The film starts by reintroducing the Chosen Children from Digimon Adventure. The main focus is on Taichi but all the other children receive enough focus so that the viewer knows how they have changed over the past few years. It also shows how the relationships between the characters has developed; there are, for example, several moments in which Sora's affection towards Yamato is being hinted at. Additionally, you can see how Jou does not have time to meet with the other Chosen Children due to him having to study for school. This behaviour splendidly builds upon Jou's personality from Adventure and 02 and is consequently remarkably realistic.Digimon Adventure tri manages to stay true to its origin by perfectly recreating the feeling one has while watching the TV series. At the same time, however, it deals with themes not present in the original as the children have grown. For example, Taichi is worried about the destruction they cause by fighting against Digimon, which contrasts his rash personality from before. Romance is also often being hinted at – in the past, there have merely been some subtle moments but this time, it is present much stronger. Moreover, a secret organization reminiscent of Digimon Tamers' Hypnos and Digimon Savers' DATS has been founded in order to research Digimon and to combat the infected ones. Due to the events in the previous series which posed a threat against humanity, it is only logical that an organization such as this would be founded.As diverse and well-developed as the children's characters are, the Digimon's personalities are, unfortunately, somewhat bland, which had already been a problem in the TV anime. They all act basically the same and while Gatomon/Tailmon used to have a strong personality, no signs of it are shown in this film. The Digimon act like catalysts which cause the children to grow but they hardly develop themselves. While this has always been the case, it would be welcome if this changed in the upcoming films.There are also some new characters introduced. Meiko, a transfer student, is a mysterious girl, who seems to have a secret. We do not get to know much about her but it is obvious that she will play a crucial role in the future. Moreover, some important members of aforementioned secret organization are part of this new adventure but, at this point, not much is known about them either. While there is also a new antagonist, it is unknown what his motives are and where he came from and whether he is actually bad. As such, the viewer does not yet know what the children's goal is or where the plot is heading towards. However, being the first of six films, this poses no huge issue as this film's main purpose is to reintroduce the characters and to demonstrate in which manner they have developed in the past three years.Naturally, not everything is explained in this film. We are informed about the fact that the Digital gate had been closed for over a year but we do not know why it was closed in the first place. At the end of 02, it seemed like it would be open for all time. While this might be explained in the future, there are some other aspects that pose an inconsistency regarding what we know from Adventure and 02. For example, in the film, it seems like only few people know about the Digimon's existence. However, due to the fight with Apocalymon at the end of Adventure and, more importantly, the battle with BelialVamdemon/MaloMyotismon at the end of 02, the entire world should be familiar with Digimon. Nonetheless, they are merely referred to as threats who had caused some major damage in the past. There might be some sort of explanation including memory erasing but this is unlikely and would probably not be satisfactory.When the film's first official artworks were released, most people were upset and claimed that the characters looked completely different. However, with the release of some trailers, it was made clear that the new art style and character design were not bad at all. Nevertheless, there is another issue in a similar department: Toei Animation's recent works all suffer from bad animation, as one can see in Dragon Ball Super, Sailor Moon Crystal and the newer episodes of One Piece. With Digimon being a film, one would think this would not be the case this time and while it is not as bad as aforementioned examples, the animation looks awkward more often than bearable. It is fine during action scenes but, other than that, animation quality is regrettably disappointing. The new evolution scenes are entirely different from what the viewer is used to and, at first, it might feel slightly awkward but they actually are not bad. A major issue, however, is that not all evolution sequences were animated. These scenes were an aspect of the film a majority of the fan base was looking forward to. Hopefully, these evolutions will be animated in the future because otherwise it would be an unforgivable disappointment.The Digimon Soundtrack's original composer, Arisawa Takanori, sadly passed away in 2005. Nonetheless, some tracks of the amazing Digimon Adventure OST were used in this film and lead to nostalgic moments. Some of his works were also remixed and while it sounds pleasing at most times, the one soundtrack that sounded infinitely better in the original is Koushiro's/Izzy's theme. There are also some new musical pieces which are nice but, unfortunately, not as breathtaking as Arisawa's. The opening is “Butter-Fly” by Wada Kouji and the ending song is “I Wish” by AiM. Both are remixes of the original series' opening/ending sung by their original performers and it is difficult to decide which version is better. In any case, both songs not only create a nostalgic atmosphere but also establish a refreshing feeling to underline the film's modernness. The same can be said about “Brave Heart”, an insert song sung by Miyazaki Ayumi, which primarily plays during the evolution sequences.Another qualm some people initially had was the fact that the children's voice actors were different. However, the new voice actors fit the children's personality impressively well and their performance could not have been much better –  in particular, Yamato's voice actor, Hosoya Yoshimasa,  did a magnificent job. Of course, the same can be said about the Digimon's voice actors, who all returned to their original roles.Ultimately, this film can be recommended to every Digimon fan out there. It might have some weaknesses but, being an introductory film, it cannot be a masterpiece. The good sites heavily outweigh the weaker ones and the enjoyment level while watching the film is over the top. Digimon Adventure tri 1 is a great start to a new adventure together with the characters and the atmosphere of the original series and I cannot wait to see the second part in Winter 2016. date was pushed from summer to November 2015. Needless to say, fans were disappointed by the fact that it would air in November and worried they might have to wait a long time until they can finally watch it due to it being a film. However, Crunchyroll unexpectedly simulcasted Digimon Adventure tri, making it available for the entire world even before it aired in Japanese cinemas.The film starts by reintroducing the Chosen Children from Digimon Adventure. The main focus is on Taichi but all the other children receive enough focus so that the viewer knows how they have changed over the past few years. It also shows how the relationships between the characters has developed; there are, for example, several moments in which Sora's affection towards Yamato is being hinted at. Additionally, you can see how Jou does not have time to meet with the other Chosen Children due to him having to study for school. This behaviour splendidly builds upon Jou's personality from Adventure and 02 and is consequently remarkably realistic.Digimon Adventure tri manages to stay true to its origin by perfectly recreating the feeling one has while watching the TV series. At the same time, however, it deals with themes not present in the original as the children have grown. For example, Taichi is worried about the destruction they cause by fighting against Digimon, which contrasts his rash personality from before. Romance is also often being hinted at – in the past, there have merely been some subtle moments but this time, it is present much stronger. Moreover, a secret organization reminiscent of Digimon Tamers' Hypnos and Digimon Savers' DATS has been founded in order to research Digimon and to combat the infected ones. Due to the events in the previous series which posed a threat against humanity, it is only logical that an organization such as this would be founded.As diverse and well-developed as the children's characters are, the Digimon's personalities are, unfortunately, somewhat bland, which had already been a problem in the TV anime. They all act basically the same and while Gatomon/Tailmon used to have a strong personality, no signs of it are shown in this film. The Digimon act like catalysts which cause the children to grow but they hardly develop themselves. While this has always been the case, it would be welcome if this changed in the upcoming films.There are also some new characters introduced. Meiko, a transfer student, is a mysterious girl, who seems to have a secret. We do not get to know much about her but it is obvious that she will play a crucial role in the future. Moreover, some important members of aforementioned secret organization are part of this new adventure but, at this point, not much is known about them either. While there is also a new antagonist, it is unknown what his motives are and where he came from and whether he is actually bad. As such, the viewer does not yet know what the children's goal is or where the plot is heading towards. However, being the first of six films, this poses no huge issue as this film's main purpose is to reintroduce the characters and to demonstrate in which manner they have developed in the past three years.Naturally, not everything is explained in this film. We are informed about the fact that the Digital gate had been closed for over a year but we do not know why it was closed in the first place. At the end of 02, it seemed like it would be open for all time. While this might be explained in the future, there are some other aspects that pose an inconsistency regarding what we know from Adventure and 02. For example, in the film, it seems like only few people know about the Digimon's existence. However, due to the fight with Apocalymon at the end of Adventure and, more importantly, the battle with BelialVamdemon/MaloMyotismon at the end of 02, the entire world should be familiar with Digimon. Nonetheless, they are merely referred to as threats who had caused some major damage in the past. There might be some sort of explanation including memory erasing but this is unlikely and would probably not be satisfactory.When the film's first official artworks were released, most people were upset and claimed that the characters looked completely different. However, with the release of some trailers, it was made clear that the new art style and character design were not bad at all. Nevertheless, there is another issue in a similar department: Toei Animation's recent works all suffer from bad animation, as one can see in Dragon Ball Super, Sailor Moon Crystal and the newer episodes of One Piece. With Digimon being a film, one would think this would not be the case this time and while it is not as bad as aforementioned examples, the animation looks awkward more often than bearable. It is fine during action scenes but, other than that, animation quality is regrettably disappointing. The new evolution scenes are entirely different from what the viewer is used to and, at first, it might feel slightly awkward but they actually are not bad. A major issue, however, is that not all evolution sequences were animated. These scenes were an aspect of the film a majority of the fan base was looking forward to.

It spends a large amount of time doing absolutely nothing. The first episode has maybe 5 minutes of plot, at most, and it continues along this plodding pace for most of the movie. Even the action seems slow.This is apparent in the characters as well, where it builds artificial tension by portraying Tai as having PTSD without actually explaining why other than still shots of destroyed buildings. I think I know what they were trying to go for, but they executed this TERRIBLY.This laziness in storytelling carries over into the...art and animation, where half of the shots are still frames, or still frames with just the main characters running. It looks like they ran out of the animation budget 5 minutes into the movie. Speaking of which, the animation of the fights are...adequate. But they skip vital animations including some of the digivolutions (the most badass ones that we ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE).The sound was mostly okay, until the climactic battle. The score ANNIHILATED any tension in the scene, deciding to play a victorious melody throughout the entire fight. Rather than feeding the conflict, it belies the intensity.Even if this is meant to be an introductory movie, it was lackluster at the best of times, and unwatchable at worst. art and animation, where half of the shots are still frames, or still frames with just the main characters running.

When Butter-fly started playing, i really felt like crying. It's been like what, 15 years? Damn, to think that the me from that time would stop whatever he was doing just to sit in front of the TV and watch the new Digimon episode with a smile the size of this world and the next...... well, it's certainly a tremendous trip down memory lane, in more ways than one. And one that i end up cherishing a lot since it connects me to a period of great happiness in my life. That's what childhood is or at least that's...how it should be for any child. An overhwhelmingly sweet moment in our way too complicated lives when we are blessed with an endless avalanche of happiness and dreams and innocence. When we are the most genuine and the emotions we feel have the most authenticity to it. Where the mundane becomes extraordinary in the most ordinary ways. Truly an unmeasurably important and almost unforgivably ephemeral period in life.Ehem. Going back to Digimon. Well, i won't talk much about the story and the plot cause to me that's the least important. Hell, i didn't even remember most of the characters names by the time i watched this, much less the story. However, i still remembered what i had to remember. The bromance between the two main guys. The glorious soundtrack. The glorious soundtrack (yes, it should be mentioned at least twice). The nostalgic digi-evolution scenes. Tai and Agumon. The other children and their digimon. Their interactions with each other.Stuff i thought i had forgotten ages ago, but somehow managed to naturally remember once these new episodes started playing. Even if this sequel flops hard, i don't think i even care. The fact that i was able to revisit this series, listen to the opening theme and see the characters (now much older) interact with each other once again is more than enough. It made me extremely happy.Ok, enough reminiscing, so here's some random thoughts about the actual episodes i would also like to point out (spoilers ahead, so read at your own risk):- the animation quality started horribly with a lot of QUALITY scenes but the ending episodes were much better, and i think my eyes also started getting used to the character designs and overall animation; it must be worth noting that while this is a Toei production, i read that no Toei animators actually worked on it, i wonder if it will happen the same in the 2nd movie (and whether that is a good thing or not)- the ost is as great and nostalgic as i remember it, truly a pleasure to listen to!- all that bromance, fuck yeah! that's what this sh*t is all about, screw all the hetero shipping faggotry when all the other ships completely pale in comparison to the mighty Yamato x Taichi ship, the one true bros we need but do not deserve- speaking of Yamato, was he always this likable? when i was a kid, i'm pretty sure i hated his guts, but in this sequel i find him pretty nice- Taichi is now worried about collateral damage and killing people and i'm not sure how i should feel about this, but those moments at the riverside with Agumon hit me right in the feels- gotta mention the unneeded love triangle, aka the elephant in the room (or should i say the elephantmon? heh :v), which is back again, and in full force, it seems...- well, here's the thing: when i was a child i think i had a major crush on Sora (now that i think about it, it might have been because of the cute hat, and also that one Digimon Movie when she was dating(?) Taichi), so i obviously liked her and wanted her to end up with Tai; then i got kinda pissed when i later found out that she chose Yamato instead; nowadays, and after watching Tri, i find myself wondering what's so special about her and think the two guys deserve much better, to be honest :/- there is a new girl now (probably she only exists so that Taichi doesn't end up with his left/right hand), but the bad news is that i usually end up disliking this kind of character archetype, so let's hope i don't this time but i honestly think i will- Takeru x Hikari better happen, those two kids are super likable!All things considered, i'm glad Digimon is back and i'll definitely be watching the next movie/batch of episodes. It was truly a pleasure reliving a bit of my childhood with these first 4 episodes! how it should be for any child.

It was truly a pleasure reliving a bit of my childhood with these first 4 episodes!"", 'Maybe I was expecting too much, but the truth is that I\'m pretty disapointed. I think by now we all know that Toei animation has been doing a very mediocre job with their animation, but this time they managed to hit a new low. Digimon seems to be suffering from a worse fate than Sailor Moon Crystal and Dragon Ball Super.SPOILERS AHEAD, IF YOU HAVEN\'T WATCHED THE MOVIE THEN STOP READING NOW. Unless you don\'t care about spoilers, that\'s fine too.So lets start this and see why.Story: 7Seems pretty average so far and I was actually disapointed with some scenes, said scenes should have made...use of the nostalgia factor and made for some great emotional moments, like the digidestined reunion with their partner digimons, it would only be logical, right? After all, they spent so much time without seeing them, WE spent so much time without seeing both digimon and children so it should have all been an emotional reunion for us lot.But aparently not..The characters and digimons seemed overly casual about it and there was hardly any emotional factor there, it left me apathic and disapointed on how they wasted such a great oportunity.Then we have Taichi and Yamato clashing, a classic indeed, it\'s just how we all remember them, except this time around Taichi has changed and is no longer the corageous and impulsive leader he once was. Completly fine here, room for some good character development, however it can be a bit confusing why Taichi is having second thoughts about it sometimes. Yet he manages to pull himself together and realise he needs to fight in order to protect others, something he seems to have forgoten by the end of the battle agaisnt Alphamon, considering his apathetic and unsure atitude again.So far the best thing out of Digimon Tri has been the love insterests and such, those were actually fun to watch.I must say though, the addition of a new character seems interesting enough, firstly because of her digimon who seems to be hiding? And also because of her Digivice, the way it looks seems to imply she\'s from the same time as Taichi and the others, unlike Hikari and TK who have different digivices from the rest. This is something I\'m curious about and looking forward to the explanation later on.Art: 4Oh boy where do I start, Toei did it again guys, terrible lazy animation, a lot, and I\'d like to give emphasis to the word ""A LOT"" here, there\'s a lot of stills and camera panning across the screen on Digimon Tri, really a lot of stills of characters not doing anything. Ocasionally we have a character saying ""yeah"" and their mouth keeps shut too. The animation is just, poor, very blocky, you could sometimes count the amount of frames they used to animate something. For a movie this sure is disapointing. Aren\'t movies suposed to have better quality because of the bigger budget and deadlines?The characters also looked very weird sometimes, they looked dowright deformed on some instances as they werent drawn properly.Another thing I that dissapointed me were the digivolutions. Yes, the  most important and iconic thing about digimon and they managed to screw it up, now the normal digivolutions are fine, no where as much action and eye candy as the old ones but they\'re okay. Now what\'s beyond me is how the rest of the digivolutions weren\'t animated, so Garurumon and Greymon just suddenly appear digivolved again, out of nowhere, and it happens again and again, untill suddenly they digivolve into Omegamon. If this isn\'t being lazy, then I don\'t know what it is.It was horribly anti-climatic and downright ridiculous. Not to mention it makes you think, if they they could easily get past their first digivolution in order to get stronger, then why didn\'t other digimon do the same? Surely it would have made their lifes easier.Sound: 7While it wasn\'t amazing, it wasn\'t bad either, it was just right. The new versions of the old opening and ending were very nice touches, if they wanted to give us some nostalgia, they sure nailed it there. I also noticed some of the songs used throughout the movie were from the old digimon soundtrack, so the feeling of nostalgia was there throughout the whole thing and I give them props for that.Character: 8This is the part I probably liked the best, some characters changed, some didn\'t, others not so much, but they\'re still the same old characters we grew to know and love, their personalities and relationships are still there, but they\'ve also grown and we\'re able to see that. It\'s always satisfying to see your favourite characters again after some years and noticing that their personalities are still there, so you easily recognize them. For example how cheerfull Mimi is, or how Taichi and Yamato often clash due to their personalities. We know all that too well and personaly, I\'m glad to see it all again, it\'s nostalgia all over the place in that sense.Enjoyment: 5Even though the movie had its good points.. they werent the right ones, so I can\'t say this was very enjoyable. Unfortunately good music and good characters don\'t make up for bad art and average story telling. If one of those two had been good, then surely my opinion would differ.Overall: 6It\'s fair, it\'s average. It\'s not too bad but it\'s far from being very good too.It was a very disapointing experience in overall, this was something many of us grew up with and longed for, obviously that created a lot of hype and expectations, except that was all taken away quickly. I honestly expected a lot better considering the franchise we\'re dealing with.But then again we too expected a lot better from Sailor Moon Crystal and such, and those expectations fell way short. A shame really.However I must say I\'ll keep watching this, not only because of the story, but mostly out of nostalgia. Had I been new to Digimon, I\'m not sure if I would stick around for the next one.So here\'s to hoping the next movie will be better. use of the nostalgia factor and made for some great emotional moments, like the digidestined reunion with their partner digimons, it would only be logical, right?

Suffice to say, although the look is different, the feel is still there.I think there are more people familiar with Digimon than not. But for those who aren\'t, what\'s always separated Digimon from the often compared-to Pokemon is how they approach their material. Aside from the fact that Digimon has approached darker and more complex themes across its seasons, part of its appeal has also been its focus on the characters. Battles and character quirks are perhaps done better in Pokemon, but for Digimon, much of...its best content centers around inner struggles that characters have and their growth from dealing with them. The events in the Digimon world usually parallel and reflect these struggles, providing both high stakes and visual manifestations.The first movie did a good job in reuniting the characters, reintroducing their various quirks and relationships naturally with some sprinkles of fanservice (not nudity, but stuff for ""fans""). The story moved along at a good pace, relaxed while bringing characters together and speeding up once the action started. It\'s also kept another facet that differentiated Digimon, which is how it embraces the impact of Digimon on the real world rather than just skirting around it with resets or isolated boundaries.And I believe this is the reason why this sequel does well in embodying the Digimon spirit. As mentioned before, Digimon\'s never been too afraid of going into more mature themes and messages, so it\'s always been able to bring in some real stakes for tension while balancing it out with lighthearted moments. And that continues here, with good use of foreshadowing and music to transition cleanly from warm to suspenseful atmospheres.This somewhat extends to the art and animation, which suffers quite a bit from still-frames and pans. I may have some rose-colored glasses on though as other Digimon series had many of these issues, with really well-animated segments usually being the influence of particular directors. That said, this is technically a movie series and the animation will seem stilted in comparison to some other Digimon movies. The new character designs didn\'t bother me too much as they are flexible enough to convey subtle emotions quite well, which is necessary for a character-driven show like this.Overall, I can confidently say that this new addition to the franchise won\'t disappoint Digimon fans. It\'s definitely got the spirit of the show and looks to be tying up some loose ends too, for those fans that were left hanging with the end of Adventure 02.

Watched every episode and movie, and had all the cards. And I am all for blinding myself with nostalgia, but this is a monstrosity of epic proportions, even going into it with zero expectations.From the start we have Tai. Yes he looks like Tai, but apparently in the 6 year hiatus he has encountered some, as of yet unknown, tragic event that caused all aspects of his personality to shrivel into nothingness.And this goes for all of the characters....Yes, they look like older versions of the characters, but maintain zero percent of their original personality, or any personality for that matter. Of course you would expect that they had matured and changed over the years, and it would have been really cool to see our favorite characters all grown up, sadly they have reduced the characters to no more than conduits for spouting digital monsters.I am sure most Digimon fans would agree that the part I most looked forward to was seeing how the characters had matured and what their lives were like now, and how their relationships progressed. I am quite sad to report that it contains none of these aspects. The characters are just so unbelievably bad that it cannot be expressed in words. Its as if they are androids that stripped the skin off of the old characters and are trying to act like them so that their families don\'t realize they are facsimiles of their former loved ones. And the fashion the characters reunite in is on the same shallow level. They just sort of meet up. Here is a re-enactment ""Sup dudes, Digimon right"" ""Yeah Digimon"" No explanation of how their lives have been or how anything has changed.In short the characters and story are shallow enough to stand in and not get wet.Now we get to my main beef. The animation. OHHHHHHH the animation. Now I am the most lax person when it comes to animation. Sure I absolutely love gorgeous animation, but when someone on a forum or review says ""the animation was bad/sub-par"" I usually think ""Huh? didn\'t even notice/looked fine to me"" This is the first time I have ever been struck with a powerful sense of ""jeez this is some garbo animation"" I didn\'t even notice Twintails had bad animation. Yes you read that correctly TWINTAILS HAS FAR SUPERIOR ANIMATION THAN DIGIMON ADVENTURE TRI. Even the most basic scenes are inconsistent infantile garbage. It doesn\'t get better in fights either. You wait, what is it 2 episodes, for the fight just to see some frames that they apparently dug out of the dumpster out back. Now to be fair Toei has stated that "" We had some issues reassembling the faulty cels from the paper shredder, but we have our best animators working on a cure"" Fair enough Toei. I\'ll give you a chance since your most recent shows have had seriously top notch animation.And yes I am aware that Digimon is not known for its animation quality, but seriously, I have seen better animation etched on the walls of caves.Music. Okay. It is possible that I went temporarily lost my hearing due to the sensory overload from the animation, but no complaints.So, in conclusion, this show is pathetic and fails to entertain in any way imaginable. This will bring you no joy, no sorrow, no love, no nostalgia, if you can make it through the gauntlet of mediocrity(at best) there will be nothing left. You will be reduced to a husk. A shell of what you once were. You will effectively become Digimon Adventure Tri, something that looks familiar and lively, but devoid of all life once you peel away the thin layer of delusion. If you wish to maintain your human form DO NOT watch this...for there is no return. I write this with my final breath, my fingers are slowly turning to ash as I type...my vision fades...and as I slip into the void a faint sound is heard...at first I think this is the angel of death calling my soul into his realm. But no. The noise intensifies. Still subtle...I cannot make out what it is saying. Suddenly my bones shake, my teeth feel as if they are forcing their way deeper into my skull, the pain is unbearable, it becomes clear what the noise is...how could i forget. Liam you damn fool... I laugh as the noise envelops me. I know that it is the last thing I will ever hear...""DIGIMON DIGITAL MONSTERS, DIGIMON ARE THE CHAMPIONS! DIGIMON DIGITAL MONSTERS, DIGIMON ARE THE CHAMPIONS!!""

DIGIMON DIGITAL MONSTERS, DIGIMON ARE THE CHAMPIONS!!""', 'I\'m going to be perfectly honest, as children television shows go, particularly anime, Digimon is one of the best examples of going well beyond just selling the audience a silly toy or other apparels. In comparison to the obvious ""inspiration"" that is Pokemon, it was clear Digimon\'s story had far more thought put into it, but there are reasons to why Pokemon is more relevant than Digimon in today\'s pop culture, but this isn\'t the place to talk about that.In a ""surprising"" announcement made over a year ago, Toei animation confirmed another Digimon series in the works. The real surprise, however, was that this new...series is to be a direct sequel to Digimon Adventure 02.I\'ll be honest, after the disaster that was both Sailor Moon Crystal and Dragonball Super, my expectations were tempered to lesser extend than what my inner child wanted to be excited about. More and more teasers started to come out, the character designs were revealed, and fans became staved for more. Initially I was a bit disappointed in the new designs (Not the digimon though, they look true to the original and better than they ever did), the human cast was stricken with many called ""Same face"" syndrome.It didn\'t help that like Sailor Moon Crystal, Digimon Tri was also pushed back and was changed into a different format, to be released as movies instead of a new tv series. More and more I started to doubt this new project, something to be a cash grab on the series\' 15th anniversary.Then it finally came out yesterday, to most countries thanks to Crunchyroll\'s surprise announcement of streaming it on their service.All of my previous fears were immediately put to rest, the more I watched, the more apparent that unlike Toei\'s other failures, this one was indeed something for all of the ""digidestined"" of the world, something worth the wait and hits squarely right in the childhood with great care and attention.Set three years after 02, Tri picks up at the cast currently going through their highschool years. (I\'m going to refer to the character\'s original Japanese names, sorry Foxbox generation, though the names aren\'t too radically different) Taichi (Tai) is still playing soccer, Yamato (Matt) broke up; with his band and made a new one with one only a highschool boy would think up, Sora (Sora, see what I mean) is apparently still dating Yamato, Koushiro (Izzy, okay this one was a bit sketchy) is still the computer wiz we all still loved (Who even creates a set of goggles for Taichi that have plot relevance now), Jo (Joe) is still studying his ass off but even has a girlfriend now that we don\'t get to see (Don\'t worry, even the cast themselves are questioning this declaration), Mimi (Mimi... lol) still gallivanting in North America but manages to make it back in time for the this new series,  Hikari (Kari) is more of older sister to Taichi rather than a younger one, though Taichi is still a bit immature it only makes my observation more solid, and Takeru (TK) who\'s more or less still the same, bit of a lady killer as Hikari points out (Why aren\'t they dating yet?). And there\'s a new digidestined, who I will not spoil though it\'s very obvious but isn\'t revealed until the last part of the movie (Or four part anime that Crunchyroll decided to it split up into).Not one character acts completely out of character, everyone is how they have been 15 years ago and Tri goes far beyond the call to stay in continuity (There\'s a few retcons that seem to be brewing, but as a fan of digimon that witnessed the end of 02, I hope they do). The character banter is just like old times, Koushiro still goes into his own world when speaking tech, Mimi is still a bit bratty and over enthusiast, and Taichi and Yamato still get at each other\'s throats. The only thing that feels off is that Taichi kinda worries about things that we would expect coming from Yamato, it\'s feels so contrived. Speaking of which, Tri kinda goes out of it\'s way to be too nostalgic at times.The conflict between Taichi and Yamato just feels incredibly forced, like there was some sort of nostalgia quota that needed to be filled. Sure they fought in the past, but here it seems like it\'s only here to fill in time. The pacing itself is a bit on the slow side compared to the original series, but I feel like it\'s like this to enforce the change to the cast and tone of this season of Digimon. It\'s got a slice of life pacing going on and even feels like one too, but when the digimon finally come in, the pacing gets only a little bit faster.One of the things I was worried most for was the quality of the animation, Toei isn\'t exactly known for their stellar craftsmanship in this category, and given the state of Sailor Moon Crystal and Dragonball Super, I had all more reason to be more than concerned. While it\'s nothing particularly breath taking, especially as a movie release, it\'s still far above what the television series had reached. The Digimon designs are true to the originals, and even the previously mentioned ""Same face"" syndrome worry is mitigated with each character having more nuanced expressions in animated form and subtle differences. The animation does appear to be a bit more jerky in action scenes making it more apparent that the project has a television show budget and was originally produced to be one, but it\'s nothing worth taking points off from, it\'s very exciting and dynamic and that\'s all we want after all (And not that chicken scratch they call animation on Dragonball Super).Digimon Adventure Tri started as something I was worried about, but the end project fills me with hope for the next 5 installments. The amount of heart warming fanservice and attention the small details will more than satisfy all old fans and old fans only, but be honest, this is story only for the digidestined of the world, just how we wanted it to be... series is to be a direct sequel to Digimon Adventure 02.I\'ll be honest, after the disaster that was both Sailor Moon Crystal and Dragonball Super, my expectations were tempered to lesser extend than what my inner child wanted to be excited about.

They made such an amazing job on the story and gave everyone their deserved time, and wow, have they changed growing up, I\'m not a crier but some...moments were hard to keep the tears and memories back from my childhood. So I personally think they made a superb job with the first episode! 11/10. For the purpose of the episodes(first film) they made a great job on the story re-introducing all the old beloved characters!The Art of the series could not been better they\'ve really worked with it and it shows, I had big expectations and after seeing what they did I\'m not disappointed the least! The Art fits the series and makes it look so futuristic and awesome. We all know how the Anime creators have one style of making the series, and then often change the art style when making a film, Digimon Adventure tri, has that movie quality that beats everything I\'ve ever seen. 10/10.Sound was amazing also the intro music was awesome. And the rest of the soundtrack was so great really had that Digimon feeling to it, that we all grew up to! 10/10.The Characters, Oh do I love the characters, they\'ve changed so much these past years just as expected but they\'ve captured the original idea and characteristics behind them all. Mimi is still Mimi and the funny loving girl she was, Sora still can\'t handle Taichi and Yamato but still makes everything work in the group, Hikari still the adorable little girl she used to be, Takeru the playboy we always knew he would become :D, Koushirou the computer geek that we all love and that keeps our little digimons safe in the worst of times with his skills, Jou still going hardcore with life and always thinking, Taichi still the side alpha of the group and the oldest with his own attitude, Yamato the other side alpha that keeps the group together at the hardest times.and lets not forget our new member of the group Meiko the adorable new girl with her digimon Meicoomon.AND DON\'T FORGET! Agumon, Gabumon, Patamon, Gomamon, Palmon, Piyomon, Tailmon, Tentomon, That we all know and love 10/10.Enjoyment, I think you already know why I love this series by now, But to clarify, how the story made me feel, it feels like the original and they made the reunion feel like the best reunion there could ever be in a Anime. 10/10. They made me fall in love again!Overall 10/10 for these reasons, best series in 15 years! moments were hard to keep the tears and memories back from my childhood.

There are a few scenes with strangely drawn faces, I'll admit that, but for the most part it's fantastic. I love how fluid it is and how the colors look. It reminds me of the animation from the previous movies (Diablomon).The characters and voices are great. All the same actors as before, and I'm also okay with their decision to make Taichi hesitant to get involved in all of this again. Bringing back his old reservations from the first season could be fun to work with, as long as they...don't over do it. I also loved the new renditions of the OST. The addition of instruments makes a very fun sound.Fight scenes are great, and I LOVE that they don't have the Digimon screaming out each and every attack they use anymore. They just fight, and it makes it feel a lot smoother. As much as I love the first two seasons, it always irritated me how they would just verbally announce every single thing they were going to do.Cons:Why did they only show evolution animations for Adult level? That was a huge disappointment during the last fight with Alphamon... It just goes from Agumon in one scene, then suddenly he's Greymon, then he's Wargreymon out of nowhere, and finally we have Omegamon all of a sudden WITHOUT AN EVOLUTION SCENES IN BETWEEN. That just... makes no sense to me.I also don't buy that the Adventure crew hasn't once yet thought to try and contact the 02 kids. They've all met up to discuss what's going on twice now, and in neither case did anyone even attempt to reach out to Daisuke and the others. Not even Hikari or Takeru! Considering that the 02 kids carried the Adventure kids' asses and lead the fight against many enemies during the entirety of the second season, it makes no sense for them to just... forget about them like this. It feels like bad, lazy writing to me. Maybe there will be a reason in the next movie that will help this make sense, but for right now... I just don't buy it. don't over do it.

Adventure is an amazing show, with very mature themes in the plot and great characters. The sequel, Adventure 02 was not so good, with lame new characters and an awful ending. Tamers was so called Digimon 3 by TV marketing, but is a spin--off (a great one to be fair), so Digimon Adventure has ended with a bitter taste in the fans mouth.So I received the news of...a new Digimon Adventure with great expectation. Despite the awful ending, was a serie that I cared so much when child. And also, I was sick for a better ending as well.This first movie/OVA was a great surprise, and made me fell in love again with these beloved characters. But wait... again or for the first time? Yes, for shure, they are no kids anymore, they are teenagers now, with brand new personalities, dreams and dilemmas. Taichi (or Tai) is no more the lighthearted and flustered leader, he\'s more responsable  and rational now, and is terrified with the destruction that giant monsters can bring. Yes, bein heroic and fight the evil is not so easy when you are grown up, and I liked very much this new Tai. Yamato (or Matt) continue to be the heart of the group, always thinking in do good to others, a great exponent to the crest of friendship he carries. And is still the bad ass. Sora is no longer a tomboyish ""need pretend to be strong"" character, is more like  a cartaker and it seems to be the glue that will keep the group together. Also, the movie draws a possible romantic triangle between her, Tai and Matt. Takeru (or TK) is no longer the whining brat and awful character, is more joyfull and a womanizer project. Mimi is back from a long stay in america, is not more the childish one of the group, is the extroverted happy-go-lucky that stole the spotlight. Izumi (Izzy) continues to be the great computer geek and genie of the group, but have showed a new facet when confronted with the brand new Mimi that activates his libido. Joe and Kari are overshadowed by the others, but are still great indeed. The first have a new dillema in his college aplication marathon and is seen more studiyind than doing other stuff, and the second one, well... continues to be Tai\'s atractive little sister. I hope she gets more screentime in the next movies, she was extremely important in the old shows .As you can see, the story is more chacter driven and this is the great merit from this first installement, is presenting a nouveau regard over our old friends. As their bonds intesifies, their challenges seems to be greater then fight giant monsters. Speaking on that, yeah, they are back. And yes, we have also great action scenes and new misteries surrounding the Digiworld. The villaneous Digimon are stronger, and the old pet monster have a lot of work to do in the next chapters. Also,  a new Digidestined is the house. What she will bring?The animation is simply gorgeous. Toei is a studio that lost the good animation tram and keep the oldfashioned style managed to make a great job here. Also, the OST is back with the great old themes renewed and is simply outstanding.So, Digimon Adventure Tri is a great work that is trully shot through the heart of the nostalgic fans. Presenting old friends in a new path, and putting them in a comming of age plot is an excellent ideia. The characters are the soul of a good story  and Toei knows that. It\'s a love letter to the old fans and a great invitation to new ones. Digimon is more mature, more realistic, and a 100% awesome. Now that the  adventure had evolved, I can\'t wait for more! a new Digimon Adventure with great expectation. Despite the awful ending, was a serie that I cared so much when child. And also, I was sick for a better ending as well.This first movie/OVA was a great surprise, and made me fell in love again with these beloved characters. But wait... again or for the first time? Yes, for shure, they are no kids anymore, they are teenagers now, with brand new personalities, dreams and dilemmas. Taichi (or Tai) is no more the lighthearted and flustered leader, he\'s more responsable  and rational now, and is terrified with the destruction that giant monsters can bring. Yes, bein heroic and fight the evil is not so easy when you are grown up, and I liked very much this new Tai. Yamato (or Matt) continue to be the heart of the group, always thinking in do good to others, a great exponent to the crest of friendship he carries. And is still the bad ass. Sora is no longer a tomboyish ""need pretend to be strong"" character, is more like  a cartaker and it seems to be the glue that will keep the group together. Also, the movie draws a possible romantic triangle between her, Tai and Matt. Takeru (or TK) is no longer the whining brat and awful character, is more joyfull and a womanizer project. Mimi is back from a long stay in america, is not more the childish one of the group, is the extroverted happy-go-lucky that stole the spotlight. Izumi (Izzy) continues to be the great computer geek and genie of the group, but have showed a new facet when confronted with the brand new Mimi that activates his libido. Joe and Kari are overshadowed by the others, but are still great indeed. The first have a new dillema in his college aplication marathon and is seen more studiyind than doing other stuff, and the second one, well... continues to be Tai\'s atractive little sister. I hope she gets more screentime in the next movies, she was extremely important in the old shows .As you can see, the story is more chacter driven and this is the great merit from this first installement, is presenting a nouveau regard over our old friends. As their bonds intesifies, their challenges seems to be greater then fight giant monsters. Speaking on that, yeah, they are back. And yes, we have also great action scenes and new misteries surrounding the Digiworld. The villaneous Digimon are stronger, and the old pet monster have a lot of work to do in the next chapters. Also,  a new Digidestined is the house. What she will bring?The animation is simply gorgeous. Toei is a studio that lost the good animation tram and keep the oldfashioned style managed to make a great job here.

Now that the  adventure had evolved, I can\'t wait for more!', ""*It's recommended that you've seen at least the very first Digimon series to get yourself introduced to the characters, this review also contains some points revealed in the movie, so it's advisable to only read it after watching the movie.*Digimon tri: Saikai (Saikai literally means reunion/meeting). Probably one of the most anticipated entry to the Digimon series ever since it was announced.As part of my childhood I was pretty hyped about it turned out... just okay.In this series we get the reunion of the DigiDestined (including a new one) alluring to the respective title, who gather to combat a new menace that's surging upon the...real world : Infected Digimon (as refered to a secret agent group also introducted in these series)Straight from the start, I started smiling listening to Butter-Fly, the nostalgia just flew into me, but I have to admit the artist voice doesn't transmit the sheer epicness that Koji Wada transmits to me. Hell, even the scene when Taichi gets the goggles was super cool!The art looked pretty good (including CGI/new evolution sequences), but now that I grew up, there are some things that make me feel uneasy about it, the voice acting was pretty good as well, but it was a new experience for me since it was the very first time I've watched Digimon with their original japanese voice.I also had a major issue with how Taichi acted through the series, he was suppose to be corageous and he was so different from how I remember him, I mean even his symbol was the courage symbol, he was afraid of the city destruction and his surroundings which just felt... awkward. The remaining cast remained loyal to my memories so it made up for it.I will also note that I didn't fancy the end when Agumon/Gabumon entered boss rush mode against Alphamon using their evolutions/finishers, it was decent, but it could have been better if it wasn't so rushed at the very end, maybe save it for the second part?All in all, I would give it a 7/10 since it was pretty decent overall, even probably an 8/10 for the nostalgia and love I had for the series a child, but nothing more than that. real world : Infected Digimon (as refered to a secret agent group also introducted in these series)Straight from the start, I started smiling listening to Butter-Fly, the nostalgia just flew into me, but I have to admit the artist voice doesn't transmit the sheer epicness that Koji Wada transmits to me.

Firstly Digimon adventure tri movie 1 is more of a set up film in my opinion, the story wasn\'t clearly explained and they weren\'t clear on what happened prior to this film and for that reason I gave it a seven. although there is areas that need to be improved.The Art is a drastic improvement from the classic series they look like actual teenagers and the animation for the digivolution was improved as well.  the digimon art is just as good if not better then its classic counter part and really helps bring out their personalities.The music in this film...brought back alot of memories and made me smile several times such as when ""Butter-fly the original Digimon series intro was played. the battle music and digivolution music it made it feel like an adventure and i for one can\'t wait to see where they go from here.Character wise, the development was good but needs improvement, i\'m glad they haven\'t focused on matt and sora and clearly made Tachi the main character as in some films the main character can be overshadowed by supporting characters. The character development for Taichi and Agumon was well done but could be improved and other development for supporting characters was hardly if not there at all.enjoyment i gave a ten as, it brought back many memories and reminded me how far Digimon has come, every fan of digimon whether you have seen the original series or not should see this film as it will bring a smile to your face. brought back alot of memories and made me smile several times such as when ""Butter-fly the original Digimon series intro was played. the battle music and digivolution music it made it feel like an adventure and i for one can\'t wait to see where they go from here.Character wise, the development was good but needs improvement, i\'m glad they haven\'t focused on matt and sora and clearly made Tachi the main character as in some films the main character can be overshadowed by supporting characters.

Too bad the internet already spoiled quite a bit of the future story events for me. :(Let\'s start with what I didn\'t like because the list is much shorter ;). I liked the opening theme as much as any of the US/English openings, but wish they would have used Butter-Fly since they used other songs (in Japanese) from the Japanese series in the English release, and it would have been a nice tribute to...the late Kōji Wada, since he passed before the English Dub was released. This series is definitely a tribute to the long-time fans, a lot of whom (myself included) think that the Japanese had a better OST than we did. The other thing that didn\'t really jive with me was some of the character animations, don\'t get me wrong this whole thing was beautifully animated, but in some shots, certain characters, especially Tai and Agumon, seemed lanky and too angular. Lastly,  want to know what happened to the 02 kids, but the internet let me know that it\'s still not answered.Now for the good stuff. Like I mentioned before this series is obviously a gift for the longtime fans, it is everything that a sequel should be-a labour of love rather than a quick cash grab. I love seeing the characters from my childhood in HD, and everything especially the digivolving scenes were beautiful. I also appreciate that this series remembers that Gatomon is a champion level digimon. Adventure and Adventure 02 acted like she was a rookie digimon. I also really loved that they included Brave heart as the evolution theme, Japan definitely had a better OST than we did in the US and keeping this in there really got my blood pumping as someone who has seen both the US and Japanese versions. I also like the small things they snuck into the movie as shoutouts to long time fans, such as Izzie\'s ""Prodigious!"" and bringing back Tai\'s goggles. the late Kōji Wada, since he passed before the English Dub was released.

You can say, Taichi and friends more badass when they are kids. And the bromance bait so strong with Taichi-Yamato pair (they always do, but this time they are a young adult man and that's kinda makes me giggle. Oh my brain has been infected with some bl ideas *slapped* X)) sorry, its out of topic.The opening song, i think the original one is the best. Rest of all, i 'm agreed with some reviews said :) "", ""Hated the  human characters designs and story. Humans lack any real design to them, with them being the low quality standard that anime seem to favor these days. Hated the rookie digimin's voices, they all sound like squeaky school children.The character development seems to have reversed. Some seems to have regressed in their maturity and some have progressed into adulthood. It seems that only one character will see any type of character advancement with the plot playing out as it has in these 4 episodes.Story so far seems to be an alternate or modified version of another Digimon season's plot. It has already...been done and these 4 episodes don't forecast any huge changes in the future. been done and these 4 episodes don't forecast any huge changes in the future."", ""DISCLAIMER:Spoilers are possible in the following reviewNotification:I'll be running these reviews for animes that don't have enough substance for a big review.I'll try to keep this review short,there isn't much to say anyway.Story is your usual Digimon story. A group of kids, named digidestined, and their digimons,i guess that's a correct plural form, save the world from Digimon who are being controlled by some evil thingy. In this case the evil thingy is a maddening virus. Characters are as they were in the original Digimon anime albeit teenagers, which means more annoying. There's some interesting characters conflicts and a big fat stupid one between...Tai and Yamato. Art is horrendous and somehow manages to be worse than the original anime that came out long ago. Songs are ok, especially the new rendition of the old opening, but sound overall is not that good. Explosions feel like rabbit farts and they don't yell out their special moves. I know that observation is kinda kiddish but this anime is fanservice and nothing more so it should have it. That statement is not without supporting evidence. The original cast and that opening are obviously made to be nostalgia inducing.  This feeling sticks trough the whole anime,probably cause characters from the original series keep appearing, but there's one big problem. You ready? It's that this mini series is bad. Not bad in a blandy bland bland bad way. This anime is bad cause it's inferior to the original series in every way despite our futuristic alien technology.

First of all, with eight characters and only seventeen episodes I really hated and resented introducing Mei. She's boring, pointless, and only takes away from the people I actually care about. Same for the secret agent people, they just convoluted the plot and kept important information secret for the stupidest reasons possible.I'm also fine with a slower, more thoughtful pace. But it felt like there was so much filler nonsense that I should have skipped a few episodes. A lot of plot hangups and character development also depends on the cliche of people being to stupid to talk to...each other for five seconds. Finishing this felt like a chore and punishment for having fond childhood memories.There was some good however, except it's hard to describe because it was spread so thinly and intermittently. Overall I regret watching and should have just found some good fanfiction. each other for five seconds.

Honestly though, when I actually got to watching it, it wasn't as exciting as I thought it'd be. I felt like there were a few things that they did wrong, or things that they're missing from Tri compared to the old series.1. Taichi was supposed to be the symbol of courage. Why does he now all of a sudden turn into a complete sissy? I mean, sure people change when they grow up but in this case, they didn't even explain why he was...indecisive throughout the whole movie.2. Where was the epic evolution scene for the Super Evolution and the Warp Evolution? They just completely skipped that for whatever reason, yet it was an important part of the original series which made us love it so much.3. I know this isn't always everyone's cup of tea, but I really miss the move-name shouting. Watching the fight scenes were kind of awkward after getting used to the original where they would shout their big finishing moves at every fight.That being said, I there are still more episodes coming to Digimon Tri, and I have hope that in the future they'll be able to do much better. The show has so much potential! indecisive throughout the whole movie.2. Where was the epic evolution scene for the Super Evolution and the Warp Evolution?

Starting off with some narrative of platonic philosophy it keeps the watcher contemplating what the main conflict of this 6 part movie series could turn out to be and in my opinion it has lots of potential. Themes handled are much darker than the original and leads to some great character development. Build up of tension is done very well with the bgm and Butterfly/Braveheart had me singing along. The animation quality is quite the disappointment, which will leave a lot of digimon fans hating and it does take away from the enjoyment. I think Saikai is...a decent introduction into this 6 part movie series and while it may have its faults if you are a moderate digimon fan you\'ll enjoy it one way or another, hardcore digimon fans maybe not so much.***SPOILER STARTS NOW***Detailed Review:Story: Starting off a movie/show with reference to an ancient myth or philosophy seems to be quite the common trope in the anime industry these days, for good reasons and Digimon Tri is no exception to this. In Saikai, the movie draws its reference from Plato\'s Theory of Form. The demiurge is the ""artisan"" responsible for the fashioning and maintenance of the physical world. Ideas is a non-material abstract form that is to possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality that cannot be perceived in the material world. In Tri, the demiurge has no awareness of this Ideas and hence the basic premise of the movie series has been foreshadowed if not already set up: it\'ll probably boil down to something like save the world being destroyed, very digimon-esque. Very basic and cliched premise you might think. But with the appearance of Alphamon, possessor of the vacant seat in the Royal Knights, the show is most definitely throwing out subtle foreshadowing references to this idea of the creator of the material world to the watcher. While the movie has not all too much of its plot discretely revealed, if the show keeps playing on Plato\'s Theory of Form, I cannot help but imagine how much potential this series could have even with such a seemingly basic premise. Mind you my knowledge on platonism is quite restricted so anything I said previously might be completely wrong.Aside from the philosophical introduction, themes and motifs of the movie are portrayed fairly well through the interaction between and development of characters. Saikai spends quite a bit of time concentrating on the interaction between the original DigiDestined as the title would suggest.Much has changed from the fateful summer, with everyone busy with something, the crew seems to have drifted apart. However with the return of their partner digimon, they slowly start to reunite again. The small interactions between individual characters really flesh out what we loved about the DigiDestined and shows us their friendship is still going strong, all the way from Taichi and Yamato starting a big fight while Koushiro is just rambling on and on on things no one understands to Mimi\'s outlandishly outgoing attitude that makes everyone uncomfortable yet still content.Nonetheless everyone has changed over the years, which therefore brings forth change in their bonds as well. Koushiro seems to care more for fashion due to the arrival of Mimi (much to Tentomon\'s despair) and things seem to be going to a steamy hot love triangle between Taichi, Yamato and Sora. Their digimon double the fun with their remarks on these.Change is a very prominent theme throughout and Taichi gets the most treatment out of this. Taichi has matured a lot and sees things very differently from how he did as child: he fears the consequences of battles. He seems to have found his resolve during his fight against Alphamon but after the battle, he falls back into his internal struggle. I really hope they don\'t pull a Shinji Ikari with Taichi any further than this. Additionally, I do feel the reunion with their partner digimon seemed a bit short? I wouldn\'t have minded a bit of screentime seeing individual partners catch up, the movie isn\'t called Reunion for nothing. Then again it were the digimon that brought forth this reunion anyways.Nonetheless having concentrated on characterisation of the DigiDestined by having them literally hang out for around 15 minutes does make the movie feel very slow paced at times and on many occassions feel as if nothing happened for I don\'t know how long. Better directing could have potentially avoided this but I can\'t complain too much cause the digimon had me laughing whenever they were on screen and the excellent build up of tension to battle sequences cannot be overlooked.The music and soundtrack was a job well done. The bgm definitely did its job when it came to setting the right atmosphere, especially when the tension was building quickly or during Taichi\'s and Yamato\'s nice little bromance talk in the Ferris Wheel. With the original singers for Braveheart and Butterfly returning to sing each others song, not only was it nostalgic but very refreshing. Furthermore that orchestral version of Braveheart was just brilliant. Although, there was quite a lack of voice acting during battle sequences especially during Alphamon vs Omnimon. No grunts or anything from both digimon or humans. I was really disappointed when they didn\'t call out the names of their attacks... And why doesn\'t Alphamon speak?The animation quality really made Saikai suffer and this is probably my single most biggest complaint as well as worry for the movie series. Toei being its studio, I wasn\'t all too worried about the animation quality. While their recent anime series works have been utterly disastrous (Sailor Moon Crystal and Dragon Ball Super), their movie animation quality was always top notch. (look at one piece strong world, just incredible)I have never been more disappointment. It was probably the most choppiest of animations I have ever seen in recent years and mind you there are some horrible ones out there recently. And if you\'re going to use that many still frames at least make them somewhat pleasing to the eye, some of it is just plain eye cancer. For example when Taichi is running away from Kuwagamon, the long distance shot of Taichi facing Kuwagamon, Taichi looks horrendous. As a bonus I am not a big fan of big thick line drawn effects that stay still for several frames. Those are the sort of effects that goes well with kids but the intended audience for Tri is most definitely not kids as seen in ANY of the themes handled in this movie.When I first heard that Atsuya Uki would be in charge of character design, I wasn\'t very happy. Don\'t get me wrong, his works are awesome (Cencoroll, Tsuritama) but I felt as if his artstyle just wouldn\'t fit well with Digimon\'s style. But to my surprise I quickly got used to it when I saw the movie and in fact very much appreciated the design in the end. Evolution sequences were also quite awesome having implemented some CG it did remind me of the sort of CG in Bokura no War Game. And to be honest, the battle sequences were actually pretty awesome and well choreographed. However I can\'t help but think I wished Yoshiyuki Sadamoto and Mamoru Hosoda would have worked on Digimon Tri. They really were a dream pair. And why the hell did they not show the ultra and mega evolutions during battle?In conclusion, Digimon Tri\'s story is something worthy of being called Digimon. While not much has been revealed, if they play their cards correctly, it could shape into something pretty awesome. Character interactions and development is on point with the returning cast and their partner digimon, making long time fans go crazy with nostalgia and making us remember again why we love them so much. The music doesn\'t exactly help calm down the nostalgia fit, it only makes it even more intense. The movie on a whole was very enjoyable having me smiling or going crazy of excitement every second. The animation quality really missed the mark, being no where near anime movie quality or even your average anime show. In this sense I do find it very difficult to see this as a movie series but instead just a 24 episode show (assuming each movie will be 4 episodes) which will take bloody years to finish. Saikai will definitely be a mixed bag for digimon fans but nonetheless I found it very enjoyable and have high hopes for the following movies to unveil the grand epic to come. a decent introduction into this 6 part movie series and while it may have its faults if you are a moderate digimon fan you\'ll enjoy it one way or another, hardcore digimon fans maybe not so much.***SPOILER STARTS NOW***Detailed Review:Story: Starting off a movie/show with reference to an ancient myth or philosophy seems to be quite the common trope in the anime industry these days, for good reasons and Digimon Tri is no exception to this.

Saikai will definitely be a mixed bag for digimon fans but nonetheless I found it very enjoyable and have high hopes for the following movies to unveil the grand epic to come.', 'Nostalgia does not make the heart fonder it seems.I am a big fan of the original Digimon series but this movie is honestly horrible.Story:While there are hints to something larger occasionally in the plot, every scene is needlessly dragged on. The slice of life parts that open the show only sustain itself on nostalgia and is infinitely worse than good slice of life animes out there. The latter half of the show involves the main characters staring dumbly at danger as monsters attack being nothing more than passive bystanders.Art:I felt as if I was watching an overly (bad) artistic movie made by some independent...artist for the sake of making a point. Color palettes are dull and uninspiring, unlike the first episode of Digimon. The movie does attempt to show rather than tell (far too much emphasis on show) so the art is arguably the best part of this. At least the artists tried to make some sort of point with the designs of the digi world.Sound:Music and booms seems to be all there is. Even if the music is from the original series, it\'s heavily overused in scenes with little variations. Ace Attorney games have wonderful music that is kept fresh each game through remixes, variations, and character themes. Music is also adjusted based on the mood and feel of the scene. Digimon Adventure: Reunion does not.The abuse of sound in the movie is worse than my middle school attempts at adding to RPG Maker projects.Character:Was there supposed to be character in this movie? I couldn\'t notice, seeing as there were way too many scenes where nothing happens besides characters nodding and grunting at one another. Or dialog scenes that lead to nowhere, are said without any useful context, provide little to the actual plot. Or characters staring at each other stupidly while the monsters fight completely breaking up the flow of the fight scenes. The sudden giant section of exposition in the middle was awkwardly placed and didn\'t fit with the rest of the slow anime.Overall:A botched slice of life intro, passable combat scenes, and lazy usage of sounds.How this movie might have been salvagable:Duration: Cut by at least 50%Slice of Life Intro: Add in humor of Wagnaria or Charm of Non Non BiyoriArt: I get that it\'s supposed to be very ""real life"" like with the gritty and clean art design but there are countless shows that get it right without feeling so...lifeless.Sound: See sound reviewCharacter: Getting rid of the nonchalant look on characters faces when something is trying to kill them would be good. Cause humans don\'t have a blank look on their face when that happens. Or I don\'t know...getting rid of unnecessary slowness in fight scenes, the random cut ins of the digi-destined dumbly staring at one another during the fight scenes.

I've decided to structure my review around this particular theme.First, the manner in which second season canon was handled. Second, the movie has quite a bit of ship tease which occurs in the movie which many fans wished would not occur. Third, a new character was added to the team. Forth, there are a ton of unanswered questions. Fifth, the art style is something which has bothered since the posters were...released.I'll address the way the canon for the second season was handled. On the positive sides the makers of the movie didn't forget that the canon existed. The two younger digidestioned still have their upgraded digivices, and the uniforms that the older kids wore for season two are now being worn by the younger two. Matt's band is mentioned, and so is the fact Joe goes to a different school. The only other reference to season two material is a flashback sequence showing the main digidestioned introduced in season two being nixed. There is no telling what else will be nixed in the next movies either. For example, while season two left the impression that Matt and Sora are dating, they aren't in the movie.A few people will argue that season two's canon trumps that of the movies, particularly when the director and the producer publicly claimed that the material in season two was canon, and some fans even credit the director and producer as the creators of the Digimon series. In reality the series started off as a series of games, and were created by a different person entirely. One of the rumors floating around at the time was that the production team split because of a major rift, and the production team for Tamers was created because of said rift. The movies may thus be seen as a way to fix the issues that occurred later on in the second season, particularly if season two didn't fit what the original creator wanted for the series.This leads me into the second issues. The movie does not at all shy away from ship teasing. The pairing between Matt/Yamatto and Sora is no longer an official canon pairing, and the love triangle for Sora between Matt/Yamatto and Tai/Taicho is back. Contrary to what the director said, the love triangle did exist within the games of the franchise, and Sora did show an interest in Tai/Taichi. Add to this there is ship tease for a relationship between Kari/Hikari and T.K./Takeru, but this remains under the surface. The most evident ship tease though is between Izzy/Koushio and Mimi. Those rooting for Joe/Jo and Mimi together are out of luck.Chances are there is going to be more ship tease in the later movies, something many fans were hoping could be avoided because a.) the series is meant for kids, and b.) the series fits into the shounen demographic. The first problem with this though is the fact Digimon Tri is not aimed at kids, but is instead aimed at older fans of the franchise, and as such romance will be a thing. However, in that same turn kids series aren't free from romance contrary to the popular belief. Second, the shounen demographic isn't free of romance either. That's another misunderstanding. The main problem though is people may not be pleased with the pairing choices put down by the movie.The third issue is the new character. Meiko ends up replacing the four charters from season two, which is something that will not sit well for certain fans. She's not though a bad character at this point. Unlike the characters from season two, her introduction was a lot slower, and she didn't usurp the role of the original eight like Davis/Daisuke and company did. One downside is she may be thrown in there to solve the love triangle issue involving Sora between Matt/Yamatto and Tai/Taichi, which again will be something that may not sit well with fans. She's a lot more soft spoken then Sora, so she pretty much invokes the role of a proper Japanese lady far better. Add to this she's got a major shrine maiden vibe going on, which in turn means she could, if not handled well, turn into a Mary Sue.Still, this is actually the part I found myself most worried about in the series, as I feared she would usurp the canon characters like Davis/Daisuke and company did, if not worse. She's in reality a very non intrusive character, whose presence did not over shadow the original eight at all, and instead she's slowly introduced as an additional cast member, much in the same way Kari/Hikari was in season one. Her personality ended up being enjoyable, and pleasant. Any character hate at this point is unwarranted.The forth issue is that there are a ton of unanswered questions. One of these questions is what happened to the four who were nixed, but other questions pop up. Since this is an ongoing series, we'll hopefully see these questions answered. The fifth is the art work. The art work actually isn't bad, but is something that people will need to get used to. One disadvantage is the characters don't look quite the same as they used to, as the art format used for bandai's shows aimed at children are gone, but on the positive side this allows for a whole lot more detail in the art work that wouldn't be possible had they gone with the old style.As for the plot of the story, one of the reasons they likely released as a movie instead of in episode format comes down to the fact the series plot wise works more like the movies did. While all of the Digimon telivision series are action packed, this one holds back on the action in the same way the movies do. For some people this may be a disappointment, but in the same regard a lot of built up occurred within the series allowing for a nice introduction for the new character.

Back in Digimon Adventure 02, when they brought in a new generation of Digidestined, whenever one of the original characters showed up in an episode for a crucial plot point, we saw exactly how much they took their crest to heart and how that helped shape them as they grew up; here in Tri, we see the original Digidestined start to struggle with who they once were and who they will become. From the way part 1 and 2 came out, it seems that each part is going to feature 2 characters per part...struggling to remember and recapture what their crest once represented about themselves. Something to know going in, they use the first part of episode one to ""subtly"" let you know that the new digidestined from Adventure 02 WILL NOT be featured in (and possibly not even a part of) Tri.Art 9/10: The art will probably be the toughest thing to adjust to if you still have the animation from the original series in mind, that being said, you will probably come to love almost all of it after that brief adjustment period (even I still have problems with some of the CG art during the digivolving sequences, but that\'s also mostly just Ikkakumon). Once the show finds its footing after two episodes, the fights also all become amazing (look forward to the final episode of each part for epic battles). Despite how Tri shapes up in terms of art, what keeps the art score away from perfection in part one is that they keep reusing stock footage in flashbacks (trust me, you\'ll see what I mean).Sound 10/10: Miyazaki Ayumi - ""Brave Heart"" enough said.Character 10/10: If you thought you knew the original characters after 2 seasons of 50+episodes, you are wrong. Tri takes their character development to the next step now that they are older and have their futures to worry about, as well as how they now realize that the Digimon cause real damage to their surrounding when they fight. Like I said above in plot, Tri has a major focus on the original digidestined recapturing what their crests once meant, and so far, each is done beautifully (part two better than part one in my opinion). The relationship aspect that we couldn\'t explore back in the original series because of their age is also starting to be addressed in Tri, which may trigger some people who have longtime ships from when they were kids, but it had to happen eventually (and I swear, T.K. better shape up and realize he is meant to be with Kari).Enjoyment 10/10: This was exactly the nostalgia trip I needed in my life, and seeing as I don\'t do drugs, that is the kind of trip I am always down for.Overall 10/10: I\'m so glad that they found a way to add on to the series that I grew up with as a child so that it can continue to have meaning in my life later on now that both the characters and I are older. If you want a repeat of the series you also once new as a child, let that feeling go for a bit so you can take in what Tri is trying to do.My only complaint is that there is only one part (4 episodes) released every 6 months. struggling to remember and recapture what their crest once represented about themselves.

The characters and art look beautiful and also still keep that older look to it in a way. Similar to the style of the first Digimon movie. The music is good with the digivolution theme being a blast from the past. The characters are just like them old selves but you definitely see how they have matured and...how they are more entitled to their own opinions as compared to the first series where they just went with each other's plan. Tai shines in this movie having a understandable moral conflict which gives it a much more adult tone. He sees the disaster and he isnt sure if its for the right cause or not. He worries about people getting killed a topic not often touched upon in Digimon. The nostalgia and fanservice definitely is incorporated well, such as Kari having a birthday party just like in the first movie, Kuwagamon being a callback to the first fight of the series, and plenty more if you pay close attention. I went into this not having seen a Digimon series since the 3rd series. I wasn't sure how Digimon was still holding up only to be delightfully entertained once more by the characters I enjoyed most, just as much as when I was a child. However if you are not a fan of the older digimon series you probably wont get too much enjoyment from this.

Overall, I\'d have to say it was underwhelming given the hype that built up to this. People expected more of the story and character development, and it disappointed. Oh lord did it. Perhaps it was due to overhype or just a plot line that no one was expecting in general, the story fell flat on its ass. The once joyful and cheery characters of Tai and Joe were pushed to polar opposites. Yes, people might say ""Oh it\'s part of growing up"". What people don\'t get that the whole point...of this series is to give the people who watched this series growing up, a sense of nostalgia. A poor attempt of giving the movie some emotional depth ultimately backfiring into this, droll.

I've watched everything there is up to this point and also played a few Digimon games.This is a good movie but there's still a few aspects that I want to mention:1) CGI is present during digivolution sequences and in my opinion it looks bad2) this movie has no love whatsoever for Gomamon and it's sad3) it took me a few minutes to get used to the new character design and animation style. The only character that feels immediately as himself is Kochiro (Izzy).4) The soundtrack is...eargasm after eargasm of nostalgia. As far as I am aware, all the songs used are remakes of the original ones from 21 years ago (I'm counting from the time I'm making this review).5) The final battle felt too rushed.

We grow up with them. We are inspired by them. To certain kids of \'99, a group of ""Chosen Children/Digidestined"" were the very epitome of such heroes as they spent an unforgettable year on an adventure with them.However, now that we\'ve grown up, things have changed. Adults need to be more \'serious\' now and put childish things back where they belong. In 2015, despite the rise of Marvel\'s lighthearted movies, the fixation on grittiness still takes precedence over inspiring stories. We no longer look at things with hopeful hearts as...we mock Superman and Captain America for being naive boyscouts who fail to look at the reality of our world.The main character of Digimon Adventure, Taichi Yagami, knows this. It\'s more than just fear consuming him. No longer a Chosen \'Child\', Taichi the Courageous addresses the one thing I\'ve always complained about in certain superhero movies (particularly Man of Steel) - a lack of acknowledgement towards collateral damage in the aftermath of a battle. With Batman v. Superman addressing this mistake, Digimon too has caught up with the new age, imbuing the new stories with a dash of realism.And this really excites me, more than the nostalgia of hanging out with my old buddies again. Digimon has finally evolved again. After Digimon Xros Wars, I wasn\'t sure that things were going to improve in the future, and I was afraid that there would be a lapse in storytelling as the studios focus more on money-making formula.Even better, it\'s not just Taichi who goes through such unexpected character development, but Jyou too, as he too has moved on and deal with his life through a sense of maturity. Having struggled with his entrance exam, Jyou has shut out the childhood memories of things he believes he\'s not responsible for, things that are unrelated to his current life as a student. This amazing turn of event is nothing I had came to expect from Digimon, considering their recent history of repetitive and formulaic storylines in the video games that they promoted for the 15th anniversary of the Digimon franchise (Re:Digitize and Cyber Sleuth included).Of course, being an anime (shorthand for ""animation"" FYI), the animation is kinda an important factor, and unfortunately, Adventure Tri. didn\'t do that well in this department. And I\'m not just referring to the cel shading that made most of the movie look like a cheap video game cutscene. The animated movement of the characters itself feels very awkward sometimes. The characters\' body language sometimes don\'t reflect what they are feeling, leaving some misinterpretation among certain audience members who critiqued Taichi for being emotionless towards the Digimon-caused collateral damage when that\'s obviously far from the truth. And naturally, the cel animation itself looks horrible and out of place, and the rest of the hand-drawn traditional stuff looks overly simplistic and amateuristic. They had better animation back in the first season of Digimon compared to this movie. That\'s how bad it is. At one point of the movie, Takeru looked like he was drawn by a college student studying animation.Also, even though I know this is just the first part of a four-part movie series, it does feel a bit lacking. Aside from Taichi and Jyou, the rest of the cast seems like they were only there to crack jokes, which was one annoyance I felt towards the same group of characters during Digimon Adventure 02, the second season of the TV series. I guess that, with their development coming to a full circle during the first season, there\'s hardly any use for spotlighting on them any more and they have to turn our attention towards those who still have some growing up to do.And oh god, the evolution sequence is so bad. Not only did they drag out the sequence with repetitive cel animation to fill out the screentime (they were way shorter in the TV series), they also took out the  sequence of Agumon and Gabumon\'s evolutions from the Perfect Stage to the Ultimate Stage! We didn\'t get to see the nostalgic MetalGreymon transformation sequence that was so awesome! It was kinda lazy on their part.And finally, the fight between Alphamon and Omegamon was so lackluster. It\'s teased so much in the trailers, and yet we only receive so little in the end. It\'s Alphamon - THE Alphamon. Those of us who knew him from the Digimon X-Evolution movie knows how big of a deal this is. Alpha and Omega have come together again and it\'s so... insignificant in the movie. Sigh. Oh well.But truth be told, I\'m rather content with how things turn out for the movie. There are little details in there that not only pander to the fan in me, but they also show that there\'s a good writer behind the movie. For example: Taichi didn\'t just magically forget about the relationship choice Sora made during season 2. You could still tell that he\'s struggling with the awkwardness of (not) asking Sora out, and it further shows his maturity. I also like the government aspect of the story. Even though it\'s an element that\'s been done to death already in other superhero stories, I think it\'s handled quite well in the movie... for now. It\'s no Hypnos from Digimon Tamers that\'s for sure, but at least it\'s a step-up from season 2 where the government was completely okay with children controlling monsters that destroy buildings.Even though it\'s still leagues away from the quality of Tamers, this has been a good reunion for Digimon fans. We got our nostalgia fulfilled, we got our new character development, and we got an intriguing story crafted for the modern era. It\'s a good start, if anything. we mock Superman and Captain America for being naive boyscouts who fail to look at the reality of our world.The main character of Digimon Adventure, Taichi Yagami, knows this.

At one point of the movie, Takeru looked like he was drawn by a college student studying animation.Also, even though I know this is just the first part of a four-part movie series, it does feel a bit lacking. Aside from Taichi and Jyou, the rest of the cast seems like they were only there to crack jokes, which was one annoyance I felt towards the same group of characters during Digimon Adventure 02, the second season of the TV series. I guess that, with their development coming to a full circle during the first season, there\'s hardly any use for spotlighting on them any more and they have to turn our attention towards those who still have some growing up to do.And oh god, the evolution sequence is so bad. Not only did they drag out the sequence with repetitive cel animation to fill out the screentime (they were way shorter in the TV series), they also took out the  sequence of Agumon and Gabumon\'s evolutions from the Perfect Stage to the Ultimate Stage! We didn\'t get to see the nostalgic MetalGreymon transformation sequence that was so awesome! It was kinda lazy on their part.And finally, the fight between Alphamon and Omegamon was so lackluster. It\'s teased so much in the trailers, and yet we only receive so little in the end. It\'s Alphamon - THE Alphamon. Those of us who knew him from the Digimon X-Evolution movie knows how big of a deal this is. Alpha and Omega have come together again and it\'s so... insignificant in the movie. Sigh. Oh well.But truth be told, I\'m rather content with how things turn out for the movie. There are little details in there that not only pander to the fan in me, but they also show that there\'s a good writer behind the movie. For example: Taichi didn\'t just magically forget about the relationship choice Sora made during season 2. You could still tell that he\'s struggling with the awkwardness of (not) asking Sora out, and it further shows his maturity. I also like the government aspect of the story. Even though it\'s an element that\'s been done to death already in other superhero stories, I think it\'s handled quite well in the movie... for now. It\'s no Hypnos from Digimon Tamers that\'s for sure, but at least it\'s a step-up from season 2 where the government was completely okay with children controlling monsters that destroy buildings.Even though it\'s still leagues away from the quality of Tamers, this has been a good reunion for Digimon fans. We got our nostalgia fulfilled, we got our new character development, and we got an intriguing story crafted for the modern era. It\'s a good start, if anything.', ""Finally a 1990s anime reboot done right! Move aside Sailor Moon Crystal and Dragonball Super, Digimon Adventure Tri for the most part has met my expectations.Story: The story starts off slow but it's understandable as it's the reunion part of the overall Tri series. That being said, by the end of part 03, everything starts to make sense regarding the new evil that is appearing. It was heartwarming to see the DigiDestined and the Digimon reuniting as I reminiscence over the years gone by since the first season has ended.Art: The backgrounds and digivices are all well detailed. The digimon has a look similar...to the 1990s version but more fleshed out due to advancements in technology. The human characters has the typical shonen 2010s style so however.Sound: The opening and ending songs are very good to listen to and even the BGM in the various scenes are a joy the ears. It captures every scene to the tee very nicely.Character: Development wise, the Digidestined themselves still have their personality when they were kids for better or worse depending on your perception. Except now as late teenagers, they have responsibilities (i.e. entrance exams for Joe) and tend to do their own thing unless there's an meeting to be held regarding the story and events of the series. Thankfully the Digimon themselves are still quirky and full of fun to see. There is also a new character that appears but not as fleshed out yet. I also don't understand why there's no mention of the 02 series characters as we clearly seen them as kids doing that season while 01 characters were in high school then, like they are now.Enjoyment: Overall I enjoyed what I have seen so far and I expect it to get better once Episode 2 is released since it was a slow start. However the questionable disapperance of the Digimon 02 main characters mystifies me. I hope they're atleast acknowledged in the next episode as there's been times where both 01 and 02 characters would help out each other when needed. to the 1990s version but more fleshed out due to advancements in technology.

The focus of this project appears to be the characters. All the original Digidestined seem to have naturally progressed in the 6 years since their original adventure. Tai has developed an internal conflict that actually mirrors ones from the original series. He fears the actions of the Digidestined in their fighting may be causing more harm than good, and that they may be the reason for all of the destruction in the first place. The few fight scenes that appear in the episode are brief and don't focus on the...flashy effects or long transformation scenes of the original, but they serve their purpose to push and develop the characters. flashy effects or long transformation scenes of the original, but they serve their purpose to push and develop the characters."", ""ENG: see this movie brings a great nostalgia, a very good feeling watching the first few minutes to the sound of music (in a new way) Butter-fly! By the way, the sound part in general is absolutely great. In the animation part, it is also seen that Toei did a great job, with very smooth scenes and good use in scenes using animated 3D, the great highlight goes even to the digievolutions and the action scenes (some people may be shocked at the new look of the characters, it's understandable, but they did it in a very competent way). The main plot is still not...very clear, mainly because it does not know how much of the Digimon Adventure 2 this film considered (until the emperor digimon? Malomyotismon existed, and if so, was until his defeat?), at least the story is cool and it is also developing well ( hopefully the plot looks like it's going to really explore the consequences of Digiworld on the real world, such as the existence of a security and surveillance agency for this, for example.

At the halfway point I wanted to shut it off, play some XCOM instead because I was really unmoved by it all. It felt slow, it felt like the characters had gotten bland after years away and I was pulling it apart more. The soundtrack was bugging the shit out of me I kept picking out moments were the music would ruin moments and seemed really out of place. I wasn\'t amazed by the animation either, it\'s not by any stretch of the imagination bad but it never amazed me and...I was just waiting for something to remind me of why I liked Digimon in the first place. Why I watched the show as a kid with eyes glued to the tv in amazement or later as a teen still finding enjoyment in it. I was geared up to really dislike Digimon tri.Due to the sheer number of characters I feel like rating all their overall performances would pointless, especially as this movie mostly focuses on Tai and Matt. Starting with them it feels like the writers are trying to make Tai deeper by showing how Tai realises just how real the damage caused by the battles can be but I don\'t understand most of his actions throughout the movie. Matt\'s always been an emotional little shit and in this movie it shows however he does come across as the more herioc and proactive of the two. I feel like the writers are stepping on old group with the two meaning that it all feels a bit familiar, and I\'m more than happy to bet $5 that in the next movies they\'re gonna have a punchup. Everyone else is just there for the sake of it and I hope they build on them more later because I feel like they\'ve grown up but that haven\'t actually grown as characters.As I said I very nearly disliked this movie so obviously it does some things right. Despite some bad comments on animation earlier it does have some nice moments towards the end of the movie and overall the whole thing has a nice colour pallet. The soundtrack is awful but I really liked the opening, I like how it matches the movie and is pretty catchy as well. I felt invested in the characters instantly because of my connection with the series but I feel it adds some things that could add to the series in later movies. Like the introduction of Meiko who feels important to the plot and shows the signs of being an okay character. Despite my rant about Tai and Matt the fight they have in this movie feels more adult (probably because they nearly are adults) and it seems like the two boys are beginning to realise just how far apart they\'re drifting. I also get the impression they\'re going to build certain characters and maybe get some of them together but a nerd can only hope.I\'m not entirely pleased but I\'m looking forward to next movie. Most of all it feels like Digimon tri 1 suffers from being the first movie, having to get the materials for greatness together as apposed to actually buidling something.-he3/5 it\'s okay I was just waiting for something to remind me of why I liked Digimon in the first place.

It focuses on the real-world lives of the original Digimon Adventures human cast rather than showcasing Digimon transformations. The storytelling presents a strong beginning, but the story is incomplete, leaving plenty of room for Acts Two and Three. The animation is so far the greatest improvement, particularly during fight sequences. While the main stage is the human world, the presence of the Digital world is still felt in a more subtle sense, hinting at greater complexity to come.

Everybody's grown up just a bit more, but they're all fundamentally the same. Tai's still the star of his soccer team, Matt's the frontman for his band, Mimi's living in America, Joe's being awkward and trying to become a doctor, Izzy's an expert in computers, TK's living with his divorced mom, and Kari is nice.

That basically tells you the direction this movie will go in: Tai and Matt are the solution to everything.

The new theme song is somehow both a bit better and at the same time not quite as good as the original. Other than the  new theme song, nothing ever feels out of place, and that only feels off because you keep expecting to hear the original.Overall, it's a pretty solid movie, but the only real reasons to watch it are either nostalgia or to get to the movies that come after it. scenes.

Despite being for a franchise built on a glorified toy commercial with the budget of a potato, for a toy manufacturing company TOEI. Once more, those of you who grew up with the original 8 chosen children ARE the primary demographic. And for the first time, TOEI has no new marketable toy to shove in your face. This series is for us.It is important to keep the goals of media in mind when reviewing it, but despite its context I would defend...Digimon TRI as an excellent watch and the best and most loving reboot of any franchise I have seen to date.Most people tend to forget that Digimon TRI occurs after Digimon 02. As a reboot of a franchise it surprisingly accepts the canon, material and content of related material including the Digimon Movies directed by Mamoru Hosoda, Adventures, 02 and weaves them together in order in order to transition elegantly into and make sense of the bizarre time-skip epilogue of Digimon 02.  I think audiences who grew up with the American release of the show may find the tone abrupt as TRI builds upon its Japanese release.Remember that Digimon in the US played up its campiness and comedy, whilst the tone for the Japanese release was edgier, and more serious. Try comparing even the Japanese and American versions of [Our War Games].Our 8 heroes are back, harkening not only the character development they acquired through both Adventures and 02, but even the characterizations from Mamoru Hosoda's take on the beloved series.Digimon TRI builds opts for a more mature show to match its aging audience building on the somewhat darker tone Digimon has adopted over the years while excelling at more polished and nuanced character interactions inspired by [Our War Games] at the fore-front of the series. TRI is nuanced most of the reasonings for interactions are never explained, as it should be. This emphasizes the naturalness of our cast’s group dynamicIf it's one thing that Digimon always expelled in, it is/was character interaction while juggling 8 (if not more) unique characters. Unheard of and deemed a relic of the past in today’s animation market.Digimon is a show not only about the evolution of monsters, but of its heroes as they are becoming adults. The responsibilities of maturity is the central theme of Digimon TRI. This is illustrated gorgeously by the ED to ‘I Wish’.However despite the shounen-esque fights Digimon has always been a series who's heart lies in the relationship between it's main characters. The great thing about TRI is that by accepting the cannon from previous installments, it has the brilliant (but difficult) opportunity to retain those relationships vital to the success of the show and build upon them.From building up Izzy's brilliance and social ineptitude (that he slowly is growing out of), TK and Kari's now romantically distanced relationship, Joe’s struggle as he battles against the realities of the everyday, Mimi’s idiosyncratic personality that brightens and binds the group, Sora’s growth into a more feminine and motherly role while struggling stop an already breaking relationship between Matt and Tai.Like the original digimon, Matt and Tai foiled relationship is the focus. Following the theme of the responsibilities of maturity, Tai is paralyzed by his inability to revert to the fearless child leader he once was. Entering adulthood TRI goes to great lengths to show Tai’s insecurities as he begins to notice the consequences of heroics in the world around him. This is further enhanced Matt, who once again foils Tai reminding him of the brash yet passionate leader he was - a complete role reversal from Adventures.I have seen some criticism for TRI regarding it’s art style and design, and while I disagree that it's bad, I can agree that it is the weakest part of Digimon TRI. There are times that TRI’s small budget shows, and honestly it's not as high as one may think, but I want to remind viewers that Digimon has ALWAYS been a dirt cheap show.In response to criticisms with the studio’s art-style I want to remind viewers, though die-hard fans will need no reminder, (even after considering the quality inflation over the last few years) that Digimon was never appealing because of it’s art style, designs or even its products. It was a series that, despite its young demographic, challenged its audience seriously. Approached them with darker themes. Focused on group dynamic and the nuances of friendships, not the quality of its fight scenes or monster designs all the while creating characters that grew to love and tuned in week after week to root for.I stand by my word that in terms of accenting the franchise’s strengths, which is clearly one of TRI’s goals, it exceeds. We were treated to a more contemporary Digimon, a graphic aesthetic that has been cultivated by previous installments of the franchise, wonderful reimaginings of [Brave Hearts], [Butterfly] and [I Wish] and gorgeous Digivolution scenes that are just plain better versions of their older counterparts.

This might be a but biased, because digimon adventure 1 was my favorite tv show when I was little. I was really obsessed to say the least, so I'll love it no matter what.It's very nostalgic because they use the same voices and music, and that just makes me very happy.As for the storyline, I can't grade it too hig because I don't really know what's happening. Everything is still very much a surpise. It seems so focus on the original chosen 8 children. Which I love, because the adventure 2 children didn't do much for me, I especially...hated davis. So although I don't mind that, I do admit that it's weird that they are not mentioned.. At the same time, it's clear they will show up in one of the episodes.What is so great is that adventure was a kids show, and tri seems to be written for those kids, who are now in their late teens or adulthood. The kids face some troubles growing up that we all face. There is also a bit of romance and flirting and hints that weren't there in adventure 1. Or maybe I just didn't see them. Adventure 2 & the movies did show some romance especially between takeru and hikari, and sora and taichi and yamato. It's too bad that the ending of adventure 2 eliminated the possibility of those developing, because tri shows some possibilities for them..Jyou, koushiro, mimi and yamato seem to be perfectly in character. Taichi struggles with his courage, which is a bit out of character but can also be seen as growing up. I haven't seen much of sora, hikari and takeru yet. So far, they seem in character.The art looks great, although it took some getting used too. The rest, especially because of the music, is just one big trip of nostalgia. The only bad thing is the time between the seperare parts...All in all, I'm a fan, can't wait to see more, especially of hikari & tailmon. I hope I don't have to wait two years for that. hated davis.

The kids face some troubles growing up that we all face. There is also a bit of romance and flirting and hints that weren't there in adventure 1. Or maybe I just didn't see them. Adventure 2 & the movies did show some romance especially between takeru and hikari, and sora and taichi and yamato. It's too bad that the ending of adventure 2 eliminated the possibility of those developing, because tri shows some possibilities for them..Jyou, koushiro, mimi and yamato seem to be perfectly in character. Taichi struggles with his courage, which is a bit out of character but can also be seen as growing up. I haven't seen much of sora, hikari and takeru yet. So far, they seem in character.The art looks great, although it took some getting used too. The rest, especially because of the music, is just one big trip of nostalgia. The only bad thing is the time between the seperare parts...All in all, I'm a fan, can't wait to see more, especially of hikari & tailmon. I hope I don't have to wait two years for that."", ""If you don't wanna read, here's a shameless self-promotional link to the video version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbYiXE3HvYYI was extremely excited for this film, mainly because I am a Digimon fan and when I saw the promotional poster for this new movie I was hyped. And I watched it the day it was released, but at the time I was a bit biased towards the film because I of the nostalgia. So after waiting a while and rewatching it a couple of times, the questions now stand. Is this film any good and does it actually live up to the hype?Please do keep in mind that I will...be judging this movie not only as a start point for the rest of the films but also as a standalone one.Without further ado, let's get started.I'm going to keep the synopsis short and brief so that I can get into the main part a little quicker.Three years after the battle against BelialVamdemon,  Taichi and the others have begun to grow up and have started doing their own things and pursuing their own goals  . However during his soccer game Taichi see's that a Kuwagamon has appeared and attempts to stop it as it wreaks havoc and destruction across the city. By reuniting with his friends and fellow digimon the first film in the Digimon adventures tri series begins.Digimon adventure tri, is honestly a difficult anime film for me to review because I really wanted this film to be good. Before I get into the nitty gritty stuff, I'm going to start with some of the positives.I think the writers did a fantastic job at realizing the stage in life that all of our characters are in. It feels believable and genuine. Even if you're new to the series and know very little about these characters, the relationships all feel real. A major theme of this film is this idea of growing up and the distance that it creates between people who were once extremely close. It's a mature theme that I really didn't think would show up, but it did and it was executed brilliantly. The entire storyline involving these characters reunion was really the shining star of this whole film.Now personally I thought they did a great job with the OST, not only was the opening song enjoyable, but the music that played throughout the whole movie was done with great care as well. All the music fit well with the scenes and added a multitude of elements where it was needed.It was also fairly well paced. There were some moments where it could have slowed down and taken some time to explain things, but for the most part I was never left hanging.The character designs were also well done for the most part. It really feels like the characters that old digimon fans knew and loved had gotten older.Now despite being the first movie in a series, it doesn't excuse it from not being to hold it's own. This movie has a lot of flaws and sadly they aren't little flaws that can be overlooked. As we move into the negatives I do want to say that the overall story of the film is fairly good despite some questionable characters and moments that make you go “wtf”. The major issues of this film really come from it's directing, editing, and overall animation and artstyle.First off let's start with the actual execution of the themes in this film. Without spoiling too much the first movie is really about Taichi as a character, and the setup for both his internal and external conflicts are done well, and although his external conflicts with his friends is strong throughout the film his internal conflict fails to feel natural and cohesive. This element of his character is forcibly shoved down our throats through obvious narration and dialog. It seems like the writers couldn't think of any better ways to get this story arc across other than through generic and blatant explanation. So by the end of the film it wouldn't be outlandish to say that Taichi was an annoying character to some extent.I will say though that they were able to get this message across visually.The next major problem with the film is it's directing. There are certain scenes and set pieces during this film that really raises some questions as to how it was directed. Again without spoiling too much, there is a conflict that occurs at an airport, and during this battle scene, with destruction and chaos happening, it is literally put on hold to show the reunion of most of the characters and the digimon and we then spiral into a 2-4 minute scene where these characters have an actual conversation as if the battle is not happening at all. It's like the writers decided that at this very moment the battle was going to go on intermission for a half-time show where instead of cheerleaders dancing to music and little mini games being played, we get to see a conversation play out.Continuing on the films terrible directing there are even moments where the director had chosen to show single frame or scene multiple times to convey the exact same message which further makes it seem like there are elements just being forced down the audiences throat.Moving past these issues we come down to the animation of the movie. First off I want to mention something. Is it just me or do the artists not know what Taichi's skin color is supposed to be. Because in some scenes he has this fat tan but then in others he's super pale. And don't tell me it's because of the lighting because in scenes that involve multiple characters in a dimly lit area everyone seems to retain their skin color just fine. Moving back on track the overall animation for me was disappointing.There are moments where a characters face will look so out of whack that it pulls me out of the movie and makes me physically scrunch my eyebrows and question “what is wrong with their face”. Even if the animation style is supposed to be this simplistic, yet vibrant and cartoony, have some consistency in the quality of the characters that we see in every single scene. Despite the artstyle there are some scenes that just downright look like someone just smudged the screen and the only thing they didn't mess up were the clouds. Because holy crap those clouds look good. There are some scenes where the anime really embraces their chosen artstyle well and it looks extremely good and works well with the movie but then there are scenes that just aren't as well done. The animation quality just isn't consistent. Many of you might think that I'm just over exaggerating nitpicks but these are all elements of the film that can pull someone out of the experience.Guy's, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I can't wholeheartedly say that I had a good time watching it. Despite a fantastic and believable reintroduction to the characters and a setup for a fun story there are so many elements of this movie that really take you out of the experience. These seemingly harmless issues eventually spiraled out of control and made being able to really enjoy the movie from start to finish difficult.This film is really for the hardcore digimon fans who can look past all these glaring issues. But for others it might not be that great. After rewatching this film a total of three times, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Therefore my final rating for Digimon Adventures Tri: Reunion is;“Backlog it”It's not something that you'll ever have to watch, even if you are a digimon fan. I'd save it for a rainy day where you have nothing better to do. Hopefully the other movies were able to segway off this one well enough to make up for a very average return to the Digimon universe.Thank you for watching the video, hopefully I gave you enough information to help you decide whether or not you want to watch this film or not. be judging this movie not only as a start point for the rest of the films but also as a standalone one.Without further ado, let's get started.I'm going to keep the synopsis short and brief so that I can get into the main part a little quicker.Three years after the battle against BelialVamdemon,  Taichi and the others have begun to grow up and have started doing their own things and pursuing their own goals  .

Problemas apenas na coragem de Taichi, tudo isso para alguém que se tornará membro da ONU? Que exagero...Os demais personagens continuam os mesmos, com suas atitudes óbvias de...sempre...Muito cedo para falar da história... Mas me foi algo vago, sem pé sem cabeça...A Trilha Sonora... Não suporto mais ouvir a velha trilha sonora durante tantos anos... Mas o sentido de usa-las é a Nostalgia. Isso me entristeceu muito.Pessoalmente gostei muito do OVA, Mas em comparação a qualquer outro filme de Digimon, esse foi o pior.Sem conteúdo algum de relevância, praticamente um Spin-Off sempre...Muito cedo para falar da história... Mas me foi algo vago, sem pé sem cabeça...A Trilha Sonora... Não suporto mais ouvir a velha trilha sonora durante tantos anos... Mas o sentido de usa-las é a Nostalgia. Isso me entristeceu muito.Pessoalmente gostei muito do OVA, Mas em comparação a qualquer outro filme de Digimon, esse foi o pior.Sem conteúdo algum de relevância, praticamente um Spin-Off', 'The original Digimon movie (and Our War Game in particular) is to this day not only my favourite anime but one of my favourite movies in general, so i was psyched when Digimon Tri was announced. unfortunately Tri doesn\'t live up to the precedent set by earlier Adventure stories.(this is a spoiler free review in terms of main plot but i will reference minor events)I originally watched Tri 1 not long after its release but wasn\'t really feeling it, so i decided to give the series another go dubbed because i\'m actually really fond of the Digimon dubs. Now with a cast of familiar voices...i found Tri 1 more watchable than the first time round, but that alone isn\'t enough to negate all its other issues. i do wish that the dub could have also included some music from the series dub too, but that\'s just personal preference.As other users have commented before me, the biggest problem with Tri 1 is that nothing really happens. The amount of necessary plot across the whole movie could probably be cut down into about 10-15 minutes. Now, I understand that part of this is down to establishing setting, but overall it just isn\'t very satisfying to watch and considering that Our War Game as an example managed to set up and execute a self contained story in about 20-odd minutes, here it just feels like a waste.I really dislike the art style for the human characters in Tri. Some scoff at using sameface syndrome as a complaint in regards to anime (though even in Digimon Adventure there was enough facial variation in the kids alone that made Joe\'s face vary from Izzy\'s and Izzy vary from Matt etc) but the problem remains that the faces here are so similar that a lot of the adults in Tri are indistinguishable from the kids - when Tai\'s teacher first appears I assumed he was a student until he was addressed otherwise.The human characters also suffer from having very blank and inexpressive faces, even when they are supposed to be surprised or scared. In a weird contrast to this though the Digimon, who often had much more fixed and static facial expressions before, have become much MORE expressive - there are a couple of fantastic shots of Agumon and Gabumon snarling which look great but totally overshadow the kids\' disappointingly rigid faces.The characters personalities come across weirdly..... off, and this continues to be a recurring thing across the series. In Tri 1 specifically there is a particular scene where Matt lashes out at some kids badmouthing Digimon and Tai restrains him, which has continually bothered me because it seemed like it would be much more appropriate for their characters to be the other way around? The Digimon partners also seem much more childish than before beyond their natural naivety, as though they\'ve regressed to be mildly irritating babies incapable of talking about anything other than food. And they do talk about food.... A LOT. Like I know it was A Thing that Digimon just really love food but it seems to be the only thing they talk about now.One particularly baffling character trait introduced in Tri 1 is that Tai, upon seeing the destruction caused by Digimon in the real world, has PTSD-style flashbacks to some kind of event. This is not addressed again. For the rest of the series. So get ready to ask a lot of questions and get little to no answers because that seems to be Tri\'s bread and butter.When the movie finally begins to feel like a Digimon story it is lackluster, a rushed fight that ends abruptly, which is a huge shame.Overall I would say that Tri 1 and perhaps Tri 4 are the weakest across the whole series. And it\'s not even that Tri 1 is excessively BAD, it\'s just simply..... not anything. I would call it a solid 4-4.5/10.To anyone wondering whether it\'s worth continuing to watch the other movies, I will say that the series DOES pick up and begin to """"feel"""" more like a Digimon story, but continues to have a variety of frustrating to straight up maddening issues throughout. i found Tri 1 more watchable than the first time round, but that alone isn\'t enough to negate all its other issues. i do wish that the dub could have also included some music from the series dub too, but that\'s just personal preference.As other users have commented before me, the biggest problem with Tri 1 is that nothing really happens.

Haiyore! Nyaruko-san F,https://myanimelist.net/anime/26023/Haiyore_Nyaruko-san_F,"[""This OVA was absolutely amazing! I laughed so hard during all episode and counted many references to the other series and popculture. I think that after this ep there should be full 3rd season with action just after OVA's and with same level of relations between characters (which supose to evolve during 3rd season). I highly recomend this ep for people who seen two previous seasons and like Cthulu and Lovecraft :D "", 'The entire Haiyore! Nyaruko-san series is amazing, its saddening to consider Haiyore! Nyaruko-san F a sequel considered it was just 1 OVA many hoped it would a full 12 episodes. None the less this one episode fulfilled many of my expectations.Expecting you\'ve watched the other season (Haiyore! Nyaruko-san and W) you can expect the same hilarious parodies and the wacky awkward situations Mahiro is put through by the alien Trio + Mom and Shantak-kun.In this episode Mahiro and his household are offered tickets by Tamao and Yoichi to tag along to a popular amusement park that just recently opened. The theme is...""A realistic escape game"" where participants do various games throughout the park to find the end, unexpectedly a new character arrives to tries to interfere with the groups daily lives.The art style is the same as the previous seasons. Pretty standard quality of animation consisting of bright vivid colors, detailed character art, fluent animation, and well drawn backgrounds. All the art and animation fit very well with each other it will come down to personal opinion whether you enjoy it or not.The sound is good there is nothing really to complain about, but at the same time nothing to really too out of the ordinary. The voice actors fit their characters roles and personality perfectly. The sound quality was good, the dialogue between characters was fluent and clear, and the action scenes sound effects where on point nothing seemed to be missed. As for the OP and ED I found them both really enjoyable to listen to they were catchy and entertaining.After the long ride of 2 seasons and couple of OVAs thrown in Mahiro and Nyaruko FINALLY start getting a good development with their relationship. The whole 1 sided open relationship x tsundere male was ongoing for too long. In this episode we finally see character development and a change of direction. There was a huge gain of satisfaction I had while watching this episode. I\'ll let you judge on if you think it was satisfying or unsatisfying.I love the Haiyore! Nyaruko-san series I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in comedy and parody. There wasn\'t a single moment that I didn\'t find enticing or enjoyable. It was one of those anime that will always remember and have a special place for.Overall this 1 episode really filled my expectations I was left satisfied and happy. The story, art, sound, and character development were all good and enjoyable. I really hope that Haiyore! Nyaruko-san episodes continue to come out, but it is looking grim since the light novel ended sadly. The only 1 down side I have for Nyaruko-san F was the fact that they made it only 1 episode I would of loved to get an entire season 3.Story: 9Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8 ""A realistic escape game"" where participants do various games throughout the park to find the end, unexpectedly a new character arrives to tries to interfere with the groups daily lives.The art style is the same as the previous seasons.

There was a huge gain of satisfaction I had while watching this episode. I\'ll let you judge on if you think it was satisfying or unsatisfying.I love the Haiyore! Nyaruko-san series I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in comedy and parody. There wasn\'t a single moment that I didn\'t find enticing or enjoyable. It was one of those anime that will always remember and have a special place for.Overall this 1 episode really filled my expectations I was left satisfied and happy. The story, art, sound, and character development were all good and enjoyable. I really hope that Haiyore! Nyaruko-san episodes continue to come out, but it is looking grim since the light novel ended sadly. The only 1 down side I have for Nyaruko-san F was the fact that they made it only 1 episode I would of loved to get an entire season 3.Story: 9Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8', 'Ah, Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, a parody anime talking about the existence of HP Lovecraft\'s cthulu monsters in female human versions of themselves in a show that\'s about as wacky as you can probably think of.  So, with the new OVA, what\'s there to see?Story (7.89/10): The story for this OVA is very simple.  Nyaruko, Mahiro, and co. are given tickets to a new attraction in town thanks to Tamao being suddenly given enough tickets for the entire cast.  (How convenient)  Upon entering this attraction, Mahiro and Nyaruko are thrown into a dangerous situation that requires them to get out, and there, we...have our story.Since this is an OVA, the story of it doesn\'t really go all out, however unlike most OVA, this one actually has a more story-like aspect rather than just a random fun episode filled with fanservice or what have you.  Rather, this OVA showcases our main two characters being thrown into a situation which in turn, has our signature male tsundere Mahiro, to think about the relationship he has with the strange cthulu girl that has invaded his life for about 2 seasons + 2 OVA\'s already.The OVA itself ends with a bit of a cliffhanger ending, making me think that we might have something of a third season of the show (even though it\'s considered a sequel to W.) because at the end, it introduces us to a new character and progression with the relationship between our main two characters, but only one can hope.  Still though, overall, this was a nice OVA.  Nothing to really get scared over because this is Nyaruko after all, and issues in this show always seem to resolves themselves.Overview:+ Nice, new story+ Character relationship progression (and it\'s between Nyaruko and Mahiro.  That\'s even more surprising.)Characters (7.77/10): Like the rest of the series before ""F"" here, there really isn\'t any change in cast.  We still have Nyaruko with her lovesick/thirsty behavior towards Mahiro, we still have Kuuko and Hasuta being their normal same sex lovey selves (not that there\'s anything wrong with that), and the others.The only real big change with this OVA in terms of characters is, as I\'ve stated before, the relationship between Mahiro and Nyaruko.  There is actually some progress with specifically, how Mahiro actually sees the crazy Cthulu girl, and makes some decent headway towards what we\'re all probably (hopefully) thinking, which is the pairing of the two.  (At least, I hope I\'m not the only one praying for that to happen.)Overview:+ Cast is the same memorable selves as they are+ Character developmentArt and Sound (7.88/10 and 7.11/10): The art for Nyaruko-san F is style-wise, relatively unchanged.  There really isn\'t much difference in the actual style of the show, but quality-wise, since there\'s been a gap between the last OVA and this one, it looks significantly better, a whole lot brighter, clearer, and better quality.  I like it.In terms of sound, it\'s a bit of an interesting call this one.  For this OVA, it\'s actually given rather than the original tracks from the previous season, a new set of OP and ED tracks that are completely different in terms of OP and ED visuals, and the actual track itself.  What bothers me is that for some reason, they\'re not really as addicting or soul-crushingly annoying as the first two were (especially the first season one...), so that was a bit of a letdown.Overview:+ Much better art quality+ New OP and ED tracks-  New tracks weren\'t all that memorable sadlyPersonal Enjoyment (8.10/10): The Nyaruko series has always been a very enjoyable series to me personally.  It has a lot of parodies within it, it\'s a wacky series that really doesn\'t require much thought when watching it (cause lord knows you\'ll be even more confused if you try and make some sense out of it), and the odd relationship between Mahiro and Nyaruko always interested me.Did I like this OVA?Yes, I did.  It\'s always fun to watch a series you enjoy again with new material, so there wasn\'t really any reason for me to not enjoy this to some extent.What didn\'t I like about this OVA?Nothing really, except that it wasn\'t longer.Would I recommend this OVA?Yeah, if you\'re a fan of Nyaruko.  Likewise to the rest of the series, this OVA plays out relatively the same, if not a little bit more deeper into the relationship between the characters.  Personally, I hope that this isn\'t the end to the Nyaruko anime because tbh, with the way this ended, they\'re either trolling us, or hinting at it, and I hope it\'s the latter, because this show is really fun to watch.Overall Score: 7.66/10 have our story.Since this is an OVA, the story of it doesn\'t really go all out, however unlike most OVA, this one actually has a more story-like aspect rather than just a random fun episode filled with fanservice or what have you.

Instead it is focusing on the relationship between the MC and Nyaruko. This was a nice change sense we have only gotten two or three episodes with a serious ton too it.I'm not a big fan at how easily Nyaruko is able to be taken out like she was in this. But it did bring in one of the best scenes of the...entire show with the MC giving Nyaruko an actual kiss over the tears of both of them as Nyaruko is about to die in an awful way.This would have been awesome if later on it wasn't revealed that both of them had forgotten their memories of the event. But we are at least given a kiss between the two of them in front of the entire class.Overall it's sad that this wasn't a full on sequel with an entire season.

I'm already getting all giddy up when i think about this episode. This review might be a tiny bit messy but stick with me here guys.I've always viewed OVA's as not important and a filler so I've stopped watching OVA's after a while. THANK GOD i picked the right one this time because  it left me completely stunned...and satisfied . I never expected that an episode like this would happen. It has everything packed into it with an extra ammount of romance  for you mahiro and nyaruko shippers out there :D . I won't write about the story line since i'm sure you guys would like to watch it for yourselves. What i love about this episode so much is how in pretty much all the episodes in the 2 past seasons it never felt like they were in too much trouble but this one really showed how screwed they were. Which made me feel worried about the characters and really questioning to myself how this was gonna be resolved. You'd think like oh the past seasons they've always been saved by hilariously ridiculous reasons but this one was different. The ending was fantastic for me, i just wish i could give the author a hug and a kiss right now ( Yes I'm a boy and I'm straight as a pole). I do not wish for another season but maybe this OVA could've be an hour or have another OVA that is 25 minutes. This episode was towards the ending of the light novel so another OVA would wrap this whole series up quite nicely.I love every single tiny bit of this series even though it does have it's cons. This is a series that will stick to my heart forever.  Anyone could tell me about how bad this series is and i wouldn't give a damn and still have the same opinion. The author gave us the best handjob anyone could give with this OVA. I will give the good sir a piggy back ride if he needs it. I'm looking forward to watching this anime AGAIN in the future since there were so many references i'm pretty sure I haven't caught them all. Hands down i would recommend the series and especially this episode to anyone especially if they find references and parodies hilarious.P.S:  I did not write anything for the sounds or the art since it's the same as the 2 past seasons and satisfied .

As they pretend to be a married couple to protect the peace between the countries, they find themselves gradually falling in love. PRETEND LOVERS TO LOVERS TROPE FR.I can\'t write a long review about it but if you\'re looking for pure fluff and romance like Romeo and Juliet but instead of their countries keeping them apart, they are the ones giving the other distance, they are what keeps ""them"" apart.If you\'re...looking for an anime that has so many representations, like feminism, body issues, self issues, this might be the one for you cause it certainly was the one for me.Not all might like it and say its boring, but for me, being in love and being loved for who you are, no matter the country, no matter the position, no matter the body size, to be truly loved despite all that, is for me, a wonderful thing to see.It\'s funny how fate and destiny works in mysterious ways to make you find what you\'ve always been looking for.I hope you guys check it out! Both Sarah and Naranbayar are so cute. looking for an anime that has so many representations, like feminism, body issues, self issues, this might be the one for you cause it certainly was the one for me.Not all might like it and say its boring, but for me, being in love and being loved for who you are, no matter the country, no matter the position, no matter the body size, to be truly loved despite all that, is for me, a wonderful thing to see.It\'s funny how fate and destiny works in mysterious ways to make you find what you\'ve always been looking for.I hope you guys check it out! Both Sarah and Naranbayar are so cute.', ""I watched this movie on a plane and was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. While the romance aspect between the main characters felt a bit rushed initially, I grew to appreciate the uplifting development of Sarah and Naranbayar's relationship as the story unfolded, the two bringing out the best in each other without being overly reliant on the other. Towards the end, I found myself quite satisfied with how things played out for them and their respective kingdoms, given their role to help both.The film also introduced some really compelling side characters, though I wished they had more time to fully...develop. For instance, Piripappa, the king's massage therapist turned advisor, could have benefitted from more depth as an antagonist. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the sisters were given more depth than I initially expected in this movie. They didn't come across as mean for the sake of it, and I found their relationship with Sarah to be rooted more in her anxiety rather than any mere pettiness. Saladin, was also a standout character who defied my expectations in a pleasantly surprising way, as an actor turned advisor, who though a bit of a trophy husband actually went to the effort to make a difference without betraying his character. (Maybe I also liked him because he was voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya, and man does he do a great job in all his roles!)However, unfortunately, the movie was not without its flaws. The excessive use of flashbacks unnecessarily padded the runtime, and the comedy, especially in the 'introduction' scene, was one of the weaker aspects of the story. Unfortunately, the final conflict also left me somewhat disappointed, and Sarah's jealousy towards the 'fake wife' Naranbayar had felt like an unnecessary layer of tension in their relationship that I don't think was needed, at least to the extent the movie pushes on you.Either way, this was a solid movie, but not something I'm going to rush to rewatch. develop.

The FL is bright and warm, albeit plagued by anxiety. The ML is straightforward and a quick thinker. Together they form a cute couple, it\'s just a shame their relationship and characters were not explored further, as I don\'t think that what\'s been shown is quite enough to mark this as a romance.

I mean there\'s a literal *wall* you can get a ladder to cross over and on one side it\'s a dry desert and on the other it\'s *immediately* lush forests, lakes, rivers, and rain. That\'s not quite how climate biomes work, so I almost felt it would have been better to claim it\'s some sort of magical wall that causes those stark differences. The left Minister (the actor ikemen) used to be a nomad.. 5 years ago and now he is the boytoy of the princesses (plural) and the - yeah a figurehead, but still - minister? And then the moment he gets in contact with the ML he suddenly finds his ministerial chops and pulls off - together with the ML who is a civil engeneer and has no political acumen, seemingly - this grand scheme to unite the countries that have been fighting for the past millennium? None of these make sense to have been so easy. The only positive point about any of this was the Crown Princess turned out to be something more than a cliche mean older sister. Ultimately, just like with the romance, the political aspect falls short of being a fulfilling plot point.Overall, I think this film suffers form not spending enough time on developing either of its main points: romance or political intrigue. If either one was properly developed, the other, brief as it is, might have served as a good enough backdrop for the main element that is fullyt realised, however since that is not the case here, one feels quite unsatisfied after finishing the whole thing.Still, the characters are likeable and what there is, is fun to watch. I never felt the need to just turn it off and never found myself rolling my eyes at the characters/plot. If you have some time and want a quiet watch, this will do the job.

( I just love Tsukimori soooo000ooo verrrryyyyyy MUCH )well, its not just actually b\'coz of Len that I love this anime, it about EVERYTHING in it!!!!! Starting from the characters, then the music and to the part wherein each of the characters develop their personalities throughout the entire series.. ..P.S. you might have noticed that I did not focus much on commenting the ""summer encore"", but since it is the special episode after the first season of the anime, I guess its just right to comment on everything. .. .. well, I would really tell you all ""you will regret it if you will not have the chance to watch this AWESOME anime"". .. I swear! Kahoko was right there sitting and listening to the OUTSTANDING playing of Len.. ..

"", ""Well, La Corda D'Oro Summer Encore is one of the best one-shot anime in my disposal. The story revolves when literally all guys confessed to Kahoko. She just blushes, damn Kahoko! Female version of the lucky bastard : lucky bitch. The art is made in La Corda D'Oro anime version standard, no penalty. Sound, SSDD hence no penalty again. Character : slight penalty but not too severe because that lucky bitch really confused when 5-6 males confessed directly to her. Enjoyment?? No FS!! 2 point penalty!! ""]"
Houkago Teibou Nisshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39730/Houkago_Teibou_Nisshi,"['Darn you Corona, for robbing this show of the views and the potential to be great, because this is truly underviewed and underrated, and before I start this review proper, I honestly plead anyone who likes the usual CGDCT gimmick, but wants something different out of it, this show will do wonders. Don\'t think, just watch!And without further ado, Doga Kobo is back at the CGDCT formula once again homies! It\'s gonna be a lil\' different from what we\'ve come to expect of the sub-genre, and this show here proves more often than not that it can do the Slice-of-Life genre justice while being confined...to the typical school-ish comedy that is affluent with most CGDCT series we\'ve seen all too much and known all too well.Houkago Teibou Nisshi, or Diary of Our Days at the Breakwater, re-accounts the life of Hina Tsurugi, in an easy predictability of families moving into new cities for the main character to try something new (that\'s way too overused as a trope), but is essential for getting things off to a good start to the real-life seaside town of mangaka Yasuyaki Kosaka\'s birthplace and story setting in Ashikita, Kumamoto in Southern Kyushu (which is honestly quite cool to hear this). Despite being a mainly art-and-crafts person, the enthusiastic gasp of someone plainly fishing catches her eye, but given her fear of sea creatures, Hina is one scaredy girl, but with some coercing from a childhood friend, she is inducted into the Breakwater Club and from there on, begins her learning journey of plain ol\' fishing.In any given CGDCT series full of moe, the characters are what will make or break their source material as a whole (I\'m looking at you, Koisuru Asteroid), and thankfully this series is one of the better ones with a catch and a hook to name to. Each of the 4 girls are a delight to watch, and along with the usual newbie Seiyuus that are attached to their name, they did a remarkable job as well. And need I say that this show is also infotainment fun as well to add onto the list?Presenting to you the members of the Breakwater Club:- Newbie 1st Year Hinata ""Hina"" Tsurugi, her fear of sea creatures is warranted, but with some help she is able to imitate and copy the behaviours of other members and learn a mouthful. But of course, what is fishing without some genuine experience, and at some time she has to learn it by herself in order to match up with the others and fish gallantly.- Natsume\'s nearly-forgotten childhood friend Natsumi Hodaka (also another 1st Year), and as much as she loves to roam around Hina, her prowess and passion for fishing is of the usual ""growing up from young"" aesthetic. A very lively middle school girl with a ponytail, if I may add.- 2nd Year Makoto Ohno, particularly serving as the Breakwater Club\'s Albert Einstein figure (with the glasses). Ask her anything about fishing, and she is not hesitant to rain down the massive information that doesn\'t break her warm-hearted sweat. And always donning a lifejacket, there\'s a good reason for this, and that\'s in case she drowns in deep waters, because she is a non-swimmer. And fishers will know that swimming is a requisite to fishing, so that\'s at least a good safeguard just in case bad things happen.- 3rd year and president of the Breakwater Club, Yuuki Kuroiwa. The older girl who coerces Hina to join the club out of her fear of sea creatures, and acting like an old man for most of the time. Her role (like any other president would) is to act like a proper safe-distancing ambassador from the club advisor and the club\'s activities, in this case an easily drunk club advisor-cum-school nurse Sayaka Kotani from hemorrhaging the club\'s pickings of caught sea creatures. Talk about munching on hard work that others got, but entirely at no cost a.k.a FOC.Stand-out personality traits have always been a staple of CGDCT shows, and this show takes it seriously but gives it a fun spin, to which I wholeheartedly accept with arms open wide. It\'s a nice touch IMHO.What is more impressive of this show is the inspiration from the production team over at Doga Kobo. If you know anything about  ""the man, the myth, the moe legend"" director Masahiko Oota, he has done many of Doga Kobo shows that are of the better side of the spectrum (Gabriel DropOut, Himouto! Umaru-chan, Wataten! to name a few). Newbie director Takaharu Ookuma has worked hand-in-hand with Oota for many years as his disciple, and this is his first breakout show, which I have to say that this is discipleship well done that made me love and appreciate this show even more. Am definitely gonna look out for more shows under this disciple\'s belt in the right direction.Doga Kobo\'s simplistic but vibrant art style and animation has never once ceased to amaze me, even more so for this show to emit an almost Iyashikei-ish feeling of relaxation, and that\'s already quite brilliant on its own. The same can be said for the OST, to which the OP & ED set are some of the best Seiyuu-driven songs that I\'ve heard in quite some time (and listening on repeat, because it\'s just so good). And as always, the young and upcoming newbie Seiyuus taking up main roles are a good indication of their start-up careers as potential VAs for the upcoming future.Fishing shows are quite uncommon, and yet even more in the anime medium. I\'d give a double thumbs up for newbie mangaka Yasuyaki Kosaka on trying something similar, yet unconventional. I\'m a sucker for CGDCT shows that are done right and can make me feel like I\'m on a voyage of some kind (a.k.a Yuru Camp), so this comes off as highly recommended, without a hitch. It\'s full-on relaxation and simultaneously a pilgrimage that is not forced on you, and it\'s some good knowledge as well if you wanna try fishing.Maybe when the COVID crisis is over, then we can visit the mangaka\'s birthplace in Ashikita, Kumamoto to do some relaxed fishing? I really hope I get the chance to do so and thank Kosaka-sensei for creating this wonderful manga that\'s a ton of fun to experience, you won\'t get this experience anywhere else than here. to the typical school-ish comedy that is affluent with most CGDCT series we\'ve seen all too much and known all too well.Houkago Teibou Nisshi, or Diary of Our Days at the Breakwater, re-accounts the life of Hina Tsurugi, in an easy predictability of families moving into new cities for the main character to try something new (that\'s way too overused as a trope), but is essential for getting things off to a good start to the real-life seaside town of mangaka Yasuyaki Kosaka\'s birthplace and story setting in Ashikita, Kumamoto in Southern Kyushu (which is honestly quite cool to hear this).

Fishing is used as a vehicle to explore what it means to be passionate among the entire cast, with presentation being more subtle. Unfortunately, this means the show's appeal as well as its misfortune of airing during COVID-19 - being particularly hit hard and being pushed an entire season down the line - actively hurt the series....Don't let this fool you, as there's quite a bit to appreciate here, and especially if you have a background with fishing.Much of the series' appeal comes from how well researched the fishing is - bait, common fishing tactics, adjusting said tactics for different species of fish and there's even an episode where the entire cast go and get fishing equipment depending on their builds - another episode has an extended segment where all of them have to learn how to swim in case an emergency happens. It's this attention to basic details that makes this series so refreshing to watch, with even something as subtle as how fish behave around different kinds of lure or even just not touching certain fish - in this show's case, a stonefish - with your bare hands (which sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many even experienced fishermen make such a basic mistake). This also extends to how to dissect fish safelyThe series follows a semi-episodic structure involving the four main leads going out and fishing, with enough variety in what they're trying to fish to keep the show's content interesting - there's even an episode where characters don't fish up fish at all, which was refreshing. Character progression is linked mainly to the main characters' abilities to fish, with Hina in particular as the show's central character being at the focus of this; introduced as a wide-eyed, extremely naive teenage girl who can't tell left from right with what she wants to do in school (let alone in fishing) she grows from a rather empty high schooler craving a passion in her life to a genuinely passionate fisherman, who actively seeks out fishing. This is shown through various scenes - ranging from her actively researching about fish she wants to catch, looking up techniques and ever so slowly overcoming her squeamishness as the series goes on. For all intents and purposes, the narrative is centered around Hina and her growing passion for fishing, subtly showing her changing demeanor as the series goes on.The other characters and their love for fishing is all explored as the series goes on, and their dynamics; this ranges from Makoto mentioning fishing as an outlet for her otherwise withdrawn personality - which contrasts greatly with her inability to swim and Natsumi's interactions and recurring friendship with Hina, acting as a catalyst for Hina's increased interest in fishing as well as various interactions when not fishing (ranging from sewing to studying) that help establish their relationship with each other (which is also handled very naturally, like two old friends actually would interact with each other). Last but not least, there's Yuuki, the introverted and hands off leader of the group whose apparent apathy is a mask to conceal her genuine love for fishing, acting as the rational head of the group and guiding them while handling her job as student council president. While these are basic character traits, it's the chemistry between the group that made them so endearing. However, a noteworthy flaw can be argued to be the comedy - certain gags considering how several characters straight up look well underage appear inappropriate, and these jokes are concentrated early into the show, potentially making it difficult for some viewers to continue watching. Much of the humor I did enjoy though, with a particular mention being a fishing session that involved interacting with a very curious heron, the entire cast wandering around in the mud to look for clams with hilarity ensuing and interactions with Sayaka, the club advisor.Much praise can be given to Doga Koba for the work they've done on the show's production values, with consistently look great - the backgrounds are absolutely beautiful, with hand-drawn illustrations being backed up by light but fitting use of CGI that enhance the relaxed and comforting appeal of the series. No particular bit of animation lacked fluidity as far as I can recall, with movement being smooth and easy to look at - a particular note is that all of the various creatures caught by the cast are hand-drawn with no cut corners in animating movements for the fishes themselves, which in the hands of a lesser studio could've easily been done completely in cheap CG. Water looks easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack and sound design never feels off or out of place, fitting the overall tone of the series. Of particular mention are the songs for the OP and ED, which are fairly catchy.In conclusion, Houkago Teibou Nisshi is a show that appears to have gone under the radar - partially due to COVID-19 but also due to some gags in the first few episodes that may have scared some viewers off. This masks an otherwise excellent series, and I do recommend it highly, especially to those that enjoy stories about the joy of discovering a new passion or about fishing.Thank you for reading.

Another cozy CGDCT anime from DG. Houkago Teibou Nisshi has been one of my fave shows of the year so far.

I personally didn't have much of an interest in fishing prior to...watching the anime and afterwards was motivated to go out and try it.As you'd expect from DG, solid art, animation and character designs.

Now time to tell why you should be watching this series!There is a lot to like about this show, from it being a usual cute girls doing cute things, with very funny moments. But it's also quite informative about the topic it presents. It's like fun learning, you enjoy a great show, but also learn how to fish in general. I find that truly great honestly, while it helps having an interest in fishing, but for the anime to do that, it's a nice touch.The art style is very colourful and bright. As if it's a nice relaxing atmosphere, preparing you for...a nice and relaxing show. A show like that, that is very nice to look at, all good there. The same can be said about the sound and music in general. It all fits together really well, I see no real issues there.As for the characters and story itself.

From our relatable kind hearted MC, to her friend who is just bundles of fun, with her older sister being a fun character overall, with the final one being a quiet sweetheart.I'd honestly recommend this show.

When the characters manage to catch a fish, the anime celebrates the moment in a very conquering and rewarding way. He also praises the realization of the characters at the time of their meals, in addition to an organic preparation, the foods are always framed with an extra shine, there is an avidity built that stimulates a thirst for continuity in these actions. This method is very similar to that used in Dr. Stone, who also exalted his achievements well and was...even more stimulating.But even so, the anime is not interesting in all the minutes of its episodes, in fact I think it cannot escape the generic formula of this type of fixed-gender anime. Maybe this comes from the fact that he cannot relate any drama presented by the characters to the anime theme, so it turns out that when the story is not talking about fishing, it is absolutely nothing. He takes on a calmer and less unruly tone to try to extend the fishing theme throughout the minutes of the episodes until the end of the series, which is made worse by the fact that the direction makes dubious choices, with almost contemplative and slow plans, it's literally like he wants me to sleep in a few moments.Houkago Teibou Nisshi manages to be interesting like most fixed-gender animes, but unfortunately, he also cannot escape the same repeated formulas. even more stimulating.But even so, the anime is not interesting in all the minutes of its episodes, in fact I think it cannot escape the generic formula of this type of fixed-gender anime.

Our characters do have their own semi-cliche traits. Yet it was not focused and overdone in the anime which really did the show a huge favor. The setting...was really nice, different from the commonplace urban city places and more in the Southern Honshu coast which is tropical and is a perfect for a fishing anime.Every episode really brought a smile on my face. Each episode brings us a certain day or a certain fishes that they're gonna catch and it is refreshing because they always have a certain goal to meet and the characters in the show enjoy what they do. I love that they put haikus or quotes by the end, it is a nice touch.When it comes to our OP and ED, oh let me tell ya. Both of them are really great!Sea Horizon (OP) and especially Tsuri no Sekai e (ED) are really catchy. The empowering OP and the jazzy ED is a combination I never expect I will love in a slice-of-life show.Additional points for Houkago Teibou Nisshi for giving me moments to smile at and positive vibes throughout the trying times which is the 'middle of the year'.

But what we got is already great, it's a very nice show with lovely characters and is one of the shows to watch when you feel down or discontent from everyday life. What an underrated show and a show deserving for my first review. was really nice, different from the commonplace urban city places and more in the Southern Honshu coast which is tropical and is a perfect for a fishing anime.Every episode really brought a smile on my face. Each episode brings us a certain day or a certain fishes that they're gonna catch and it is refreshing because they always have a certain goal to meet and the characters in the show enjoy what they do. I love that they put haikus or quotes by the end, it is a nice touch.When it comes to our OP and ED, oh let me tell ya. Both of them are really great!Sea Horizon (OP) and especially Tsuri no Sekai e (ED) are really catchy.

Anyway I love this anime tbh it was my favourite out of alot of others mainly because of how relaxing it was to watch I would make myself a cup of tea and relax in bed while watching it because it was so chill. this which was nice to see it wasn't just thrown together by people who didn't know what they were doing which is nice to see they also somehow incorporated humour and teaching together which is a nice blend it was a shame that it had to come to an end at episode 12 wish it was longer and had another season tbh.

She\'s tricked into joining the fishing club against her will and the whole rest of the anime is her suffering in the wrong club. jk she falls in love with fishing and is REALLY enthusiastic about it by the end.In the true spirit of fishing, Breakwater is really an anime that leaves it all behind. There\'s no romance, (barely even yuri) no drama,...no school, just good ol\' fishin, talkin\' about fishin\', and cookin\' up the fish. And it\'s entertaining as fuck.I had no idea fishing was this complex of a hobby. There are tons of ways to fish, some more active than others, all depending on your skill level, what you feel like, and what you\'re fishing for. Hell, one episode they just went to the beach at low tide and caught clams. This show has the perfect cast of cute girls to explore all these, teaching you a lot as well about different types of fish, different rigs, prep methods, and even a little about safety, legality, and the environment. It\'s also interesting how Hina\'s original hobby, handicrafts, meshes surprisingly well with fishing, what with tying knots of fishing line.As a whole, I think Breakwater is an anime about how fun it can be to venture outside your comfort zone if you have the right people to guide you, and I think that\'s really great. Hina was dead set on joining the handicrafts club, but when some girls had other plans for her it turned out better for her anyway. This show is cute and wholesome and I\'d recommend it to literally anyone regardless of their interests. Ugh I wanna fish now. no school, just good ol\' fishin, talkin\' about fishin\', and cookin\' up the fish. And it\'s entertaining as fuck.I had no idea fishing was this complex of a hobby.

I watch this every time i eat a meal, and it really makes my food tastes better even when it's showing gross parts, like filleting fishes. Fishing moe is the AOTS.

As of now, I am only 4 episodes deep, but so far I have thoroughly enjoyed what has been presented to me.Story: 7I mean, it's just cute girls fishing. Never thought I would see a slice of life about that exact topic, but I'll be damned if I say it isn't a welcome one. Sometimes slice of lives just don't land because I'm not interested at all in what the girls are doing (See Koisuru Asteroid), but I've always loved...fishing, so watching a bunch of cute girls go into detail about some of the specifics of fishing is very fun to watch,Art: 8The character designs are extremely clean, a couple times I even mention to myself how clean they look, and that is to be expected of Doga Kobo, they always managa to make some great characters with top tier designs.Sound: 7Sound is always a topic where as long as it isn't awful, and fits the show well enough, I'll give a 7 or above. This is one of those cases, nothing too special, but nothing that takes me out of the experience or anything.Character: 8As much as they likely fall into pretty generic stereotypes, I love watching this group of 4 just play around together. Natsumi particularly never fails to make me laugh, while Oono is always there to make everything feel calm and under control. Overall the characters are nothing unique or incredible, but they do their job very well for what they are.Enjoyment: 8I mean, it's fucking cute girls fishing. What more could you ask for?Overall: 8Highly recommend this to anybody who considers themselves a slice of life fan. It's super chill to watch, and who knows?

And well of courser the storry is just fishing club activeties but thats how i liked it! i dont know who is my favorite character they seemed all nice. also they didnt have the cliche of broken family, the main character had both mommy...and daddy present in daily life (happy family)looking forward next seaosnon (hopefully??)-with love, anime_watcher_62 and daddy present in daily life (happy family)looking forward next seaosnon (hopefully??)-with love, anime_watcher_62', ""I know I can't be the only one who has been wanting too see a cute girl Slice of Life type of anime about fishing. There are so many anime about different sports, hobbies, and activities. Even not very well known or popular ones that don't necessarily translate well into a full fledged anime. I don't see why fishing couldn't work as a premise if its executed properly. It should also be noted that this isn't the only anime to have fishing as a major focus. It is however the first iv'e seen that is done in the style of a Cute Girls Doing Cute...Things Slice of Life anime with fishing as a major focus. In this case its through one of the school's clubs where the girls get together and do different types of fishing and prepare accordingly depending on what they are interested in trying to catch. Kind of like how Yuru Camp goes into some detail on camping and the different camping gear that is used, this does a little bit of that and gives a few pointers on fishing here and there that those who may be new to the sport may find somewhat useful. Learn how to hold a rod without looking like a total beginner, looking around before you cast so you don't snag someone in the face, and putting a swimbait on a jighead. That type of fun stuff. They also target other sea life like catching crab and squid.If I were to make a MOE girl fishing anime it would probably focus on tournaments and definitely sport fish. Also comedy because I love my CGDCT shows to have some good fun laughter and a laid back good feeling vibe. I have to say though, I like the way this anime is approaching it and how it introduces fishing into the story and showcases little things here and there. The girls aren't exactly my ideal girls for this type of show but they work fine and are growing on me as I continue to watch more.I'm glad this series is back and airing again. Coming back to it I realized just how much I enjoy watching it and missed being able to catch more new episodes of it. I have a feeling this show is going to end up underrated but at the very least those of us that do enjoy this type of anime can spread the word and help bring attention to it so more creators will feel encouraged to do something a little bit different instead of the supposed tried and true, not taking a lot of risk and rehashing the same exact concepts over and over again just with different characters, and even the characters aren't that different a lot of times. I really would like to see more of this type of anime succeed and hope to see more different concepts tried in the future.If you like CGDCT and Slice of Life types of shows I would say check out this anime. If you like comedy I would say still check it out as it has bits of it here and there. If you like fishing you will also probably get a kick out of it at least on some level. As an angler I know that I did. Well that's about it for my ramblings. Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy it. Things Slice of Life anime with fishing as a major focus.

As someone who has gone fishing many times, I can say there are some real relatable moments from when I first started.Doga Kobo does another fantastic job animating this anime. The art and animation do their job and do it well.

While it may seem like just another CGDCT's anime, nevertheless the twist of fishing really surprised me in how different everything felt. The daily life of a club about fishing is the perfect setting for this type of slice-of-life.Made by Doga Koba, they are known for multiple anime, but are notably known for slice-of-life. The many examples include, New Game, Maoujou de Oyasumi, Yuru Yuri, Gabriel DropOut, Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san, Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!, and Himouto! Umaru-chan. When it comes to comfy daily lives of anime...girls there aren't many better studios out there for the job.The style of slice of life that Houkago Teibou Nisshi goes for is more mature and slow than most may enjoy. It's not the witty fast line slice of life or very eventful really. Doga Koba has this style down pat and even makes something as dull looking as fishing enjoyable while also going into depth about different types of fishing.It starts off with the introduction to our protagonist Hina Tsurugi who moved to the countryside with her family. In a seaside town she'll be transferred to a new school, she's quite nervous being in this new environment. Hina's personality is typical of the genre being kind with a cheery demeanor. She originally wanted to join the arts and crafts club due to her passion for all things associated with it, however Hina is suckered into joining the Breakwater Fishing club after antics with the clubs president, Yuuki Kuroiwa. It's difficult for Hina at first because she has a fear of large fish, which becomes a running gag throughout the show. It's a fun introduction, nothing mind blowing innovative though. Hina is fun to follow around and the setting in a small seaside town is unique! The teaching of fishing was really cool too.The rest of the cast is just as likeable as Hina, and over time she becomes more comfortable with the club and those in it. Yuuki Kuroiwa's aloof demeanor comes off as nonchalant with things around her, despite this she care deeply about her club and those in it. Makoto Oono is the most reliable member in the club when it comes to fishing. She's able to clean fish well, cook, and overall very knowledgeable about fish. Natsumi Hodaka is the typical childhood friend, she likes to tease Hina and looks like a tomboy but in actuality is very good student much to Hina's surprise and very supportive of Hina's growth as a fan of fishing. It's a small but comfy club with each episode focusing on the life of fishing with friends!The best time to watch Houkago Teibou Nisshi is after being burnt out on seasonal anime. These type of down to earth anime hit new levels of comfort when you're burnt out. One of the helping factors being the comedy which was surprisingly funny at times, mostly because the characters sold it really well. As an anime the calm tone mixed harmoniously with the comedy.

Hopefully, that helped, thank you for reading it in advance.After getting delayed due to covid-19, Diary of Our Days at the Breakwater finally makes a finish for fans of the CGDCT theme, not even just those fans, regular watchers or people getting into CGDCT alike can share the same pleasure that comes with the anime. What a successful comeback.On first a look, mixing fishing and CGDCT may seem a bit odd at first, but after looking into what the theme has accomplished, it begins to become clear that just about anything can become better when you throw the correct amount...of cuteness within each girl. The same applies to Diary of Our Days at the Breakwater. It has the correct balance of cuteness, and, well, doing things.Story - 6:The story is average, other than its niche fishing theme, the story brings nothing new to the table. Stories like so aren’t necessarily a bad thing, but there is no room for bettering the show. You could argue that not everything has to have a super complex storyline and sometimes simplicity is the best. But from a show made up of plots taking a duration of half an episode. I find that there is no attempt to embrace the simplicity of the story. It is just, the lives of student fisherwomen, that is all there is to it. Nothing too deep. Though I can’t say the same for the sea… Going back to the show’s layout, taking half-episodes to make for 1 plot at the time, it can be quite hard to pull off when intentionally trying to make for a particularly good or interesting story. As seen with other anime with the same layout, they tend to suffer from an overabundance due to, well, nothing else but the premise of the show that will never change. Not surprisingly, it is the same for the show though what I will point out is that unlike other anime with incredible consistent plots, it is “lives of student fisherwomen” where, living life in a world as given, isn’t just fishing 24/7, there are other aspects such as the normal outings every now and then, in saying this though, even these aspects aren't focused upon too much.For a slice of life CGDCT, it does a good job at presenting what it wants to be, but even so, there was room for improvement for stoires as so, if only the story had more of a vairety to what was up with the club members it could have been better to sit through.Art/Visuals - 6:Really basic visuals, nothing too intriguing and it is probably something you have come across assuming you have seen a fair bit of anime in your lifetime. It had the normal effects such as black lines dropping from one’s head to convey the dead inside/depressed feeling, and the angle brackets for facial expressions. Essentially the norm.The same goes for the animation, there were a few inconsistencies in frames here and there but it isn’t so much that it is unwatchable.Sound/Audio - 6:Really basic OSTs, even the OP is in the same category, what I will say however is that I enjoyed the ED better than the OP, it had a catchy tune to it and is quite memorable.The VCs were okay, they did a good job at conveying character personalities, no problems to point out there.Character - 7:The characters were good, they all had nice chemistry between them, from the easily disgusted Hina, playful Natsumi, knowledgeable Oono and sly fox lady Kuroiwa. These characters sure did well together at bringing out the most of each other.Starting with Hina, she does have some character development to her and is probably the only character who gets this treatment, she goes from easily disgusted about scary ad slimy fish but over time she begins to learn that things aren’t as bad as they seem to be with a few exceptions, the same goes with her fishing skills, she learns more and more about the new skills you can use in fishing, in which she shows her intrigue in. She isn’t the most special of characters to exist but she has been made to a good standard nonetheless.Other characters such as Natsumi, Oono and Kuroiwa don’t get the development like Hina got, which is expected with the background to the club as well as the formatting of the episodes, but they do have their own little insights of when they were fishing, it is not expanded on so much, but it still exists there. It is a shame that these characters were kinda just left out to have nothing to add to their name other than a little history, but it was expected. Even if they didn’t have the same treatments as Hina did, they are still good characters that you can find an interest out of.Enjoyment - 7:I somehow ended up watching this religiously, it wasn’t so much that it was the most enjoyable thing in the world, but it was really good at what it was presenting so much so that I had to keep up with it whenever I could. In addition to this, you can also learn about fishing whilst watching, yeah, it went in one ear and out the next for me, but it was still enjoyable to see the different techniques people who fish use. Good quality and learning stuff on the side. Who knew the lives of students fishing could be so enjoyable.Overall - 6.4 (6)TLDR ReviewStory - 6: Very basic story of the daily lives of student fishers in the format of 1 plot in every half-episode, but it does well for a s.o.l, if it had more vairety it would have been better.Art/Visuals - 6: Very basic visuals you will have most likely come acrossSound/Audio - 6: Very basic OST and OP with the exception of a catchy EDCharacter - 7: Good character chemistry, though only Hina is developed with others having a little insight into themEnjoyment - 7: Ended up watching this religiously, you can also learn fishing stuff.Overall - 6.4 (6)As someone who found this unintentionally, I can say that the choice I made in watching this was a good one, so much so that I am also reading it’s source material due to its postponement of the anime. Honestly, this and a few other postponed stuff made for a good time to go for the source material that was still up and running depending on the different workers behind them. Anyways I guess that jumping in headfirst into things you haven’t seen yet isn’t always a bad idea, you never know what you might find.So what is today's haiku?Girls that do fishing.May not give the best story.But is a good watch.- NextUniverse. of cuteness within each girl.

Even if they didn’t have the same treatments as Hina did, they are still good characters that you can find an interest out of.Enjoyment - 7:I somehow ended up watching this religiously, it wasn’t so much that it was the most enjoyable thing in the world, but it was really good at what it was presenting so much so that I had to keep up with it whenever I could. In addition to this, you can also learn about fishing whilst watching, yeah, it went in one ear and out the next for me, but it was still enjoyable to see the different techniques people who fish use. Good quality and learning stuff on the side. Who knew the lives of students fishing could be so enjoyable.Overall - 6.4 (6)TLDR ReviewStory - 6: Very basic story of the daily lives of student fishers in the format of 1 plot in every half-episode, but it does well for a s.o.l, if it had more vairety it would have been better.Art/Visuals - 6: Very basic visuals you will have most likely come acrossSound/Audio - 6: Very basic OST and OP with the exception of a catchy EDCharacter - 7: Good character chemistry, though only Hina is developed with others having a little insight into themEnjoyment - 7: Ended up watching this religiously, you can also learn fishing stuff.Overall - 6.4 (6)As someone who found this unintentionally, I can say that the choice I made in watching this was a good one, so much so that I am also reading it’s source material due to its postponement of the anime. Honestly, this and a few other postponed stuff made for a good time to go for the source material that was still up and running depending on the different workers behind them.

Unlike most Cute Girls Do Cute Things shows, Houkago Teibou Nisshi is surprisingly visceral with its depiction of violence and murder and it doesn’t ever shy away from showing the gory details of it all, making it easily the most violent show of the year.But I kid (or am I?). Teibou is otherwise an incredibly relaxing show with a lovable fish-out-of-water protagonist descending into madness as she slowly depletes the ocean by way of murder...and fishing. Hina’s varying fishing expressions of her horror and squirmishness all make for great comedy material and you laugh along the other club members at her plight.As with Yuru Camp and Yama no Susume, it provides a more educational look into an outdoor hobby which you can look to as a beginner’s guide of sorts before you inevitably give up on it a few months later. And as with Yuru Camp, the best parts of the show are the cooking segments where the gang whips up something visually appealing you could almost smell it. Of course, don’t count on me gutting a fish anytime soon. I’d probably faint like Hina.While the character archetypes are nothing new (perpetually drunk sensei included), the show still makes great use of these characters in the scenarios they find themselves in and they do play off each other very nicely. There are also some nice instances of character depth as with Natsumi’s studiousness for example that do differentiate them from other one-note characters from other similar shows.While the Spring Season corona delay was inevitable, sometimes, as with fishing in real life, you just gotta keep waiting. And sometimes there are days where you just can’t get fish to bite you know?That said, for a show about all of nature’s delicious sea creatures, Teibou excels as both a comedy and a relaxation piece while being mighty informative to boot.

No one cared about the show anymore, and without any positive momentum, the MAL score was below 7.00 for much of its run.And that's a shame, because this is a diamond in the rough and is one of the best SoL shows I've seen. Breakwater integrated the educational bits very well into its...skits. It didn't need any narrator like Laid-Back Camp, as the club members taught Hina how to cook. And it didn't need any texting.

Koukaku Kidoutai Arise: Ghost in the Shell - Border:1 Ghost Pain,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17187/Koukaku_Kidoutai_Arise__Ghost_in_the_Shell_-_Border_1_Ghost_Pain,"[""Bold and cryptic, the original Ghost in the Shell movie (1995) is considered by many fans to be the apex of sci-fi anime within its decade. Over time, Oshii’s adroit directing influenced a multitude of many abstract ideas, both ambitious and creative. However, it was Kamiyama Kenji’s Stand Alone Complex iteration of the series that helped further the franchise's reputation as a result of its superb action scenes, script, and sophistication.With that said, Ghost in the Shell: Arise is a series that needs no introduction. But perhaps in an ironic way, it is essentially the introduction for the franchise. Although the franchise is largely...an elaborate piece comprised of intelligent crime cases that tackle thought-provoking issues, the cast remains enigmatic as a whole. In its entire run, only bits of backstories about the characters are scattered throughout, and Motoko’s relationships with the rest of Section 9 are not specified until the second season of the Stand Alone Complex.Arise however, gives very little in the way of answers for the amount of questions that it brings to the table. In many respects, the premise of a cybernetic hacker is redolent of the original Ghost in the Shell movie, though the unsettling atmosphere is construed and explained in a very different manner. Arise is very much focused on Motoko herself, rather than the broader social scope. In the event of Border: 1 Ghost Pain there is an alleged conviction that Motoko is the culprit of a murder case, and Motoko must confront herself in the midst of confusions to clear up her name.Consistently incorporated throughout the movie, Arise's ambiguity is the foothold for its mysterious components. While murky at times, the enigmatic nature of the movie allows for the truth of Motoko's conviction to surface in a tangible fashion. The beginning of the movie arouses a sense of confusion (in a good way) and easily attracts the audience's attention. However, the nature of the Arise series being separated into 50 minute entries very much limits the extent of the storytelling. In the case of Border: 1 Ghost Pain, this is especially true, as the riddle is unraveled in a predictable succession of preface, hinting of a villain, uncertainty, and then a final battle with said villain. The conflict is weakened in the process due to the simple mistake of a rushed pacing, leaving us with a shallow sense of suspense during the latter parts of the movie.Despite the contestable issues with the pacing, the essence of the character dynamics hasn't lost its touch in this movie. Motoko slowly re-encounters and stumbles upon many future members of the soon-to-be Section 9, and their relationships remain underdeveloped yet still sturdy. For an introductory plot, Arise made a first-rate effort of delivering the story in a simplistic yet appropriately mystical pattern. Unfortunately, the said deliverance is occasionally soiled by the inclusion of one-dimensional villains, whose actions conveniently fit as plot devices where needed.By and large, the animation is pleasing to look at. On one hand, the action scenes are all fluid and splendidly done. Likewise, the aesthetics generally illustrate appealing appearances. On the other hand, while the character designs are fresh and new, they could be viewed as dubious alterations by older fans. Similarly, the music is not as excellent as hoped. It is perhaps too high a bar for one’s music to live up to Yoko Kanno’s distinctive style. However, as individual background music, the OST is actually fine in setting the gloomy mood during the movie.As an experimental film to follow up on an imposing legacy, Border: 1 Ghost Pain has done a surprisingly fine job of providing basic background. While some lesser parts drag down the tension of the story as a whole, the core of the franchise is still there. Although it does not pay homage to the long-lived franchise, Arise proves to be a fascinating take on the sci-fi genre. For that, Border: 1 Ghost Pain still deserves a try for its creation of an intriguing thriller. Naturally, there are still three other movies that are subjected to their own merits, so it'll be interesting to see where it goes from here. an elaborate piece comprised of intelligent crime cases that tackle thought-provoking issues, the cast remains enigmatic as a whole.

So basically just dumb people.Ghost in the Shell has gone through a few hands in its life. From the cyberpunk manga origins by Shirow Masamune, before he turned into a weirdo who only drew calendars full of pictures of impossibly proportioned naked girls covered in machine oil, it then went to Oshi. There it had its most visually striking entrant with a gorgeously directed movie, albeit one lacking a little in character. Then he made a second movie...which we should all probably not talk about. Then it was handed over to Kenji Kamiyama and was allowed to spread its wings a little in two full length TV series. With this space it was able to explore a wide range of typical cyberpunk topics with frightening levels of depth in what I consider to be the strongest the franchise has ever been.The latest instalment sees it placed into the hands of Tow Ubukata as the chief writer and I will admit I was a little bit worried. This is the man whose most famous previous work was Mardock Scramble, a novel series that certainly had its interesting ideas but sorta lost track of them around about the time Norio Wakamoto was being eaten by flying homosexual sharks. Actually I think it was the dolphin that was homosexual…anyway, gay marine animals aside, it was a huge mess. So I tuned into Ghost in the Shell Arise with my expectations tempered significantly.So, Arise. It’s a prequel-of-sorts to Stand Alone Complex (apart from the fact characters’ backstories have changed so it’s not actually a prequel at all but it hardly matters) featuring a younger Major Kusanagi leaving her old military unit to form Section 9 on behest of a boring old man called Aramaki. Despite the backstories changing and therefore COMPLETELY RUINING the franchise, each character introduced feels like slipping back into comfortable old shoes. The Major is still her headstrong self with that self-doubt and temper hiding beneath. Batou is still the cyborg dudebro with a kind heart. Togusa is still that intelligent family man. The rest of the crew whose names you can never remember are still hanging around in the background being not as interesting.The story for Arise over its 4 episodes is about the nature of memories and how can you trust your cyborg brain when it can be hacked and change you as a person. Things you considered vital parts of your psyche could be lies and you doubt your own humanity when you can be so easily rewired. Who do you let past those defences you have built up in your fear that you may become something you are not. Who are you really and can you trust your body to represent you. Are you defined by your memories? Pretty standard stuff if you’ve ever experienced any previous iteration of Ghost in the Shell, but it hasn’t stopped being a fascinating subject in that time.Arise focuses on memories most of all and builds on this theme in some really quite excellent ways that aren’t immediately apparent from the start. Part of this is because the show is so bloody difficult to follow. Episode 1 is the worst in this regards. Being incredibly complicated to the point that you can feel your brain slowly dribble out your ears through exertion is again something very common to Ghost in the Shell. Making a Ghost in the Shell not complex would be like making a Gundam anime without robots. But when you start throwing in an unreliable narrator created by false memories altering what it is she sees to the point that you question whether anything you saw previously is true, that’s when you’re just being mean. The show is complicated enough as it is without making us doubt everything we’ve seen.Thankfully it improves immensely after that. Episode 2 is a perfect example of how to do it and should be a good outline for how to do every Ghost in the Shell episode. It’s about a military unit who have been put on a show trial for war crimes they didn’t commit so their boss shuts down the city by hacking into its traffic computers, so the Major and her team have to track the perpetrators down through both an epic car chase and hacking battle. It’s an episode that’s simple enough to wrap your head around with understandable motivations but still with the depth to the conflict that makes it interesting. It even has a twist involving the false memories that works because it’s only a single change that you can instantly understand the implications of and even throws in some character depth and themes of how our memories can define us.It also has a kick-ass car chase involving Arise’s versions of Tachikoma doing their best Attack on Titan’s Survey Corps impressions, swinging through the cyberpunk city with their absurdly cute high pitched cheers. For as much as I like to talk about all the depth and complexity of Ghost in the Shell, I also want to see the Major punch someone in the face so hard her own cyborg arm is crushed. The production values here are about equal to that of Stand Alone Complex, which is a little disappointing in that we haven’t progressed that much in the 10+ years since then but since Stand Alone Complex still looks fantastic today that’s not as negative a point as it sounds. Fights feel impactful and I even like the Major’s character design revamp (it’s about time she put on some bloody clothes).Where is has really upgraded is the CG. Where Stand Alone Complex CG cars look awful, Arise looks a lot better and even exciting. That car chase wouldn’t have looked anything like as good had Stand Alone Complex tried it with its CG. It can admittedly jump back and forth in quality though. Arise uses a hell of a lot of CG animation and it can be jarring when a character changes from one scene in CG to the second in hand-drawn, and it still lacks that all important weight that CG seems to be permanently saddled with. But it didn’t make me go “ewwww CG” which is an improvement in almost all other CG. On a cinematography standpoint though I feel Arise is the weakest in the franchise. The best it gets comes in the fourth episode when it makes some very deliberate call-backs to the movie.In the end I came away feeling quite positive about the whole experience. It definitely has its weaker points. It can’t match the movies visual flair nor have the space to recapture the depth and character of Stand Alone Complex, but it does get somewhere in between the two. The most positive thing I can say about it, as a huge fan of this franchise, is it definitely feels like Ghost in the Shell. Its characters, themes, writing and even general flow feel like Ghost in the Shell. It doesn’t come across as bad fanfiction tacked onto the franchise or anything like that (which this same author seems to be doing with whatever the fuck he’s done to Psycho Pass). It has all the things I love about the Ghost in the Shell franchise. Not any more than that, but not any less either. which we should all probably not talk about.

Not any more than that, but not any less either.', 'Perhaps this question may have popped into your mind one of these days: What happens to our future after the events of a world war? Perhaps we still exist but on the other hand, what would our new world be like? Well, it\'s a question that not many of us may care to know given our current circumstances. But world wars have happened in the past and they left devastating results. To quote from a famous German physicist, Albert Einstein once said:""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.""Well, it\'s...back. Even if it\'s not in original form, I am quite happy to see a revived Ghost in the Shell animation in some way or form. At the same time, it should be noted that this first film (and the rest) are considered prequels. In other words, this film does not belong to any of the original three series. This is an alternate series. Kenji Kamiyama , the director of the series, in fact isn\'t even involved with the project. Anyways, Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Border:1 Ghost Pain is the first of four films of a saga that takes place in 2027, apparently one year after the end of a non-nuclear world war. The setting takes place in New Port City where there\'s all sorts of drama and crimes.The film runs over 50 minutes but just under an hour. Its atmosphere reflects on the dark and grim like futuristic world where there\'s crime and anxiety. Even in the beginning, there\'s a bit of investigation related to the murder of an individual. Then of course, there\'s the investigators. Among one of them is our main female protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi of Unit 501. There\'s not much we learn about her except for the fact that her body is made up of cybernetic enhancements and is fully cyborg. Identified by her fierce eyes, Major plays the role of a dominant woman-cyborg hybrid who is fully capable of handling situations herself.Being set in a futuristic world, there are obviously futuristic themes and gadgets. Beyond just Major\'s cybernetic advancements, there are interactive AI, powerful surveillance devices, and machines that are capable of destruction. With its cyberpunk settings, it\'s no surprise that the futuristic world has more developed technologies to our own. Perhaps World War IV triggered more than just fear. Rather, it created a state in which the technologies we depend mayb become our own destruction. In the world of GITS, there\'s crime and weapons who falls into the hands of dangerous individuals can be a catastrophic.Among other factors in the film, there seems to be a little mystery regarding on the murder of the particular individual from the beginning. In fact, whoever killed him had his or her motives. The job is obviously handed to our Major who seems to struggle quite a bit in the case, at times even putting her colleagues\' lives at risk. Her action girl skills puts her in the shoes of a dominant female though as she is independent and often works at own her discretion. Mounted by her cool Kaneda style bike and red suit, Major fights with style and her own way. The way she handles cases seems to be straight out and to the point although surprises can take her on a different scale at various occasions.No discussion with GITS can be complete without returning characters right? Among one of the returning characters from the original series is a large man with strange eyes and also full of cybernetic enhancements. His name is Batou and there\'s definitely some suspicion that falls under his eyes. In fact, those eyes of his aims suspicion at our Major. As strange as it sounds, their reunion gets a bit rocky with fists aiming at one another. However, trouble brews faster than it comes as our main characters finds themselves in jeopardy at the mercy of many of the dangerous gadgets in this film.As I had expected, the OST mixes well with the action packed scenes. In fact, the action is fast paced with no holding back between many scenes. Handled by both guns and physically, the film adapts that straight out way of combat. Some of the battle scenes later on even resembles Terminator-like duels between cyborgs. In terms of mental aesthetics, GITS Arise also explores some of the inner parts of Major such as her \'memories\' and causes of a pain that she experiences throughout the film. Connecting with the cyberpunk themes, it\'s no surprise that the film decided to adapt these ideas. ""What\'s real?"" and ""What\'s the truth?"" are just a few questions that pops up into Major\'s mind.The result of the animation by Production IG in this film seems a bit different. Namely Major, her hair is of a different color for some reason than compared to the original GITS series. I did find Major\'s new character design to be out of space and strange. Also, the amount of fan service was somewhat more than I expected. Her design is also fitted with numerous cable plugs that truly reflects her nature as a cyborg. (those cables do come in handy by the way...) The backgrounds definitely gives off that natural feeling of being a world set in futuristic times though. The high level structures and machinery are just a few example. Among another key factor is the idea of the title. It\'s mysterious but fits with the idea.As for soundtrack, the film handled it quite well from my perspective with its electronic beats. There\'s a sense of that science fiction feeling that matches the many scenes of the film at many occasions whether be Major\'s action scenes, the OP song, or the voices of the characters. Speaking of which, Sakamoto Maaya once again lent her voice in this film as our main character Major. The way she speaks reflects her serious nature and ideas of dealing with crimes throughout the city. Then, there is also the ED song that has that unusual beat. Well, if anything, I thought the OST worked well for the film.All in all, this film is nostalgic and brings back some of that GITS feelings back. It\'s been quite awhile after all and this is a rather refreshment of what\'s to come next with Major and her crew. The animation is a bit out of shape but ignoring that aspect, this film brings out a scientific flow of crime investigation. If you were a fan of the cyberpunk genre or the original GITS series, then this film is definitely something to keep an eye on. Even if you\'re fresh and completely new to the franchise, its\' worth giving a shot. It\'s only about 50 minutes so consider that a standard for this film. Of course, there\'s three others to come later, with Ghost Whispers debuting in November. Simply put, give this film at least a try. GITS awaits you. back.

GITS awaits you.', 'At the top of the cyberpunk hill stands the Ghost in the Shell franchise. First formulated in concept by Masamune Shirow, it has been Mamoru Oshii\'s Ghost in the Shell (1995) film and Kenji Kamiyama\'s Standalone Complex series that have amassed wide and overwhelmingly positive reception. Ghost in the Shell: Arise—a four-part OVA series—is the most recent installment into the franchise, serving as a prequel set prior to Section 9\'s establishment. With high expectations coming from a new Ghost in the Shell title, it may not come as a surprise that Arise\'s first piece (Border:1 Ghost Pain) wields variable success.Perhaps one of the most noticeable...changes in Arise is the single point of view focus onto Motoko. Her actions and behavior play off as slightly more human in the OVA, whether it be displaying discernible facial expressions or occasionally acting by emotion. This causes her to seem more like her physical age than her typical, cold and cryptic self. Additionally, she holds more bearing on the story than normal. Aiming to solve a murder and later being implicated as the primary suspect, Motoko becomes pivotal in whether Arise can subtly yet powerfully grasp its story.As a teaser and opener, Border:1 does a decent job. The mystery remains simple while still wafting that old GITS tension; it nicely paces through the narrative on tried and true grounds. The investigations murk about, action scenes go a-flurry, and exciting plot twists make the sketches of a solid storyline. Motoko also receives hints of development through a partially grasped backstory, and while this may seem incomplete, Border:1 is after all only one of four entries, and the allusions toward more (particularly Motoko\'s development and thorough introductions to future Section 9 members) work seamlessly into the storytelling.Yet, this is also one of Arise\'s pitfalls. The simple plot structure—combined with a singular point of view and occasionally awkward pacing—can cause a few scenes to feel slightly linear and dull. Moreover, the restrictive point of view may narrow the scope of the OVA\'s aims, and GITS\'s recurring characters (namely, Araki, Batou, and Togusa) make a nice cameo but that\'s about it.This leaves a lurking, uneasy feeling about the work\'s direction; many of the sci-fi themes prevalent in previous titles are also non-existent here. However, what\'s fortunate is that Arise manages to keep many of the subtleties and charm within the character dialogues intact. It may not exactly feel like the GITS we\'ve all come to learn and love, but it\'s still a good sci-fi story nonetheless.Much of the streamlined narrative can also be attributed to the limited time allocated in Arise. After all, a one-hour treat can only do so much into framing the beginning, middle, and ends of a mystery. However, this limitation is surely not the only factor causing simplifications in the work; the villains come and go, the action scenes are numerous yet not always relevant to the plot, and certain dialogues seem out of place and unrequired. Still, at the heart of Arise\'s content lie the fundamental pieces which provide for good writing.While Arise\'s visuals proudly stands with its own style, its design choices have stirred controversy. The OVA beautifully flourishes a lighter opacity than previous installments. This luminosity offers a fresher appeal, leaving a tonal vibrance that nicely captures the ages of the slightly younger cast. However, paired with the more minimalist detail and brighter shade of skin tones, this can at times apprehend viewers. Motoko\'s character design, for instance, almost (note: almost) has that moe appeal trending among current shows. This no doubt has spurred contentions among the loins of all otaku and self-appraising viewers. Fortunately, what rare fanservice does exist encapsulates the same seinen bloodshed-and-boobies common in the genre. In other words, you won\'t be seeing Motoko pull off an Asuka catchphrase any time soon.The soundtrack remains true to the cyberpunk theme, offering circuits of electronic pop, jazz, and smooth guitar riffs. The choreography and overall animation are generally both fluid and topknotch, oozing out creativity with Arise\'s integration of cybertechnology in action scenes—realtime hacking wizardry, cybernetic organs, and quick-fire CQC. The 3D CGI works just as well as in Stand Alone Complex, with little to no intrusive vices; it\'s great to know these elements have (for the most part) marched the classic beat encased within the GITS franchise.With mixed success in its execution, Arise still serves as an admirable entry point into a new tetralogy. Production IG proves that its animation and visuals are still ever improving, and Arise\'s plot—while ""off""—makes a decent segway for the next three titles to come along.

For more details, please see the club frontpage. changes in Arise is the single point of view focus onto Motoko. Her actions and behavior play off as slightly more human in the OVA, whether it be displaying discernible facial expressions or occasionally acting by emotion. This causes her to seem more like her physical age than her typical, cold and cryptic self. Additionally, she holds more bearing on the story than normal. Aiming to solve a murder and later being implicated as the primary suspect, Motoko becomes pivotal in whether Arise can subtly yet powerfully grasp its story.As a teaser and opener, Border:1 does a decent job. The mystery remains simple while still wafting that old GITS tension; it nicely paces through the narrative on tried and true grounds. The investigations murk about, action scenes go a-flurry, and exciting plot twists make the sketches of a solid storyline. Motoko also receives hints of development through a partially grasped backstory, and while this may seem incomplete, Border:1 is after all only one of four entries, and the allusions toward more (particularly Motoko\'s development and thorough introductions to future Section 9 members) work seamlessly into the storytelling.Yet, this is also one of Arise\'s pitfalls. The simple plot structure—combined with a singular point of view and occasionally awkward pacing—can cause a few scenes to feel slightly linear and dull. Moreover, the restrictive point of view may narrow the scope of the OVA\'s aims, and GITS\'s recurring characters (namely, Araki, Batou, and Togusa) make a nice cameo but that\'s about it.This leaves a lurking, uneasy feeling about the work\'s direction; many of the sci-fi themes prevalent in previous titles are also non-existent here.

Rebuilding on a premise from scratch opens up an enormous amount of potential to tell a brand new and exciting spin on an old tale. This is especially the case when the world is as interesting and layered as Ghost in the Shell. But that’s exactly what makes reboots so worrisome. It’s up to the creators to capitalize on that potential, but they don’t always do. Which one did Production I.G do, you may ask?Ghost in the Shell: Arise Border: 1 Ghost Pain is the first part of a series of movies reimagining...the original Ghost in the Shell series. This new series is an origin story for Section 9, detailing what happened before they became the ass-kicking vigilantes of Stand Alone Complex. The story starts with Public Security Section 9 investigating the death of a high ranking military officer who may have been involved in some shady dealings. It turns out that this man is the superior of Motoko Kusanagi, who is currently working under a special unit of the military. Throw in a mysterious virus, some politics, some action, some self-reflection, and a number of shady individuals and you’ve cooked yourself up a GITS mystery.All the important characters of Ghost in the Shell make a comeback, though the spotlight is definitely on Motoko. Batou and Pazu play a part in solving the mystery, while Chief Aramaki, Borma, and Togusa are sort of pushed to the side. Many of the characters look and act noticeably younger.Motoko has undergone a drastic change. She’s given an entirely new backstory this time around, the most noticeable change being that we get to see her family. She is also far less experienced than her SAC counterpart. Of course, she is still a calm, collected, and capable woman. After all, she’s still a fearless combatant and a superb hacker. But keep in mind that this was before she was in command of Section 9, so there’s an absence of leadership and cooperative qualities in her character. She clearly wants to be a lone wolf, though that’s impossible considering the military branch she’s tethered to. Being in the position she’s in, there are times when she must rely on her superiors instead of confidently calling the shots like she did in Stand Alone Complex. Her character still has aspects of her previous personality, yet it’s slightly altered and molded into a much younger Motoko that fits with the setting of this reboot.The other characters aren’t really explored as well as Motoko. But it’s hinted that they’ve gotten the same treatment she did. Batou is still a tough and capable fighter, yet his brash and emotional side is hinted at with the “attack first, ask questions later” approach he takes when he thinks Motoko killed one of his partners. We are allowed to take a small peek in the lives of Pazu and Togusa during the movie as well. Togusa too doesn’t have much of the influence he had in GITS, and is frustrated over his treatment as a lowly detective.The story stays consistent for the most part, but seems to be a bit more action oriented than the movie and SAC. However, this does not detract from the story too much. It follows the previous formula of “crazy mystery involving viruses and shady characters” but it’s told in an interesting enough fashion to keep you glued to the screen until the finale. This is due in part to wanting to know all about the rich world and these fascinating characters that parade across the screen.GITS has always contained a fair amount of politics and philosophy. In Arise, these aspects are mostly dabbled in. Political conflicts and important bills that affect the world and characters are sort of briefly mentioned as an afterthought. The role of politics in the grand scheme of things isn’t actually revealed until the tail end of the movie. The questioning of one’s humanity is also not explored nearly as much as it was in the original film. This time around, it’s more like “what is real and what is not real” due to the mysterious virus affecting Motoko’s brain and altering her perception of reality. The story also ends a bit abruptly, leaving the viewer with quite a few questions.This is forgivable for a couple of reason. The first Arise film is shorter than the original movie and far shorter than SAC. For a 60 minute film, they were able to stick in quite a bit of content, but obviously they couldn’t fit in everything. This is also only one of four films in the Arise saga. The full potential and scope of this reboot has yet to be seen. This is only the beginning.Production I.G has outdone themselves with the art and animation in this movie. Every mech, every vehicle, every backdrop is given vivid color and detail. The fight scenes were given just as much attention, being fluid and sometimes a little over the top. The character designs have undergone some significant changes, with Motoko and Batou being changed the most. Almost everyone has less muscle definition, giving them a skinnier and more youthful appearance. Chief Aramaki looks closer to his character design in the original movie, albeit with no grey hair. Batou’s eyes and hair are different, while Motoko was given an almost complete overhaul. She is given a far more conservative look, with brighter and shorter hair. Those accustomed to the style of the movie, anime, or even the manga will probably be a bit taken aback by the altered character design. None of them are bad, but they do take some getting used too.Arise isn’t completely on par with its juggernaut predecessors. But it’s still an immensely enjoyable film, a fine piece of animation, and a worthy addition to the Ghost in the Shell franchise.It started strong, so let’s hope the rest of the Arise films can keep it going. the original Ghost in the Shell series.

I was also obsessed with the Metal Gear Solid game for PS1 and something about what was on the screen just really struck a nerve. I immediately asked my dad to let me rent it, and my love of anime had begun. I had seen anime prior to that, but that was the first time I knew it was animation...from Japan. I was hooked. Ghost in the Shell has remained one of my favorite series ever since, in fact not even considering just anime it is one of my favorite Sci-Fi series ever. So when I saw there was a new GitS I was happy to say the least, but also a bit skeptical.Story(8): Overall I think the story was well done, it was very much like what I would expect from Ghost in the Shell. That being said, it wasn\'t amazing or anything, it was like a stand alone episode from SAC(which really isn\'t a bad thing). It also becomes clear early on that Kusanagi isn\'t with section 9 yet, and the story is basically her first encounter with them. I know a lot of people may have an issue with the backrounds of the characters not being the same as in SAC, but this is an alternate version and I don\'t see that as a negative. All the things that make Ghost in the Shell great are here and done well, espionage, realistic sci-fi elements, action. I was overall impressed with it.Art(8): My first impressions from the trailers were that the animation was ""ok"". After watching the whole movie I have to admit the animation is very good. It does seem to not have quite as much detail as SAC or the original, but it shows a lot of promise during the action scenes and the details of the cyborgs. There\'s a certain scene where Kusanagi is in a fight and her limbs get ripped off slowly and her cyborg parts start to show, very reminiscent of the original film, and it looked great. As for the art style/character design changes, I wasn\'t as effected by them as I expected. I think they were very well done, just not what we\'re used to. I\'m sure some people wont be able to get over this change though, for me it wasn\'t a big deal.Sound(8): I usually don\'t have too much to say in this category, but Arise had good sound quality and voice acting. All the sound effects for guns, hacking/computer noises, cyborg noises, ext sounded great. The music was also rather good, although I\'ve seen people saying they dislike it. I personally thought it was good. The voice acting is great, I believe the voice actors for most of the cast from the original 96\' film returned to play their roles, although I admit I watched the dub of the original so that wasn\'t a big deal for me. They did a great job though.Characters(8): The characters we already know pretty well, and while Kusangai seems to have a slightly different personality the rest of the crew seem very much like themselves. I know for some people ""change=bad"", but I got over it quickly and adapted to the slight differences in the new section 9 members. I will mention that some of the side characters were rather bland and not very memorable. I can\'t wait to see these new takes on the characters we love developed further in the next three movies.Overall/Enjoyment(8): I have to say, I enjoyed it a lot. More then I expected to, I expected it to be a decent Sci-Fi anime but not live up to the GitS name. It wasn\'t quite as good as SAC or the original, but it very possibly could manage to be in the next three movies. I really thought it was well done, and I was impressed with the action sequences and keeping the espionage moments interesting and on par with previous GitS outings. Overall, I could not be happier. This is exactly what I\'ve wanted recently with there being a lack of good seinen anime. I can\'t wait for the next movie to come out.I\'m still fairly new to reviewing, so sorry if I\'m not as professional as some of the people on here. I don\'t cover the plot much, because it\'s a 55min movie, just watch it. No point in just repeating the description in my opinion. Hope my review was helpful. from Japan. I was hooked.

Yes, it is indeed a dystopian future sci-fi movie with androids. Yes, it has the same characters, (or at least the same character names.) Let\'s dive in shall we?-Story-The story of the new Arise series isn\'t a sequel or prequel to the existing Ghost in the Shell franchise by Mamoru Oshii, instead it\'s called a ""re-imagining"" of its older brother.Let\'s start with the world and atmosphere - it\'s gone.It\'s not the atmosphere you would expect to see from a...Ghost in the Shell movie. Being different is not inherently a bad thing, but in this case it\'s a step back, and the world feels like just another futuristic sci-fi movie. That Blade Runner style of atmosphere we all loved is gone. This has much to do with the visuals, such as the art style and the color palette they chose to go with. In the original Ghost in the Shell, the visuals did a major part in telling the story. Here, it\'s just bland.Despite being a ""re-imagining"" , the movie does nothing to introduce the viewer to it\'s characters and it\'s world. Besides a few action scenes, I felt like nothing really happened. There are many tropes, like the main character not being able to differentiate reality and what she\'s seeing, and they could have utilized these better. Instead the story doesn\'t really go anywhere with them. It\'s not the type of story that\'s going to ask you a lot of questions or keep you awake.-Characters-Oh Major, what a shame they did to you.As you would expect from a re-imagining, the traits of the characters are not the same as the original franchise. Instead what we got are some characters that are just -there-. You\'re not going to grow any emotional ties to these characters from watching the movie. There is no depth to any of the characters, as it feels that they are there simply to move the plot along and have some interactions with each other.A real let down for me was how they handled Major Kusanaji. They stripped her of all her complexity. The Makoto who was struggling to feel human emotions and was struggling to explore what makes androids different from humans is not there. Instead the Arise version of Makoto is your generic main character. No inner conflicts, no depth, just a pretty face who fights. What a disappointment.-Sound and Animation-Again, very generic and painfully mediocre.The mesmerizing music from the original is gone and replaced with generic music that I don\'t even remember how it sounded like, and that tells a lot. Animation and Art Style is good, nothing special but it\'s good. However, it does not fit the dystopian setting of the movie at all. It lacks the visual story telling and the set pieces the original contained. Again I was bitterly disappointed.-Enjoyment-Ha ha , I did not.-Overall-It wasn\'t an appalling experience, but when you hear Ghost in the Shell, you expect more than just a sci-fi action movie. I feel like this would have been better if they did not slap the ""Ghost in the Shell"" brand on it and made it it\'s own franchise.If you\'re a Ghost in the Shell fan , you\'re going to be disappointed with this movie. Even if you\'re just looking for Sci-Fi action movie, there are much better movies. But if you\'re really bored and have nothing else to watch, this is a serviceable.[Proofreading - SomeRandomNerd] Ghost in the Shell movie.

But if you\'re really bored and have nothing else to watch, this is a serviceable.[Proofreading - SomeRandomNerd]', 'Disclaimer: As another reviewer said, splitting up the Arise-Border miniseries into separate parts is just silly. This will cover the entire thing.So what is Arise-Border? What should have been a straight-forward ""re-imagining"" of the cult classic turned international favorite strays all too quickly within the first few minutes. Instead of giving us a faithful ""re-telling"" with our characters being better-developed (a short-coming of SaC) and the story being old-news, Arise-Border seems to want to be something else while knowing it can\'t. So, basically the odd child in the family nobody knows what to do with. Just nurture them or something.Arise-Border is what I think the...first part of the Arise ""retelling"" and it hits the ground stumbling. The first episode plods along uncertain of itself and how to invest its viewers while trying to tell the story of Makoto before she left her military unit to become an ""independent contractor"" aka join Section 9. My initial issue with Makoto in SaC was her being seemingly unstoppable, but still likable. This Makoto is so wonderfully incompetent it makes you wonder at points how anyone held her in high regard.Batou and Togusa are here, but the ""buddy cop"" relationship hasn\'t even had the seed planted yet. We do see a younger, stubborn Togusa (although his character hasn\'t changed that much, has it?) still green as a detective and instead of the highly-regarded guy any police force would want, he comes off as more the only guy who actually uses his brain on the force. Batou on the other hand feels like the perfect amount of goofy and ""big guy"" which saves the main trio. Thank the forces of nature, too, because the other members only exist to have a moment of exposure and then fade back into the background.I\'ll continue downing on the other stuff in a second, but I wanted to give the technical side of things some exposure. I mentioned in my SaC review that the music was fantastic and worth a listen; Arise-Border doesn\'t seem to know why. The opening is almost a lazy attempt at the beauty of Origa\'s voice mixed with some half-baked synth and I won\'t even go into the other stuff. I\'ve said in another review that the music isn\'t what makes a series, but it can hurt it. Here, the absence of any music in some scenes is a Godsend. If a series doesn\'t know what its sound department is doing, leave the tracks that are supposed to stimulate the viewer as part of the whole, out.The art is good, but the designs that aren\'t set-pieces are okay. Some scenes really feel pleasing to the eyes while others (like episode 4\'s fight scene in the lab) are hard to watch if only because of how disjointed and out-of-place they feel. Thankfully, the series doesn\'t do this too often and when it does, you can take some comfort in knowing those scenes won\'t last long.The story itself is episodic and struggling to remain interconnected. The overarching plot is the ""Fire Starter"" virus that is affecting our post-modern military structure and causing false memories which lead to otherwise law-abiding persons to commit crimes. The first episode plays too much with the ""what is real?"" concept and loses sight before making a sharp U-turn back to the plot. The second episode does it better, but the last few minutes feel more like an attempt to recapture what SaC did right and run with it. Unfortunately, that ""out of place"" feeling comes back.The third episode is really good in that it takes advantage of having what the previous two set up and adding to the main plot. While nothing is actually resolved, there is development for the major. Unfortunately, the next episode shows a kind of unnatural regression for her character. Huh.Aramaki in this version is hard to watch. The cool, steely-eyed monkey-face is reduced to a begging old man chasing after a young body for her ""talent"". If I didn\'t know him to be the badass old guy from SaC, I would feel contempt for the character. Instead, this almost seems like a betrayal and the way he constantly demands Makoto and co join Section 9 is almost as painful to watch as the hard-headed major act like a bratty child who either gets her way or nobody can play with the ball.Arise-Border isn\'t a GitS series in the traditional sense. What should have been a creative re-telling is instead a lopsided building the engineers painted in bright colors and straight-faced told everyone it had ""personality"". Look at it, take a picture, but don\'t invest too much in it. first part of the Arise ""retelling"" and it hits the ground stumbling. The first episode plods along uncertain of itself and how to invest its viewers while trying to tell the story of Makoto before she left her military unit to become an ""independent contractor"" aka join Section 9. My initial issue with Makoto in SaC was her being seemingly unstoppable, but still likable. This Makoto is so wonderfully incompetent it makes you wonder at points how anyone held her in high regard.Batou and Togusa are here, but the ""buddy cop"" relationship hasn\'t even had the seed planted yet. We do see a younger, stubborn Togusa (although his character hasn\'t changed that much, has it?) still green as a detective and instead of the highly-regarded guy any police force would want, he comes off as more the only guy who actually uses his brain on the force. Batou on the other hand feels like the perfect amount of goofy and ""big guy"" which saves the main trio. Thank the forces of nature, too, because the other members only exist to have a moment of exposure and then fade back into the background.I\'ll continue downing on the other stuff in a second, but I wanted to give the technical side of things some exposure. I mentioned in my SaC review that the music was fantastic and worth a listen; Arise-Border doesn\'t seem to know why. The opening is almost a lazy attempt at the beauty of Origa\'s voice mixed with some half-baked synth and I won\'t even go into the other stuff. I\'ve said in another review that the music isn\'t what makes a series, but it can hurt it. Here, the absence of any music in some scenes is a Godsend.

It\'s essentially a stand alone episode you might find in the series with alot more color and the new style that comes with the reboot. In this review I am going to talk of what I think about the first episode of this new GiTS film series, and the direction the reboot is taking.Ghost in the Shell is not a series that is new to reboots. Almost every other installment in the franchise is in someway a retcon of the original work, or a work based on...the original work. Because of this, saying ""I like Ghost in the Shell"" is no longer a very specific statement, the series is very wide reaching in its themes as well as general content. Although both very well done in my opinion, the stand alone complex series and the original film are almost black and white, not even going into the much different manga. When I heard that GiTS was being rebooted into another installment, and I saw the Major\'s redesign, right away my hipster sense had activated and I passed it off as another modernized money grab and a waste of time. Luckily for me, my quick judgment was quite off from reality.You can think of this reboot as somewhat of a prequel to Stand Alone Complex. It has been confirmed both internally and externally that is not the same canon, but they are both very similar in presentation and general state of affairs. Due to this, Arise has much more in common with the cop mystery in episodes of SAC then the film series. That is to say, you will not find existential science fiction philosophy and the deep boots nature of the original film. Arise is done under the pretense of a look at the characters of SAC and what they did before they became the elite unit of Section 9. Arise stars the younger, redesigned Motoko revolves around her solving a mystery around the same time that she first meets Section 9. Significant changes to the Major\'s character became apparent directly and indirectly. Upon starting this film, the first thing viewers will notice is that the Motoko that stars this movie not only looks younger, she also sounds much younger than her previous iterations. The younger voice and stuff is an obvious hint that Motoko is not as strong or as in control as she was in the other mediums, that she is not quite as mature or dominant as an investigator either. This is the first spin on things that makes Arise stand out from what would basically just be a stand alone episode of SAC. At first I didn\'t particularly enjoy the more girly Major, but 15 minutes in you accept it as the character dynamic the film under its new direction is going for.The first episode of Arise\'s plot is something like this. A Lt. Col who was the leader of a special unit has been blown up by a bot, and oddly enough Motoko is part of this ""Unit 501."" She goes off trying to solve the case, running into Section 9\'s Daisuke Amaragi for the first time in the process. In lieu of a typical SAC subplot, things are definitely not as simple as they look on the surface. The Major starts to uncover a huge military conspiracy related to herself in the process of the investigation, and the film visits the recurring theme of Motoko\'s cyborg issues with that. Not going to go into too much more detail with the plot. The story of Ghost Pain left a good impression on me. It was interesting, short enough, and rife with unexpected plot twists, but not deus ex machinas like in Solid State Society. Although interesting, and interesting from the get go to long term GiTS fans, it really isnt much more than a typical mystery. There are mysteries that go beyond what is typical, we\'ve seen this in other entries of GiTS such as GiTS 2: Innocence. It\'s not a bad plot by any means, its not even really average considering what the average plot is. I just think that, taken at face value, there are some SAC episodes that are more creative. This is just one part of what Arise is though, its not just about what the story was, but how its executed with this rebuilt style, and that was the best part about Ghost Pain. Ghost Pain felt like a super high budget SAC episode. Everything was colorful, action packed, and generally really cool. I want people to know that Ghost in the Shell has not been dumped down from anything Solid State Society was, so if you think there will be vast infodumps, you will not find them. The action in particular was very good in this installment. Cyborg combat has always been fast and heavy in GiTS series, and the animators took it to town.Its unfortunate that we saw almost nothing of the rest of Section 9. Ghost Pain basically stars Motoko and only Motoko. Other members of Section 9, even the major ones like Batou and Togusa, their appearances can hardly be called anything but cameos. They offer almost nothing to the overall story, and see no character development at all. There is so little screentime to Batou and Togusa I could not even confirm if there were any changes in their personalities over their original incarnations. You would think that a reboot with an emphasis on redesigned and differently presented characters would have an emphasis on said characters, but that does no occur. All attention is on The Major, and unfortunately this doesn\'t really work out in the character department. We see some bits of subplot over the Major\'s tragic past that leads into a complex about her cyborg body, but no this is nothing new to the Ghost in the Shell series. Compared to the character dynamics of the Major you see in the latter parts of 2nd Gig, SSS, and of course the original film, Ghost Pain achieves so little it can hardly hold a candle to them in this category. I however, do keep in mind that theres only so much a 1 hour introduction film can do, so there is some degree of holding out you should have before you start to see these things.Yoko Kano and Kenji Kawai are out, and the film suffers because of it. No memorable music in this film.GiTS Arise: Ghost Pain is 7/10 introduction to this new GiTS series. Great action, a good story, and alright characters await new and old Ghost in the Shell fans who watch this rather shiny but not superficial entry. I am looking forward to the next film in the series and have high expectations. the original work.

However, story remains dense with its political fodder. Characterization is emphasized more so than the SAC series which helps to newcomers. Veterans of the series will feel they are treading similar water but will feel at home in the gits world. There can never be enough GITS it's a fascinating series that continues to intrigue even after it's release in the 90s. However, The arise series is nothing new and doesn't expand the overall gits world. It plays it safe to not...taint the previous film masterpieces and fits in well as a compliment to the SAC series. There comes a time though where fans may grow tired of the same themes and characters. GITS is an immersive world and it would be more refreshing to have new characters, themes,  and plot developments outside of the SAC unit. GITS Arise has a revised art style and I for one am not a big fan of the new look angst emo haircut on her LOL. Regardless, the show is worth checking out if you are interested in the GITS films or tv series and has a much improved follow up episode on Border 2. taint the previous film masterpieces and fits in well as a compliment to the SAC series.

It keeps provoking thoughts about the series in every movie and every episode, with mostly unpredictable plot twists making it a really good franchise. The newest part of it, being Ghost in the Shell: Arise, is the prequel to everything else.Story: The Story is set in the year 2027. A high military high ranked man gets murdered in the streets and Kusanagi Motoko who was his subordinate wants to take it over. The movie follows her solving the crime, but soon enough she...herself is getting suspected...In total the story is not engaging as earlier GitS crimes, such as the laughing man, but still has some really good twists.8/10Characters: The cast pretty much consists of the later Section 9 shown in the other franchise parts and centers around the coming together of them. They didn't really get a lot of depht in this movie, but considering how much it was in the other movies that is not that bad for people who already watched the other parts, but for someone that is new to the franchise, by now I wouldn't tell to watch this first. There are for more Borders on the way though, so maybe we'll see that in later parts.7/10Art: The Animation of Arise is done by the same studio who produced every single other GitS part, which was Production I.G. They did another really good job at this and that was what the made the action scenes really cool. The new character design of the Major was a bit unusual if you've seen earlier parts, but once you got used to it it was fine.9/10Sound: The thing I liked the least about Ghost in the Shell: Arise, was the soundtrack. Everything fit and so on, but it never did give me the feel of the show that Kanno Yoko and Kawai Kenji gave me. The voiceacting was good as always.5/10Enjoyment: Arise was everything but not flawless. But in total the movie was done fairly well.

The original release dates got delayed suspiciously close to when it was revealed the Arise movies would be reworked into a TV series. If I were on the production team for the dub that’d certainly kill my spirits, but I’m glad they saw the project through to the end because I’m so used to watching Ghost in the Shell dubbed. That doesn’t count for much this time, though. Unfortunately, the original voice cast has been completely replaced. A pointless endeavor since the new cast tries their hardest to imitate the old...only to fall short because of the simple fact it’s not the same person. The “uncanny valley”-ness of the new voices makes the dub job more than just a little weaker. It reminds you of when things were better. This latest Ghost in the Shell series does that in general.I’m not being pessimistic, just making an observation and calling it as I see fit. I’m not greedy enough to expect multiple five star meals from the Ghost in the Shell franchise. If Arise is indicative of the general quality the franchise Is going to be from here on after having played its trump cards, that’s a pretty good deal. The Arise team did a great job at creating a reboot with an original story that feels perfectly in place in the GitS world thematically and stylistically. The changes are ultimately minor and none of the franchise’s integrity has been lost. It really is just more Ghost in the Shell. The only question is how it stacks up the old.Perhaps the most unique thing about the Arise continuity and its greatest hook for old GitS fans is that it attempts an origin story for Section 9 where its most well-known members haven’t joined yet. The previous anime didn’t really attempt an origin. I didn’t have a problem with that approach, as Ghost in the Shell’s “in media res” approach to storytelling is one of my favorite things about its writing. You got to piece together the greatest world in science fiction by yourself, and the satisfaction of doing so accompanied with how well it all genuinely worked together was immense. The lack of exposition and origin detail made the already plausible universe not feel contrived, and it made an immersive experience that only gave you new information.Arise has a similar respect for its audience’s intelligence, but at this point I feel like it’s expecting them to already understand the technology and various mechanisms of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. This means it has a better excuse for withholding information than Mamoru Oshii’s movie, but it also means it’s still an inferior starting point to Stand Alone Complex which finds the running time to allow the viewer to fully adjust to the world while being able to follow the stand-alone plots well enough to not be bored. I actually found Arise’s first episode, Ghost Pain, to be the hardest to follow Ghost in the Shell story yet. Not in a good way that hints at complexity, though. Just a few moments of “how did that character make that connection and why are they doing what they’re doing?”. By the end I felt like I had a grip on things, but if I cared to look closer after uncovering the mystery I worry some of the scenes would’ve genuinely been poorly written. Again, it’s the plot that’s obscure this time, not the terminology. Which is a problem I don’t remember having before.These frustrating moments didn’t ruin the experience for me at least. The year this time is 2027 which I think is the earliest year Ghost in the Shell has ever been placed (how do they now think it’s going to take even less time to reach this technology?). Motoko Kusanagi returns to solve the murder behind one of her superiors. She has a run-in with Section 9 and decides to form a suspicious alliance with their chief, Daisuke Aramaki. Motoko is more of a central character this time around than any Ghost in the Shell work since the original Oshii movie. I find this to be somewhat disappointing, as I always thought Batou and Togusa were better characters and they’re barely featured here. Motoko is great, but I always saw her as more of a symbol for Ghost in the Shell’s themes than a distinct human being. I’ve accepted that her seeming lack of humanity is intentional, a representation of GitS’s highly networked world through a person whose sense of self is impressed on by communicating with others in order to form a whole or a desire to move past individual consciousness altogether. Still, I’ve never found herself that compelling. Part of this is also deliberate as her backstory has been kept extremely hidden, but regardless that’s how I feel. Batou and Togusa are more empathetic.And yet, they do their part to make Motoko’s past a more important thing than it’s ever been due to the fact that this new series’ central theme is identity and memory manipulation. A fantastic idea as GitS has always been focused on existential philosophy and this explores the possible implication of its unique cyber brain technology. It’s a new focus for the franchise that’s completely attuned with its usual interests, and it’s directly linked to its setting. I certainly find it preferable to 2nd Gig going over the Stand Alone Complex theory again and downplaying its direct relationship with the unique technology through a 1:1 post-9/11 geopolitics metaphor and commentary.I found the production qualities to be about the same level as the Stand Alone Complex series, if not a little bit better (as it should be, since it’s a movie). There’s some frame-skipping during movement but nothing that bad, and although this installment features more action than I care for it features great fight choreography. Use of CG is either subtle on the characters during action scenes or it doesn’t stand out in the environment as with the usual Tachikomas, which is good. The soundtrack is handled by a musician called Cornelius this time around. He’s nowhere close to the level of Yoko Kanno – absolutely nothing got stuck in my head which may be the most disappointing aspect of this release but otherwise his glitchy IDM at least suits the setting and theme of electronic mind corruption. Another thing that’s always drawn me to Ghost in the Shell that I’m sure no one else cares about as much is the impeccable city design and cinematography. Every landscape shot of the city in this franchise takes my breath away and is enough for me to always keep my eyes locked on the screen. Arise keeps that trend up perfectly. I’d love to live in the Ghost in the Shell universe. The one we’re in now already has just as bad political corruption anyway.Now it’s time to talk about the revised character designs. I feel the same way as I do about the voice cast change: why bother? The character designs are close enough to the old ones to not really feel like a difference, so it’s just irritating how it’s slightly off and thinks that’s enough to be called innovation. We didn’t need new character designs, and if we did these sure as hell wouldn’t cut it. Motoko has taken the biggest hit, now being a much younger girl. People’s complaints about this have been reasonable because Motoko’s character design is largely why she stands out and is so impressionable. It’s precisely because the heroine in an anime isn’t a teenage girl for once and is instead a full-grown adult who’s mature and capable of taking charge and succeeding at any task like a true elite. Arise’s Motoko is still largely the same personality (as are the other characters), but her character design no longer reflects that. And yes, it’s reasonable to assume that this was an attempt to attract a wider audience because the reason old Motoko stood out was for reasons that are also why her type of character design isn’t more popular in Japan. They like younger characters. For whatever the reason, there’s no way around it. And teen Motoko still finds plenty of excuses to run around in her underwear or browse around cyberspace naked, even if her tits and ass are smaller. This has always bothered me because it’s like the show is pretending it’s above fanservice with its intelligence but ultimately finding (not-so) subtle ways to fit it in anyway. Whatever, I’m used to it by now.I’m not sure yet what the remaining episodes of Arise have in store or if it’ll get better in the story department, but my expectations were met. Above all else it’s just great to see more Ghost in the Shell. If the franchise continues being handled this well then I’m fine with a lifetime of mostly the same-old, same-old. only to fall short because of the simple fact it’s not the same person. The “uncanny valley”-ness of the new voices makes the dub job more than just a little weaker. It reminds you of when things were better.

I actually found Arise’s first episode, Ghost Pain, to be the hardest to follow Ghost in the Shell story yet. Not in a good way that hints at complexity, though. Just a few moments of “how did that character make that connection and why are they doing what they’re doing?”. By the end I felt like I had a grip on things, but if I cared to look closer after uncovering the mystery I worry some of the scenes would’ve genuinely been poorly written. Again, it’s the plot that’s obscure this time, not the terminology. Which is a problem I don’t remember having before.These frustrating moments didn’t ruin the experience for me at least. The year this time is 2027 which I think is the earliest year Ghost in the Shell has ever been placed (how do they now think it’s going to take even less time to reach this technology?). Motoko Kusanagi returns to solve the murder behind one of her superiors. She has a run-in with Section 9 and decides to form a suspicious alliance with their chief, Daisuke Aramaki. Motoko is more of a central character this time around than any Ghost in the Shell work since the original Oshii movie. I find this to be somewhat disappointing, as I always thought Batou and Togusa were better characters and they’re barely featured here. Motoko is great, but I always saw her as more of a symbol for Ghost in the Shell’s themes than a distinct human being. I’ve accepted that her seeming lack of humanity is intentional, a representation of GitS’s highly networked world through a person whose sense of self is impressed on by communicating with others in order to form a whole or a desire to move past individual consciousness altogether. Still, I’ve never found herself that compelling. Part of this is also deliberate as her backstory has been kept extremely hidden, but regardless that’s how I feel. Batou and Togusa are more empathetic.And yet, they do their part to make Motoko’s past a more important thing than it’s ever been due to the fact that this new series’ central theme is identity and memory manipulation. A fantastic idea as GitS has always been focused on existential philosophy and this explores the possible implication of its unique cyber brain technology. It’s a new focus for the franchise that’s completely attuned with its usual interests, and it’s directly linked to its setting. I certainly find it preferable to 2nd Gig going over the Stand Alone Complex theory again and downplaying its direct relationship with the unique technology through a 1:1 post-9/11 geopolitics metaphor and commentary.I found the production qualities to be about the same level as the Stand Alone Complex series, if not a little bit better (as it should be, since it’s a movie). There’s some frame-skipping during movement but nothing that bad, and although this installment features more action than I care for it features great fight choreography. Use of CG is either subtle on the characters during action scenes or it doesn’t stand out in the environment as with the usual Tachikomas, which is good. The soundtrack is handled by a musician called Cornelius this time around. He’s nowhere close to the level of Yoko Kanno – absolutely nothing got stuck in my head which may be the most disappointing aspect of this release but otherwise his glitchy IDM at least suits the setting and theme of electronic mind corruption. Another thing that’s always drawn me to Ghost in the Shell that I’m sure no one else cares about as much is the impeccable city design and cinematography. Every landscape shot of the city in this franchise takes my breath away and is enough for me to always keep my eyes locked on the screen. Arise keeps that trend up perfectly. I’d love to live in the Ghost in the Shell universe. The one we’re in now already has just as bad political corruption anyway.Now it’s time to talk about the revised character designs. I feel the same way as I do about the voice cast change: why bother? The character designs are close enough to the old ones to not really feel like a difference, so it’s just irritating how it’s slightly off and thinks that’s enough to be called innovation. We didn’t need new character designs, and if we did these sure as hell wouldn’t cut it. Motoko has taken the biggest hit, now being a much younger girl. People’s complaints about this have been reasonable because Motoko’s character design is largely why she stands out and is so impressionable. It’s precisely because the heroine in an anime isn’t a teenage girl for once and is instead a full-grown adult who’s mature and capable of taking charge and succeeding at any task like a true elite. Arise’s Motoko is still largely the same personality (as are the other characters), but her character design no longer reflects that. And yes, it’s reasonable to assume that this was an attempt to attract a wider audience because the reason old Motoko stood out was for reasons that are also why her type of character design isn’t more popular in Japan. They like younger characters. For whatever the reason, there’s no way around it. And teen Motoko still finds plenty of excuses to run around in her underwear or browse around cyberspace naked, even if her tits and ass are smaller. This has always bothered me because it’s like the show is pretending it’s above fanservice with its intelligence but ultimately finding (not-so) subtle ways to fit it in anyway. Whatever, I’m used to it by now.I’m not sure yet what the remaining episodes of Arise have in store or if it’ll get better in the story department, but my expectations were met. Above all else it’s just great to see more Ghost in the Shell. If the franchise continues being handled this well then I’m fine with a lifetime of mostly the same-old, same-old.', ""Well as a GITS fan I had to watch this. I didn't expect much from this. I really loved the original first film. The series and other films were not bad either. Who wouldn't fall in love with Motoko right? :DAnyway, this piece was not that bad in the end. It was really interesting to see what happened before all the things in films etc. How Motoko met young Aramaki (well, younger than in the films and series, he has still brown hair here O_O) and the rest of her future team.I really appreciated that they draw all the characters according to the first film...and even used the same voice actors if possible. I liked major more with her body from SAC more though. Nevertheless it was really nice to bring back my memories and feeling from the time I watched the first movie, few years ago.The result is, everyone who is GITS fan should watch this. It is not crap, not masterpiece either but decent piece of GITS franchise.BTW: Nice action scenes and fights. Mmmm Motoko is even more deadly in her younger version :D. and even used the same voice actors if possible. I liked major more with her body from SAC more though.

Mmmm Motoko is even more deadly in her younger version :D."", 'The most common complaint I see about Arise is that it isn\'t Stand Alone Complex, it\'s not consistent with SAC, and it doesn\'t capture the same feel. This is all true. Arise is a different timeline, a different spin on section 9 and while it may act as Section 9\'s origin story, and it is, but not one consistent with SAC. Know this as you watch it.The second is Motoko Kusanagi\'s character design. This is a bit more valid, as the major is one of the most memorable and iconic characters in cyberpunk, and probably all of anime.I liked both SAC and Arise, and...will inevitably need to draw a few comparisons. But, this isn\'t about SAC, it\'s about Arise, so onto the review.SettingThe first part of Arise is set in, you guessed it, near future Tokyo, well, it\'s actually a fictional city called Newport, but it might as well be Tokyo for all intents and purposes. However, the setting differs from usual cyber punk fare by looking almost like a typical modern city. Apart from a decent amount of technological integration, Newport City of Arise is nearly identical to the Tokyo (or any other modern city) of any anime set in a present day city. I feel this is more realistic. Consider the change in cityscape from 20 years ago. Skyscrapers are taller, lights are brighter, touch screens are more prevalent, but aside from that, the Star Wars-esque spires and Vibrant LED lighting portrayed in 80s future fantasies are as distant as ever. It\'s understated setting is fitting for an anime that plays off of GitS themes but tones down the ""cyber"" aspect of cyberpunk. Many may dislike this because it doesn\'t feel futuristic, but the setting design is well done for the most part, especially in th fight sequences.The major\'s character design is similarly believable. No large purple hair or tights. I get her design in SAC and I like it, but I don\'t think that changing it devalued the franchise or her character, in fact, I preferred it, allow me to elaborate. The SAC Motoko is the boss. She has her own team, she\'s skilled in cyber warfare, and she can get what she wants despite the labyrinth of bureaucracy involved in conducting covert operations. Her character design exemplifies this, the fact that she chooses to remain female despite being able to change into a male body (which we learn from Batou is advantageous in several ways), tells us that choosing her appearance is important to her.The Motoko of Arise is not the Motoko of SAC. She isn\'t the boss of anything, she\'s skilled in combat and espionage due to her cyborg and training body, but it\'s unit 501 property, she doesn\'t own anything, not even her body. But considering how little control she seems to have in her life, the major manages to  pursue the case of her murdered commanding officer, which the government seems to be going to great lengths to cover up. The lack of control in her life is expanded upon with the core theme of the first part of Arise, identity and the nature of memory in a society that allows both of those things to be manipulated through technology. Our memories, while not infallible, are undeniably our own, what happens when they can be translated into computer data? Data that can be changed, erased, replaced. It\'s by no means a theme new to the GitS franchise, but I feel it was better explored in Arise than anywhere else.Arise - Border:1 is a slow burning mystery, and also the prequel to section 9\'s formation, although Border:2 focuses more on the latter. Beginning with the investigation for Motoko Kusanagi\'s CO\'s killer. She arrives in Japan to receive a package, apparently from her CO. Shortly after arriving, Kusanagi witnesses Arimaki, the baboon himself, digging up the grave of the man she\'s supposed to investigate. Summarizing the plot is not the point of this but what follows is a truly epic action sequence that has raised the bar for what I view is ""good"" action direction and fight choreography. I\'ll get to this in a bit. The mystery comes not only from Kusanagi trying to unravel a military cover-up but also from battling the cyborg related ailments she incurs on her mission. The phantom pain allows her back story to be explored in a way that feels natural and presents us with one of the problems of the era\'s technology, how does phantom pain affect cyberized people? One of the primary reasons I liked Arise so much was that it chose one core  issue to focus most of it\'s time on, and developed it wonderfully. Stand Alone Complex is loaded with philosophical ideas and a more engaging story, but I have to say I like the focus in Arise. I can\'t say more without spoiling it so...Action:Arise contains the best action scenes in any anime I have seen to date. Even if you\'re among the crowd who thinks Arise is an insult to the GitS franchise, I believe that it\'s worth watching for the action alone. I can count the number of times on one hand that a fight scene left me in a state of awe and Arise tops that short list. The animation of the characters, the physics, it\'s perfect. Later battles with another cyborg showcase what you can do with superhuman strength and a body that doesn\'t feel pain. Cybernetic bodies give amazing creative license for self destructive fighting and the animators capitalized on this brilliantly. Cyberwarfare is integrated seamlessly into the fight sequences so you know what\'s going on even when hand to hand combat and hacking are being used simultaneously.Character Design:The major sports red jump suit and a realistically proportioned body. Granted, she\'s a cyborg, so she can look like, and wear, whatever she wants, but her character design in Arise fits her personality and position very well. SAC Motoko would simply be awkward had she simply been transplanted into Arise. Arimaki looks more realistic as well. He still has the baboon features, but he looks like he could be an actual person. As for Batou and the rest of the crew, they\'re designs are largely unchanged, but certainly lower quality. Batou looks a bit pudgy, Borma\'s a marshmellow, and Togusa looks like he was made on Mii creator.Aesthetic:It\'s toned down compared to most cyberpunk, but I like it. It\'s atmospheric where it needs to be and the Major\'s \'cyberspace\' is reminiscent of SAC while still being consistent with the overall style. The screens everpresent in fictional cyberspace aren\'t terribly cheesy either.Characters:I\'ve gone into this a bit, but there are some characters that deserve to be brought up. Pazo actually receives screen time. He\'s not terribly developed and serves a Deus Ex Machina moment at one point but it\'s nice to see him in action for once. The other members of 501 (Kusanagi\'s unit) are much more obviously augmented. They would stand out like a sore thumb in any public space but seem to trade an innocuous appearance for brute strength. They mainly serve to show the major\'s relationship with her unit, to help us understand why she is so driven to solve her CO\'s murder, and of course, the subjects of excellent fight scenes.Arise seems to bank on it\'s viewers watching SAC beforehand, because none of the characters are given too much depth or characterization apart from Saito in Border 2. It relies on you having an idea of what these characters are like already which is kind of a significant flaw given that I think hardcore GitS fans might actually be less likely to enjoy Arise.Sound Design:Absolute perfection. I wouldn\'t necessarily add any of the tracks to my favorite songs list, but that\'s not the purpose of the score. Every track fits seamlessly into the scene it\'s set too. It\'s never outrageously dramatic and the quirky techno fight tracks, as well as the opening song, are some of the most memorable ones I\'ve heard simply by virtue of how much they add to the atmosphere. I watched this with a friend and several times we both commented to each other just how good the OST is. The sound effects are noticeably good as well,a rare occurrence.I loved Arise because I viewed within it\'s own context. While it\'s impossible for a fan of the GitS franchise NOT to compare it with SAC, I was able to enjoy it as it\'s own work. will inevitably need to draw a few comparisons.

That being said, on the review.Ghost in the Shell Arise is another spinoff of the Ghost in the Shell series franchise that bases its setting around the time that Section 9 officially formed and features the group tackling a series of crimes in each OVA episode that involve hacking of cyberbrains in some form. While maintaining the same themes of earlier Ghost in the Shell anime with corrupt political elements and debating the nature of one's humanity if they heavily convert their body into a machine, the...different continuity leads to some interesting differences in character chemistry and personality. For instance, Motoko's more brash character leads her relationship with members of Section 9 to be different in comparison to earlier takes on the character as she is defiant of Aramaki's authority, will press Batou's buttons with her cyber-hacking skills and can usually find herself biting more than she can chew when dealing with cyberhacking threats due to inexperience in the field. Also, the time frame for the series is before Togusa's daughter was born which the series alludes to as he was still a police detective before joining Section 9 later in the series. Beyond this though, the majority of Section 9 get shafted in regards to any character focus as Arise is more focused on Motoko's perspective on any of the cases that she tackles.In regards to plot, Arise mostly focuses on the gradual formation of Section 9 through the different cyber-hacking crimes that they have to thwart. Each episode dabbles into the typical themes of the GitS franchise as I covered with Motoko and the remainder of Section 9 trying to figure out and resolve the threat from each case. While this exploration helps to attract Ghost in the Shell to more recent anime fans, all the cases that Section 9 tackle are self-contained in each episode and the lack of an ongoing plot like what Stand Alone Complex offered in the 2000s makes Arise lose a good deal of the intrigue and depth that came with Section 9 being challenged in handling cyberhacking crimes and questioning the state of their country's political and military system when uncovering more corrupt elements to both through the investigation of any cases they dabble into.Presentation-wise, Arise offers excellent visual quality as it sports highly detailed settings and character designs, notable examples being heavy mechs and Arise's version of the Tachikomas used as Stand Alone Complex's unofficial mascots. Movement is consistently fluid throughout the OVA's run as action sequences are nicely animated and net-diving scenes are just as much of a visual experience as they were from seeing Stand Alone Complex over a decade earlier. In regards to music, Arise chooses to utilize electronica tracks for many of its scenes and these clash rather poorly with the show's themes and action scenes due to their underwhelming mood.Overall, Ghost in the Shell Arise makes for a decent addition to the franchise as it offers some new takes on Motoko and the members of Section 9 while introducing its themes to new anime fans who got their start in the 2010s. The more episodic format of its storytelling does lead the majority of Section 9 to get shafted in focus and the lack of an ongoing plot may turn off those who enjoyed Stand Alone Complex.

Since the main character can't rely on her own memories and nothing ever hints at that INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CLUE. Because of this warped perception multiple scenes are highly confused. Are they flashbacks to REAL memories? New scenes...that are highly similar? Things are so rushed its impossible to tell.To try and put some kind of bow on this ramble, the whole movie feels rushed. It feels like one of those god awful Michael Bay movies that got written during that big writers strike, when all they had to go off was a bad first draft. that are highly similar?

Koukaku Kidoutai Arise: Ghost in the Shell - Border:4 Ghost Stands Alone,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19195/Koukaku_Kidoutai_Arise__Ghost_in_the_Shell_-_Border_4_Ghost_Stands_Alone,"['In 1995, Masamune Shirow\'s Ghost in the Shell emerged from the pages of his manga and onto the big screen, wowing audiences across the world with tales from his adult oriented, mystical cyberpunk world of police, political intrigue, mysterious technological crime.Fast forward to 2015, and the Ghost in the Shell franchise is one of the most well known and respected names in the medium- along with boasting three TV series, four hour-long films, a feature length special film, three feature films, the newest of which having just aired two months ago.Very few anime or manga series can claim to have had the success...that Ghost has over the past 20 years, and even fewer have maintained the quality of writing or demand for the audience\'s attention as it, either.Enter Ghost in the Shell Arise- the new series of four hour-long films, to be capped off with the ambiguously named ""Ghost in the Shell"" theater released film. This review is for all four films together, as a series.Arise takes place in 2027, some three years before the events of Stand Alone Complex, focusing on the story of how the Major Motoko Kusanagi came to be associated with Section 9 of the Nihama, and met/recruited the members of her team that we all know and love. Each of the first two episodes concentrates on the major\'s past (which has been altered slightly to fit in this new continuum, something old fans of the show might pick up on) and then subsequent involvement in a government wide conspiracy investigation, respectively.The 2nd and 3rd installments are more closely tied- forming a longer mystery of a master hacker causing deep political unrest by means of a virus that creates false memories and enables people to be controlled remotely.Ghost in the Shell Arise borrows a lot of classic Ghost in the Shell moments- mirroring setpieces, scenes, and imagery from the original movie and both SAC series. It also tackles similar types of conflicts- obvious homages to past stories: master hackers infiltrating the government and performing terroristic acts, refugees crises,  and widespread, deep political intrigue and corruption. Massive, untraceable remote hacking, Having multiple ""ghosts"", and melding a consciousness with the net/""is it possible to live without a body?"" all make an appearance here- with some subtle nods to the aforementioned 1995 movie and SAC. Arise tries to take its own identity, but for better or worse, ends up feeling a lot like a retelling of some of the deepest parts of those, in a much shorter and concise way.Having such source material to draw from gives Ghost Arise a bounty of tales to tell, but perhaps this is merely a reimagining of the originals, with new artwork and some new clothes for the Major (which she SORELY needed. That onesie swimsuit with the baggy cargo pants looks like garbage.)Arise was animated by Production IG- the longtime architects of bringing Ghost in the Shell to life. As in my review of Guilty Crown- I must once again give them credit for their body kinetics. The characters move in realistic and lifelike ways, which helps keep the anime feel more grounded and gritty- without delving into too ""high"" of action. There are quite a few dismemberments and broken limbs- and when this happens, they hang, swing, and flex appropriately. One scene in particular made me grimace, where two characters are fighting, and one pulls the other character\'s arm over his shoulder, and pulls down on it with such force (since he\'s a cyborg) that the arm flexes out, hyperextends, and then breaks, elbow out. But it doesn\'t stop there. He keeps going and completely tears the arm off- ripping tendons and ligaments with it. It\'s all shown in very visceral detail- and fairly close to anatomically correct.Other times, people are shot, or have fingers broken, and they remain twisted and limp, and the characters have to deal with these crippling injuries- they aren\'t just magically healed by the next scene.The voice acting in these movies was decent. It\'s obvious that this is a Ghost for a new generation of fans, and along with that comes the departure of most of the former voices, for better or worse. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, (the voice of the Major until this series) does play a supporting character, as Motoko\'s boss. I thought this was a good sendoff for her, who had done such a great job voicing the Major in the past.In a breakout role, Elizabeth Maxwell heads up the cast as the Major. She sounds as an appropriately younger and less experienced Motoko should- authoritative, sarcastic, and driven. Ms. Maxwell is a relative unknown, with only 8 roles to her name currently. I will be interested to see how she does in the future, because she\'s convinced me as the Major.John Swasey (Gendo Ikari, NGE | Gouzaburou Seto, My Bride is a Mermaid) performs excellently as a crotchety, but slightly younger Aramaki. Jad Saxton, tiny voice extraordinaire also perfectly captures the essence of the Logicoma-  predecessor to the annoying but endearing Tachikomas from SAC.One role that I didn\'t think fit very well at all was Chris Sabat as Batou. There\'s really no replacement for Richard Epcar, but it just was not convincing for me, given that Batou is probably my favorite character in the franchise.The other voices of the team, Ishikawa, Borma, Saito, Pazu, and Togusa are all newcomers- and it\'s nice to hear some unfamiliar voices, even if they\'re not what I\'m used to.Overall, these movies are nice additions to the franchise, even if they are weaker than previous editions of the series. I enjoyed the nods to the previous material, and the new material as well- especially the fresh coat of paint, as it\'d been about 7 years since Ghost hit the screen the last time.There\'s still plenty to enjoy if you have the desire for more Ghost. that Ghost has over the past 20 years, and even fewer have maintained the quality of writing or demand for the audience\'s attention as it, either.Enter Ghost in the Shell Arise- the new series of four hour-long films, to be capped off with the ambiguously named ""Ghost in the Shell"" theater released film.

Koukaku Kidoutai: Shin Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27411/Koukaku_Kidoutai__Shin_Movie,"['THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*Sigh*. Yeah this one took a long time to show up, didn\'t it? I actually watched the new Ghost in the Shell film months ago, but I never got the chance to review it until now because something more interesting to review would always be around that week. And then the next. And the next. So yeah, I think my lack of enthusiasm gives the whole game away regarding my feelings on Ghost in the Shell: Let\'s Give It The Same Title As The Fucking First One Like We\'re A Video Game Franchise Reboot.I didn\'t even know there was a new movie...coming out until a friend who pays a lot more attention to upcoming stuff informed me of its existence, and then it took another friend to inform me that it was coming out to American theatres for a limited time. Maybe I missed a news segment somewhere, but it just got lost in the anime announcement shuffle and despite the theatre I watched it in being relatively packed, there\'s not a whole lot of fanfare about it either. It\'s a sequel to the Arise OVAs, which I remember being kind to when I first saw them, but I honestly can\'t remember what happened in the things other than it serving as an origin story for Section 9 and that the Major was a whiny prima-donna in her youth. Or at least as whiny as you can be when you\'re a cyborg with restrained emotions. Thankfully, the film is stand-alone enough so that you don\'t need to see those OVAs, if only because its story is about as non-existent as its reputation.So after forming the gang of cyborgs along with one token human who never hears the end of his role in this film, Motoko Kusanagi is tasked with stopping a terrorist group led by a female cyborg that looks exactly like her. When her team fails to prevent the death of a powerful figure, the team goes through numerous procedural investigations, pseudo-philosophy, and loyalty tests in their search for the truth regarding who this Major copycat is and how they could possibly take down someone who\'s as skilled as the genuine article. It\'s basically The Perfect Insider with guns, and there\'s only so much explosions can do to snap me out of the fact that everything that happens puts me under an eye-shutting trance. Apparently in the past, Section 9 cyborgs had the ability to induce comas with their robotic voices.One of Ghost in the Shell\'s biggest problems is that its presentation is a chore to get through in order to appreciate its big ideas, because the main characters are all stone-cold professionals with no real flaws and very little personal story. That\'s fine when playing a video game like Metroid Prime, especially since nobody actually talks in that series, but in an anime full of dialogue, it feels more like a lecture rather than entertainment. And whilst the new Arise timeline has tried to make the stories more personal, it takes a bit of the Other M approach in regards to characterizing the Major, making her out to be a whiny teenage rebel who somehow has control over a bunch of professionals that complain about the most obvious things (Togusa really won\'t shut up about being the only human in the group). This aspect is not helped by the fact that the version I watched was dubbed by Funimation and all the voices were different from the Stand Alone Complex series, usually not for the better. Mary Elizabeth Glynn even voices a woman who confronts the Major in an early scene, which just made me wish even more that she had been voicing the latter in this film.Unfortunately, Ghost in the Shell\'s problems go far beyond how the characters behave and into the simple fact that the people behind this Arise thing simply don\'t know what to do with them or the universe in general. I\'m not kidding around when I say that there is practically nothing in this film you haven\'t seen before in any other iteration of the franchise ever. Why exactly would I want to see the same thing - even if it\'s good - repeat itself over and over again with each installation? You know why the new James Bond movie sucked balls? Because it didn\'t have a single original thought in its head, hitting every expected beat for the purpose of milking the audience\'s wallets rather than because the creators genuinely believed there was more story they could extract from the franchise. I\'m not even a fan of Bond or Ghost in the Shell as a whole, and even I can see that they\'re going through the same thing Terminator went through after Judgment Day blew our minds.And it doesn\'t even execute its repeated elements very well. Characters bring up problems and then resolve them anticlimactically all over the place, whether they be personal or plot-related, in order to spout more obtuse jargon that never really goes anywhere or contributes to anything. Togusa\'s inferiority complex regarding being flesh and blood ends up getting the ""angst, what angst"" treatment in the final act because he realized himself just how unimportant it was in regards to what was going on and drops it entirely. Just about the only conflict that stays a constant presence is the Major and her team acting against the rules of Section 9 and doing things on their own terms. Okay, it\'s a little weird to see that given how even when she no longer abided by Section 9\'s rules in the less popular movie iterations of the franchise, she still respected them, but that could lead to some unique takes on the GiTS mythos if done well. But what I wanted from that conflict is the same thing I wanted from every other conflict that was brought up in this movie: some fucking payoff!It\'s been a while since I\'ve seen this film so I don\'t quite remember the exact details - and even if I did, Ghost in the Shell is bloody hard to take in in one go anyways - but I do remember that after so much talking up regarding the false Major\'s skills, she gets defeated with a plan that was executed with as much enthusiasm as a routine office job and nobody cares about her after she\'s gone. And then after that, the Major shows up at Section 9\'s office to reaffirm that she doesn\'t play by their rules, even though she needed their cooperation to take down the terrorists in the first place, before re-enacting the opening scene of the first movie so that we can get a cool transition to the end credits. So in other words, aside from a few people we don\'t really care about being dead, nothing consequential happened in this film. Nobody grew up. Nobody learned anything. The audience sure as hell didn\'t learn anything new. And our leads just get to continue doing whatever they want, just like how they started.You know what I say? I say screw this Arise revival, fuck the live-action film, re-release Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig on Blu-ray, and let this franchise jump off a building like the Major, only it doesn\'t survive the fall. Then maybe we can move on to reviving something that actually could benefit from a revival. Like Bubblegum Crisis. Or Kimba the White Lion. coming out until a friend who pays a lot more attention to upcoming stuff informed me of its existence, and then it took another friend to inform me that it was coming out to American theatres for a limited time.

Excellent action from the [then] fledgling Section 9 is...present as they work together like gears in a machine to unravel the truth behind the assassination and suspicious events in Niihama. GiTS 2015 contains great character development between the enigmatic Major Kusanagi and her team in Section 9.For those of you who are not familiar with the series, Ghost in the Shell (GiTS) is prolific Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk manga and anime series spanning many decades.

The characters resemble their forms in Arise more than in previous installments. My personal favorite in terms of art were the futuristic cityscapes as I found the architecture of Niihama as portrayed in GiTS 2015 to be quite creative and thought-provoking.GiTS 2015 also boasted a solid OST, from the beautiful instrumental in the flashback scene in the beginning to the smooth and jazzy ED by Maaya Sakamoto x Cornelius. The well-done voiceovers and OST set the atmosphere for the plot.Overall, GiTS 2015 is an excellent watch for anyone into the Ghost in the Shell series. Although it\'s very much possible to watch this movie without having previous knowledge of the GiTS series, one may find the plot and setting difficult to interpret on-the-go. Nevertheless, GiTS 2015 adds an extra layer of depth to existing lineup of the series, and closes the door to the loose ends in Pyrophoric Cult. Now, the question is: Will a new door open to further development of Ghost in the Shell in the series?Well, for better or worse, the answer is yes, as a live-action movie will be released in 2017, directed by Rupert Sanders.

It’s as convoluted and scientific psycho-babble as that series, and the original GITS series and movies too. I suppose if you were expecting something as revolutionary, or at least a cult hit, like the original GITS movie, you’d be disappointed. It’s more of an engaging sci-fi intrigue ride, rather than a head turner. Animation was fantastic, and the action scenes were high quality, as you’d expect from the franchise. I can certainly see people’s disappointment in this movie, but if you’re a GITS fan overall it’s...worth the watch. If anything, you’ll get some cheeky retro continuity at the end too. To be honest, it makes me want to re-watch the Stand Alone Complex series again! As someone who’s seen every GITS feature, including all movies, multiple series, and the compilation movies (GITS SAC Laughing Man & Individual 11), I’m just happy to get more GITS. worth the watch.

It was then that several things made more sense, and this was perhaps the movie which made the most sense to me (who is not a hardcore fan and all).Ghost in the Shell always excites me with the massive amount of depth comes because of the inherent setting of their world. I must say, that this kind of designing of a storyline is one of a kind and that is something I would remember this franchise for.Especially when it comes to futuristic genres, where the...setting consists of sophisticated robots and lightning fast computers that blow away our minds, it is super important to get things right (I mean the story) because say all you want, in the end it's pure fantasy although I hope I am proven wrong. In that sense, the first movie of GITS was released 20 years ago which is a blasphemously long time, and in that age having such futuristic ideas (which are entertaining to watch even now) is utterly magnificent. It is genius. This is truly a classic franchise worth your time.This movie as opposed to the sequel has more elements of comedy and definitely lesser gore and absolutely no nudity which I find surprising (because, you know). Also, I understood this movie better than the first (maybe it's just me). Another thing I would venture out to say is that there is much more action in this one.Perhaps the only thing that it lacked was the serious atmosphere (with all the gore, nudity and longer political talks) the original movie had made for the viewer which got the franchise its fans.

However, I liked this one the most :)"", ""I'm not exactly sure who this new Ghost in the Shell movie is made for. Despite it being the 25th anniversary movie, it's very clearly part of the same continuity of the Arise franchise and works as a conclusion to it's long running storyline. At the same time, however, it's attempting to be a stand alone film that it's own intriguing mystery.The result is a somewhat muddled, but overall generally entertaining installment in the franchise. While it sadly ditches the more philosophical undertones in the original films and the more political aspects of Stand Alone Complex for a more action driven approach, it still maintains...the spirit of what makes Ghost in the Shell a consistently compelling and engaging universe.Set in the year 2029, about one year after the events of Arise, Motoko Kusanagi (Maaya Sakamoto/Elizabeth Maxwell) leads her team to discover the culprit behind the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister, which leads to a conspiracy deep in the government and connected to her past.I had a hard time writing that synopsis because, for the most part, this film's plot is all over the place. It's extremely hard to follow, but not in the traditional way Ghost in the Shell makes it out to be. While it's filled with technobabble and exposition, the film jumps from scene to scene, sometimes without warning. It's a shame too, cause the story itself is a very interesting idea and fits right into the Ghost in the Shell world, it's not executed very well.This is made up though by the strong character dynamics. If Arise and this film will be remembered, it is for the best character interactions out of the entire series. They really feel like a team here, and each member gets a chance to shine. The banter between the team during both in battle and outside the field is very memorable and I hope later adaptations take note.Surrounding this is the gorgeous animation by Production I.G., which is some of the best work they have ever done. Ghost in the Shell has never looked better then it does here, with the character animations and action sequences popping like they never have before. It's a movie that is a sight to behold, similar to most installments of the franchise.The normal casts in both languages were replaced for the Arise continuity, so it may take some time to get used to. Thankfully, both do an adequate job performance wise, with the Japanese and English actresses for Motoko being the standout. And it's always nice to hear Christopher Sabat in anything.Japanese musician Cornelius returned from Arise to compose the music, and brings a distinct techno infused sound to the film. However, while good, his score is not nearly as exceptional as Kenji Kawaii's or Yoko Kanno's efforts, and feels more like background noise at times.That is probably the best way to describe this movie (and the Arise franchise as a whole) - adequate and unexceptional. It's strong action sequences and memorable characters helps overcome the confusing and poorly plotted story, making this a good, but not great 25th anniversary gift for Ghost in the Shell fans.I give Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie a 7 out of 10. the spirit of what makes Ghost in the Shell a consistently compelling and engaging universe.Set in the year 2029, about one year after the events of Arise, Motoko Kusanagi (Maaya Sakamoto/Elizabeth Maxwell) leads her team to discover the culprit behind the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister, which leads to a conspiracy deep in the government and connected to her past.I had a hard time writing that synopsis because, for the most part, this film's plot is all over the place. It's extremely hard to follow, but not in the traditional way Ghost in the Shell makes it out to be. While it's filled with technobabble and exposition, the film jumps from scene to scene, sometimes without warning. It's a shame too, cause the story itself is a very interesting idea and fits right into the Ghost in the Shell world, it's not executed very well.This is made up though by the strong character dynamics. If Arise and this film will be remembered, it is for the best character interactions out of the entire series. They really feel like a team here, and each member gets a chance to shine. The banter between the team during both in battle and outside the field is very memorable and I hope later adaptations take note.Surrounding this is the gorgeous animation by Production I.G., which is some of the best work they have ever done. Ghost in the Shell has never looked better then it does here, with the character animations and action sequences popping like they never have before. It's a movie that is a sight to behold, similar to most installments of the franchise.The normal casts in both languages were replaced for the Arise continuity, so it may take some time to get used to. Thankfully, both do an adequate job performance wise, with the Japanese and English actresses for Motoko being the standout.

So that being said, there is no need to differ between the 5 entries (and the movie).So, here we have another true Tow Ubukata Screenplay. You can recognize that garbage only 2 minutes in, cause NOTHING makes any sense or is well sceneraized. Just like any other Tow Ubukata Screenplay, we have randomly thrown together scenes, that don't make sense on their own, yet alone any sense withe the original manga. One random occasion after another,...trying to fool you into thinking you just watched the deepest shit ever. But you really didn't. Things just appear and then go away. No content whatsoever. The characters literally beam themselves into the next scenes. It goes without saying that character development is non-existent in an Ubukata Story.Remember the one South Park Episode with the sea cows that just randomly picked balls with words on it out of an aquarium and made a sequence out of it? That is exactly how Tow Ubukata writes.Ok let me try that:Character: MajorLocation: ParkOccasion: BirthdayActivity: ShootingOk cool, so we have Major holding her Birthday Party at a Park while a Shooting going on. That is a perfect Tow Ubukata right there. See I'm capable of that method myself, let me write the next screenplay.

Very much just an action flick, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. Just that, I expect more from the GitS series. Even the ""Arise"" series -- which is probably the weakest of all GitS -- had some of the philosophical and meta things that really makes the series interesting.Storywise, thought it was a little convoluted. Was hard to follow who was fighting who and for what reason. Not even really sure the ending really explained any of that. Though, perhaps, it was left that way for future releases.Some of the English voice acting was...jarring. Not sure why, but Chief Aramaki\'s voice actor has been replaced.

K,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K,"[""You're probably aware of the fact this anime is gettin' pretty low scores and most of the people who review it keep complaining about same stuff. No coherent plot, weak character development, rushed storytelling, blah blah blah.Well, well. That's all cool and stuff, but why don't we show the other side of the coin, too. By the way, I'm a guy, straight and all. K is manly stuff, k. (fakken pun)Story: 9 Simply put, this story is great. It's not the most original story of all times, but it isn't a complete cliche either, as many would like you to believe.See, the thing...about K is that it sells a really TRAGIC, DARK, DEEP and SOUR story of betrayal, friendship, and sacrifice, in a shiny package so that the general audience would be satisfied with 'hot' bishies, tits and cool animation, while some people, like myself, can still enjoy it for what it really is.I won't say anything else about the story's content, since you can clearly see it in the series description.People complain about not knowing what is the sword of Damocles, or where the King's power come from and what not. Those same people give Evangelion a score of 10 even though it's full of randomly chosen cool sounding terms from Bible and what not. Compared to Eva's sea of dead scrolls and Lance of Longinus, K's sword of Damocles is much more relevant to the story and actually serves as a foreshadowing to the show's overly dark culmination.Do note however, that the pacing in the beginning is rather weak, which is completely understandable considering the character cast and time frame in which the story had to be presented. Pacing improves in the next half of the show, leading to ones of the most epic scenes of this season.Art: 10 One word, gorgeous.Sound: 10 Outstanding, fits the mood perfectly, and overly improves the viewer's enjoyment. Not much else to say, except that this series has one of the greatest ED songs in last few years, not counting Fate/Zero's endings, of course.Character: 100000Look, don't trust people who'll tell you that this show has weak character development or that the characters are generic. Considering that K has only 13 episodes, and it's cast is freakin' huge, the characters are pretty much the soul of this show. Their interactions, personalities, lives and motives, ability to make you both laugh and cry, all that makes them pretty much the most memorable characters I've seen in a long time.K's characters are not the fanart you see on Pixiv and Zerochan. They may look gorgeous, perfect, flawless and shallow, but actually, they're just flawed, tragic and ultimately human reflections of us all.Enjoyment: 10  Obviously.Overall: 10Get mad all you want, but K gets a pure 10 from me. This anime is not what it looks like at the first glance. It's not what you think it looks like under it's shiny package either. It's a tragic tale of a group of people who share a bond thicker than blood, a bond that will eventually lead them into becoming more human than humanity itself. about K is that it sells a really TRAGIC, DARK, DEEP and SOUR story of betrayal, friendship, and sacrifice, in a shiny package so that the general audience would be satisfied with 'hot' bishies, tits and cool animation, while some people, like myself, can still enjoy it for what it really is.I won't say anything else about the story's content, since you can clearly see it in the series description.People complain about not knowing what is the sword of Damocles, or where the King's power come from and what not.

One can look at this cake and view it to be extremely succulent and sweet on the exterior, but after tasting it, one may find dissatisfaction from cake's lack of quality. Just like this cake, K attempts to attract viewers with its beautiful visuals and flashy soundtrack like icing, but the poor quality of an inconsistent story that felt rushed can dispel the exterior beauty and leave viewers sick to the stomach.Upon viewing K for the first time, it is hard to disagree that it looks beautiful. K...perfectly portrays the gorgeous aesthetics of an urban city landscape with tall majestic skyscrapers, bustling pedestrians in every street, and an abundance of detail in every nook and cranny. To add to K's beauty, is the addition of a very refreshing and versatile soundtrack that perfectly captures the emotions of each scene. The music in K includes a large range; from soft melodic piano pieces, to intense electronic beats and mellow hip-hop. The music is implemented in a very sophisticated manner and never feels out of place or repetitive. This wonderful combination of visual and audio appeal reinforces the sense of beauty of K.Although K looks beautiful, one must be cautious of its beauty. The beautiful appeal of K is only icing on the cake and the actual quality of the cake itself may be a different story. K's biggest drawback would be the attempts to implement a wide cast of characters. Since K revolves around the theme of gang rivalry and leadership, the multiple characters from the different clans carry a large focus within the story and although this can be very exciting, the attempts have gone to waste due to the short time given in the space of thirteen episodes and lack of definition. The many characters are given many scenes such as flash backs or fan-service that attempt to reinforce their personalities and shine them in a likable manner. This is possibly the strongest element about K, but this turns out messy as many characters that are given lots of screen time hold no significance in the story whatsoever, leaving the story to be rushed and full of holes to fit the span of thirteen episodes. K gives side characters a chance to shine, but these efforts leave viewers wondering why these pointless characters are given so much screen time when the time itself could have been used to improve the story.As stated before, K is extremely comparable to a cake. Too much time and effort was spent on trying to sweeten the cake, but the limited amount of time has left it undercooked. One may think that this cake is a failure, but in absolute truth, it is not. An undercooked cake is not ruined and can still be enjoyed, this is very similar to the essence of K as it all comes down to one's sweet tooth. Although the story of K felt rushed and messy, the character interactions and personalities truly sweetened this anime and the excessive amount of icing on this cake can also add to the appeal. If you're interested in an anime that not only looks and sounds beautiful, but goes in-depth of exploring different character relationships and personalities, this anime is for you. However, if you're looking for an anime with a consistent and well written storyline, you should look elsewhere. perfectly portrays the gorgeous aesthetics of an urban city landscape with tall majestic skyscrapers, bustling pedestrians in every street, and an abundance of detail in every nook and cranny.

(pun intended)Story: 9At its core, K is a story about finding the identity of a murderer and its implications in an ongoing war between superpowered clans.  Elements of sci-fi, fantasy and mystery are combined to make for a very appealing package.  In my opinion, the first few episodes don't really explain much, but they leave enough questions unanswered to make you keep coming back for more.  I suppose it may be to give the viewer the same feeling that the protagonist Yashiro would get from having his daily life changed so suddenly.  However, the story really...picks up in the latter half and overall was simply very exciting to watch.Art/Animation: 10The animation for K is absolutely amazing.  GoHands really impressed this time.  The backgrounds are highly detailed and the setting allows for some beautiful shots of the city and the island.  Reflections and lighting are done expertly, even if at times it looked a little too bright.  I also really like the character designs in K - everyone looks great and the SCEPTER4 uniforms are a notable highlight.  Additionally, the OP and ED sequences are highly stylised and great to watch, meshing well with the songs chosen.Sound: 9K has fantastic music - among the best I've heard for a while.  There are many great tracks and they are used well to enhance the feelings of the scenes.  Some of my personal favourites are the main theme, which was also used in one of the PVs; and the ED song, performed by Neko's seiyuu.  I think having the character songs play in the background for the next episode previews was a particularly nice touch.  The voice acting was top notch, with plenty of big names such as Sugita Tomokazu and Ono Daisuke, to mention a few.  Across the board, they really succeeded in bringing out the characters' personalities and emotions.Characters: 9The characters in K are one of the main driving forces of the series.  Much of the plot revolves around Yashiro, who at first appears to be just another happy-go-lucky high school student thrown into the midst of a gang war he knows nothing about.  Kuroh is more tough and composed, and his seriousness is a nice contrast to Yashiro's carefree personality.  K also presents us with an interesting dynamic between the Blue and Red Kings - they fight on opposing sides, but seem to be more than just simply enemies.  The only possible flaw I found was that Neko's character didn't really get enough elaboration; it almost seemed like she was just included because her powers were needed for the story.  The focus moves between the various sides so we get to see events unfold from several perspectives.  The characters do develop well throughout the show, with some interesting revelations, though due to the 13-episode length, some may find that not everyone got fully fleshed out.  However, the manga prequels make up for this.Enjoyment: 9K was a very enjoyable series.  There weren't as many fight scenes as I would have liked, but every time I did see some action it just looked incredibly cool.  Whilst the premise may not be entirely unique, K had more than enough flair, intriguing story and compelling characters to keep me hooked until the very end.Overall: 9For me, K was an amazing series that just got better and better with every episode I watched.  If you like supernatural action with an interesting identity mystery attached - you should definitely watch K.Thanks for reading!

Fantastic fluidity to motions. Very active scenes and active bodies. The color usage is bold and nothing to overlook, however, I did start to find the experimental color gradient to be a little bit of an eyesore at times. Yet, at other times it was definitely effective in setting the mood. The characters were cleanly drawn with slim, delicate figures. Smaller details such as clothing design and the cityscape are fun.Character: 6The show is similar to Durarara! in that it incorporates...a medley of characters in a crowded city with some magical powers sprinkled in. When I saw the plethora of characters, I didn't expect to get a character driven story. And it wasn't. Unlike Durarara!, which was given 24 eps to tell its story, K-Project only got 13. The characters weren't given enough time to truly shine individually, but that is not to say that they weren't able to shine in conjunction with other characters. The relationships between Shiro and Kuroh, Mikoto and Reisi, and Misaki and Fushimi were good enough to add a little complexity to the characters and story. But the number of characters did leave me a bit overwhelmed.Sound: 7I am not a fan of the soundtrack, OP, or ED. But I can't say the music was bad. It was average for an anime like this.Story: 4Now we get to the part that explains why this anime failed. The story, in short, is too messy and poorly developed. Even though it's supposed to be a mystery about Shiro trying to understand his identity and amnesia, I found myself more drawn to the gang war between the red and blue teams. Yet, that part of the story was never fully developed enough and left me in the dark as to why they were fighting so much. Part of the mythology of the anime revolves around the colors and the powers that come with them. I would have liked to get a crash course on the history and involvement of these powers in their reality. When the mystery is revealed, the resolution is unsatisfying. You couldn't get a strong feel as to why the main antagonist is the way he is, because they spent so little time developing him. There are many subplots, which would have been okay, except that this is a 13 episode anime. Most of the subplots were let to ease to an end instead of approached and dealt with properly. This left me feeling a bit bereft and questioning the whole point of building this whole maze of story.Enjoyment: 5I got bored with it halfway through but kept going because it's not bad enough for me to drop. It took me a while to complete it because I got involved with other animes. Despite the incredible visuals, the poorly written story and flat characters failed to enthuse me. The cluttered storyline and mythology kept me confused most of the time as I was trying to play keep up with all the little subplots and characters.Overall: 6It's not a bad anime, but it is an example of an anime trying to take on too much at the same time and failing miserably. I would say that maybe if it was given 24 or more episodes, it might have been able to rescue itself.

There are many flaws and factors that drags K down from being a well done anime to a below average one.Let us start with a close look at the story. Our hero, Isana Yashiro, goes on an errand one day and is suddenly attacked by a group of men on the streets. It is later revealed that he is blamed for a murder that he does not remember committing. An interesting plot with a decent bit of potential behind it.Everything is fine until we realize the plot comes to...a complete standstill. After many questions and events are raised, we come to the mid-way point of K. That is when it becomes apparent that the anime is not going anywhere. As this dreadful standstill is happening, more and more questions arise every episode. Plot twists are added as an attempt to make everything more bearable, but it just adds to the confusion. To remedy this situation, the creators tried to cram all of the answers in to the last few episodes. The result was a rushed ending with plot holes left floating around everywhere.To summarize the story, i\'d have to say it was a complete mess that was painful to watch. The creators wanted to make the anime more interesting and unique by continuously adding elements to their plot, but they ended up dropping the ball big time.Characters are supposed to have vibrant characteristics and at least seem somewhat realistic. That is because to get the most enjoyment out of a story, we must be able to connect and feel with the characters. I was not able to do that with anyone in K.As an attempt to make the characters seem as cool as possible, they were all given silent and complex personalities. We get no insight into what the characters are actually thinking, and the minimal dialog is of little help as well. They are so unnatural and impossible to figure out. Most of them are like emotionless statues that just talk occasionally for the sake of being alive. There is also a severe lack of character growth and development that destroys any chances left of connecting with the characters.The creators tried too hard and ultimately made the characters too complex and just plain uninteresting to watch.Although the storytelling in K was horrid, the visuals and music were of the highest grade. The BGMs had a nice ring to them, and the surreal backgrounds had my eyes glued to the screen for every second of every episode. Character animations and fight scenes were extremely detailed to the point where i have nothing but praise for them.Since it would be annoying to listen to me ramble on about the art, i will just leave it at that. All you need to know is that i thought it was very good.While my eyes and ears were indeed very entertained with K, my brain was moaning from boredom and distress for a significant portion of the time. My enjoyment was greatly derailed by the plot and characters. Good art and music was the only thing that kept me going.In the end, i have no choice really but to condemn this anime. It was simply uninteresting and poorly done. Perhaps they focused too much on how it looked and totally forgot to write a story until the last minute. Either way, i would only recommend watching this if you are very curious about it. a complete standstill. After many questions and events are raised, we come to the mid-way point of K.

The BGMs had a nice ring to them, and the surreal backgrounds had my eyes glued to the screen for every second of every episode. Character animations and fight scenes were extremely detailed to the point where i have nothing but praise for them.Since it would be annoying to listen to me ramble on about the art, i will just leave it at that. All you need to know is that i thought it was very good.While my eyes and ears were indeed very entertained with K, my brain was moaning from boredom and distress for a significant portion of the time. My enjoyment was greatly derailed by the plot and characters. Good art and music was the only thing that kept me going.In the end, i have no choice really but to condemn this anime. It was simply uninteresting and poorly done. Perhaps they focused too much on how it looked and totally forgot to write a story until the last minute. Either way, i would only recommend watching this if you are very curious about it.', 'K is a weird action anime with relatively high production values. It follows the story of a young boy named Shiro who murdered some random guy who was pretty much a big deal except Shiro didn\'t kill him because he has an alibi, but everyone thinks he killed him until they get to know his alibi but then Shiro remembers he did kill him or something but he didn\'t because he has an alibi. The story still makes sense very much, at least if we compare the story to the characters action\'s which frankly reminds headless chickens.The characters of this series run all over...the place slapping other\'s shit because they simply can. Which is obviously just cool because the characters are such awesome, awe-inspiring badasses who don\'t need any logic whatsoever during their shit. While that would be somewhat true and something to appreciate in some series, K does it completely.. awkwardly. You see K\'s main element is not action like everyone falsely assumed - it\'s on the genres so duh - but it\'s main elements are actually bishonen, neko, fanservice aand.. wait for it... shonen ai. You can check this from ANN if my way of putting it doesn\'t seem trustworthy. These themes do not make it by any means awesome, but what it manages to create is an overwhelming amount of gayness. I\'m not a homophobic, but I have no reason to appreciate a series which is relying on a fujoshi fanbase and other people with the weirdest fetishes. Pretty sure Japan appreciates this, though.K is also ripping off Durarara, even the character design of Izumo Kusanagi is a direct copy of Shizuo. What they also seem to be following closely is the awful pacing. Nothing happens beyond fanservice and some random slapping. If something else actually happens then that something is simply said nothing. Let me give an example of what this ""nothing"" is and how the characters make sense. Some ""bad guy"" appears to Shiro\'s house, tries to kill him but ends up chasing Shiro around the town. Then suddenly magically we are back to Shiro\'s house and all of the characters lie on the floor because they are exhausted. Then this so called bad guy does what? Well makes them some dinner and they eat of course. Approved? lolno. During all of this there is some cat-neko-girl-thing being there with Shiro without any real reason, lying there naked most of the time, making weird noises and expression which someone would call cute or sexy. As tasty as it might sound it is actually just.. meh.After mocking K this much you might be thinking why I\'m still bothering to watch this series. I didn\'t found any of this too annoying since I stopped taking the series seriously in the beginning, but what I really liked was the animation, which is rather cool and original. On a first impression it seemed like a fresh air and something you don\'t see every day in anime, making the series worth of watching from my part even though I already found it bad. Bad but entertaining. But then K failed completely from that part as well. On episode 5 great fight scenes happened and oh boy, the word lameness got a new meaning. Describing that scene with mere words and trying to convey the dull it has to offer is without a doubt more time consuming than the execution of that scene was. So instead of going in depth with this I\'m just going to say this; if you, my dear reader, consider two-colored light to be the most fuckawesome thing ever, then this shit just might fly for you.What do we got? K failed with characters, story and animation. The fanservice is meh and on top of that it\'s aimed for fujoshi. This series is simply hard one to enjoy, certainly doesn\'t seem like it is even trying. On a bottom line - K isn\'t \'k. the place slapping other\'s shit because they simply can. Which is obviously just cool because the characters are such awesome, awe-inspiring badasses who don\'t need any logic whatsoever during their shit.

K failed with characters, story and animation. The fanservice is meh and on top of that it\'s aimed for fujoshi. This series is simply hard one to enjoy, certainly doesn\'t seem like it is even trying. On a bottom line - K isn\'t \'k.', 'I love K! I love it for the fact that the series seems almost like watching rainbows without an actual way of expressing itself at first, especially regarding its artwork. It\'s almost like the directors are indirectly saying, “let\'s throw some cool animation and shit and get the audience to watch this!"" Sure, there is a plot but it\'s just way too slow. I\'m not exaggerating here but K is a series that just doesn\'t work out right at all. For those of you reading this, you might agree and some of you might not. Anyways, let\'s begin shall we?Let\'s start by asking ourselves...what is...“K”?Well, K is an original series that began airing in the Fall of 2012. It\'s animated by the studio GoHands and directed by Shingo Suzuki. He is also responsible for some of the character designs for the series. The series apparently also has manga adaptations with a prequel known as K: Memory of Red. Well, anyways, the series is quite mysterious...For instance, what the hell does “K” actually stand for?Some of the titles of the episodes suggest things such as “Knight”, “Kitten”, “Kill”, “Key”, Karma”, etc. I often wonder why it\'s like this. Sure the titles might give off some hints. Example: episode 2 titled Kitten is dedicated to Neko-chan who is..a cat or kitten. However, most of them are rather vague and leaves it to the viewers\' imaginations.Story: 3Seriously, what the hell. Are the directors serious here? No, that\'s not even a serious question because the story of K is a joke, one that\'s not entertaining at all. We begin the first episode with Shiro apparently framed for murder. From there on and out, the series becomes a sort of cat-and-mouse scenario where he gets hunted down. But then, there are the side episodes and occasionally flash backs involving other characters. I have to say that this does NOT work out right. It\'s like trying to cook a dish without the proper ingredients.Think of it this way. You want to make a pizza. You have the dough, the ingredients, the oven, etc. Then, when the time comes to make it, the pizza turns into shit because it\'s mixed in the wrong way. K is no different to be honest.Oh but that\'s not all. K also tries too damn hard. It resorts to using some plot twists and thriller like sequences but it doesn\'t work. Why? The series\' scriptwriting is just awful. The plot is revealed but what is the main purpose of it? I almost feel like nothing when I\'m watching this series. It\'s slow with a capital S. S for shit in the storyline department.Characters: 4Almost, all the characters in my opinion lacks something or has qualities that are cliched, generic, and not done right. Let\'s take a look at our three main protagonists starting with the kid who has been on the run from the very beginning:*Yashiro ""Shiro"" Isana – he is the happy and outgoing guy of the series. He often makes jokes but at the same time is quite respectable to his peers and classmates. There is a big secret about this character but we don\'t find that out till nearly the very end.*Kuroh ""Black Dog, Kuro"" Yatogami – this guy even has a side story dedicated to him. Talk about being on the spotlight! But anyways, Kuroh is pretty much the opposite of Shiro. A few words that can describe him are “quiet, mysterious, haughty, caring, loyal, and courageous”. Yet at the same time, he lacks a personality. Seriously, he doesn\'t have much of a personality at all except when he interacts with the two main protagonists.*Neko – Oh who am I kidding here, this is probably one of the reason why more than 80% of the demographic are watching the series. Neko is a very energetic young girl with a curious personality like a cat. Curiosity killed the cat? Neko actually brings that expression to reality in a few times when she acts before she thinks. She\'s got a million dollar body but a 2-cent brain. She doesn\'t like to wear clothes and often times or not, clings onto her beloved “Shiro” as she likes to call him.The rest of the characters seems to play roles only in action rather than in the actual story, the one that moves ridiculously slow. The Red King and Blue King clashes in the latter half of the series but once again, it\'s cliched with the usual egoistic talk and dragged monotone speeches. The righteousness from the Blue King also seems ironic since he wishes to protect the students yet his group is responsible for the danger of their lives in the first place.Artwork: 8Alright, I admit it. The artwork of the series is amazing. It\'s like you\'re in a dream where everything is colorful and presented in a way that is at cinema level. The blue aura backgrounds and the characters\' outfit designs makes them look like bosses and gives off that cool feeling which is one of the positives of the series. It is no doubt that the artwork and visuals represents the highlight of the series. Pretty cool designs I\'d say even though some of the clothing doesn\'t look too original. Yes, I\'m looking at you, Full Metal Alchemist and Tegami Bachi.Soundtrack/Music: 7Although not up to the art standards, the soundtrack of the series is well presented. Some of the OST are pleasant to listen to whether it\'s a dramatic, action, or emotional scene. The opening song , ""King”, by angela is also well performed where it depicts a montage of the main as well as the supporting characters.The ending song though is just a slap in the face. We see..well, mostly Neko wearing almost nothing as she doesn\'t like to wear clothes making suggestive poses. It\'s just pure fan-service and nothing more. Once again, it tries to use its visuals to do the talking rather than expressing.Overall, this series deserves a “5”. The story is so damn slow and the characters give generic a whole new meaning. Luckily, the soundtrack and artwork makes up for this. Yet, at many stances, I feel that K isn\'t doing a right job of progressing its episodes. Although the plot eventually reveals itself, it shouldn\'t make an excuse to make the audience wait. Now, I\'m not saying this series is the worst garbage ever created. If you enjoyed the series, then do what makes you happy. However, K did not live up to its expectations. At first, I thought I was watching some good bullshit from K but that doesn\'t seem to be the case now. K is just bullshit and I can\'t recommend this to anyone. “K”?Well, K is an original series that began airing in the Fall of 2012. It\'s animated by the studio GoHands and directed by Shingo Suzuki.

The story line feels like the creators decided to pull all their favorite aspects out of all the anime they\'ve ever liked and put it into one. There is a weak reference to ""deep"" connections between these 7 gangs in the anime, but this story is following the main character, Shiro and his cat that turns into a sexy girl randomly. The blue gang is a vigilante police group and one of the members, Kuro, believes that Shiro committed a murder...based on this shady cell phone video of Shiro or someone who appears to look like him, committing the crime, and Kuro decides to follow Shiro around at school and become a ""transfer student"" and cook for Shiro and his cat like he has no real duties. The story line is absolutely horrid and there is nothing great about it.Art: 10/10The anime contains the most beautiful art I\'ve seen in a lot of anime, but that is the only thing going for it. I am continuing this anime based on the art alone.Update: 1/10As the series went on, the art began to decrease in quality. The group probably spent all of their budget on the first episode and everything else went to horribleness.Sound: 6/10It sounds fine.Character: 1/10Just like the story line, the characters are pathetic. They are not unique in any way and there is no character depth at all. I feel no emotions or sympathy for any of them. The main character, Shiro, seems to be this aloof high school kid who appears to have some dark side or schizophrenic tendency, but also doesn\'t seem to have much care. The cat/girl turns into a human randomly, she has two different colored eyes, and does ""cute"" things. (I think she is a rip of Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, but not as enjoyable). The red gang seems to be a collection of ""tough, cool guys"" plus some strange gothic lolita girl. There hasn\'t been much on the red gang yet for me to make inferences on them. The vigilante police blue gang includes Kuro, the guy who carries around swords and follows around the main character while the main character tries to prove his innocence. He\'s boring and one dimensional and seems to be a rip of Jin from Samurai Champloo, and he carries around a weird briefcase filled with cooking utensils. There is a woman in the blue gang, who is dressed in this outfit where her butt hangs out but apparently works in this professional setting. She seems like a rip of Hawkeye from Full Metal Alchemist.Enjoyment: 5/10I enjoy it because its fun to make fun of.Update: 3/10Overall: 3/10This isn\'t an anime that will ever make a mark. It in general, just sucks.Update: 1/10If you enjoy watching characters stare at each other for long periods of time, fight scenes eliminated, important parts of the story not even animated (the blimp crash scene), and characters having ""deep"" connections and conversations with each other which are never explained, this is the anime for you. based on this shady cell phone video of Shiro or someone who appears to look like him, committing the crime, and Kuro decides to follow Shiro around at school and become a ""transfer student"" and cook for Shiro and his cat like he has no real duties.

You can polish a turd, make it really pretty, flashy, and cool...but it still doesn't defeat the fact that it's still a turd.K Project might be the biggest letdown of an anime I've seen all year. It has some of the best OSTs I've heard in a series this year. The animation is gorgeous and the art direction in the first episode had a setup for a series that was going to be epic. So what the hell happened? To put it bluntly, how did such a captivating series become such an epic pile of crap?Simply put, the story...was all over the place and it all begins with the setup. The plot resolves Isana Yashiro who is falsely accused of killing a clansman of the Red King. He is hunted down by Yatogami Kuroh, the servant of the former Colorless King, HOMRA, the clansman of the Red King and SCEPTER4, the clansman of the Blue King. Isana is befriended by Yatogami in the process as well as a strange girl/cat named Neko, who we find out is a Strain. Together, they try and solve the mystery behind Yashiro's mistaken identity for a killer who claims to be the Colorless King, as well as find out his connection to the Silver King. Everybody got that? Good...because I sure as hell didn't. For one, who or what are the Kings? The series briefly describes them as seven people with special powers. When they release their power, an object appears in the sky called the Sword of Damocles. So what the hell is the Sword of Damocles? Gooooood question...because the series doesn't explain that either.There's a clash between the Red and Blue clans during the early stages of this series because Munakata Reishi, the Blue King feels that another disaster will befall them because Mikoto Suoh's (The Red King) Sword of Damocles is in rough shape due to overusing his power. We get very little explanation or back story about the dangers of a king maintaining their Sword of Damocles so it is just another minor plot point that falls to the wayside due to poor development.I found the ONLY thing this story did well in both explanation and in storytelling was the reveal of Adolph K. Weismann, the Silver King. Weismann was just about the only character that got any sort of development, albeit still not enough in the grand scheme of things. We learn that the Silver King is also known as the Immortal King...yet, we don't get an explanation as to WHY he's immortal. Or at the very least, the series doesn't do a very good job of explaining that detail. We also find out that there are 7 Kings in total, but it's unexplained who these Kings are, where they came from, and why they have these powers as well as why they can pass their powers down to clansman.That leads me to my next point, this story just didn't develop it's characters...any of them. Apparently according to the plot, we should be invested in the battle between the Reds and the Blues. The conflict between Suoh and Munakata. Okay, can you at least tell us WHY? There are times when I wonder, is this story about Yashiro, or is it about Suoh? Or how about Yatogami Kuroh? We learn that he was a servant for the former Colorless King, Ichigen Miwa. And? That's it...for being the what would become best friend of the lead character for this series, we learn next to nothing about him...and don't get me started on this mess that is Yashiro's character. The explanation and back story behind his character is so fragmented and confusing that even when the series is completely said and done, I still don't know ANYTHING about his character.Ultimately, it felt like the producers tried to tackle way too many issues in a 13 episode series. What it resulted in was a lot unresolved plot points and loosely knitted character development that fell apart at the seams because there were far too many characters to even try and develop. GoHands should've realized (and I use this analogy a lot) that sometimes, less is more. Give us a narrowed down, detailed look at each set of characters or clans. Give us a better explanation/back story to who or what the Kings are. This series MIGHT have worked in a 26 episode set...and I say that loosely. They still might not have been able to tie up all the loose ends in 26 episodes.

Don’t just judge by the score I give the anime! If you hate my review, please explain why.The autumn season of 2012 was an entertaining one. The season brought new light and a breath of fresh air to the anime industry. Of all the anime there is to talk about, K is one of the most talks about anime to date.  It might be though to the fact that the PVs carry ton of promise for the project bringing in huge...amounts of hype and a start of a new fandom.  Sadly, K collapse under its own weight with ton of criticism toward its poor story and plot progression.  Creating a huge divide among the anime community with one side being the haters while the other side the fans. I’m categorized under the fans but K indeed has flaws that should be taking account.All in all K is a project underworked.  For GoRa’s 1st anime project, I found it be a massive success.  And I will explain why:Story:  (+/-) [1 MAL POINT]The story at the beginning: Tatura is murder in an incident putting Yashiro, the main protagonist, into a chaotic battle between the Kings and clans regarding who killed Tatura.The story is indeed the biggest problem of K by far.  It is important to note that K’s story is not action oriented given by the few scenes of action nor is it a mystery because you’re not meant to solve it.  K’s story is a mix of different elements but these elements is what makes its story collapse.If you ever seen an anime produce by Nakanishi Go, you might be able to pin out the problems the plot has. K suffers from poor plot progression.  The anime wants to explore all the different elements but sadly with only 13 episodes it isn’t possible. The 1st 3 episodes focus on explaining the world of K. Episodes 4-9 focus on the bonds and tensions between characters. Last 4 focus on brining all characters together for the big finale.Asking little questions is the key to enjoying K or then your negatives will ruin your positives. If questions do arise, then don’t be afraid to ask the community has ton of excellent theories is quite accurate.Yet, the plot manages to be quite interesting at times.  The story is filled with interesting moments and twists that you sometimes wonder if the story is the main focus. And it isn’t! The main focus is in the characters.Characters: (+/-) [1 MAL POINT]There is lot of things to say about K and its huge cast of characters. I don’t hate any of the characters.  They all perform their roles masterfully with their voice actors truly capturing the personality of the characters. So why did I give it only 1 MAL point?  Not all of the characters are given the proper screen time they deserve.The main trio [Yashiro, Neko, & Kuroh] represent the power to have close bonds with each other. Mikoto and Reishi are the Kings with huge hearts toward their clan who journey a solitary road.  And there is Yata and Fushimi two close friends/rivals that can never be separated by faith [no yaoi here]. K is all about bonds but what about the other characters?There are more obvious bonds within K but the screen time is given more to these parings more than anything else.  I personally wanted to see more of Ana as she manages to be the most questionable character regarding what she means to Mikoto.What ever happen to Izumo? Given a role of a typical leader!The classmates were interesting and wish they had more time on screen.Rikio!!!! He means something to Yata but what? The poor old Gold King….. not even given the proper time to be on screen for being the Gold King.Hopefully these problems will be fixed for the next season because these bonds were unique to K making the characters memorable in their own right.Art:  (+) [2 MAL POINTS]The biggest positive of K is its Art, and that is something we all can agree with. Animation quality of K can just not be described with words. It’s just plain beautiful to look at.  GoHands really knows how to bring quality to the next level.Following a similar art style that can be found in the Mardock Scramble series, K uses a smart blend of gradients to bring out the colors of the characters and the setting. It even helps create a realistic shine on objects that shine depending on the lighting. Ton of detail is pack in every frame with the brief scenes of CG being forgiven as this is animation at its best. With only one major screw up being with the Bell Tower Explosion scene [rather not explain as it was horrific to watch]. Action scenes are well drawn out fill with the flashing colors of the physic powers even though they are quite short.K broke new ground in the anime industry showing how TV animation can reach the quality of the movies. Setting the bar high to what future TV animation can look like.Sound: (+) [2 MAL Points]Soundtrack of K….. memorable!!!! For Endo Mikio’s 1st time in the anime industry, he manages to capture the urban feel of the city and emotions of the characters. You know a soundtrack is going to be excellent when the 1st track, title “Suoh Mikoto”, comes blazing in with the beat and intensity of the pain to describe Mikoto’s character. This helps creates stage for K when the opening credits were done rolling as we enter the world that is K. And there are more tracks I wish I could describe but in the end their no real way to describe the emotions and feelings you get from each track.For the OP and ED songs, they do their job well but aren’t as memorable as the soundtrack. Then again my taste of music is quite different when it comes to OP and ED so sadly I can't go in depth.Enjoyment: (+) [2 MAL POINTS]K is an anime that isn’t meant to be taken seriously. The fun of K comes from the bonds of characters within the beautiful world that is the anime. I personally had a blast with the anime. Even though it has flaws, K manages to not be an utter failure of this season. In fact my memories of K will stay in tack as K’s charms can appeal to anyone.Either it is for the animation, soundtrack, characters, or the story, K has something for everyone. For the 1st project of GoRa, it is a massive success that can be use to make the project better than it was before. I’m looking forward to what GoRa can bring to the table in the anime industry with its future K relating projects.  If you’re someone like me who is going to watch the 2nd season, I recommend reading the manga prequels and watching K in a new positive light.Now I will but my review to a close to the most memorable anime of the year for me.

I mean, some of these people are trying to be deep about it and writing like a critic, but a lot of it is just a guise for their own taste in Anime. If they state something that they don\'t like, well that\' just cause they don\'t like it.ANYWAYS, I just finished up episode 8 of this series, went straight from 1-8 although I probably shouldn\'t have. So i\'m pretty hooked.Trying to go no spoiler here:The story is alright it has plenty of generic points but, if you abstract things...you know, everything has generic points, doesn\'t mean they are the same thing. It seems out main antagonist has lost his memory about a important event and he\'s trying to find out what happened. People have special powers and the origin of which has already been revealed.The art is fantastic, absolutely fantastic. Crisp at many times often with sort of way-ward colory splashy overlays which I find very appealing to my senses.Sound nothing to complain about.The characters are super generic (again in abstract terms). We got the happy-go-lucky protagonist, his clueless female friend, aloof ally, etc. What really keeps me going is that so far I haven\'t really seen an antagonist per se... (avoiding spoilers here!)It\'s pretty conflicting to note who is and who is not the antagonist especially if you read the manga back story; so as far as characters go I think that\'s a pretty neat thing.Enjoyment 8, it\'s appealing to me.My overall is my enjoyment, so again 8. you know, everything has generic points, doesn\'t mean they are the same thing.

However i can see why many people didn't like this anime.Plot: Im not going to bore you all with giving a summary of the plot, as im assuming you have at least some knowledge of the show if you are reading this review. 'K' had so much potential, however like many recent shows airing, the plot was neglected due to the high demand of having pretty visuals and...catchy songs that will attract in viewers. The story line wasn't bad at all, it was simply lacking more attention from the creators. I felt as though the entire plot was rushed, resulting in many questions that were left un-answered.Art & Sound: There's really not much to say about these two components of the show. Both were fantastically done.Character: The character development was fairly bland and poorly done. I noticed that alot of the main characters didn't have any development or references about their past. I don't know what i was expecting, but it wasn't what i got.Overall, it was an okay show. Give it a try and if you don't like it in the first few episodes, give it up. Because it doesn't get better as the show goes on. It's one of those shows that you will hate, love, or you will be neutral with it because lets be honest. You all have nothing else to waste your time with.

(that's why you are reading this review)."", ""Sometimes I wonder if people want to be original from the get go or just take  concepts from different shows, throw them all in a pot and hope something good comes out.  Project K is a classic example of people who have to much to do and not enough resources to do it with.STORY 4/10From the first episode we have been given the basic outline of each character, their goals and where each of them stand in terms of ranking. It doesn't help the viewer that episode one starts in the middle of the plot, tracks back and then pushes forward.It...sets up a very clever way of telling the story by throwing all these problems and situations at the viewer in hopes it will make it all clear by episode 13. Depending on how far you read into the plot and the characters motives you may get a completely different answer.ART 9/10The art of this show is what (in my case) makes it memorable. It sets a brilliant landscape for the show from the city to the wastelands, the technology such as the robots have all been detailed to the millimeter. You can probably watch this show and adore it based on the art alone.SOUND 7/10I was sort of conflicted with the OST, while the music was very good it felt like the tracks were played in the wrong moments. The opening theme didn't fit the style of the opening and the main piano piece was very overplayed, it almost felt like one long music video for that one song.CHARACTERS 4/10As I've read in some other Project K reviews people say that the characters were too 'under developed' for me this wasn't quite true. From episode one it was like the characters were just to distant from the plot, not giving much of a story away. I'm not sure if this is a result of the makers wanting them to seem more mysterious or setting up something for season 2 but I couldn't feel sad or pained for a character I barely knew.ENJOYMENT 7/10This isn't a bad anime. I enjoyed it, the art was amazing, the soundtrack was good, characters were likable. I give credit to the producers who were able to squeeze all these different plot points in to just 13 episodes.OVERALL 6/10I think Project K had to much to live up to before it even aired, with the story telling style of Baccano! and overall plot feel of No.6 this anime is enjoyable and that's all you really need. Not much to think about or keep up with (Unless you're one of those 'deeper meaning' people).If you can stand the amount of fan service it gives girls to ship him with him then I recommend this show as just a bit of eye candy for people who like quality art with simple-to-follow plot. sets up a very clever way of telling the story by throwing all these problems and situations at the viewer in hopes it will make it all clear by episode 13.

The story is intriguing and first but becomes a letdown later on. However you cannot say it is a failure just because you don't understand the overall complex of the series. For those of you who enjoy action scenes or characters that act cool and/or clumsy.. then you should watch K.For those of you who don't know how to appreciate a good anime please don't write crappy reviews when you look only at a tree and not the entire forest "", ""Do you know one of those anime that despite not having anything outstanding to it, still end up making you watch it until the middle of the night and go tell all your friends about how great it is the next day? Yeah, K is one of thoseStory: 8/10K story is set in a busy, futuristic city that underneath its grandeur lies supernatural forces and dangerous gangs. Much like Durarara!!, the show has multiple story lines that end up intersecting each other in the end. Now, if this is the first time something like this was done, I would really had enjoyed it much more....But if you are a big fan of Durarara!! like I am, you would be very distracted by how many similarities these two shows have. However, that did not stop me from liking the story of K. From the intense tale of the chase for a murder case suspect to the story of the psychic power wielding gangs, K has a pretty interesting plot. Just like Durarara!! though, there are some points that you might have to read between the lines a little, but for me, that is a lot better than having the plot spoon fed to me by the show.Art: 9/10Art is perhaps K's strongest point. When I was a kid, I always imagined I had awesome psychic powers and I would look like a total badass if it weren't for this thing called reality. But when watching K, I feel like my imaginative world  came to life. Intense battle scenes, awesome psychic fields, cool character designs, etc. you name it, K has them all.Sound: 8/10If you like Nujabes even a tiny little bit, I think you would like K soundtrack a lot. Filled with suave urban style tracks, K's BGM fits the show's setting like a glove. Of course, it is not Samurai Champloo, but the music does grow on you and on many occasions add to the atmosphere seamlessly, making K a very appealing experience to your senses of sight and sound.Character: 8/10If you're looking for a show where even the side characters make you relate to them so much you could be their best friend, K might seem a bit lacking. However, for the type of anime that it is, it doesn't need to have those kinds of characters. Instead K makes up for this by having several solid leads, while adding in some character archetypes that we all know and love like the Spectacled Badass, the Sadist, the Kindhearted Gang Leader, the Ice Queen, etc. and does that take out any enjoyment? Absolutely not.Enjoyment: 9/10Like I mentioned before, K is not an outstanding anime. I've seen others shows that have used the elements that it has before and done it better. However, by combining these aspects together and multiplying that with smooth music and animation, K ends up being a very fun ride at least for me.Overall: 8/10Now those of you who are into more serious shows and expect only the best of story and character development might say that this show is not worth its score, and that is entirely understandable. However, for just sheer appeal to the senses, K is still a very enjoyable show. It does not try to be overly serious and it does not need to be. So go grab some popcorn and maybe even a friend, because K is a show worthy of the title King in its category (well, there are better shows of course but I just wanted to make that joke.)

Cool characters, beautiful art, nice introduction to the plot and setting. As I watched subsequent episodes however, I started to realise the story was progressing from nowhere to little at all.The story could have been something interesting. The first episode presented many interesting characters, and the plot was good enough that it could have gone somewhere interesting as it progressed. Sadly, this progression had gone almost nowhere after three episodes, and many characters took a turn for the worse. They're shallow at their best, and completely...obsolete and irrelevant at the worst. The majority only appearing to serve as fan service to female and male viewers. Which is another point I need to make about this show. It's shallow. To be perfectly honest it seems a lot like someone wanted to create a show purely just for those people that like shipping characters and letting their own imaginations get in. It's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's like porn without anything explicit (Excluding Neko, her entire existence in this show is purely sex appeal), and they didn't forget to include a terrible plot line either.On to the art, it really is beautiful, but it also feels like it's like that for the reasons stated above. Although the scenery is just amazing to look at, and the animation is superb too. It'd be a perfectly fair reason to watch K just to witness what the animation has to offer, although I personally think the first episode covers pretty much everything there is to see, particularly since I noticed a few scenes reused in subsequent episodes.Well to summarise, if you don't mind shallow characters and slow story progression which may or may not lead anywhere coupled with beautiful animation and fan service, feel free to check this out, but just be mindful that there are definitely better things out there than what K has to offer. obsolete and irrelevant at the worst.

I personally think that K completed the plot its based around its own little world pretty well.Isana Yashiro is a soft and an adolescent teenager who lives on his own and is always active with his friends around the campus. However he soon finds himself chased down by the infamous gang named ""HOMRA"" who are the clansmen for the Red King. In the anime, seven kings or rulers are portrayed who have their own persona and supernatural powers. From the...impeccable Silver King, to the inferior Colorless King, the series focuses mostly on the Red King and the Blue King. So after the murder of one of the members of the HOMRA gang namely of ""Totsuka Tatara"", a video tape is left behind which point out the seemingly innocent Isana Yashiro as the culprit. It also happens to be that Isana Yashiro isn\'t quite as the person he seems to be, as he has little to no memory of his own past. K follows the story of the Red King and the HOMRA members seeking their revenge of the murder of one of their members, to the Blue King and their clansmen trying to stop the inevitable battle that will shake the order among the seven kings and to reveal the true identity of Shiro aka Isana Yashiro.K has quite an unique blend of characters, with Kuroh Yatagami, the student of the former Colorless King who is in the search for the person who is to become the next Colorless King, and to reach a decision whether the new Colorless King is worthy enough of the throne. He also has the job given by his former master as to decide whether the new Colorless King is good or evil, and if he\'s the former, Kuroh is to slay him right there. Coming to a decision that Shiro is the new Colorless King from the video tape that surfaced featuring Shiro shooting Totsuka Tatara, Shiro now has to explain that he\'s innocent. Shiro is shown as a silly yet simple and also a very mysterious character who is in search of what truly is he, along with Neko, a cat which possesses some magical powers.From the beautiful melody tones inserted into each episodes and a good voice acting work done, K tops the sound aspect very well. Angela is an extremely talented singer and it\'s evident from the lovely opening theme.GoHands has a reputation for creating a beautiful piece of art and K adds to that reputation. K is a burst of attractive colors and a ravishing artsyle that truly makes K a masterpiece when you talk about the artwork. It\'s one of best anime around in recent times if you consider the art of it, and for the same reason I can\'t stop but wonder why the studio has made very less anime\'s of the same type. Personally I really enjoyed K and I\'ll say that it\'s worth giving a watch. The story is well brought together which makes for a good watch and a nice ending. impeccable Silver King, to the inferior Colorless King, the series focuses mostly on the Red King and the Blue King.

It also happens to be that Isana Yashiro isn\'t quite as the person he seems to be, as he has little to no memory of his own past. K follows the story of the Red King and the HOMRA members seeking their revenge of the murder of one of their members, to the Blue King and their clansmen trying to stop the inevitable battle that will shake the order among the seven kings and to reveal the true identity of Shiro aka Isana Yashiro.K has quite an unique blend of characters, with Kuroh Yatagami, the student of the former Colorless King who is in the search for the person who is to become the next Colorless King, and to reach a decision whether the new Colorless King is worthy enough of the throne. He also has the job given by his former master as to decide whether the new Colorless King is good or evil, and if he\'s the former, Kuroh is to slay him right there. Coming to a decision that Shiro is the new Colorless King from the video tape that surfaced featuring Shiro shooting Totsuka Tatara, Shiro now has to explain that he\'s innocent. Shiro is shown as a silly yet simple and also a very mysterious character who is in search of what truly is he, along with Neko, a cat which possesses some magical powers.From the beautiful melody tones inserted into each episodes and a good voice acting work done, K tops the sound aspect very well. Angela is an extremely talented singer and it\'s evident from the lovely opening theme.GoHands has a reputation for creating a beautiful piece of art and K adds to that reputation. K is a burst of attractive colors and a ravishing artsyle that truly makes K a masterpiece when you talk about the artwork. It\'s one of best anime around in recent times if you consider the art of it, and for the same reason I can\'t stop but wonder why the studio has made very less anime\'s of the same type. Personally I really enjoyed K and I\'ll say that it\'s worth giving a watch. The story is well brought together which makes for a good watch and a nice ending.', 'When I first saw pictures and trailers for K, I though:""Man this looks promising!""And so the first episode started off with an amazing instrumental hip hop track, some cool looking dudes and a cute loli... and this weird blue filter...Well after a couple of episodes full of nonsense later I found myself baffled how anyone could even understand what this show was about.Well needless to say, this show made as much sense as a monocycle riding monkey on a plane.Let\'s just get to it....First the good:Animation 8/10This show looks damn fucking amazing it would have earned a 9/10 but that damn ugly blue filter ruined it for me to be honest.I mean look at it it\'s fluid as hell, the fighting scenes are fabulous. I was impressed. The only thing it kinda felt short was sometimes when they used boring stills ineffective and some background looked okay but not great (but sometimes they also did).Another gripe I had with the character designs. I like if they are individualized but they were a bit too Bi-Shounen for me.Sound 6/10The other great thing about this show was the great OST. A mixture of instrumental Hip hop and Electronica. Really cool and my first favorite OST of the season (others came to that list later).The Voiceactors were okay but because the characters were so poor and 1dimensional they couldn\'t shine and non stood out.The opening was horrendous and the ending forgettable.Now to the bad Parts:Story 3/10That this convoluted piece of garbage even got 3/10 is a miracle.But I have my reasons for that.Besides the ending the plot made no sense. had no sense of pacing, was complex for complexity sake and even in the end wasn\'t clear. I would say the premise was okay but since it never really got explained it was just a huge mess.At least because of the nonsensical story it never felt as if there was anything that wasn\'t important or like a filler, and some battles where cool so the episodes could be exciting and here and there was a cliffhanger or WOW effect but still in light of a stupid plot felt short.Maybe it\'s me and I just didn\'t ""get it"", but then it was the animes fault. I ""got"" Lain, and if this crap is deeper than Lain I think I kill myself.Characters 1/10At least everyone seemed to have a reasonable motivation for what they did.But else there was no development, nor did any character make sense. Everything felt artificial.Likable was only the cute Loli for being a cute Loli. Yeah that\'s it.Worst-Cast-Ever.Value 2/10If you have no Idea what I mean by this, go to my Profile, check ""new rating system"" and read about Value. I think it\'s a very good point to make for every show.But I will include it\'s parts for this reviewRewatchability - only to see if it makes more sense. But please no thanks not again.Sentimental - It was a particular bad anime with the most messy plot I\'ve ever seen. It sure stands out to me. It was also the first really nonsensical anime I\'ve ever seen. I give creds for that.Historical - Non this show will be forgotten, didn\'t do anything groundbreaking or influential. At least I hope it doesn\'t influence other shows to be this bad.Enjoyment 3/10I did enjoy it for the music and amazing animations.And I hoped it would become clear.But after finishing it, it only was this really bad anime that I finished with wasted animation and soundtrack.Conclusion : BAD do not watch, of just for the fighting scenes but I have some gifs for that if you\'d like to seem them.

What can I say? I have mixed feelings about it; more importantly it is a typical sad case of great concept ruined by terrible execution. Here's why.Lets put the story aside for a while, and talk about the concept. The concept for Project K is arguably fresh and creative. I won't call it particularly innovative but it does wonderfully so combine elements of sci-fi and fantasy. Seven Kings and their vassals endorsed by that special power, street gangs, military-like organizations and a high school and an inevitable evil mastermind behind all the events. It's a bit of everything and I suppose that's why...it is non-standard. With proper attention to each and every bit of that we would have probably received a truly memorable anime. And here's where Project K fails hard. Being only 13 episodes long it does nothing to process those ingredients into an edible dish. We never as much learn about the origin of power that is inherent to kings or how they received it. Is it magic? Is it science and technology? Who are other kings? What is factual peculiarity of their power? What is the story behind the crater thing? etc. Same pretty much goes to every other plotline and character.Plot itself is somewhat messy. We've got a mysterious murder and gangs who are going after the culprit who is in turn the main protagonist who suffers from amnesia who later discovers kings/vassals/magic and the actual murderer. Seems like a very action packed anime huh? Well it isn't. Good 2/3 of it we are having character interactions and chases which have very little to do with actual plot and hence the very gist of it is unveiled during final eps. Such uneven pacing keeps you hooked only during very first and very last episodes, becoming rather annoying in the middle. Most plotlines go nowhere and a lot of things are left unexplained, such as who's Neko, where's slate, past of certain characters. It just doesn't fall in place. That being said, amnesia is an awful plot-device.Art. Now art is one of the few strong points that K has. Animation is smooth and beautiful featuring great camera angles and spectacular special effects. The art itself imitates a cross-processed film which makes it look bright and optimistic, easy on the eye. The character design is hit and miss. Some are nicely designed with a distinguished look, the others are your typical janes and joes you'd find in any anime. Overall, it's a visual eye-candy although the quality declines towards the end of series.Sound. Another strong point. The soundtrack is crispy with some lovely piano arrangements, if a little repetitive. I have nothing much to say about OP and ED, they are both quite decent, but not the kind of songs that would stuck in your head.Characters are poorly fleshed out and present nothing original. We have typical personality-less school mob. We have an odd main hero who acts somewhat like Haru from Tsuritama. We have Neko who is in a sense a cardboard copy of Shiro (Deadman Wonderland), and we have Kuro (a lovechild of Kanda x Sebastian). In fact we have a ton of characters which are implied to have had interesting ties to each other in the past and present, but sadly it is never fully unfolded in the anime. It's not to say that characters are annoying or boring from the start, not at all. What I imply is, with the length of anime, it just seems unreasonable to put such a crowd in and toss hints about their complex history. If it was 26 eps long, that would be fine. Alas, it is not.Overall, it's easy to watch. Project K is that kind of anime that is perfectly watchable if you turn your brain off and just relax. It's not the best anime ever, nor it is the worst one. If you are looking for something other than just swords and mecha, this is probably a good choice. it is non-standard.

The first ep had me right from the start. There's a lot of people complaining that details in the world aren't explained, but that's because they don't bother to do research, there IS a manga that serves as a prequel to this. Also, I for one enjoy mystery, and figure that things will work out in the end. SPOILER ALERT: Plot Twist.Its art is simply amazing, much better than just about every anime I've seen so far.Its characters are distinguishable, they have their own unique personalities with actual...depth to them. Its more than just fighting and fighting, as evident when Seri visits Izumo at the Homura headquarters. depth to them. Its more than just fighting and fighting, as evident when Seri visits Izumo at the Homura headquarters."", 'I have only seen 3 episodes of K and btw this is my first review, so please stop read this if you find it annoying and really bad just stop, and if you mind, tell me why it is so bad so I can improve and not write crap again.This anime seems to have a lot of potential, mainly due to its unique and amazing art, especially the opening. I could take a random screenshot from the opening and use it as desktop wallpaper without any problems, because it is so well made. Apart from the opening the actual episodes also has some really...good art, moving people and an environment that actually could be a possible future Japan. The thing that I find most amazing is the small details, and finesses the different cool looking gadgets they have. The music I sometimes can find unfitting, and the beats in the background can sometimes be a bit disturbing, but those beats are usually well placed and the soundtrack is better average.The place that the story is set in is a very realistic future of Japan, even though the place where they are in is an alternative world. From what I have seen so far, this story is about different fractions in a city, and their war, something that is interesting. The story has lots of potentials, and could easily bloom out, but I am afraid that it probably won’t, because this story seems a bit too complicated. After three episodes I find a lot of things especially characters confusing, because I still don’t have the slightest idea why they are there and what role they have. The humor is something that this anime does not lack. I find the main character amusing and sometimes hilarious, for example (small spoiler) a guy comes to murder him and the following day they end up eating breakfast together.There seems to be tons of different characters, and if you see to your left under the information, there are only going to be 13 episodes. The character introductions so far has been average, and is nothing that really stands out, but it works out well. You can easily tell apart from most of the different characters, but because there are so many and it is a problem remembering all of them. There are two characters that are really similar to each other, and I think I have mistaken one with another a couple of times already. But otherwise each character seems to have a unique personality,appearance and ability.Just like most anime this one seems to also have a “fan service” character, just like Inori form Guily Crown, but now the anime industry has taken one step further, and this character, who is called Neko (cat in Japanese). She goes around naked, is really random, and whose purpose in life is to please the young adult males. I find this really sad and irritating, because she doesn’t really fit in the picture of the story so far, and seriously people grow up. Is it really that fun to see naked women run around that has very little to do with the story? There is something called internet and people can just go there to google “naked women” if people are so desperate.Even if this anime has some flaws and things that might ruin it in the future, I am willing to take the risk to be disappointed.So summary time:Art: 9/10 some really amazing artStory: 7/10 because there will be flaws and there are some flawsSoundtrack: 7/10 not the best but goodCharacters: 7/10 find them well done, but too many and still have difficulties to tell some apart even after 3 episodesEnjoyment factor: 8/10 some really good scene are present in this animeOverall: 8/10 because this anime has lots of potentials to become a 9/10 but the possibility for it to drop down to 5/10 is not small because it is very story based, so each episode must be somewhat meaningful. good art, moving people and an environment that actually could be a possible future Japan.

It\'s so superb. The animation is so smooth. The fight scenes are awesome (although few). The art is so detailed. The colors are vibrant (but sometimes annoyingly too much). Character Designs are good. They fit each character\'s personalities. It really is a feast for the eyes.SOUNDSoundtrack was pretty good. OP & ED are thumbs up. Voice acting was well done. There\'s nothing much to...complain about.CHARACTERSHaving so many characters to feature, most of them are left untouched, which is bad. There will be a sequel, which might improve this, but in this season, there\'s little to no character development at all.STORYWhen you speak about the concept, it\'s got huge potential. The problem with it is that the execution was badly done. The series will leave you with a big ""HUH?"" as it is so confusing.ENJOYMENTI\'m a sucker for animes with great art so even though the story\'s not that good, I fairly enjoyed it just because of the art and the soundtrack.I suggest that people who are finding an anime excelling in art and soundtrack to watch this as it is a huge treat but I also suggest that you have little to no expectations at all regarding the story as you will be heavily disappointed by it. complain about.CHARACTERSHaving so many characters to feature, most of them are left untouched, which is bad.

Yashiro Isana is attacked by a group of suspicious men because Yashiro is suspected of killing one of the groups comrades, however to no memory of Yashiro. This is the catalyst...of the following events to come. Story wise we are left confused as the story starts to unfold later on the show and not much explanation is given early on. I can interpret this by the writers trying to replicate that same sense of helplessness and confusion that Yashiro is a victim of. When watching the show progress towards its end you would hope that stories and mysteries will unfold, however this is not the case 2/3 of the show we still do not know the full extent of the story.This leads on to the criticism of the plot. With the story left to be fully explained towards the end of the series this means that story pacing feels unnatural and rushed towards the end as it feels the show is trying to tie up lose ends with what little screen time they have. I felt as watching the show I didn't care for the story as much because it wouldn't give me time to soak up story. With so many cool concepts for the show the 13 episodes did not do the show justice as there was room for the writer to build upon.Art: 10One section of the show that cant be criticised is the Art. Its visually stimulating, the way in which some scenes look almost real with what I can imagine are real life rendered images used as backgrounds for some sequences of the show, its as the anime world invaded reality. The colours of the anime are vibrant and bright which makes for a pleasant watching experience. Character models and attention to detail on characters are of high quality which adds a more authentic touch. Animations where also fairly good as most scenes where carefully planned out from a detailed standpoint. Compared to other shows such as bleach and Naruto that has a bad habit of recycled animation and static character models, K animates the show to a fairly high degree.Sound: 8The sound of the anime is also noticeably good. Voice acting is great across every character with characters such as Mikito, giving me goosebumps whenever he talks. As for selection of music its fair to say that the music choice they use is some of the best I've heard regardless that there wasn't many music selection as I would have liked there to be, meaning that music was sometimes recycled A lot but that's just me being picky. Overall the sound quality of music and voice actors they did use made the show a bit more pleasurable to watch.Character: 5Linking back to the original argument I made under the Story section with the story being to short and rushed this unfortunately carries over to the character development which I find there is generally none of. With Such powerful characters displayed from the very start of the show, its as if it almost intentionally sets up for these characters to develop and show a different side to the very linear personalities. The writer tries to compensate for this by giving us flashback sequences here and there, however this is not enough to fully immerse us with the characters on display. Furthermore some characters who play an integral part in the anime are introduced with no background story making these characters remain a mystery and for viewers to question the purpose of said characters.Enjoyment: 6For me personally I enjoyed the show at times but was left disappointed by the plot holes and the lack of details that I look for in an anime. The concept of the show was a unique one that I really loved but again was left disappointed on how the plot was lacklustre.The art made me really appreciate the show as at times it felt I was viewing a visual masterpiece with the amazing art direction is was going for. Overall it was a decent way to bide the time.Overall: 6To conclude I wouldn't recommend this show for any newcomer to anime not to say its a bad show but just because there are many other shows that perfect most categories I covered. However for someone who has seen most mainstream anime I would encourage you to watch it as the Art is some of the best you will see for any show.

The overall concept was decent, but presenting it was mediocre, partially due to time constraints (I would imagine).Story - 5.Although the concept of the anime was an intriguing one, the execution was not so well done. A lot of times I was confused by what was happening, with no real explanation afterward. The overall story I understand, however little things are left unsaid - anything about the kings really, their origin, very little is actually said about powers, how and why different people have them, and so on. It left me with...a gazillion questions and very few answers. The ending is also a cliffhanger....sort of...which is always annoying if it is not followed up.Despite some plot holes and unexplained phenomena (like the whole Strain thing - why do we only meet one? And why is she entirely unexplained?) I did enjoy watching K, for reasons I will state below.Art - 10.Yeah one of the things everyone seems to agree on it that K's art and animation really is stunning. The animation was smoothly executed, the character designs were relatively interesting and the art style consistent. The colour palette was varied and really helped develop a certain feel in a lot of scenes, especially the fight/action scenes - lots of bright colours to add to the excitement. The little details were not few and far between either - almost everything was detailed, which really made a believable environment.Sound - 8.The sound quality for K was noticeably high, the voice actors did a sterling job and really set the scene for the anime in general. Honourable mentions to Mikoto and Fushimi's actors, both of which executed a brilliant and believable performance to their characters.I enjoyed the OP, it seemed relatively fitting to the theme of the anime, however the ED didn't really stick for me. I didn't like nor dislike it.The only problem I had with the sound was the same piano riff/theme was used throughout the series, I don't think there was many deviations for it, mostly for a reveal or the lead up to an epic moment. It didn't annoy me, it was just noticeable and maybe a wider range of background music would have set the scene a little better.Finally the in-world noises were executed fine too.Character - 6.Since the story is so confusing at times and seems to leave most questions without answers, the characters weren't too easy to really relate to for me, although I developed a soft spot for Shiro.I think where characters probably worked best in K is with their interactions with one another - they almost all have ties with each other and interact in different ways, which really made the anime for me. You were always wondering what their true relationship is and how it will change over the course of the anime.Of course, being so short, you don't get much time to really connect to the characters whilst you're trying to figure out what's going on around them, but for me an at least passable job was done portraying what they wanted to portray. I've seen blander and more personality-less characters than K, that's for certain.Enjoyment - 8.Despite its flaws, K was an engrossing and thrilling ride for me. I really had no idea what to expect (as the synopsis didn't give away a lot) but I wasn't disappointed (until the ending). It may not be a really deep engaging story but the action scenes are really a spectacle to behold, I'm glad I watched it for the art alone! Although there wasn't much character development or real..substance to each character, they stood best when interacting with one another, which really kept the show moving for me. And the mysteries surrounding each. Which were decently executed, but I feel like if they'd had more time to give you a little more information on the characters and the world in general it may have been easier to connect.I digress.Overall a very enjoyable anime to watch, especially for those who appreciate excellent art and animation - just don't expect a fully solved puzzle at the end of your journey. a gazillion questions and very few answers. The ending is also a cliffhanger....sort of...which is always annoying if it is not followed up.Despite some plot holes and unexplained phenomena (like the whole Strain thing - why do we only meet one? And why is she entirely unexplained?)

It is very pleasant to look at, and (most of the time) the animation is seamless. Also, the soundtrack is above average, and I really enjoyed the opening and ending themes especially. Now, let\'s get into the problems I had with the show.K spent a ton of time on world building, only to end up not actually using most of the stuff they spent time explaining. In the early episodes they talk about how there are 7 kings, and the colorless king, but only the red, blue, gold,...and silver king actually appear in the anime; on top of that only the red and blue clansmen appear in the anime. So why have 7 kings?Also they explain that Neko is a strain that has special powers, which I thought was a really cool concept. But she was the only one (or the only one to appear in the anime at least) so what was the point? It seems like her only real purpose was to make Shiro and Kuro really OP for no reason. It would have been interesting to see if there was another strain like her on an opposing side with a different ability, and make the battles more interesting or something. I don\'t know, just my thoughts on her.K is also guilty of using what we call big ""no-nos"" in story telling. The one that K is most famous for abusing is giving tons of exposition to the audience, using characters that would have no reason to be discussing the information; it is just a really lazy way to convey information to the audience. They do this MANY times; one such example of this is in one of the very last episodes when the blue king and the red king are talking about the ""swords"" of each king (the big ass ones that float in the sky) and how it shows their true form or how they are on the inside; basically when a king is weak their sword looks all weak and broken and vice versa. They spend roughly 4 minutes talking about this when obviously (being kings) they would already know this information, so why are they talking about it? Why are they wasting so much screen time discussing things that they clearly already know? It would have been much better to explain stuff like this to Shiro because he didn\'t really know anything that was going on, so there would be a reason to explain it to him.Also, one thing that I really didn\'t get was their weapons. Why are they using swords if this takes place in the future? And the fact that the red clansmen use baseball bats and lead pipes and such implies that the weapon doesn\'t really affect their strength, but they use they powers to augment their weapon to make it strong. So why use weapons at all if they are just using their powers to augment them anyway? Why not just use their powers alone to fight (and actually, the red king does only use his powers to fight, and is the only character to do so).The characters were very bland and generic for the most part; none of them really stood out as a unique character particularly. I didn\'t find any characters super unlikable or just plain bad per se, but there are no characters in K that really stand out as something I have never seen before. Part of this may be attributed to K trying to use so many characters to accomplish so little. They didn\'t need as many characters as they had to tell the story they wanted to tell, and if they had opted for using less characters, they may have had enough time to really develop them and fully flesh them out.Final Scores:Story: 3Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 3Enjoyment: 5Overall: 5Overall I didn\'t hate K, nor did I think it was a ""bad"" anime. I just thought it was one of those anime like Guilty Crown where all of their budget went into the art/animation/sound and not into the characters/story. I thought it was pretty average, probably wouldn\'t recommend to a friend, as there are many anime that do much more in the same amount of episodes (or less). and silver king actually appear in the anime; on top of that only the red and blue clansmen appear in the anime.

Why? Because my first review wasn't good enough to protect it.First off, I will be writing some spoilers about the characters, especially Mikoto and Shiro. If you have not watched K, don't read the second half of my review. I won't review the plot, simply because I believe all plots should revolve around the characters and never the other way around. With a lot of mystery and action series, you are basically watching a puppet show with forced actions and personalities onto the characters just to keep the plot engaging. This will never work for me....Never.K is different in that the plot is built around the characters. This is easily done in a slice of life series, but for a short action, fantasy, and mystery story, this is extremely hard. You have to build the characters the same time you build up the plot. This seems pretty easy in theory, but in reality, to prevent the plot from taking over the characters is a pretty hard task in a limited amount of time. The creators have to constantly keep in mind this cheesy idea: the “soul” of each character that tells them where they want to go.Here comes the spoilers on the characters. I will focus on two only because others involve around them.1. Mikoto. Yes, Mikoto. He isn't the main character, and no, I did not put him in the first place because he is my favorite. In fact, I dislike him. However, he is the most important character in K nonetheless. He is the foil, and actually I haven't seen in a long time this kind of fascinating foil. He is the foil that never truly interacted with the protagonist, Shiro, but it makes me excited just to think about them together. Oh, I should stop here for a second and comment something about the yaoi suggestions. I'm a fujoshi. But I'm not a fujoshi who drools over every boy love story. For example, I did not like Kuroshitsuji no matter how much I liked the boy and his butler. The beyond reasonable plot and cheap character development ruined it for me. Now back to K, if you are a person who is extremely sensitive to boy love suggestions, then K might not be a show for you. But truthfully K has very little boy love suggestions.Now seriously back to Mikoto. Mikoto is the kind of tragic hero who is lost in his resolution from the beginning to the end. I wouldn't say he did what he did out of revenge. Of course, revenge is a part of it, but Mikoto is a much more complicated person. Let's say, if Johan Liebert from Monster and Kuroro from HxH sit at one extreme end and Luffy from One Piece sits on the other extreme end, Mikoto is the person in the middle. I don't like him exactly because he is in the middle, but that's just my personal taste. Mikoto could not abandon his sadness and anger and become monsters like Johan and Kuroro, and he also could not change the negative energies into positive forces like Luffy can. From the very beginning, he is already like a time bomb, both literally and abstractly speaking. Glass-kun tries to stop the bomb from killing himself and others around him. That's Glass-kun's role in the whole series, so essentially, Glass-kun is the foil to Mikoto. I won't get into other characters around them, but each major follower of Mikoto has his unique personality. Despite the differences in their personality, they still followed Mikoto till the end(except for that one particular person with his psycho voice. he is still interesting, don't get me wrong). So what made Mikoto so attractive for them? I think it's Mikoto's vulnerability that turned into strength for others, but not for himself unfortunately. And no, I don't mean they feel superior standing beside a more sensitive and vulnerable person that suffers alone. It's because they could feel the warmth from the fire he burns, so like Tatara said, Mikoto's power protects people, and his followers feel it. This whole set-up is symbolically consistent with Mikoto being the red king that wields fire that is a potential source of warmth and Glass-kun being the blue king that's cold in appearance but calms the fire when it goes wild.2.  Next is about Shiro. Personally, he is my favorite, along with Kuroh and Neko. I won't reveal his real identity here, but honestly, whoever Isana Yashiro is, Shiro is Shiro. That's why I like him the most. His warmth, unlike Mikoto's, doesn't come from self-sacrificial burning, but from his smiles. Shiro is a playful character that smiles a lot, even in dangerous and sad situation. His unfitting smiles are not satirical, unlike most people's when they want to feign confidence. Shiro is a person who believes in people around him and allows others to believe in him. His foil Mikoto can also do this, but again, they do it differently. That's why I feel so excited about this setup between Shiro and Mikoto. In appearance, Mikoto is a dying person while Shiro is an immortal, but they suffer the same loneliness. Mikoto self-sacrifices while Shiro smiles but they do it for the same reason. Kuroh and Neko are essential for the development of Shiro as a character. They are there so that Shiro has someone to smile at, especially when he smiles out of sadness. The cliché way of putting those three would be, they complete each other. Unfortunately for Mikoto, the person who completes him died. Their fate consequently changed because of this development. I feel in a way, Shiro and Mikoto switched their places in many respects.The most obvious one is  Mikoto who had a special friend ends up losing that person while Shiro who had no one gains kuroh and neko. This situational switch triggered much of the character development.In summary, K is a story about gaining and losing important people around us, and also learning from them about ourselves. I think it carries a very beautiful message.I don't understand where K is confusing, how K is superficial, and why it deserves the low ratings and harsh reviews. From my point of view, I saw great characters and witnessed their stories. It's been so long since I can write so much on anime characters. Mikoto and Shiro are so well planned out characters, and I promise you, even if you have already watched K and deemed it not good, give the characters and their roles, even their power, more thoughts. You'll end up finding a lot of interesting surprises. Never.K is different in that the plot is built around the characters.

The development team had been astonishingly tight-lipped about the series and few trailers that they had released made the series seem promising. When the first episode aired I was immediately enraptured by the gorgeous visuals, animation, and jazzy and modern soundtrack intertwined with classical nuances. From what I could see, there wasn't much not to like about this show; the universe itself seemed interesting and the diversity of characters was also certainly a draw. As a...heterosexual male, I didn't even mind the slight hinting at BL, I mean, I got through No. 6 with few problems so this show couldn't be much worse with Shion and Nezumi #2, right?I guess the first thing I should cover is what everybody can literally and clearly see, the art and animation. The art and animation of K are stunning. The characters and the city-scape is all look really good and the nuances they add are interesting such as the bending of space when Kuroh uses his “hand” ability (I see what you did there GoHands) to launch himself away from the Howling Flame, aka Homura, or the crazy effects of Neko's powers. However, despite how good it may look there are some minor flaws that I noticed. In the first episode- yes the first episode- there was one instance where the bartender character spoke English but his lips weren't synced properly. Seriously, GoHands? You messed up on lip syncing in the first episode. Is a couple fixed frames really too hard? I've watched five different releases of the first episode and they all have the same problem so I'm fairly confident that it's not just me. There are also other times where limbs were stretched and positioned in strange and almost inhuman angles while the battles are going on but those aren't as noticeable.Next is what you can clearly hear, the music and voice acting. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, K has a jazzy and modern-sounding soundtrack that is intertwined with some classical nuances. Most of the time it has a nice, relaxing feel with a heavy emphasis on piano but there are other times where it picks up slightly, especially in battles. Unfortunately, the music never reaches to the ranks of something epic-sounding, it may sound cool and fitting but it never really got me pumped up for a battle or particular scene. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's bad, I can respect the composer's decision to keep the tone so mellow all the time; it's just a stylistic choice, nothing more. Speaking of stylistic choices, the one thing that K does well with its music is with the absence of it; yes, silence. Well, some may be wondering why that's so important in music and the thing is: a lack of sound is sometimes much more profound in a piece of music than the intricacies in the music itself. Some moments are simply best to leave silent than to have music playing throughout the entire scene, leave the sound effects to do the “talking” for themselves. And finally, speaking of talking and as with most of the Japanese voice acting, the voice acting in K is top-notch with each seiyuu fitting the role they are put into well; nothing  much to complain about here. I actually found the cleaning robots to be randomly entertaining with their deep voices and samurai-esque sayings.I guess that's enough of talking about the good stuff for now, on to the bad stuff- namely the characters. Besides the fact that the characters are forgettable, generic, and just good at being present, it seems as if they pulled people from everywhere and just piled them into K. Kuroh and Shiro (I wonder why they're named that? *sarcasm*) look a lot like Nezumi and Shion from No. 6, Yata looks like a typical skater-punk or like Beat from The World Ends With You, Neko is the cat-girl (go figure), and Seri the typical buxom anime blonde, just to name a few. There are a lot of characters in K, for example: literally every single character in Scepter 4 , the blue group, has a name that they call out when they pull out their swords for battle (innuendo). The problem with having such a large cast is that not very many characters receive development and this is one of the points where K suffers the most. There are few relationships that you really get to understand, namely Yata and Fushimi, the Silver King and the Gold King, and Neko and Shiro. These make you go: “Oh, okay that's why they're like that. Now what about the other characters?” The problem is there is no real explanation for any other relationships other than Kuroh's relationship with his Master and Suoh Mikoto's relationship with some of his fellow Howling Flame members and they also skim his relationship with the leader of Scepter 4, Munakata Reishi. By far though, Neko is the most dynamic character, almost making up for all the other emotions all the other characters lack. The rest of the characters are flat (in a literal sense), essentially remaining the same for the entire series, Shiro included.Onto the next thing, the story. With a series such as K, one would expect there to be significant storytelling unlike in a high school comedy series that just involves a bunch of high school students talking about nothing important and doing nothing important. This is another of the points where K fails utterly. There is an absolute lack of any substantial story. Yes, there is plot, however, there is no real story-telling. A plot is an event- a fact. A story is what interweaves these plot points together and gives them meaning so that they are interesting to the audience. “I went to the store” is an example of plot; [i]Beowulf[/i] is an example of a story. The premise was a classic whodunit murder case which, if handled the right way, could have made a decent story. Instead, they decided to gather the viewpoints from the three different sects- blue, red, and black/white- and put them together to attempt to make a coherent story but it all amounted to nothing. The only part where there is a flicker of story is at the end where they tried to connect the dots.Furthermore, there are no real motivations shown, especially as to why the Reds and Blues are really fighting and why the main bad-guy, who has no name, only a title, did what he did other than making the audience assume that they did it because they felt like it. In that sense, K is the epitome of the opposite of dramatic irony, also known as the unreliable narrator (more specifically a mix of the Clown and the Lair archetypes) wherein the characters themselves often know much more about the universe and situation than the audience does. Any explanation that is directed at the audience is vague and the further questions that are brought up by the answer are ignored completely, forcing the audience to just sit there and accept what's going on without question. Oh, so there are things called Strains, what are they and how do they get their powers? There are giant, floating super-swords called the Swords of Damocles (I appreciate the nod to folklore there) and they grant powers to people. How do they float and give people powers? Where did the Swords of Damocles come from? What are the units that constitute a single increase to the Weismann level? Okay, maybe that last one was a bit much to ask for but nonetheless, none of the above questions were answered in the anime series.When I ask why people think K is so great they can't come up with anything other than mentioning how beautiful the visuals and animation are or that they like certain characters. For example, I asked one of my friends who thoroughly enjoys K and thinks it's great to explain the story to me in a clean and concise sentence and he cannot give me an acceptable answer. When I tell him things like “Yeah, in K, this guy gets stabbed and now he can speak German” he gives me the strangest of looks. K seemed like it was trying to please everybody using beautiful visuals and animation, using well-known seiyuu, adding in a lot of bishounen males for fangirls to fantasize about, fawn over, and argue over their own “one true pair”, putting in two (count them, two) curvaceous women, one a cat-girl who's a barely-clad or naked at all times, with random fanservice for male fans, and adding mystery with intense action- sprinkling in some mediocre comedy while it was at it. In the end, it all became a jumbled mess. Much like a temptress, K lures you in with her beauty and soothing voice and rewards you with fleeting sensations of pleasure for seeking her attention but, in the end, she leaves you hollow and wondering if it was all worth it- wondering what really attracted you to her in the first place. Similarly, the more I watched K, the more I questioned why I was still watching it, other than to just get it out of the way. The more I watched K, the more I came to realize that it's just a bedazzled pile of crap that plays cool music; no matter how great it may look or how good it sounds, a pile of crap will always be a pile of crap. With a sequel already announced and in the making, I can only hope that the second season makes up for all the flaws that plagued the first.6 out of 10 heterosexual male, I didn't even mind the slight hinting at BL, I mean, I got through No. 6 with few problems so this show couldn't be much worse with Shion and Nezumi #2, right?I guess the first thing I should cover is what everybody can literally and clearly see, the art and animation.

The characters and the city-scape is all look really good and the nuances they add are interesting such as the bending of space when Kuroh uses his “hand” ability (I see what you did there GoHands) to launch himself away from the Howling Flame, aka Homura, or the crazy effects of Neko's powers. However, despite how good it may look there are some minor flaws that I noticed. In the first episode- yes the first episode- there was one instance where the bartender character spoke English but his lips weren't synced properly. Seriously, GoHands? You messed up on lip syncing in the first episode. Is a couple fixed frames really too hard? I've watched five different releases of the first episode and they all have the same problem so I'm fairly confident that it's not just me. There are also other times where limbs were stretched and positioned in strange and almost inhuman angles while the battles are going on but those aren't as noticeable.Next is what you can clearly hear, the music and voice acting. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, K has a jazzy and modern-sounding soundtrack that is intertwined with some classical nuances. Most of the time it has a nice, relaxing feel with a heavy emphasis on piano but there are other times where it picks up slightly, especially in battles. Unfortunately, the music never reaches to the ranks of something epic-sounding, it may sound cool and fitting but it never really got me pumped up for a battle or particular scene. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's bad, I can respect the composer's decision to keep the tone so mellow all the time; it's just a stylistic choice, nothing more. Speaking of stylistic choices, the one thing that K does well with its music is with the absence of it; yes, silence. Well, some may be wondering why that's so important in music and the thing is: a lack of sound is sometimes much more profound in a piece of music than the intricacies in the music itself. Some moments are simply best to leave silent than to have music playing throughout the entire scene, leave the sound effects to do the “talking” for themselves. And finally, speaking of talking and as with most of the Japanese voice acting, the voice acting in K is top-notch with each seiyuu fitting the role they are put into well; nothing  much to complain about here. I actually found the cleaning robots to be randomly entertaining with their deep voices and samurai-esque sayings.I guess that's enough of talking about the good stuff for now, on to the bad stuff- namely the characters. Besides the fact that the characters are forgettable, generic, and just good at being present, it seems as if they pulled people from everywhere and just piled them into K. Kuroh and Shiro (I wonder why they're named that? *sarcasm*) look a lot like Nezumi and Shion from No. 6, Yata looks like a typical skater-punk or like Beat from The World Ends With You, Neko is the cat-girl (go figure), and Seri the typical buxom anime blonde, just to name a few. There are a lot of characters in K, for example: literally every single character in Scepter 4 , the blue group, has a name that they call out when they pull out their swords for battle (innuendo). The problem with having such a large cast is that not very many characters receive development and this is one of the points where K suffers the most. There are few relationships that you really get to understand, namely Yata and Fushimi, the Silver King and the Gold King, and Neko and Shiro. These make you go: “Oh, okay that's why they're like that. Now what about the other characters?” The problem is there is no real explanation for any other relationships other than Kuroh's relationship with his Master and Suoh Mikoto's relationship with some of his fellow Howling Flame members and they also skim his relationship with the leader of Scepter 4, Munakata Reishi. By far though, Neko is the most dynamic character, almost making up for all the other emotions all the other characters lack. The rest of the characters are flat (in a literal sense), essentially remaining the same for the entire series, Shiro included.Onto the next thing, the story. With a series such as K, one would expect there to be significant storytelling unlike in a high school comedy series that just involves a bunch of high school students talking about nothing important and doing nothing important. This is another of the points where K fails utterly. There is an absolute lack of any substantial story. Yes, there is plot, however, there is no real story-telling. A plot is an event- a fact. A story is what interweaves these plot points together and gives them meaning so that they are interesting to the audience. “I went to the store” is an example of plot; [i]Beowulf[/i] is an example of a story. The premise was a classic whodunit murder case which, if handled the right way, could have made a decent story. Instead, they decided to gather the viewpoints from the three different sects- blue, red, and black/white- and put them together to attempt to make a coherent story but it all amounted to nothing. The only part where there is a flicker of story is at the end where they tried to connect the dots.Furthermore, there are no real motivations shown, especially as to why the Reds and Blues are really fighting and why the main bad-guy, who has no name, only a title, did what he did other than making the audience assume that they did it because they felt like it. In that sense, K is the epitome of the opposite of dramatic irony, also known as the unreliable narrator (more specifically a mix of the Clown and the Lair archetypes) wherein the characters themselves often know much more about the universe and situation than the audience does. Any explanation that is directed at the audience is vague and the further questions that are brought up by the answer are ignored completely, forcing the audience to just sit there and accept what's going on without question. Oh, so there are things called Strains, what are they and how do they get their powers? There are giant, floating super-swords called the Swords of Damocles (I appreciate the nod to folklore there) and they grant powers to people. How do they float and give people powers? Where did the Swords of Damocles come from? What are the units that constitute a single increase to the Weismann level? Okay, maybe that last one was a bit much to ask for but nonetheless, none of the above questions were answered in the anime series.When I ask why people think K is so great they can't come up with anything other than mentioning how beautiful the visuals and animation are or that they like certain characters. For example, I asked one of my friends who thoroughly enjoys K and thinks it's great to explain the story to me in a clean and concise sentence and he cannot give me an acceptable answer. When I tell him things like “Yeah, in K, this guy gets stabbed and now he can speak German” he gives me the strangest of looks. K seemed like it was trying to please everybody using beautiful visuals and animation, using well-known seiyuu, adding in a lot of bishounen males for fangirls to fantasize about, fawn over, and argue over their own “one true pair”, putting in two (count them, two) curvaceous women, one a cat-girl who's a barely-clad or naked at all times, with random fanservice for male fans, and adding mystery with intense action- sprinkling in some mediocre comedy while it was at it. In the end, it all became a jumbled mess. Much like a temptress, K lures you in with her beauty and soothing voice and rewards you with fleeting sensations of pleasure for seeking her attention but, in the end, she leaves you hollow and wondering if it was all worth it- wondering what really attracted you to her in the first place. Similarly, the more I watched K, the more I questioned why I was still watching it, other than to just get it out of the way. The more I watched K, the more I came to realize that it's just a bedazzled pile of crap that plays cool music; no matter how great it may look or how good it sounds, a pile of crap will always be a pile of crap. With a sequel already announced and in the making, I can only hope that the second season makes up for all the flaws that plagued the first.6 out of 10"", ""After reading some of the reviews on this anime, I decided to throw out my two cents, that being that it's being judged a bit too harshly for trying to be eye-catching and whatnot, but when you look into the anime a bit more, you'll find that there is no previous source for it, i.e. a light novel or manga. With that, it's already at a disadvantage to other popular animes like To Aru, who have a significant fanbase already started, so the success of it can't be as accurately gauged pre-airing. While the story shown so far is nothing to gawk at, it does...have a ton of potential to be interesting. There are interesting characters, well-placed Soundtracks, and great animation. So, as far as I can tell, the minimal story progression can be explained by the need to establish a following and make sure that continuing through with this anime wouldn't be hazardous in a business sense. While I, like many others, would like to see more of the story with this in the first season, I don't think it's enough to qualify this as a sub-par anime.All in all, I think watching this anime would be well worth your time if you can wait for further plot development in a potential (and in my opinion, likely) sequel. have a ton of potential to be interesting.

The creators really let me down on this one. They pulled the classic anime bait-and-switch technique. Where they make the first episode so awesome that you just know this is going to be the best anime ever...and then they switch it with a horrible drawn-out, teasing anime. You keep thinking, ""omg next episode is going to be sick!!!"" but no...it won\'t. K actually had 2-4(maybe 4) decent episodes, credit mainly give to the artwork and ost.I think the main reason K was so bad was because of all it had to work with. Near perfect art, mesmerizing ost, great...plot to start with, yet they still somehow found a way to trash it. For one, the main character was the least interesting person on the show. In fact his group was the least interesting group in the show. 2 of the 3 or 4 best episodes we\'re episodes they were absent in. Second, the fight scenes were a total let down, mainly full of colorful power-ups and unexplained abilities.That leads us to the third point: Project K explains 35.678% of the storyline and motives behind nearly all the characters. No one knows how a Kings are chosen, what is the extent of their powers, why certain characters are the way they are, nothing.Summary: K is like a legendary warrior, wielding a legendary blade, during a legendary war, and somehow he still can\'t manage to save the day. If you are new to anime, by all means, watch it. But if you\'re a seasoned anime watcher, and need more than cliches in your life, watch the first episode and walk away.

Without any way to undo this action I thought I better write this to make clear that no, I don\'t think why this visually gorgeous, broken down mess of a series is supposed to be ""appealing"". So here I go:The story is so unfocused, and the exposition is all over the place because, between wanting to tell the past via flashbacks, or...telling the present via dialogs more boring than watching a peanut go out of its shell, the writers slip through both sides, improving the chance for the viewer to just not care about it. Because it\'s hard to know what the hell are they trying to tell in the first place.Art is incredibly good, no doubt about it, however a personal gripe is the use of stock footage. You will notice an attack position and sequences used more than one time. This is some Sailor Moon level stuff right here. It makes the animation look as corny and worthless that it makes you think, if the people invested so much in the visual details, why didnt they use it to avoid things like that? Or better yet, why not hire actual, competent writers instead of throwing all the money to the dumpster to focus only on looks, but I digress.The soundtrack itself has its charm, with interesting and atmospheric tunes, so it\'s the best aspect of this series to me. The OP as well as EDs are pure, generic, run of the mill anisong stuff though, so there\'s that. Lots of people might like them, I prefer a little more variety in my music, so obviously I don\'t.And then we come to the lowest point in this series: the characters. Seriously, they\'re as flat as the floor the voice actors seemed to have stepped in. Even the mics the VAs used to record seem to have more personality than those. Either that or they\'re so annoying you only wished they were dead by the next episode. We have people portrayed by the series with some characteristic trait, yet when these characters get into the action they seem to flop all this buildup by acting as generic and aloof as possible. A complete waste of plot. Another gripe is that, with a cast that big and only 13 episodes, most of the supporting characters end up being only cannon fodder or background filler, which completely defeats the purpose of having a cast of such size. You could take some of them out and wouldn\'t even make a difference.Overall, and how I always say: Mediocrity never looked so beautiful as here, and adequacy is as flat as it gets. K, in concept, tries too hard to be the next Baccano/Durarara while failing miserably in its execution. A good setting which goes to waste, a story that seems interesting but is told in a piss-poor manner, and characters so worthless that they end up killing any little interest I could have in them.

After all, how much series are there that have a name of one letter long?After watching the first episode, I was hooked.==SETTING(spoiler-free)==\'K\' takes place in some metropolitan city in the near future: There are a lots of gadgets and interactive smartphones with three-dimensional interfaces. But this is only the backdrop for a story about multiple rivaling groups of supernatural people that fight eachother.Isana Yashiro, a guy with white-ish hair and the ability to act strange but always find a way out of tough situations, is the...main character. A video is found where a person that looks like him killed one of the people from the Red Clan. This is the reason that he is suddently targeted by a lot of people, without him actually knowing what\'s going on.For now, I won\'t give them all the points. It\'s not entirely clear yet in what direction the plot will take us, and this might change my score later on.8/10==ART==Beautiful. The way the characters are shaded reminds me a little of Durarara, but the art is much more gorgeous than that anime. Shingo Suzuki, who directs K, is also the man who made all the character designs. This can be seen, as the characters seem to blend in the story perfectly.The environment is also drawn beautifully. I love the way they\'ve handled the reflection of the sunlight, for instance.

It's a shame to say that though it is not by any means a terrible anime, K left me disappointed.Story: 5/10The story in my opinion had the potential to be good yet was poorly executed. It starts off with what seems to be a conflict between 2 gangs then switches over to a young, easy going high schooler who turns out to be the actual main character....The first 4 episodes halted plot progression. It pretty much turned from a serious series regarding the conflict between 2 gangs into a slice of life comedy with some eechi thrown in as Shiro, Kuro, and Neko go about their life in a school setting.Things do start to pick up by the 5th episode but by then almost half of the series is already wasted. What happens next is that the main plot actually speeds up in the second half where random equations are thrown into the plot. The main story quickly starts building up, episode by episode then you get a finale that really doesn't feel like anything special.Art: 10/10Definitely the best part of the series. I can't think of any other series from the top of my head that compares to the animation and art style of K.Sound: 6/10For the most part it was decent enough. Enjoyed the opening and ending songs. I found that the music used during the episodes seemed a bit repetitive though.Characters: 5/10A few characters get development with even flash backs to round them out. However, most are left in the dust. Characters like Anna and the female Lieutenant of the blues are never truly explained or fleshed out. I never really felt any attachment to any of the characters throughout the series which is extremely  rare. I just found it odd that a character who is no longer alive in the present story's timeline got more revealed about them than characters who are actually still alive in the present.Enjoyment: 5/10Decent show to kill some time even if it's just to marvel at the art and animation as I found myself doing. I may find myself re-watching a few cool action scenes but that's about it. Hopefully the 2 sequels for this series help flesh out the characters and plot a bit more.Overall: 6/10Overall K is a show that had potential to be a lot greater than it actually is. it's a good example that beautiful art is not everything and you need proper character development and better ways to reveal the plot of the story to truly stand out from the other thousands of anime out there.

It looked fun, intriguing, and even though there was plenty of fanservice, I felt like I was one of the fan it serviced, and didn\'t exactly mind. Now, however, I\'m at a point where I doubt the story is in any way salvagable.The main problems of this anime are the plot and the characters. Personally I feel there is nothing wrong with fanservice as long it isn\'t the only thing sustaining the anime. But ""K"" just feels really, really empty. The characters feel like premade shells for fanfiction and doujinshi,...and again, I *love* fanfiction and doujinshi, but the basis for them needs to be a little more solid than ""K"" is. The story is convoluted and very oddly paced; I am still not entirely sure what the main point of the plot is and why those kings even exist. There are too many things that are unexplained, and unless the storytelling does a complete 360 in the last couple of episodes I can\'t imagine this will end in a way I\'ll find satisfying.Like most people have said, it looks great and has some really good seiyuu, so watching it isn\'t a complete waste of time. Maybe if you don\'t expect too much of it it\'s alright. I\'m just disappointed because it had a lot of potential, but wasted pretty much all of it. and again, I *love* fanfiction and doujinshi, but the basis for them needs to be a little more solid than ""K"" is.

However, I feel that overall the anime wasn\'t too bad after I reached the later episodes, and I did enjoy it.I became very skeptical towards the story after watching the first 3 episodes, and I almost dropped it after thinking that the plot was no good. I felt that some scenes were too ridiculous and lacked logic. Why would the newly introduced character who wanted to kill...the lead suddenly sit down to have dinner with him due to being tired? It made no sense to me. I think the creators wanted to create a happy atmosphere to contrast with the later episodes and changes the characters were going to face, but it was executed in a way that felt a little awkward.However, at around episode 6 things started to become more interesting as the real plot finally started to unfold, and from then on the story was rather decent. I feel that a fatal flaw for K was the first few episodes that felt like empty filler. They caused many people to become confused as well as skeptical for the rest of the season. If that flaw in K was fixed and unnecessary scenes and complications to the plot were cut out, this would have been a pretty good anime with a plot that suited 13 episodes.The ending to me made sense, and has been foreshadowed since the beginning. The ending wrapped everything up and I felt it was well done in terms of what SHOULD have happened due to the foreshadowing, did.The characterization was lacking as the cast was rather large but not enough was shown about each of them, only snippets here and there. The main character Isana felt more endearing to me than the rest of them as he got the most screen time. I felt some characters had a lot of potential to become very memorable, but they were not developed enough. For example, Misaki has been a favorite among fans and I can definitely see why. However, they did not show enough about his personality aside from being a tough skater with a soft interior. Well, what else? Nothing much deeper about him was presented, and why he adored Mikoto so much aside from being the leader. The cast of characters each have interesting personalities though, I just always felt like I wanted them to take it to a deeper level for some of the main characters such as Mikoto.The art was quite nice, the characters all had rather delicate features and the music to me was very good. The opening track in episode 1 as the screen went across the city and Homra was simply awesome and classy. Animation was a little choppy at times, but the lighting and the blinking animations were beautiful to look at.The biggest flaw in this anime would be the way the story was presented. The very core and story that K was trying to show wasn\'t bad, but the presentation definitely needed trimming. The first few episodes were too messy, but the second half was much better. Overall, a decent anime.  Nothing revolutionary but still entertained me enough to keep watching. the lead suddenly sit down to have dinner with him due to being tired? It made no sense to me.

If that flaw in K was fixed and unnecessary scenes and complications to the plot were cut out, this would have been a pretty good anime with a plot that suited 13 episodes.The ending to me made sense, and has been foreshadowed since the beginning. The ending wrapped everything up and I felt it was well done in terms of what SHOULD have happened due to the foreshadowing, did.The characterization was lacking as the cast was rather large but not enough was shown about each of them, only snippets here and there. The main character Isana felt more endearing to me than the rest of them as he got the most screen time. I felt some characters had a lot of potential to become very memorable, but they were not developed enough. For example, Misaki has been a favorite among fans and I can definitely see why. However, they did not show enough about his personality aside from being a tough skater with a soft interior. Well, what else? Nothing much deeper about him was presented, and why he adored Mikoto so much aside from being the leader. The cast of characters each have interesting personalities though, I just always felt like I wanted them to take it to a deeper level for some of the main characters such as Mikoto.The art was quite nice, the characters all had rather delicate features and the music to me was very good. The opening track in episode 1 as the screen went across the city and Homra was simply awesome and classy. Animation was a little choppy at times, but the lighting and the blinking animations were beautiful to look at.The biggest flaw in this anime would be the way the story was presented. The very core and story that K was trying to show wasn\'t bad, but the presentation definitely needed trimming. The first few episodes were too messy, but the second half was much better. Overall, a decent anime.  Nothing revolutionary but still entertained me enough to keep watching.', ""For anyone who read my previous anime review, I apologize. It was my doing for writing such an unprofessional and misleading review on such a great anime such as K. Let’s start over and hopefully this one will be much better. \uf04aOkay, I must admit that I came into “K” with low expectations. It hadn’t gotten noticeably good ratings before and wasn’t very popular when it came out because of all the fuss over other premiering anime shows at that same time such as “Magi” and “Bakuman” which received excellent reviews and recognition; therefore it was hard for “K” to stand out from their shadows....Also, my sister (17 YO) had previously watched the anime not a few months ago, telling me that it wasn’t worth watching. I decided to challenge this statement and witness the anime for myself, for I saw it on my recommendations list b/c of its reported similarity to one of my personal favorites, “Durarara,” and read the plot summary for myself that was provided by . Surprisingly enough, I decided to add it to my “Plan to Watch” List, coming back to it not a few days ago.I decided to watch the first episode. It didn’t have a very strong start, which may also contribute to its lack of popularity and good reviews, but I didn’t let that phase me and continued to watch the show. I realized after about 5 episodes in, the show captivated me and I couldn’t stop watching it. Even after the weakness and confusing nature of the first few episodes, it soon proved to have great development, both in character and plot. Eventually, when I reached the end, I witnessed one of the greatest finales, in my opinion, in anime history. Please sit and read quietly while I explain this well-deserved 10 that this anime happened to receive.Story: 9The best way to describe this anime is a focus on many different viewpoints of different anime characters that somehow creatively make up one giant, amazing, unexpected puzzle that is finished at the very end of this anime. The main protagonist is a seemingly normal high school boy named Isana Yashiro, or “Shiro” that somehow gets involved with a murder case that took place on the rooftop of a bar. The murder victim unfortunately was one of a psychic clan known as “HOMRA” led by the violent short-fused red king, Suoh Mikoto. Unfortunately for him, the killer (who was captured on video) looks a lot like Shiro even though he doesn’t remember doing such a thing. With the help of his “guardian” Yatogami Kuroh, and “Neko” (I have yet to find her significance to the story), they try to get to the bottom of this framing without starting a psychic war between the seven kings. A well thought out plot, yes? There are indeed a lot of elements to the plot, and that’s why the beginning seemed so confusing and weak at first. And Indeed, the anime is very similar to DRRR. Some of the characters look similar to those in DRRR, also, the colored clan idea is a very similar, personalized element to the use of Color gangs in DRRR. Also, I find that both protagonists have very unusual and unexpected secrets that are revealed later on, which I won’t give away. The fact that all of the elements are summed up perfectly and fit together like a puzzle really adds to the plot. On many occasions, I experienced an “Oh my Gosh, That makes sense!” Moment in my head. I loved that. There were just certain occasions, especially at the beginning, when it seemed like all of the detail and elements ended up confusing and overwhelming me, leading to discomfort in some plot areas. Also, many good points were also brought up with the fact that there are noticeable holes in the plot and a lot of excess information was left out. I noticed this of course. On many occasions I would've like to learn a little more about the Silver, Blue and Red Kings; I would've also desired a little more history behind the Sources of their power, the 7 Swords of Damocles. This was obviously an issue mainly because of the span of the anime. If it lasted for 26 episodes instead of 13, I believe that K would earn 10 points in Story. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, instead the story gets a 7Art: 10This seems very opinioned, I’m sorry. But I love color. I love the idea behind color and their hidden meanings and themes. I believe that all of the colors incorporated in the plot and art style really added to the deeper meaning beneath the surface. Red marked the “Violent” clan. Blue marked the “Reasonable and Cool” Clan, and Gold and Silver marked the “Top Dog Clans” that were most powerful. These colors that were incorporated in the characters and hidden themes really added to the complex tones of all the elements in the story. The complexity and character of each little color, from personality, to mood, to comparison, (such as black and white) had a great impact. Also, I found the fight scenes, especially with use of the mix of psychic abilities, quite pretty and well designed. There was great movement and perfect camera angles in the action scenes of the anime and that was a really great aspect of the anime that just boosted the whole watching experience.Sound: 10when dealing with sound of an anime, people just look at the anime openings and endings; and while in K, both were very nice, the real highlights in sound for the anime were definitely the Character Themes and transitional OST tracks. All of the themes for each character fit them so well that it’s uncanny. You can listen to a theme song and have the ability to guess which character it fits they are made so well. Also, the OST tracks, you can tell that a lot of work went into making them just right for each scene. There are songs, such as my favorite, “Requiem of Red” that add so much emotion to the perfect scene to an already awesome ending. One of the best. Sound also refers to the voice acting, and I must say, I watched subbed and the casting was amazing. My favorite voice of course was the slurred heavy voice of Mikoto Suoh, played by Tsura Kenjirou. It wasn’t just him though, the other voice actors fit so well, whether their virtue was innocence, or pride, or cockiness. Everything worked. \uf04aCharacter: 8If there was to be a main flaw with this anime, it would have to be with the characters. Don’t get me wrong, I fell in love with almost every single character in the anime, even with the ones I was supposed to hate, haha. It just seemed like every single character had their own personal piece of the puzzle and specific role to play, if it was to add to the pride theme of the anime, or to the comic relief, or to the innocence theme, all of the characters had a role that fit the plot perfectly. I just felt that there were some superfluous characters that I had trouble trying to find their main role, such as Neko. She is cat and has psychic abilities, yes; and she DOES help Shiro and Kuroh on many occasions, but I feel that her role was mainly fanservice and gaining views and that just took away from the anime itself. There are many other characters that I feel this confliction with as well even though many of the characters’ designs and personalities really clicked with me.Enjoyment: 10If you find me, and ask me what my favorite anime I’ve ever watched is, I would most definitely say “K.” And this is why: There are so many elements and themes that really captivate you as you continue to journey through this anime. From characters to plot, to sound, I guarantee you will enjoy this anime. If you dropped it after a few episodes, Pick it up and watch it again, because you will be missing out on a lot. Everything fit together in this show and I loved how it all worked out in the end.Overall: 9I highly suggest you watch this, and I guarantee that you will enjoy it. Unfortunately this anime hasn’t gotten the publicity it deserves and that’s because people aren’t expecting it to be great. That’s how I was. But if you take the time to watch around 6-7 episodes, I guarantee you won’t regret it. You’re missing way too much if you skip out on this anime. Give it a chance. There are some plot holes that take away from the anime, but overall I liked it and of you average all of my scores, they come out as a 9, even though I would've loved to give it a 10 :) Also, my sister (17 YO) had previously watched the anime not a few months ago, telling me that it wasn’t worth watching.

Through out my years I have watched various kinds of anime. I thought I had seen it all. Until I came across this anime it really is wonderful. It appeals to both females and males.

It has a lot going for it, but it really falls short in a lot of areas as well. It is an easy watch, and it\'s never boring, but it could have been a lot better. Overall it is worth watching, and I recommend it to fans of superpower anime series.I\'ll start with art and animation. The artwork is very well done in K. In fact, the art was a high point. It\'s too bad the animation wasn\'t consistently good as well. There were scenes that were animated brilliantly, but they only made it even more clear when...they cut corners in other scenes. The cheap and rushed animation that littered this series is one of it\'s lowest points in my opinion. Art and animation are really a double edged sword in this series.With a spotty visual delivery, K also has a spotty audio presentation as well. The voice acting was at times very monotonous and droning, and then there were other times that it was emotional and engaging. The monotonous voice acting was poorly complimented with music that was just as inconsistent. There were scores that worked very well, and then there were other times that the music was almost laughable. A few times I expected a late night soft porn to start but it would only be a scene where they entered a building. It definitely affected the ""enjoyment"" factor of this story. Thankfully, it has some memorable music at times, so this wasn\'t a super low point for the series.I would have to say that even most of the characters were mediocre as well. There were a couple that were fairly charismatic, and that helped a lot. I think there should have been better focus in the storytelling on some of the more charismatic characters. I don\'t think they spent enough time on the good personalities, but they did spend some time with acceptable development over all.I saved the story for last because it is the high point of this anime series. The story was interesting enough to keep my attention all the way through. There is a major twist towards the end, and there is also a cliffhanger of an ending. It\'s not a bad cliffhanger, but they have announced a sequel, so hopefully they do something interesting with that as well. The story leaves you guessing, but it does leave a lot of questions that should have been answered along the way. Honestly I think the story was simply acceptable until about episode 6 or 7. After that it was really well done. I would say that it\'s even better when you know the twist and watch it a second time. The slower moments would be more exciting with the extra knowledge.In short, I didn\'t love this series, but I did like it. It\'s worth watching, and it has a lot of potential. It\'s short at 13 episodes, and there is still more to come. I would say it\'s a solid 7 in my book they cut corners in other scenes.

I myself have very much enjoyed ""K"" so far but more for the animation and sound than anything else.Animation and Sound - The animation in ""K"" is rather unique amongst anime, with its high contrast colours, beautiful backdrops and great fight scenes. This may be because I haven\'t seen...many different anime types, but I have not seen an animation style at all similar to that within ""K"". This, combined with the music played throughout, give the clear message that this anime is not set in modern times.Character - The characters within ""K"" are its main downfall, with each character being rather stereotypical anime character types - the unfortunate main character with a secret or unknown past (Isana Yashiro), the main ally of the protagonist who dislikes him at first (Kuroh), the useless, unintelligent but attractive female ally picked up later in the story (Neko), the main antagonist who seems ruthless and acts almost without emotion (Mikoto Suoh), ect. All stereotypes without a single original character amongst them and barely any character development. There is also the problem of having too many characters and not enough episodes to properly introduce them and explore their pasts. Remember, I\'m not saying the characters are unlikable, but just stereotypes.Story - The story of ""K"" is also rather disappointing, with attempted plot twists that you could see coming from a mile away, character decisions that either make no sense or are unexplained, and an all-round very rushed feel to it. If there were more episodes to the series, say 24 instead of 13, I\'m sure that the story would be better and less confusing, but its lack of original ideas would still be a huge letdown.Overall, I rather enjoyed ""K"" despite its bad storyline and mediocre characters, as the animation and sound are almost enough to provide the enjoyment that isn\'t provided by the former. This is an anime that isn\'t for everybody, but there\'s always the chance that you might enjoy it so go ahead and give it a watch.

You never know.', 'K, also known as, The K-Project, is a show produced by a no name studio that goes by the name GoHands. They have produced nothing but mediocrities prior to this show, which I wouldn\'t consider to be a god-scend, but far from ""Shit"" or ""below average""Art & Animation - 9/10I honestly don\'t even think I need to explain this one. The show looks gorgeous, easily the best looking show that I\'ve ever seen (YES, I HAVE SEEN THE FATE SERIES). The colors are very outlandish, the animation is very fluid, and the shots, OH MY GOD THE SHOTS!Sadly past episode 4, I can\'t recall 1...single perspective shot. But the perspective shots through the first part of the series were really cool, and helped to immerse me into the world. Don\'t really have to explain anything here. Even the CGI vehicles looked fantastic.Sound - 9/10My lord this show sounds phenomenal. With the exception of a few voice actors, the dub is absolutely fantastic. Characters have strong emotion, and while some lines sound cheesy, nothing sounds out of place. The OST is fantastic. Only once can I recall the OST not fitting the mood of the show, and that was during the second episode\'s fight scene between Kuro and Yata. The soundtrack is a mixture of techno, pop, rap, and ambience, all which sound very unique, and memorable.Story - 4/10I\'m going to split the story section up into two parts, because this show is exactly like Shingeki no Bahamut in terms of how the downhill slide occurs.Part 1 (Episodes 1 - 7)The show is very fun. Fight scenes are very sparse, and the show is just...FUN XD The show starts with our main hero, Yashiro Isana, being supposedly framed for the murder of one of a rival gang, the Red Clan (AKA. HOMRA). While being pursued by them, Yashiro is also threatened to be killed by a man who goes by the name of Kuro, the Black Dog. Eventually, Kuro finds his chill, and remembers that he is to judge Yashiro, as he is to be the next leader of the colorless clan. (Sounds like Durarara, huh?:lol:).The first 4 episodes are just action, a little bit of world building, and dumb fun. Yashiro is trying to solve the mystery while living with his cat who has now transformed into a human, and Kuro. These episodes are the highlight of the show, as it never takes itself seriously. It\'s just action with very entertaining character interactions. These first 4 episodes also throw out alot of mysteries, that are explained in later episodes.Part 2 (Episode 8-13)Just like Bahamut, the second half of K takes itself waaaay too seriously, and ends up becoming very confusing and incomprehensible. Tons of science dialogue and info-dumping is thrown out, which makes scenes very hard to understand. I actually had to go to a wiki at the end of the series due to being so baffled. I understood the gist of stuff, but not the explanations.The ending is very controversial, but because I started this show on 5.10.15 and ended it on 5.17.15, the movie is available to me, and soon the second season will be available for me as well, starting in October in 2015. The movie picks off from where the show ends, leaving me nothing to complain about at this time. However, this does not excuse the execution of the ending. A death was very anticlimactic is what I\'ll say. As soon as the character walks in, they\'re killed 3 seconds later. But to put it simply, the show dives heavily into a type of plot which revolves around the relationships of many characters, but sadly none of those characters can be fully expanded on due to time constraints.One thing that I would like to talk about is the structure. Just like Baccano, K will often bring up questions, and then connect everything else later. It also has a story which is told from 3 main perspectives. There\'s the Red Clan, the Blue Clan aka. the police (of sorts, kek), and Yashiro and crew. The show does a great job of bringing things together, but never fully explores things that it tries to connect. The pacing also feels rushed trough flashbacks, once again, due to the lack of episodes, which is probably the biggest flaw concerning the issue.I don\'t think Studio GoHands thought that K-Project would be successful, so instead of throwing out a fleshed out show, what we got was a ton of good ideas, that never get fully explored, or dived into. The story isn\'t too bad overall, but it becomes too serious for its own good, and as a result, goes from an above average, fun show, to a messy, below average battle shounen of sorts.Characters 4/10The characters in K all have a great sense of personality. There\'s the hot-headed Yata, who is very likeable for his sheer loyalty to the Red Clan\'s leader, Mikoto. The kings just seem so bad-ass, and the main cast of characters are very likeable. HOWEVER, no character develops, and by no, I mean not even 1. Sure these characters are easy to care for, but without any development due to their actions, the actions seem useless. I\'d have to say the best character in the show was by far Mikoto, however he was never really explored. He seems to have had a dark past, but that\'s never explained of course, DUE TO STUPID EPISODE CONSTRAINTS! JESUS, WHY COULDN\'T THIS BE 25 EPISODES!? XDAhem, back to Mikoto, yeah...right...Mikoto is the only character that seems to have a motivation. He and the blue king, Reishi Munakata. It is often stated that the two have had been friends previously, but as I\'ve said time and time again in this review, the relationships was never explained. More great potential, wasted. Just like Izaya and Shizuo from Durarara!!, these 2 characters really made the show special; but unlike Durarara!! which gave us a backstory on its rivalry, The K-Project leaves the characters\' backstory a mystery. Hopefully, this is all explained in season 2, however it won\'t be anywhere near as relevant or as impactful as it would be in season 1.Overall fun characters, but they have no depth, motivations, or development...of course beyond Mikoto and Reishi.Value - 5/10I\'ve heard a ton of people say that no one will remember this series; but the animation alone is very much enough to make this series remembered for years to come. However, in terms of rewatch value, this show has little to none. There isn\'t a ton of fighting despite the amazing budget given to the show, meaning that you can\'t just go back and watch the series for the fights without lounging through the exposition once again. If you\'re able to do that however, props to you, but I personally don\'t plan on rewatching this series anytime soon. Rather, I\'ll just search up the fights on YouTube.Enjoyment - 7/10I loved this show...until it began to expose its own flaws to a far greater degree than I would\'ve ever imagined that it would. Even then however, I still enjoyed the show, enough that I would recommend it to anyone, just because of how bad-ass everything was :smile:Final Verdict - 6.33/10K is a very fun and entertaining show, the struggles once it gets to episode 8, as you realize that they wasted too much time on attempting to connect you to the characters, rather than actually delving into their stories. The presentation is the best that I\'ve seen in anime, period. The characters are very fun and bad-ass, but overall lack depth or development.I would recommend K to anyone looking for an action series, or people that are looking forward to something good in the fall, as this is receiving a second season then. I hope you found this review helpful single perspective shot. But the perspective shots through the first part of the series were really cool, and helped to immerse me into the world. Don\'t really have to explain anything here. Even the CGI vehicles looked fantastic.Sound - 9/10My lord this show sounds phenomenal. With the exception of a few voice actors, the dub is absolutely fantastic. Characters have strong emotion, and while some lines sound cheesy, nothing sounds out of place. The OST is fantastic. Only once can I recall the OST not fitting the mood of the show, and that was during the second episode\'s fight scene between Kuro and Yata. The soundtrack is a mixture of techno, pop, rap, and ambience, all which sound very unique, and memorable.Story - 4/10I\'m going to split the story section up into two parts, because this show is exactly like Shingeki no Bahamut in terms of how the downhill slide occurs.Part 1 (Episodes 1 - 7)The show is very fun. Fight scenes are very sparse, and the show is just...FUN XD The show starts with our main hero, Yashiro Isana, being supposedly framed for the murder of one of a rival gang, the Red Clan (AKA. HOMRA). While being pursued by them, Yashiro is also threatened to be killed by a man who goes by the name of Kuro, the Black Dog. Eventually, Kuro finds his chill, and remembers that he is to judge Yashiro, as he is to be the next leader of the colorless clan. (Sounds like Durarara, huh?:lol:).The first 4 episodes are just action, a little bit of world building, and dumb fun. Yashiro is trying to solve the mystery while living with his cat who has now transformed into a human, and Kuro. These episodes are the highlight of the show, as it never takes itself seriously. It\'s just action with very entertaining character interactions. These first 4 episodes also throw out alot of mysteries, that are explained in later episodes.Part 2 (Episode 8-13)Just like Bahamut, the second half of K takes itself waaaay too seriously, and ends up becoming very confusing and incomprehensible. Tons of science dialogue and info-dumping is thrown out, which makes scenes very hard to understand. I actually had to go to a wiki at the end of the series due to being so baffled. I understood the gist of stuff, but not the explanations.The ending is very controversial, but because I started this show on 5.10.15 and ended it on 5.17.15, the movie is available to me, and soon the second season will be available for me as well, starting in October in 2015. The movie picks off from where the show ends, leaving me nothing to complain about at this time. However, this does not excuse the execution of the ending. A death was very anticlimactic is what I\'ll say. As soon as the character walks in, they\'re killed 3 seconds later. But to put it simply, the show dives heavily into a type of plot which revolves around the relationships of many characters, but sadly none of those characters can be fully expanded on due to time constraints.One thing that I would like to talk about is the structure. Just like Baccano, K will often bring up questions, and then connect everything else later. It also has a story which is told from 3 main perspectives. There\'s the Red Clan, the Blue Clan aka. the police (of sorts, kek), and Yashiro and crew. The show does a great job of bringing things together, but never fully explores things that it tries to connect. The pacing also feels rushed trough flashbacks, once again, due to the lack of episodes, which is probably the biggest flaw concerning the issue.I don\'t think Studio GoHands thought that K-Project would be successful, so instead of throwing out a fleshed out show, what we got was a ton of good ideas, that never get fully explored, or dived into. The story isn\'t too bad overall, but it becomes too serious for its own good, and as a result, goes from an above average, fun show, to a messy, below average battle shounen of sorts.Characters 4/10The characters in K all have a great sense of personality. There\'s the hot-headed Yata, who is very likeable for his sheer loyalty to the Red Clan\'s leader, Mikoto. The kings just seem so bad-ass, and the main cast of characters are very likeable. HOWEVER, no character develops, and by no, I mean not even 1. Sure these characters are easy to care for, but without any development due to their actions, the actions seem useless. I\'d have to say the best character in the show was by far Mikoto, however he was never really explored. He seems to have had a dark past, but that\'s never explained of course, DUE TO STUPID EPISODE CONSTRAINTS! JESUS, WHY COULDN\'T THIS BE 25 EPISODES!? XDAhem, back to Mikoto, yeah...right...Mikoto is the only character that seems to have a motivation. He and the blue king, Reishi Munakata. It is often stated that the two have had been friends previously, but as I\'ve said time and time again in this review, the relationships was never explained. More great potential, wasted. Just like Izaya and Shizuo from Durarara!!, these 2 characters really made the show special; but unlike Durarara!! which gave us a backstory on its rivalry, The K-Project leaves the characters\' backstory a mystery.

I hope you found this review helpful', 'To start off, I must first say that I personally believe that K-Project is a lovely anime, although there is no doubt in my mind that it is underdeveloped.Story: 6The story in K-Project revolves around Yashiro Isana (Shiro) who appears to be a regular student in High School, and is accused of being a murderer. This drags him into the mess that is a war between clans; the story focuses on the Blue and Red clans, and these are two that most directly affect Shiro\'s story. The story overall is probably the most underdeveloped part of the anime, in my opinion. The viewer discovers...a bit about the history of the creation of the Seven Kings (and therefore by association, their clans), we are never truly given a deeper view into the world that K-Project takes place in. There is much general information that isn\'t provided, and while it adds to the mystery, it also can be irritating. However, while the plot seems reasonably mediocre at first, the end does contain a number of plot twists and new ideas that I think puts K-Project at a 6 rather than a 5 in rating for story. Overall, I have to say that while the idea that this anime is built upon really is quite unique and has it\'s own twists and turn, many aspects that contribute to the story of K-Project are briefly touched upon and do not pull the viewer into the story\'s world, simply because the viewer is quite clueless most of time.Art: 10The Art in K-Project is simply fabulous. The detail, colors and style is probably one of the key things that set K-project apart from most other animes. The backgrounds are in full detail and color. Even people in crowds in the backgrounds have developed looks - There are no ""grey shadows"" in this anime. Also, light plays a large part in K-project; the glow of the clan members as they fight, the natural sunlight, and the screens of monitors are all done in a very unique way.Sound: 10I watched K-project in the English Dubbed version, so I cannot speak for those who watch it in Japanese. I think the voice actors did a lovely job. The voices suit the characters, and they match up with the animation. The music/soundtrack choice is well chosen. The music really sets the tone and mood for each scene, and really enhanced the whole experience. I think the music and art styles worked very well together.Character: 7The relationships between characters is also something that can be viewed as much underdeveloped. We see character interaction that leads to very complex relationships, but none of that complexity is expanded upon aside from reaffirming the same surface idea over and over. The individual Characters, however, are very well done in my opinion. No character is one-sided. The characters\' personalities and traits contribute much to the anime as a whole, and while we don\'t see much Character development of those other than Yashiro, their scenes/stories cannot be described as flat and boring. This is a time when the cluelessness of the viewer works to the anime\'s benefit - Although we don\'t see character growth in many of the cast, we are still learning about them as a person throughout the story.Enjoyment: 7I definitely enjoyed watching K-Project. There is no doubt about it. I even recommended it to a couple of my friends as well. I loved many of the Characters and the way they were presented. I wish we, the viewers, could have gotten more about the character\'s relationships with one another and the overall history of the K-project world. However, I liked pretty much everything that was already presented - I just wish there was more! The plot was a little bland, as I tend to gravitate towards anime where the plot twists never end, but I think it was an original idea (or at least, an original take on an idea) and one that seemed quite promising.Overall: 8I couldn\'t get enough of the art and music - I personally think they are the most spectacular parts of the anime and have really pushed the limits. The plot is a little dull, although the ending episodes have enough twists in it that I can call K-project ""underdeveloped"", rather than ""simple and dull"" as I would otherwise. In hindsight, I view K-project as more of a prequel type anime, although it wasn\'t intended to be one. I have, and would recommend this anime to others. It\'s absolutely lovely, but don\'t expect to detailed plots with lots of plot twists throughout. a bit about the history of the creation of the Seven Kings (and therefore by association, their clans), we are never truly given a deeper view into the world that K-Project takes place in.

It\'s absolutely lovely, but don\'t expect to detailed plots with lots of plot twists throughout.', ""Let's see... Firstly, when I started watching this, the first episode was weird. Plain weird. No other words to describe it. But its so weird that my curiosity got the better of me and I watched the next episode. Then, I realized that it's weird in a good sense. It makes us want to watch more, and every episode reveals a bit more about the main plot. Overall, it's really interesting and if you get past the  first 10 minutes, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy it. :D "", ""At a glance, K would appear to be a light-hearted super-power action series. However, that is the main flaw of the 1st season. K's 1st season is very much focused on the mystery of ''Who is the main character?'', but the opening episodes failed to set the tone for the main plot, instead moving the story around in circles. While clues were given for the mystery, the failure to set the tone would make the viewer NOT look for said clues, and instead focus on the pretty animation. It is a pity, too. The mystery itself is rather good, and makes sense. To fully enjoy...the story of K, one must be patient as the story only becomes clear after half of the season. If you are not the patient type, this anime is definitely not for you.As the focus was not on the setting, there was also the unsatisfactory feeling left by the rather poor explanation of the setting. Why is the white haired girl so different? Why do these people has powers? Why is Neko such a strange existence? How does the King gives the powers? Many questions were not explained, and from the series' point of view, it might not be hard to see why. This is a series that instead forces its viewers to infer from what is shown, and to actively seek out the other mediums that are about to be released. As a standalone 13 episode, the setting doesn't make sense.The many colour factions also means that K has a huge cast of characters. While characters were given distinct personalities, the 13 episode length also meant that there wasn't enough time to develop any of them. This is especially true for the Red and Blue factions. Merely a glimpse of their relationship were shown. Clear evidence that the 1st season of K is just a jump start to other mediums. The manga and light novels cover the story for the Red and Blue factions.Of course, while the story itself is rather flawed in the way it was presented, the anime has its redeeming points. The animation of K looks good. Although i do not particularly like the choice of using an overly shiny colour palette. EVERYTHING on screen literally shines. Even the CGs that are present are made even more obvious because of the shine. This is ,however, just personal preference. To some the shiny colour palette may instead serve to make it look prettier.If you are to watch K, be mindful that K is more than just a 13 episode anime. It is a series that requires you to read the manga and light novels if you wantto know more. Considering that there are still colour factions not shown AND a second season, it is probably safe to say that K will try to expand its universe and far as possible. Otherwise, K's 1st season as a standalone would just be eye-candy, with a mystery that doesn't hit until clearer signs were shown. the story of K, one must be patient as the story only becomes clear after half of the season.

I found some gifs on tumblr and then automatically proceeded to youtube to check the trailers and google to find out as much as possible. I was expecting a boom. And oh boy, it was a boom.I will say that I am a definite supporter and fan of K. I know that there have been mixed opinions on it, and I understand everyone's point of view, but I'm here to deliver my own impression.Story: 9/10At first (and during the most of the series duration) we DON'T REALLY KNOW what the plot is. We jsut...have a bunch of cool characters running around, trying to catch Shiro who supposedly killed a member of Homra (the Red's) and that's about it. As the story progresses, we see how the groups are connected, how they work, who are the Kings and why are they essential and we see how it deepens. I must admit though, the fact that the master plot was revealed in the last 2 or 3 episodes did make me wanna break my screen at some point. Somewhere around ep 7, you still have no idea what's going on and you start to wonder if there is an actual plot or are they just thinking on their feet. But until the end it delivers, and it delivers very nicely. It was the boom that I was expecting, but in a different way. The story itself is interesting, if you can bare with the plot-holes (it's how it usually goes with original anime projects). That's why I give it a 9 out of 10, since it could have been done better, with less confusion.Art: 10/10It is outstanding. As the animation progresses we can see that anime get more and more beautiful art, but K really does it at this part. Everything is so beautifully drawn, the character design is almost flawless (I still have a problem with a few anatomy things - like Seri's boobs for starters) and the colors are nice and flowing, enjoyable for the eye. Some would say that there too many flashy sequences or that there are too many blues. Although I agree with that, it was what made the anime more appealing to me, rather than something that was annoying.Sound: 10/10Not much to say about it, we all have ears. Actually I could write about it for ages, as much as about everything else, but I wasn't too focused on the sound. I did notice how well it fitted the scenes, the OP and ED had me hooked from the start and I still listen to them regularly. Something else I noticed,  when the OST was released I heard a few character songs on yt, and I was amazed. So it's another plus for the sound department. The voice-acting (it falls into this and character I guess) was done perfectly and I actually didn't have a problem of music interfering with the voices while watching. As someone who watched the majority of episodes in raw first and then with sub, it is a big big plus. I'll leave it at that.Character: 9/10I give them a 9 out of 10 just because it is a short anime, so it is not possible to give enough screen time for every character to develop fully. It's not like we have a ton of episodes like Naruto and Bleach where we can see the development of even the minor characters, but it was still something missing while I was watching. When it comes to this type of anime, there should be a few main characters and then add as much as you want of the side ones. With K, you get mains, semi-mains and side characters, but they all get almost the same amount of screen time (excluding Shiro and Kuro). It was kinda hard to follow at some point, when you had so little info about how they were all connected - there was just not enough time to show us how they evolved through the series. Another part that was missing for me was the link between Misaki and Fushimi. I loved the love/hate realtionship they've got (and believe me, I'm trying not to put this in my yaoi basket in this review), but what agitated me was that we never found out how close they actually were, how they acted while they were friends and exactly how did stuff happen. We got a few flashy flashbacks, a lot of yelling by Yata and laughing by Fushimi and that was about it. We were only give the bad side of their relationship. I hope they fix that in the 2nd season.Voice actors:I have to put this here, because I am a crazy big fan of seiyuus and in this anime, the first two things that drew me were the art and the seiyuu cast. I have to start with Mamoru Miyano, who is just freakishly amazing - I've loved him since the first time I watched Death Note, then in Soul Eater and now here... He showed us yet again how he can transform his voice - I was literally crying while he was maniacally laughing at Misaki.Then we have Ono Daisuke, another one of my favorites. Sebastian for starters, and looking at Kuroh's character you'd say that he always gets that kind of roles. I've watched him in a bunch of other animes and he can do it all. This is just something that he is particularly good at. And his voice always gives me chills.The other Daisuke, Namikawa - he was quite a surprise. I didn't know his voice from other anime, or at least didn't recognize it, but his voice was rather appealing and it fitted his character well. I heard a lot of people saying that he was not cut out for this kind of role, but in the end you can see that he can manage with the boyish voice as well with the deep and commanding one.We see a lot of other very famous voice actors, Tsuda - who was Seto in Yu-Gi-Oh and more surprisingly Nathan - Fire Emblem in Tiger&amp;Bunny, Sawashiro Miyuki (whose voice is the only one I CAN'T stand in this anime for some reason), Horie Yuki and another favorite Fukuyama Jun. At first I thought that this type of character was not good for his voice, since he usually plays the flamboyant characters, but it was lovely to hear him like this.The enjoyment was a 9, although I'm still somewhere between 9 and 10. I really loved it, but at some moments it annoyed me so much so I have mixed feelings about it.So the overall is 9, although in my heart it's 10.The anime has a perfect mixture of fantasy, magic, technology, mystery and action, with a slight turn on romance. It also has a BUNCH of hot male characters which leaves our yaoi fangirls' minds to wreak havoc. Overall, it's a good anime, with so many different positive points, it would be a shame not to watch it.I'm sorry if I bored you to death, but if you actually read this until the end, you have a cookie from me. *gives a cookie* have a bunch of cool characters running around, trying to catch Shiro who supposedly killed a member of Homra (the Red's) and that's about it.

I really loved it, but at some moments it annoyed me so much so I have mixed feelings about it.So the overall is 9, although in my heart it's 10.The anime has a perfect mixture of fantasy, magic, technology, mystery and action, with a slight turn on romance. It also has a BUNCH of hot male characters which leaves our yaoi fangirls' minds to wreak havoc. Overall, it's a good anime, with so many different positive points, it would be a shame not to watch it.I'm sorry if I bored you to death, but if you actually read this until the end, you have a cookie from me. *gives a cookie*"", ""I don't understand why a lot of people didn't like this anime. K was an amazing story with a very interesting plot. It's like durarara in a way in a way set in a futuristic world. The story was really well wrapped up in 13 episodes although some things remained unexplained due to it's short episode number maybe because it makes way for the movie and the upcoming second season (can't wait). The art well it was more than amazing. Studio GoHands did an excellent job bringing us K's world. I can't explain how beautiful the animation was you must see it yourselves. Also this...anime had an excellent voice acting. About the opening/ending well I wasn't a real fun on any of them but they weren't bad. Especially the opening was pretty good just a little bit off my tastes. But overall, this anime had very good OST's and music in general. Because of it's seemingly high budget the anime has some first-class voice actors (Mamoru Miyano and Jun Fukuyama are just two of the names) and all of them do their job excellently. The character department of this anime was kinda week in my opinion. Even though there is a very good (although kinda rushed in some of them) character development in most of the characters when this anime ended I didn't identify with any of its characters. I didn't hate anyone but I also didn't love anyone too. They were all interesting but nothing out of the ordinary.  In conclusion K was a pretty enjoyable anime that I definitely enjoyed from the first episode until it's ending. I am glad I didn't let all the negative comments discourage me from watching it. A must watch for me and an amazing ride. anime had an excellent voice acting. About the opening/ending well I wasn't a real fun on any of them but they weren't bad.

Does anyone noticed the singer said Hentai? It looks like a fail, but not the Titanic collapsing in the iceberg.SYNOPSIS:Generic main who only stands out because of he's natural white hair, suddenly get majority involved in a massive clan war against the Red Team, and The Blue Team because of some misunderstood revenge scheme which ends up being rather dum at the end... He also lives in some semi-sci-fi setting where magic and weird supernatural stuff apparently exist for no narrative reason.REVIEW:First of, the world...building was utter shait in this show, we have resemblances of how these clans people who hold such mysterious powers, who can apparently? Make red fire? Or apparently having bursting energy from Your fists means Your attacks are stronger? Seriously, does anyone notice how vague the supernatural aspect of this show was? It could've been a decent handicap to just explain these mysterious looking powers covered by LSD visuals. Heck! They never even shown the green clan as if I don’t care, and no one cares.All what I remember from the whole mystery aspect of the show since I didn’t even noticed when I read reviews for this, is that it always seemed so silly and stupid like how they keep Neko, the show whore, a complete mystery until we see on what seems to be a lazy written moment near the climax as an excuse for us to care for a badly written fan service character, or the “Epic” reveal of the villain looking like wolf sperm that rams into Your mouth not your arse *laughs* Overall, having the “mystery” slapped onto Wikipedia makes me feel as if the show was less of a mystery and more of a lame story with silly aspects thrown in that clearly need tweaking.Regardless, there does seem to be a lack of tension in this show, because the characters truly feel like a bunch of simplistic Archetypes, they feel overall stale and don't develop at all in the duration of the show. It always seemed that all what they ever wanted was just to do there vengeance work and be done with it. The support cast who don't really take a larger role in this project are also pretty bland, like how the protagonists love interest was never given any depth or explanation and it all feels like she's a plot device character that the show kind of teases that there's a relationship going on here.The fan service is surprisingly quite taint in this one, rather its just some cat lady showing her big jugs off, and how she never wore any clothes yet they still covered the nipples, but whatever. The cast is forgettable anyway like the quiet girl, the angry guy- wait, in fact, most of the damn side cast are barely explored at all for You to even grasp the personality properly, like this supporting unit from the red clan just helping out as if he was just helping out or the big boobed secretary from the blue team who is just serious and has a crush on the leader. Overall, I was mostly appealed from their designs and the effort from each man hour for them to make up all of this fine art.The show also seems to create tension like how it tries to attempt to have one large over arching mystery that tries to make itslef look epic, but it all just felt like an excuse for a mystery aspect rather than making it legit. There were also episodes that were nothing but pure filler, and made itself look like a waste of time. Addressing the whole “German” aspect of the show, it does make it look flashier and more unique on paper, but it always seemed like another excuse for the writers to add some quirky detail that barely adds up to anything. Heck, they even called one of the plot device characters Adolf, as if it was a rule of cool.Side characters suck, story was badly handled and everyone just seemed to be a lame stoner. What else is there to say? All what I remember for the narrative was sperm wolfy here, and a few character quirks.Consequently, do I even remember anything else that redeemed good except for druggie visuals and music? The show has potential to be a decent mystery show with supernatural aspects, but it always seemed to me that mystery shows always seemed difficult to pull off, and by the way, what’s with the title guys? K? What You mean K meaning kittens? I don't really get the title here, and it just seemed there as a quirky marketing tool than anything particular.OBVIOUS FACT that the Animation does remind me of NGNL, with all the LSD visual jazz, but does it ever further emphasise the tone and atmosphere of the show? No. It felt like they simply chucked it in there for everyone to awe at. But its still damn great, and I really like the bonus points given for this mediocrity for having a lack of CGI fight scenes and just emphasise more of it on the backgrounds. Everything has such a fine gloss and shine to it, You see the effort and style GoHands put their man efforts into, and the character designs all feel well designed and thought out, sure I see lazy ones, yet most of the designs always had some fine charm added to them. Sure, it makes them far from ordinary people, but its damn high quality, so how would I care too much about that? The action scenes also have some pretty damn great choreography, though I admit that the Clan War episode does seem cheap by just using images, but I can imagine such a budget if they had to animate so many damn bodies.Sound still retains a fine use of all the mainstream instruments with company just flinging money at. The opening is one of my favourites, and it gets me really hyped to watch such a bad show, with those really beautiful visuals the choreography and even the visual effects! As someone who watched the dub, it wasn’t anything epic, it just felt like another Funimation dub so its just good. Except for that, there’s really not a great deal to say about visuals and music since all what I can say is for You to just look at some pretty visuals...LEGACY:What else is there to say? Seriously. The reason why this is a mediocrity was because of the visuals and music. Its a show that You just really need to shut that mind down, and just live in LSD... This show does seem be quite underrated to a certain extent, so its not going to be something that will really leave an impact.SCORES:3.5/10 – For useless cast.3.5/10 – Strangely forgettable and bad story.8/10 – LSD visuals are amazing.

But that doesn't necessarily make it bad. The last few episodes alone were enough to bump the story from a 5 or a 6 up to at least a 7 in my opinion. Predictable, sure - but still enjoyable.Art/Animation - 9.5/10Honestly, the art is beautiful, enough to really warrant watching this even if just for that reason. However heavy usage of distracting filters and noticeably reused animations keep this from getting a full 10 in my opinion.Sound - 9/10Not much to say about...this, the music was great if a tad less memorable than some - though the opening and ending themes are both excellent.Character - 7/10Many of the characters are very fleshed out and well developed, and many of them were able to evoke a lot of emotions from me (namely the main two characters.) However just as many seemed to fall flat. This anime just didn't seem to have enough time in its short 13 episode run to develop as many characters as it really seemed to try to. It left with more questions than answers for many of the characters that I get the feeling the audience was supposed to love. However, the main characters are very well fleshed out and Shiro will probably remain one of my favorite characters from any anime for a very long time.Enjoyment - 8/10This seems like an anime for which the enjoyment level will only go up upon each subsequent rewatch. Having only seen it once so far however, I would say I still enjoyed it quite a bit, even though it was a bit of a confusing ride. Definitely planning to rewatch.Overall - 8/10Worth a watch for sure.

Especially considering it's only 13 episodes (though I am definitely looking forward to the movie.)"", ""When I saw the letter K on the list of anime coming out this autumn 2012 season, I was curious. I'll be frank, the animation in the trailers are very appealing. Trailer being what they are, they do not tell you... What is K ? Forget the Shiny Animation and I'll try do to a review without falling in the path of the fan-boys/girls or the haters route.What is K ? K is an anime and a Manga. Both are fairly news and I had never heard of the Manga before the Anime came out. I do not really get the title of K....Why K ? It's not as simple as understanding why Naruto is called Naruto. The letter K does come out as the first letter of each episode's title and about the various themes you can find in the anime.The animation of this show is... beast. I'll admit it. I have nothing to say. Probably the best animation this season and year. It was very pretty. I'll also add that the soundtrack were top notch. The OP was decent and the ending... well, seeing a main character naked all the ED isn't really my thing and doesn't suit the show at all.1. STORY :: What the Hell is going on and where is this going ?In the universe of K, there's seven 'kings' given particular power. Soon enough we are introduced to the Blue King and the Red King but, later in the show, you will get to see more of them. The Kings give some of their Power to their clansmen and make their little 'team' and do their things with their clan. Homra (Red King) is similar to a Street Gang while Scepter 4 (Blue King) resemble more some kind of police... -ish. The Story begin with the Main Character, Shiro. While doing an errand, he is attacked by some people he doesn't know and learn (He sees a video of it) that he killed one of their clansman/friend. He doesn't remember any of this and try to find proof of his innocence... and/or fix this mess somehow.In itself, the story isn't that bad. Some part might feel similar to Durarara!! but, it's not such a bad thing. Personally, I liked the mysteries about this murder and this is what made me watch more of it at first as the mystery regarding this event would clear up little by little. Kings giving Power to their clansmen is something I had never come across before, it's pretty interesting and it is giving the feeling that we will come across some pretty nice fighting scene between different Kings and their Clans.However, the pacing end up being annoying very quickly. Usually, people would complain that the pacing of a show is too quick near the end. Rushed. In the case of K, it was the contrary. The First few episodes had a good pacing. Not too Fast. Not too Slow. Everything was slowing getting in place and then, it goes from 'Good' to 'FUCKING SLOW'. I watched episode where I'm pretty sure 50% of it was useless. This is mostly dude to this show trying to do so many thing at the same time but, I will get on this topic in a few. With all this slow pacing, sometimes, you really start to wonder where is this going anyway since this seems to be going no where at all. I wouldn't say the ending had no point. There was one. The Story itself was solved. The conflit started with the video of Shiro killing a member of Homra and THIS was solved at the end. Yes, it was. Linking the way it was solved or Hating it is up to you tho !2. CHARACTERS :: Who the Hell are those guys ?Exactly... Who are they ? This is one question that is left unanswer and this is also the reason why the story failed. What K tried to do tho, is giving up one main goal to achieve and then putting many character around it with different issues.... I'm one of those thinking something like:  the 'Story' is similar to a background. It is true in this particular case where the 'Story' is a pretext and you just thrown in a lot of characters and they will build your story. I believe this is where K failed. Yes, the 'Pretext' is solved but some many little 'Stories' making the big one were left unsolved. We were left with our Hunger. I feel like there was much more to solve.I can name a lot of characters I wished I had the chance to understand and know more. The only one we got the chance to understand a little was Shiro and it was sloppy. I think I understand and know what the fuck is Sasuke in Naruto doing more than Shiro! What the hell... ? I can tell right away this is wrong, ahah. The whole show, they gave screen time to Yata Misaki and Fushimi. They even gave screen time to flashback about them. I mean, they made me care for this duo of friend/foe but, nothing was solved after all. Yeah... Nothing. Can anyone explain to me the purpose of this last flashback in episode 13 ? Except for the Fangirls, tho. Still wondering.I didn't feel any 'affection' for any characters in this show at all. I had interest. I did. A lot. Characters dying ? Alright! Bring it on! ...since I don't really know them anyway. Who haven't seen Clannad and cried for Nagisa ? We knew Nagisa and Tomoya very well and liked them Otherwise, no tears would have been waste on it.3. ENJOYMENT :: Why should I care ?This is the most subjective part of anything. Enjoyment is subjective. I might like Roller coaster and maybe you don't. We all have different tastes and our enjoyment might be influence by things we like. The 'Why should I care' is personal to everyone. This part is pretty interesting when we're talking about K tho. This is the part where everyone goes :''K tries to be so many thing at the same time !''Do you like Ecchi ? Do you like Mysteries ? Do you like Moe ? Do you like Shounen ? Do you like Shonen-Ai ? Do you like Panties shot ? Do you like Boobs ?... Either way, whatever you like, you'll find it in K ! Isn't that cool ?... Not really. If I want to watch boobs, I'll watch Highschool DxD or whatever. Being too many things makes you get a lot more viewer probably. That might be true a first. If you liked Shonen-Ai, you enjoyed the Shiro blushing in first episode and enjoyed the Love/Hate relationship between many Red and Blue members. If you liked Moe, you enjoyed Anna being a cute all the time. If you liked Panties shot, you liked Kukuri. If you liked Mysteries, you liked the murder incident and trying to guess who really is Shiro, like myself. If you liked Shounen, you liked the fighting scene. If you liked Boobs, you liked Seri. There's no end to this !but if you liked Shounen, you were probably annoyed at the Love/Hate relationship. If you liked Shonen-Ai, I dunno but maybe the Panties and Boobs weren't that interesting. It works either way.I can't say I didn't enjoy K. Everything is part of the enjoyment and there was decent thing in K but nothing will make me remember K in a few months and this will probably become another anime in my List I don't even remember what it was about.Trying to be good at too many thing usually doesn't let you shine in one...

Others will describe it as an artistic masterpiece that constantly builds suspense.However, I\'ve noticed that most won\'t describe it for what it really is: intricate. In fact, I noticed that the story tends to fly over some people because of that intricacy. What starts off as a ""whodunit"" story takes off as a suspenseful action drama. The twists and turns are pretty nice and even shocking.K contains a well-written story. In the beginning, it strings you along with random events, seemingly...pointless. As things progress, the series even stops the fast-paced storyline to explain any plotholes they might have in the future.The rest of the series is hit after hit. The story picks up pace at a proper level and the characters start to show their true colors. You even fall in love with a character that wasn\'t even introduced into the story.To add to the story, the art is absolutely stunning. It\'s a spectacle when action hits. At times, you even see the foggy breathe of an exhale and it even looks good. Even if you don\'t agree with the story being good, the art could be enough to make you a regular viewer.The OST is just another spectacle. The series features a lot of original songs that are just seamless in sound. They don\'t come off as wrong and I\'ve even found myself listening to the songs out-of-context plenty of times.

As things progress, the series even stops the fast-paced storyline to explain any plotholes they might have in the future.The rest of the series is hit after hit. The story picks up pace at a proper level and the characters start to show their true colors. You even fall in love with a character that wasn\'t even introduced into the story.To add to the story, the art is absolutely stunning. It\'s a spectacle when action hits. At times, you even see the foggy breathe of an exhale and it even looks good. Even if you don\'t agree with the story being good, the art could be enough to make you a regular viewer.The OST is just another spectacle. The series features a lot of original songs that are just seamless in sound. They don\'t come off as wrong and I\'ve even found myself listening to the songs out-of-context plenty of times.

But the surprise here is that if one is to dropped this too early then he\'ll be missing a lot about this anime and it looks like director Suzuki Shingo made it that way which is a very good move. The art of this anime is somewhat too fancy at least for the blues and for the student of Ashinaka High School, now I like the way Seri Awashima was drawn she kinda fit as...this fighting bitch that every fighter would fantasize especially when it looks like that she\'s going commando. The character\'s on the other hand are a bit complex as well,  who would have think that both the colorless king and the silver king are in Yashiro Isana and Kuroh Yatogami whose power is far superior that the king\'s clansman but is unable to take out a king himself, there is this Neko chiquita who is aso called ""Strain"" if one can\'t follow up as to the development of this anime she\'ll be very confusing. You might say that the enjoyment in this anime has to do as to how the audience piece together the plot of this anime as well as the role of the character\'s. I would not advise this anime to someone whose perception is shallow.My rating for this anime\'s category:Story- Good 7Co\'z it  really depend as to how one pieces this anime together that counts.Art-Fair 6Co\'z for the most part everything about this anime\'s art was too fancy, but I can give credit for them HOMRA bros and for Seri\'s hotness.Characters- Fair 6Thought the characters did put up a good performance their role can be confusing.Enjoyment & Overall- Good 7Once one pieces together the contents of this anime one would feel a certain achievement in being about to get this anime, so if a season 2 does come around then it all good.No Blood, No Bone, No Ash.........................ARIBA!!!!! this fighting bitch that every fighter would fantasize especially when it looks like that she\'s going commando.

But like eating too much halloween candy you end up watching it all anyway.The problem with K is the lousy way the story was told. K could easily have been done better, so what attracts the viewer to K is the fanservice.  Neko the cat girl, the flashy fight scenes and the high production values for art and animation tend to be the main attraction in K.  It's pure superficial style but that superficial style is...pretty good when it happens.Normally I would give K a 6 but it gets bumped to 7 just because the last episodes pull everything together so well.  What ended up being mostly a mediocre anime with an annoying main character and awesome side characters is salvaged by the last few episodes.  A lot of plot threads all happen to be revealed and then get solved in quick succession like they are coming out of a machine gun towards the last third.If the story behind K was told better the anime could have been something really great, after watching the last episodes you'll be left neither satisfied or dissatisfied. pretty good when it happens.Normally I would give K a 6 but it gets bumped to 7 just because the last episodes pull everything together so well.

The opening/ending and OSTs were nice enough and helped carry the mood of the anime, but I wouldn\'t listen to them as stand-alone music. The plot was interesting and enjoyable enough, but again, did not exactly stand out. Etc., etc. Basically, it was a fun enough ride to not consider a waste of time. I\'m just not going to fondly regard it as a masterpiece anytime soon.On to the stuff I liked. I liked the...idea of the country basically being run by different factions that are ruled by superpowered ""Kings"". It was a concept I\'d like to have seen more of, honestly. Some of the characters were also very fun to watch, especially with how our main character didn\'t project the same aura of blandness that a lot of other shounen protagonists emanate like crazy. I like the secrecy of his character, his friendly charisma and willingness to glibly lie out of situations. It\'s charming, in a way.The saving grace for me was the relationships and interactions between characters. Seeing the devotion some of the characters have towards other characters can be pretty heart-wrenching.I didn\'t particularly dislike any particular aspect of this anime; I\'d just find it a little lacking in intrigue.All in all, I gave it a 6/10.

I never really felt lost or confused and honestly liked all the characters for the most part except Yata (I will admit he's kinda cool tho). While the anime didn't answer almost any questions, it felt complete and i enjoyed it for what it was. I never got too attached to any of the characters which for me makes it an 8. I never got emotionally invested in this anime, it was just an enjoyable, problem free, watch.idk if art style is the right term here since, to me, they...just increased saturation and contrast a whole bunch. The art style looked like any other anime (maybe except the Swords and fight scenes) but otherwise why did it need to be so vibrant?

First off though i\'ll talk about some of the good things. Now don\'t get me wrong, K is not a bad show...it has potential, it just fails to execute its story properly and falls pretty flat. However, the animation itself is incredible. The directing is very good as well, the show uses nice shots and angles, and the view point sometimes has a green or blue hue to the shot,...so it gives the show a unique look. The  aesthetic of the semi futuristic Japan is very nice, and everything from buildings to alleyways have great detail and design. The character designs for the most part are pretty good as well. The show also features a fantastic soundtrack, while i\'m not too crazy for the Intro and outro, the score fits the tone of the show very well and all the songs are beautiful. Sadly though that\'s all the praise I can give K. The show starts off and three episodes in neither me or my friend (who dropped the show after 5 episodes) knew what was going on. Nothing is explained to you or implied anywhere so you\'re sitting there watching all this random shit happen without an understanding of the world they\'re in or what they\'re doing. Thankfully things become clear later on, however there are still some things that left me confused. If it weren\'t for the last two or three episodes I would have given the show a 4/10. Out of a large ensemble of characters there are maybe five max that are likeable, and I only started caring for the protagonist on the second to last episode which says something. Throughout the show you don\'t know what\'s going on so you can\'t appreciate any of the fights or the character interaction. And sometimes the show was just flat out boring, aside from episode 6 the middle episodes felt very slow and uneventful. Though the show is very flawed it still has potential. Somewhat likeable characters and an interesting premise with some good episodes near the end of the run I won\'t rule out watching season 2.

It was a bit of a disappointment though I did enjoy it.Story~ 6The story has good ideas and used them a bit ,some are fleahed out, most arent ,and a few arent explained well.Episodes 6 to 8 are plot stuffing due to this anime at the time of writing this 13 episodes.There is a second season that is going to air in the fall and I hope they fix this issue because it is what made me put it on hold and I would of dropped it...if I didnt buy the complete set which Im glad I did because the episodes 9 to 13 are great and my favorites because explanations were being explained at a good pace,everyone in the cast is gathering,and the ending is one of my favorites. Why couldn't we get more episodes like that,I would love it more if K had those episodes. The beginning of the show was fun to watch too seeing the main 3 (Isana,Kurou,and Neko) interact and trying to figure out the mystery at hand. But there are a ton of issues. There are plot holes,fleshing out elements of there world,at times dragged out dialogue (episode 7 was the biggest offender of dragged out dialogue) ,and just not enough time for the story. But that doesn't mean it wasn't fun or did some explanation. But this had potential to be something and while it was it wasnt what I expected to be. But I did enjoy it.Characters ~6.5The first three characters who are Isana,Kurou,and Neko are great. They have a great bond,personalities,develop nicely(mainly Kuroh) ,and balance each other. The rest I have some gripes with. Mikoto dosent get enough screen time ,hell most of the characters in Homra as I recall dont get too much expect for Yata to an extant.Then almost everyone in Scepter 4 is either bland,very jerky,or both minus  Seri.Development is far and inbetween with most of the cast. Are main 3 at least dose get development and bits and pieces for some side though its not alot. The saving grace for the cast is relationships,there bonds feel strong and with emotions. Im glad they had this because a cast needs these and this made me enjoy the show a bit more. Overall while most of cast is decent minus the main 3 cast there is plenty of gripes I have with them.Art and animation~ 10The animation is beautiful and consistent,some of the best Ive seen. Facial expressions are noticeable,characters designs are crisp,back grounds look greatly,and the color palette looks really good. Overall ,its one of the better things in the show.Sound ~7The soundtrack overall was good. It dose have some noticeable songs and are good to listen to with or without the show. Op and ed are nicely done and are on my favorites list. Though are some meh tracks and a couple songs I dont think fit the show but overall it is a nice soundtrack.Overall ~7/10Despite ups and downs it is a good show.

It just did not live to my expectations - maybe it was set too high, maybe not - but in the end, I just couldn\'t enjoy this anime.Art = 10: I love the art style of this anime, especially in the beginning - the colours and animation was so vibrant. The quality dropped a little bit later on but it was still so good. I really enjoyed the use of pastel like colours in a utopian future, a start difference from others (like PSYCHO PASS).Sound = 8: I love the use of...jazz in this anime, and the music choices were subtle and compliments the art style. The only reason I didn\'t give it a 10 is because it didn\'t have the ""OOMPH"" factor and maybe it could\'ve been better used at some of the scenes.Characters = 6: I liked most of the characters except for the protagonist, but maybe I\'m biased against weak, aloof type protagonist - he was too airy for my taste. My main critique though is that this anime had, what I like to call, the ""Bleach Syndrome"" (too much characters, not enough character development). Kudos on the Red King though, even though this guy barely spoke, he had the most character and depth in comparison to the rest.Story = 4: I think the story broke this anime for me. It had so much potential yet it chose a somewhat safe and generic route, I had this anime totally figured out by the 3rd episode. The pacing was all wonky, it felt like they tried to squish in a 24 episode anime into 13. There was no tension in the story, no sense of urgency - not because I thought the protagonist could handle anything thrown at it - more so that there was some sort of deus ex machina element in place (which there was) and the way the story was being told.Overall, once I saw the last episode - there was a bitter feeling in my mouth. Even though I saw the last episode, I tuned out of this anime a long time ago - I stayed to watch because maybe in the end, I was going to get blown away but I wasn\'t. It sucked me in with the first episode but the drawn out pacing and inconsistent elements placed in the anime really took me out of the immersion and the enjoyment of this anime.P.S: I\'m still going to watch season 2 just to see if they don\'t royally mess up that one. jazz in this anime, and the music choices were subtle and compliments the art style.

The creators seem to make no effort as to explain the  origin of the powers, the style of battle, and the idea behind these so called kings. The first episode give of a serious mood to the story which was well done, but every episode after that is some casual school events. the main character seems gay and all the other characters in the anime act very casual, with the exception of some character with mental issues. If you care more about the art rather than...story then this is a good anime to watch. If you care more about the story then it will be a waste of time to watch every single episode. story then this is a good anime to watch. If you care more about the story then it will be a waste of time to watch every single episode."", 'When it comes to most media in today’s world, the “rule of cool” is often used in either movies, TV, music, books or especially animation. In this special case, anime can have the rule of cool (for instance, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo), that is, if the show is rightfully done where you can recommend it to every one you know, but you can’t make that your only priority or as most people would just call it something that tried and failed, even if you got high production values.Yashiro Isana has lived a relatively ordinary, simple life. He lives in the technologically-advanced Shizume City and attends...Ashinaka High School, a notable high school that is located on an island just outside the areas. Yashiro is friendly with everyone. Nothing ever seems wrong about him, except perhaps his habit of forgetting where his school-issued PDA is. However, nothing normal has been happening since the recent murder of Tatara Totsuka, prominent member of the infamous HOMRA. No one knows who exactly killed him but the man responsible bears an uncanny, identical appearance to Yashiro. Seeking vengeance, the Red Clansmen of HOMRA set out to get Yashiro and kill him. Everyone suspects that Yashiro is the murderer. Isana Yashiro was not the person who killed Tatara Totsuka but yet another mysterious character is pulling the strings behind the curtains, a person which is quite dangerous and powerful.Yeah, I have never been so confused about reviewing an anime, especially one that has a very simple storyline of a high school kid being accused of murdering a well-known clansman from a very dangerous group and for the time being, I actually did like the plotline and I felt like it didn’t feel rushed during that plotline. I didn’t feel like they completely went too quick with that, but I feel like they went too quick about most of the kingdoms and their characters. I felt like we could’ve gotten more stories from the HOMRA group, as most of those characters and their stories did seem interesting, but that phase didn’t last. Scepter 4, I can say less about because it’s mostly 3 members of the group that are more prominent (the others are just members no one gives a shit about) and there’s the fact that one was a former member of HOMRA and has a rivalry with another HOMRA member. I think the biggest problem about the plotline is that there wasn’t enough episodes to fill most info on these characters. Maybe the light novels and manga did that better, but it still doesn’t mean it left me underwhelming.Characters for the most part, I’m at 50/50 on them.Let’s start with Shiro, Kuroh, and Neko: Shiro is our main protagonist and he is a trickster for the most part as the show starts and I did felt a little progression when it came to him solving the crime of being framed for murder and he didn’t really get on my nerves. Kuro is the atypical stoic badass with a sword and while most people thought of him as his credibility as one with weaken once he joins Kuro and Neko, to me, he was more of a better character. Yeah, I like my stoic badasses now and then but at least, he does get comedic at a few times and it may seem like breaking character to you, but it’s more of having a personality to me. Neko…..is honestly annoying the whole time, basically she’s very devoted to Shiro and is mostly there for the fan service otaku crowd as she’s a catgirl….not a girl dressed as a cat, a cat that can change into a girl….did I mention she has huge breasts? *gets a slap from random female* Ow.The HOMRA group is basically some gang archetype characters with some uniqueness in them. Mikoto Suoh aka The Red King is the tough and most powerful leader of the group; Izumo Kusanagi is the one member that keeps everything under control and the level-headed one. Misaka Yata is the passionate, very violent and headstrong member of the team, especially when he really wants to hunt down whoever killed Tatara Totsuka (one of the first members of HOMRA and also the weakest); Rikio Kamamoto as in the blonde-haired guy who wears sunglasses and eats…; and there’s Anna Kushina, the youngest and only female member of the gang…because badasses needs a loli on his side.Then the Scepter 4 group, as I said, has only 3 members that are more prominent than the rest. Reisi Munakata aka The Blue King is the calm yet elegant character, the polar opposite of The Red King and wants to keep things in order. Seri Awashima is (of course) the lone female member of the group, nicknamed The Heartless Woman (or “Tundra Woman” in the Japanese version) and….well, that’s it. She’s the second-in-command and I found nothing that interesting about her, except that she loves red bean paste so much. However, Saruhiko Fushimi is probably more interesting to me as he was a former member of HOMRA and has a long rivalry with Yata since he left there and he basically didn’t give a shit about leaving them, calling them a childish gang of thugs and gangsters but he seemed more of a regretting asshole of a character throughout.I could mention the other characters like some of the classmates (Kukuri Yukizome, Shiro’s friend) but they aren’t really that of much importance in the plot, so I’m going to move on.The animation is quite the visual and shows a lot of their high production value and the art does look gorgeous. The studio behind this is GoHands, and they are relatively a newer studio as the only well-known works I know from them are the Mardock Scramble movies and as of recently, Coppelion, and while it looks beautiful, I wish they tone down some of the blue filter they got. I admit blue is my favorite color (hell, my nickname or my updated nickname is Blue Hybrid) but sometimes it can be irritating at a few times and that also goes to their future projects (i.e. Coppelion).As for the music, this is one of those times where I like more of the score then the opening and ending themes as they really didn’t feel like they belong in the show. I would say the ending theme to the last episode fits better and this is nothing against the opening theme “KINGS” by Angela as I did like that song, it’s just should’ve been used in a different anime. Now the score does have some appeal as when the first episode began, I was really immersed into the music, preferably to the themes of Mikoto, Yata, and Reisi.Now for the English dub, which aired on Neon Alley, brought to you by Studiopolis and Viz Media and this is much an all-star cast, despite the show being a non-union dub, and for the most part it is pretty standard in being a good dub. This year, Matthew Mercer still continues to impress me as a voice actor with stuff like Fate/Zero even with schlock with Iron Man: Rise of Technovore, his role as Kuroh was great. Ben Diskin, a voice actor who I first recognize watching Codename: Kids Next Door, has gotten good range over the years and him as Yata is acceptable but the one VA that I really thought was excellent is Todd Haberkorn as Izumo. That smoothness and calm demeanor in his voice made me not even notice he was in the anime and honestly, that move to L.A. has helped in get more diverse roles (with some exception). As for the others, Sam Riegel as Shiro was okay, Patrick Seitz as Reisi is plenty good, Johnny Yong Bosch as Fushimi is what I expected from him. Tara Platt, Carrie Savage, Grant George are well-acted and last while I do not like Neko as a character, I had no problem with Stephanie Sheh voicing her but I will say if I had to choose between her as Kuro in Blue Exorcist or Neko in K, I choose the former.FINAL VERDICT: So did I like K? Well, I do to an extent but it’s not exactly I would recommend to most people. Some people may have gotten confused over the entire run and some did get it from the get-go. I’m the in-between guy where I get most of the plot but somehow miss something in the leeway that requires a rewatch (which I did do a few times) and I don’t do that often when reviewing anime. So with K, it’s in the middle of the road for me. Ashinaka High School, a notable high school that is located on an island just outside the areas. Yashiro is friendly with everyone.

I felt like we could’ve gotten more stories from the HOMRA group, as most of those characters and their stories did seem interesting, but that phase didn’t last. Scepter 4, I can say less about because it’s mostly 3 members of the group that are more prominent (the others are just members no one gives a shit about) and there’s the fact that one was a former member of HOMRA and has a rivalry with another HOMRA member. I think the biggest problem about the plotline is that there wasn’t enough episodes to fill most info on these characters. Maybe the light novels and manga did that better, but it still doesn’t mean it left me underwhelming.Characters for the most part, I’m at 50/50 on them.Let’s start with Shiro, Kuroh, and Neko: Shiro is our main protagonist and he is a trickster for the most part as the show starts and I did felt a little progression when it came to him solving the crime of being framed for murder and he didn’t really get on my nerves. Kuro is the atypical stoic badass with a sword and while most people thought of him as his credibility as one with weaken once he joins Kuro and Neko, to me, he was more of a better character. Yeah, I like my stoic badasses now and then but at least, he does get comedic at a few times and it may seem like breaking character to you, but it’s more of having a personality to me. Neko…..is honestly annoying the whole time, basically she’s very devoted to Shiro and is mostly there for the fan service otaku crowd as she’s a catgirl….not a girl dressed as a cat, a cat that can change into a girl….did I mention she has huge breasts? *gets a slap from random female* Ow.The HOMRA group is basically some gang archetype characters with some uniqueness in them. Mikoto Suoh aka The Red King is the tough and most powerful leader of the group; Izumo Kusanagi is the one member that keeps everything under control and the level-headed one. Misaka Yata is the passionate, very violent and headstrong member of the team, especially when he really wants to hunt down whoever killed Tatara Totsuka (one of the first members of HOMRA and also the weakest); Rikio Kamamoto as in the blonde-haired guy who wears sunglasses and eats…; and there’s Anna Kushina, the youngest and only female member of the gang…because badasses needs a loli on his side.Then the Scepter 4 group, as I said, has only 3 members that are more prominent than the rest. Reisi Munakata aka The Blue King is the calm yet elegant character, the polar opposite of The Red King and wants to keep things in order. Seri Awashima is (of course) the lone female member of the group, nicknamed The Heartless Woman (or “Tundra Woman” in the Japanese version) and….well, that’s it. She’s the second-in-command and I found nothing that interesting about her, except that she loves red bean paste so much. However, Saruhiko Fushimi is probably more interesting to me as he was a former member of HOMRA and has a long rivalry with Yata since he left there and he basically didn’t give a shit about leaving them, calling them a childish gang of thugs and gangsters but he seemed more of a regretting asshole of a character throughout.I could mention the other characters like some of the classmates (Kukuri Yukizome, Shiro’s friend) but they aren’t really that of much importance in the plot, so I’m going to move on.The animation is quite the visual and shows a lot of their high production value and the art does look gorgeous. The studio behind this is GoHands, and they are relatively a newer studio as the only well-known works I know from them are the Mardock Scramble movies and as of recently, Coppelion, and while it looks beautiful, I wish they tone down some of the blue filter they got. I admit blue is my favorite color (hell, my nickname or my updated nickname is Blue Hybrid) but sometimes it can be irritating at a few times and that also goes to their future projects (i.e. Coppelion).As for the music, this is one of those times where I like more of the score then the opening and ending themes as they really didn’t feel like they belong in the show. I would say the ending theme to the last episode fits better and this is nothing against the opening theme “KINGS” by Angela as I did like that song, it’s just should’ve been used in a different anime. Now the score does have some appeal as when the first episode began, I was really immersed into the music, preferably to the themes of Mikoto, Yata, and Reisi.Now for the English dub, which aired on Neon Alley, brought to you by Studiopolis and Viz Media and this is much an all-star cast, despite the show being a non-union dub, and for the most part it is pretty standard in being a good dub. This year, Matthew Mercer still continues to impress me as a voice actor with stuff like Fate/Zero even with schlock with Iron Man: Rise of Technovore, his role as Kuroh was great. Ben Diskin, a voice actor who I first recognize watching Codename: Kids Next Door, has gotten good range over the years and him as Yata is acceptable but the one VA that I really thought was excellent is Todd Haberkorn as Izumo. That smoothness and calm demeanor in his voice made me not even notice he was in the anime and honestly, that move to L.A. has helped in get more diverse roles (with some exception). As for the others, Sam Riegel as Shiro was okay, Patrick Seitz as Reisi is plenty good, Johnny Yong Bosch as Fushimi is what I expected from him. Tara Platt, Carrie Savage, Grant George are well-acted and last while I do not like Neko as a character, I had no problem with Stephanie Sheh voicing her but I will say if I had to choose between her as Kuro in Blue Exorcist or Neko in K, I choose the former.FINAL VERDICT: So did I like K? Well, I do to an extent but it’s not exactly I would recommend to most people. Some people may have gotten confused over the entire run and some did get it from the get-go. I’m the in-between guy where I get most of the plot but somehow miss something in the leeway that requires a rewatch (which I did do a few times) and I don’t do that often when reviewing anime. So with K, it’s in the middle of the road for me.', ""The best way for me to describe the anime called K is exceptionally unexceptional. It begins in a fascinating and intriguing way, but it really does not lead to anything the audience has not already seen a hundred times before. Amnesia? Check. Moe-girl(s)? Check. Supernatural Abilities? Check. I guess the best parts about K are the score and the animation itself. The movement of the characters is always smooth and crisp. Watching K with 1080P resolution is a real joy. It is just a real shame the story and characters themselves are dull and lack any real luster.What I liked about K is its...boldness. It tries very hard and excels at looking cool. The characters fighting each other, the flames, smoke, and effects are all very nice to look at. I can really appreciate the time it took to animate this series. Most, if not all, of the characters talk in a over dramatic voice, you that deep, raspy voice? Yeah. That one. It does feature some pretty funny moments featuring the character called “Neko”, but they are few and do not make K a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. The best part of the story is the history lesson we are given half way through the series. So that should be somewhat telling.What I did not like about K is the plot. It is slow, like molasses slow. Even though K is thirteen episodes long, everything seemed to take forever to happen. A lot of talking happened, with little to no forward movement. Maybe others will disagree with me on this point, but to me, there were whole episodes where nothing dramatic happened. For a thirteen run series, that just cannot be allowed to happen. A lot of the story centers around the Shiro-kun. A young lad suffering from amnesia. Who is he? What has he done? Can he prove his innocence? Kind of stuff. The story is also heavily centered around people with supernatural abilities, but the reason for why exactly they have the abilities is never given. May be this will be explained better in the second series (gulp), but if they only produced this one, then the audience would just be left with their own conjecture, and that is not good.Who is K for? I suppose any one who enjoys watching the new stuff, like me. It also should appeal to those who like light fantasy to mid-weight fantasy in their anime. Although I suspect that the second series will be much heavier on the the fantastical elements. It is a lighthearted anime that is dressed up to look like some kind of heavy, high concept epic. But really, all you have is a child dressed in his dad's tuxedo. All the flash, but none of the cash.

One would think the characters were atually actors and the visuals during the battles were outstanding.Characers:In my opinion the main disadvantage of this anime is that the main protagonist Yashiro is not a cool guy at all. He often drifts away with his mind and up the time he changes into the silver king he is somewhat gay. On the contrary the blue and the red king as well as some of their subordinates are completed characters that anyone would like and the fact that on the second half of the series they become more main characters improves the character domain of the anime.Enjoyment:The enjoyment was pretty good because i liked the battles and the schemes in order to capture Yashiro.The end was also very strong,sentimentally, and dramatic.Considering the points above I would give the overall score of 7 to this anime.

""K"" only show us a tiny amount of information about the kings or their BG, but instead of the plot, there have a lot of fan services and normal random crap. Like Neko the cat, she have big boobs and a kinda interesting personality, but however, we don\'t know...why she turn into a human from a cat... so many mystery things in this anime.

Lets review it...(Story)Okay so K started out really well the first episode was amazing.. ""serious fangirl candy""  Hot bishies, Action, talking trash cans, and a cat girl... All the trimmings for a hit anime.. (if you ask me).. but it soon was obvious this anime was going to take its sweet time going.... (anywhere) .. Some eps just felt like fillers.. And were all over the place. It took a true anime fan to decode the storyline.. There were just so many charcters to keep up with.. But the story toward the last 4 eps redeemed...its self in my eyes and if anything made a decent plot.. so I give it a 7/10... Im being generous by the way(Art)Well damn thats were 3/4 the budget went so its was impressive.. Some of the scences like when mikoto powered up looked the same as previous eps.. But Ill over look that and give it a 8/10.(Sound)Well im into the jazzy music they randomnly play.. It seem kinda like a tom and jerry type thing everynow and then but oh well, the seiyuus were amazing though especiall Kukuris...  God that girl has range.. so a 8/10 there as well..(Character)Well the show didnt have time to go indepth with any of the charcters really so they came off a lil generic... but still loveable... So a 7/10(Enjoyment)Im the type that can appreciate something for what it is and what it isnt... I mean.. Alot of people put alot of high expectations in this series.. They thought is was going to be the best thing since sliced bread... But like most expectations they fall short.. As for me i set the bar very low.. Im talking (sands of destructions low)  So i wasnt dissappointed and could enjoy the talking cat girl randomnly doing crap and wasting episode time... And didnt care that the story line was all over the place...(Overall)Well i enjoyed it i like the whole 7 kings concept.. Its pretty interesting.. Just needed more episodes.. more time to explain things an go into back stories.. The powers.. the people the art all amazing .. But its kinda annoying that the kill off main characters.. so I was just Like Wtf.. at the end... I took a nap after i watched it then rewatched it... And it had the same ending so.. I guess there going with that.. so i assume there living it at a perpetual cliff hanger to have alot of view for season two.. Which is confirmed.. Through the slow but interesting plot.. randomn, scences hints at BL only to be proven untrue the next ep.. I kinda liked the anime and will buy it once it comes to the states.. so Go ahead.. Watch it..if you dont.. you missed something worth the time put in...  7/10 its self in my eyes and if anything made a decent plot.. so I give it a 7/10...

Not so. K is crunched into a short timeframe, cutting character development and cohesion, which are vital to a series\' success. What transpires as the series ""progresses"" often leaves you lost, wondering why, how, and where certain repercussions came from.Gaping plot holes and unanswered question remain. With the fanservice, unnecessarily long conversations, and filler-like material eating up precious airtime, I found that...none my questions and speculations--basic ones, at that--were ever addressed. Rather than waste time on fanservice, the directors could\'ve focused on lacing the fundamental ideas within the series.K had a lot going for it-- a cool plot, lots of characters, shipping material, friendships across enemy lines (for the most part), more. All it needed was more time within the story and more episodes.Characters 5/10It could go either way here.

Then you\'ve got the HOMRA thugs and the meddlers of Scepter 4. All in all: they\'re generic on the surface, yes.But upon closer inspection, the characters have certain habits that are left to interpretation. For example, Munakata, the upstanding, righteous, loner-type Blue King--who shamelessly invades personal space and delivers unnecessarily hard beatings to those weaker than him. Not exactly something you\'d expect from another character who also fits the dutiful leader archetype. Another example, Misaki, a foul mouthed, hot blooded ruthless young man who we see struggle with girls, and, more surprisingly, in tears numerous times.

Like I said, regarding their personalities, it could go either way.Regarding character development, which lowers my opinion of the series-- what character development?

No character has a chance to learn and understand in those few days during which the story takes place.

Why? Because I think after reading the other reviews, people won't even watch K, which would be a shame.Let's start with the things I agree with, which is, actually, just one thing: the story. I will admit that the story is not really good and a bit rushed, but it's easy to follow and it IS a story, not like in other animes in which you can sometimes find 9 episodes without the story even mentioned.

But it WAS good.Despite us not getting that much information (as I said, looking forward to the second season) I really liked the characters. I also think the interactions between the characters were good. Not that it is of any interest, but I want to say that Yata is my favorite character.

Strictly I would give it 9.3 ....In 1 word I would say this show is 'PERFECT' in every aspect ( that I want )See Guys You must have been hearing that the Plot is not good but that is totally wrong the plot is Great and thrilling . Art is super and I bet u know that already .Music is Kewl and Characters and Animation is Perfect .The story is a little bit rushy  but that make it even more Great .In this 13 episodes you can enjoy to the fullest .The point is that a 26 + episode anime is expected to be great.so If the story is rushing there is NO PROBLEM at all , it will just make the show thrilling .I watched this Season in 1 goSo the Story is complex and that makes it even more great . A guy is suspected by a gang to be the killer of their team member and the guy don't know about it . So he tries to know about the situation .It have a great Action and great sound .A little spoiler summaryThere is gang called HOMRA and they have a loving clansmen who was just killed by a high school kid . In this anime it is told that there a king who rule the country , like red king , blue king etc . That high school kid claims to be colorless kid in the video { a video was made by the clansmen in which he died} . then by a accident he loses his memory . The clansmen of the previous colorless king came and tries to find about the realty , he should kill or follow his in basis of is he good or bad . this story runs pretty smoothly and different secrets unfolds . this is just a main plot , on the other hand there is continuous fights between red king clansmen and blue king clansmen.

Obviously it stands for ""Kool"" because that is what K is in a nutshell. Cool characters doing cool things in a cool way.K has a rather interesting premise where gang leaders called Kings, maybe that\'s why its called K. Anyway, Kings dominate majority of the city and each King is represented by a color, red, blue, yellow, green, silver, etc. And then there is one special King called the Colorless Kings that is shrouded in mystery. Our main character Yashiro ends up getting caught in the midst of the gang war because he was framed for something he didn\'t...do. Kuroh, the Black Hound and with the intent on killing him, ends up being his saving grace and ally on resolving the conflict.The story itself had so much potential and the world was really interesting. But many of the ideas were never explored, such as how do Kings get their power, what relationships did some of the Kings have, and why was Yashiro so gosh darn beautiful. Just kidding, but in all seriousness, the story becomes really confusing and you might need to pause in order to actually grasp what is going on. The characters are, like I said, Cool. The majority had some depth to them and are really entertaining to watch, especially Misaki, a skater who belongs to the red gang, who I doubt anyone will hate since he basically summarizes the entirety of this show. Cool, short, fast, charming, and most importantly COOL!!!The animation had a really interesting touch. A lot of the art looked really shiny and the action was really intense and well done. The soundtrack, ironically enough, isn\'t just rap or hip-hop, but mostly orchestral music. The OP would always get me pumped up for the show as it show cases all the characters doing their cool thing, while the ED closed each episode on a rather low note.All in all, K is a real blast to watch. It is just cool, nothing more, nothing less. If you want a good anime with cool action and cool characters look no further because K fits the bill. Besides that K doesn\'t really offer anything else besides entertainment material. do.

I found ""K"" very extremely enjoyable and can\'t really say a bad word about it. It\'s such a hilarious and amazing mix of any possible genre, scheme, and theme, that you just have to laugh at it. No-one can possibly take this anime seriously, and I doubt its producers did. It contains everything: a whole spectre of personalities, bishounens, cat-girls, Lolita-girls, beautiful, well equipped and deadly intelligent women, samurai with their swords, Japanese art and culture, advanced technology, school-life, gangs and organizations struggles, superpowers, even immortals - and in just...13 episodes! Against that all, I daresay, the plot itself is of a lesser importance.Technically, it\'s a very good anime, with fine soundtrack and superb art/animation. I also found seiyuu did a great work - especially Mamoru Miyano, whom I normally don\'t admire, but generally I felt really positive about most of the cast. (To tell the truth, I decided to watch ""K"" only because of seiyuu ^^) I\'m definitely going to watch the movie, as well as the second season! 13 episodes!

The thing i enjoyed the most in the anime was the music.A good anime for me would atleast have something you would look forward to, which this anime actually lacked, the main character build-up was too slow for my taste.i would not recommend this anime.If you have nothing to do and have time to waste then i still wouldn't watch this, but it's up to you, maybe you will like it maybe you won't, this is just my thoughts on the...anime. anime."", 'Well, from what I\'ve seen so far, K has gotten some really low scores. I watched K a long time ago but I\'m shy on writing reviews, but I won\'t let such a great anime be slandered. Now, this may be just my opinion but the complains of ""bad character development"" or ""not original story line"", in my mind, is propaganda.Put simply, what I dislike about negative reviews is that if people just take those negatives reviews, they could miss out on a great series, in this case, K.Story: 9Obviously, it\'s not the worlds number one most original story, but it\'s not close to...unoriginal. I can\'t think of many anime who\'s story is similar to K\'s.Art: 178268469491If I could give awards to some of the best artwork and animation, I could tell you right now, one of those would go to K. The animation is just, gorgeous. It\'s astounding, really. It adds so much to the plot and it makes it all the more intriguing.Sound: 10Now, the opening isn\'t one of my favorites, but it does fit perfectly. The music they use adds to the mood of the scenes, and makes it all the more intense. The soundtrack is perfect for this show.Character: 10i think the character development is great, honestly. Mind you, it\'s a thirteen episode series, so in the room there was for development, it fit it quite well. The characters are what made me love the show, they are the core. I loved every single one of the characters so so so so much, and I had SOO MANY SHIPS AND JUST LIKE, K. (sucky pun intended.) Anyway, I don\'t think I dislike one character since they played there roles so well. I have a few favorites, but my overall love for all of them is crazy. Their background stories, their current personalities, is all so great.Enjoyment: 10I binge watched K, and I don\'t regret a single moment of it. It was all totally worth it. There was moments where I was at the edge of my bed and moments when I wanted to scream my lungs out. I enjoyed it so so much.Overall: 10000000Obviously, K has it\'s flaws, every anime does, but I didn\'t think they were big enough to rate this anime any less than a masterpiece. Now, I cannot promise you that you will love this anime as much as I did, but what I can tell you is, don\'t overlook this series when it could turn out to be one of your favorites. As they say, ""Don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover.""(I WAS TRYING SO HARD TO MAKE THIS REVIEW MATURE OKAY, I WAS HOLDING BACK ON TYPING IN CAPS AND BREAKING MY NUMBERS FOR THE RATING BUT I JUST LOVED THIS SERIES SO MUCH OKAY BU- ""eh hem"" *clears throat* please take my review, every other positive review, & K into consideration, thank you very much.

In my surprised, it didn\'t become boring perhaps it was very good. The OP and ED were amusing and well done too. I regretted that I didn\'t watch this before but its okay. So here is my review to the season 1 itself only, I won\'t include the season 2 because I have a different impression on that one or should I say, I have a higher...impression in that one.Story 10: At first, I was very confused because a lot of events happened but when I continued watching, I understand the flow of events. The flow of events were well-executed and the plot was amazing. This anime made me crazy because I was really thinking of who is the real antagonist. As an anime enthusiast, I always anticipating the next event or sometimes the plot however, in this one, I always wrong with my prediction. A lot of plot twist and you will be saying "" What the hell happened?"" and "" I really didn\'t expect that"". Also, a lot of friendship here and action. I really like the fighting scenes and the chronology of events is also well-done. So, to summarize it all, the story is really great.Art and Sound 10: The art and graphics in this anime is too good. I am not fun of OP and ED but I will give an exception here because I really like it.Characters 10: All characters are well developed.So, this anime is very good and one of my favorite. impression in that one.Story 10: At first, I was very confused because a lot of events happened but when I continued watching, I understand the flow of events.

This anime unfortunately does not keep up the good pace it has started with until the end. As what others have said, this anime had too little time to do too many things. It was very underdeveloped. Contrary to what I've just said, this anime got a hold of me and I never once thought to...drop it. It's very inconsistent, but if you stick for 6-7 episodes, you definitely won't regret it. If you watch it with ease and not much seriousness, you adore this series.Art: 8/10. The art is lovely but I still believe it could've been better. It is flashy and I think it is meant to be flashy, but sometimes more is less. It lacks a little in detail too.Sound: 9/10. The sound tracks are all beautiful. Good voice acting too, but some actors were not able to pull out the best in the characters.Character: 6/10. Some characters will be interesting and will appear to be likable, but because of their underdevelopment the series will seem very crude and mediocre. A lot of them had a lot of potential but were never taken care of.Enjoyment: 8/10.  Although this has been a 'wild card' type of series for me, it was very enjoyable. Without much seriousness, this anime will be easy like a breeze. You might finish the anime in one day.  It has somehow kept me from dropping it---the show was again inconsistent, but it was good enough.Overall: 7/10. K Project is an anime series that could've been so big like the other animes. It had huge potential but it was never taken care of. It will provide eyecandy and it will be definitely an easy watch. Underdevelopment and some plotholes will show, but how some characters portray emotions, and things like friendship, honesty and camaraderie are present too. It wasn't totally cliche, in fact it had twists enough for you to be enjoying yourself in.K Project was undoubtedly, a very bumpy ride, but I guess I didn't mind after all, and I hope you won't too. drop it.

To me, K is an anime experience highly dependent on how you precieve it.K, a mystery/superpowers anime that revolves around the death of a ceratin person. As the anime progresses, the mysterious murder starts to unfold its' secrets while more information gets revelaed about the world of K, of its' kings and of a history long forgotten.To me, K was more of a ''short novel''. It is too short to tell you about its' world, but does a good job at telling you an...enjoyable short story that would motitivate you to learn about its' world in the future. The art and voice are both high quality and fancy to say the least. The story is also enjoyable and well-written.If there is anything to be desired, it is more complexity.. more answers. The anime ended without giving away too much. However is it only was 13 episodes, I saw it as a mere short story about a certain mystery murder case, a short story that tells you about its' world as 2nd priority, therefore leaving character progression/world develpoment behind as they could be considered a bit lackluster.Overall, it is a great anime that I enjoyed. I would give it an 8 due to the way I precieved it. A high quality short story that does open a new world for you.. but doesn't give you much more.PS. One of the main reasons for the low scores K is getting, is because the anime feels unfinished if you are to consider it... well, as an anime. Alot of things are un-answered, character progression is lackluster due to the anime being only 13 episodes and was too focused on the main storyline which was the deathcase. To me, it felt like it deserved an 8 because of the hope... that perhaps a future season will clear everything up. enjoyable short story that would motitivate you to learn about its' world in the future.

I don't really know why people think this is terrible like i could say that it might need some improvement on some parts but it was overall really AMAZING and rather enjoyable. It was the only one that made me look forward to every week and as soon as I got home I would go straight to watch it and look forward to next week. Oh yeah sorry if...i give you any spoilers because I sometimes I don't know what I type.Story: 9 give or take it was an amazing plot overall to me quite unique well most at least. Like it goes slowly at first for like the first few episode but it picks up after sometime and gets you really excited on what will happen. Like i could say it could be longer and that might've made it better but like for those who haven't seen the last few episodes it really makes up for it.Art: 10 the art was just plain OMG BEAUTIFUL! like everything was well drawn it's not like most you've ever seen!Sound: 10 the sound was amazing it really matched well with everything in my opinion. It totally went well with the atmosphere and scenes and makes everything better for some reason.Character: 10 AMAZING LOVED THEM ALL! They're all different and rather lovable. Even if people say that the main got weak character development he actually got some by the last few eps. The cast was beautiful and they were all lovable that it would bring you to tears if one of them died. Even if people didn't like the main character I found them all wonderful they had their own share of good and bad traits and sometimes you just wanna laugh or cry. They truly bring emotion into the story and there just really memorable.Enjoyment: 10 I enjoyed it a lot with everything it's the only anime i kept looking forward to every episode every week. The plot could just use a tiny bit of something but otherwise it was great!

After seeing the first episode, I was looking forward the next which was totally disappointing, the series still has good art and music  the story itself may be good, but as the series goes is totally disappointing too many unnecessary moments, too much fanservice, fights of short duration, I just keep watching this show because i have interest that maybe gets interesting. ', 'Shows with a gratuitous amount of detail within the development of the story and the development of multiple characters are usually standard fare within the anime medium. However, it’s all too common that the run time for most of those shows are usually cut to a single thirteen-episode season. It’s not impossible to tell the full story at a satisfactory level with limited run time. However, most writers run out of time and take shortcuts, which leave most of the audience disappointed. Unfortunately, when there’s too much of a focus on exposition to move the plot more quickly, it’s less likely to resonate with the...viewer. K is a show with only twelve episodes (so far anyway), too many characters to develop, and a story that should require a lot of exposition. Thankfully, the writers managed to handle all the hurdles very well, putting together a resonating and action-packed show that’s so much fun to watch.Our protagonist, Yashiro Isana is a seemingly normal and free-spirited high school boy who usually spends his time being out of the roof of the school and sometimes leaving the school without permission. However, his “normal” life is turned upside down when a video of him murdering someone and calling himself “the colorless king” surfaces. Despite not having any recollection of the video, the Red Clan, Blue Clan, and Kuro (who’s mission is to hunt down the Colorless King and slay him if he turns out to be evil) are all after him. Yashiro, now having to find a way to prove his innocence and get to the bottom of the murder, is bound to learn much more about the Clans that are after him, why he was supposedly framed, and who he actually is.It takes more than three episodes to really make sense of everything that’s happening and why. It get’s explained later on that there are factions in the city that Yashiro resides in; the most notable in this show are HOMRA (The Red Clan) and SCEPTER 4 (The Blue Clan). Each of these Clans have their own unique power, such as The Red Clan’s power manipulate fire. The reason why HOMRA, which operates with a street gang mentality, wants him dead is because the person that was killed was one of their members. SCEPTER 4, which operates more like a police force, are after Yashiro for justice and to protect the community from future harm. Both Clans have also been at odds with each other for generations, as there are always fights that break out between the two in broad daylight. Adding more insult to injury, a former member of the Red Clan caused more tension between the two by joining forces with the Blue Clan. There are at least three significant characters, including the kings of both Clans, that get an ample amount of development.Nobody’s motivations feel contrived and everything is genuine, from Mikoto’s (The Red King) passion for wanting to avenge his fellow comrade to Seri’s (third in-command of SCEPTER 4) tight friendship with Izumo (second in-command of HOMRA). The only problem is that there seems to be more to explore and it’s possible that once the second season is produced, there will be more to elaborate. However, for one season, it was satisfactory enough.Shiro’s story is harder to get into without spoiling major plot points that take up about half of the enjoyment factor. All that can be said is that the mystery of him being the “Colorless King” is a shadow that is cast upon him. All the more complicated is that Kuro, a no-nonsense samurai, is hell-bent on killing him as part of his mission. However, he decides to keep an eye on Shiro to give him a benefit of a doubt and give him the opportunity to prove his innocence.Shiro is also followed along by a cat that can turn into a beautiful girl, named Neko. She has the power to manipulate people’s senses and [insert spoiler here]. For a reason explained later in the series, Neko has an undying love for Shiro and is always trying to protect Shiro because he is her owner (y’know…because she’s a cat…yeah). Neko may be the only character that will rub the audience the wrong way because, in the grand scheme of things, she is basically playing the part as Shiro’s submissive pet and she (who is also always naked) is supermodel pretty. The otaku’s will probably love her though.If there’s one theme that will resonate with the viewer, more than anything, is selflessness. Again, that can’t even be elaborated enough because of spoilers. The plot builds up very nicely by the time the climax arrives. The ending pretty much set the show to new heights from a show that was fun to watch from an action-thriller standpoint to practically emulating the theme of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and everything that led up to it and afterwards. Yes, that may be a very bold statement to make but with an ending that was executed the way this was executed, there had to be theme in mind, stating that everyone should stop fighting and be more Christ-like. That’s not to say that this is for Christians, but it’s a universal lesson that everyone can and should get behind.The animation, handled by Studio GoHands, is breathtaking. All fight scenes, in particular, are animated fluidly with a lot of stylistic emphasis on the powers that the different clans use. Rarely are corners cut, nor are the character movements stagnant. The art design for the characters seem very plain to an extent because there seems to be minimal variation on the faces. The hair and eye colors and designs are nice as well of the clothes. However, the art as a whole is pleasing to the eye with the color scheme and detail that allows the characters to blend into the lovingly rendered backgrounds. CG also mixes in so well that it’s not even that noticeable.The music is also spot on with a bunch a hip hop tracks and heavy metal riffs used appropriately to get the audience pumped up for another fight that’s about to go down. The soundtrack has a diverse collection of hip-hop, rock, and house music to fit in with the technological setting of K, with every track used effectively without necessarily standing out. The English dub is also performed well across the board. Special praise goes out to Sam Riegal (Yashiro), Todd Haberkorn (Izumo), and Keith Silverstein (Mikoto: The Red King) for their standout performances. The script tends to stumble from time to time, especially when an actor is saying a long line or has to speak fast to match lip flaps. It’s probably not surprising when there’s so much dialogue in this show that has to be adapted. Thankfully, awkward line delivery is minimal.K manages to fill in all the right holes in a short amount of time with perfect pacing, an engaging trill of a story, and an ending that captures the spirit of altruism. There was apparently a movie that was released back in July and there will be a second season coming sometime in 2015. All that is great to know because, despite already having a satisfying ending, K has so much more to offer and explore in the setting. This is an action thriller for the masses that should not be missed. viewer. K is a show with only twelve episodes (so far anyway), too many characters to develop, and a story that should require a lot of exposition. Thankfully, the writers managed to handle all the hurdles very well, putting together a resonating and action-packed show that’s so much fun to watch.Our protagonist, Yashiro Isana is a seemingly normal and free-spirited high school boy who usually spends his time being out of the roof of the school and sometimes leaving the school without permission. However, his “normal” life is turned upside down when a video of him murdering someone and calling himself “the colorless king” surfaces. Despite not having any recollection of the video, the Red Clan, Blue Clan, and Kuro (who’s mission is to hunt down the Colorless King and slay him if he turns out to be evil) are all after him. Yashiro, now having to find a way to prove his innocence and get to the bottom of the murder, is bound to learn much more about the Clans that are after him, why he was supposedly framed, and who he actually is.It takes more than three episodes to really make sense of everything that’s happening and why. It get’s explained later on that there are factions in the city that Yashiro resides in; the most notable in this show are HOMRA (The Red Clan) and SCEPTER 4 (The Blue Clan). Each of these Clans have their own unique power, such as The Red Clan’s power manipulate fire. The reason why HOMRA, which operates with a street gang mentality, wants him dead is because the person that was killed was one of their members. SCEPTER 4, which operates more like a police force, are after Yashiro for justice and to protect the community from future harm. Both Clans have also been at odds with each other for generations, as there are always fights that break out between the two in broad daylight. Adding more insult to injury, a former member of the Red Clan caused more tension between the two by joining forces with the Blue Clan. There are at least three significant characters, including the kings of both Clans, that get an ample amount of development.Nobody’s motivations feel contrived and everything is genuine, from Mikoto’s (The Red King) passion for wanting to avenge his fellow comrade to Seri’s (third in-command of SCEPTER 4) tight friendship with Izumo (second in-command of HOMRA). The only problem is that there seems to be more to explore and it’s possible that once the second season is produced, there will be more to elaborate. However, for one season, it was satisfactory enough.Shiro’s story is harder to get into without spoiling major plot points that take up about half of the enjoyment factor. All that can be said is that the mystery of him being the “Colorless King” is a shadow that is cast upon him. All the more complicated is that Kuro, a no-nonsense samurai, is hell-bent on killing him as part of his mission. However, he decides to keep an eye on Shiro to give him a benefit of a doubt and give him the opportunity to prove his innocence.Shiro is also followed along by a cat that can turn into a beautiful girl, named Neko. She has the power to manipulate people’s senses and [insert spoiler here]. For a reason explained later in the series, Neko has an undying love for Shiro and is always trying to protect Shiro because he is her owner (y’know…because she’s a cat…yeah). Neko may be the only character that will rub the audience the wrong way because, in the grand scheme of things, she is basically playing the part as Shiro’s submissive pet and she (who is also always naked) is supermodel pretty. The otaku’s will probably love her though.If there’s one theme that will resonate with the viewer, more than anything, is selflessness. Again, that can’t even be elaborated enough because of spoilers. The plot builds up very nicely by the time the climax arrives.

Nothing about it comes off as a dealbreaker or particularly obnoxious aspect.That said, it isn't without problems. The biggest one is that it has such a large, branching story and so many characters but it's still only thirteen episodes. Which makes the pacing feel overly fast and leaves some things less detailed than they could be.That of course hurts the characters a bit. There are a ton of characters in K, and none of them are especially well characterized. Partially because they all have to share the thirteen episodes of screentime, but also just because this...anime isn't great at fleshing them out. They mostly have only a few traits and aren't that complex. Even the ones we see more of like Shiro and Kurou.I should point out that I don't think they're bad characters either. In fact, I like most of them. Their personalities are simple, but well defined. Almost everyone has a good balance of postive and negative characteristics, which I look for as a sign of good characters. They have sensible arcs if they have any, and their conflicts are compelling. Probably the strongest point of the anime story-wise. So let's call the cast alright on balance. I hate Neko though, and the villain is very one-dimensional.Quite a lot of the time this show has is spent on character scenes. And most of the rest of it on fights. It has a high budget with very nice animation and the fight scenes are fun.It's fun in general, is what I'm trying to get at. I'll freely admit that it isn't the deepest thing in the entire world, and the structure is flawed. But I do enjoy it a lot. It's silly, and it does a good job keeping the tone light. It doesn't handle anything particularly dark and the execution softens its content further. And like I said, I like almost all the characters. For me that's enough. It's always good to watch something just for fun now and again, and there are much worse written anime than this anyway. anime isn't great at fleshing them out.

On first glance, it looks like it has the potential to be a masterpiece. At the same time, when you really get down to it, it\'s nothing exceptional. K is overall a decent series and it has its strong suits, but it\'s certainly not worth your time if you\'re looking for a great series to pick up and here\'s why.What first drew me to K was the background of the story. The series is set in a futuristic world where Japan is essentially dominated by the 7 kings of color. Each of the kings has a different power according...to their colors. For all intents and purposes, their superiority over the rest of humanity is absolute. On top of that, they\'re assisted by their clansman, who essentially pledge their loyalty to the kings in exchange for superhuman powers. The balance of power is carefully maintained until story is set in motion by a murder case. A man who self-identified as the Colorless King shot one of the Red King\'s clansmen, and the entire thing was captured on the camera that clansman was carrying. It just so happens that the supposed Colorless King looks exactly like the main character, who\'s an oblivious and sociable high school student living in school. And the search is on for this killer.So far so good. What went wrong then? Well, nothing went wrong, so to speak. It was just that the plot unfolded at a pace so slow, people were literally asking ""so what exactly happened in this episode"" on the discussion boards. A typical episode features at most 3-5 minutes of actual plot explanation and the rest is devoted to character interaction and the occasional battles. To their credit, the animation quality is great. I liked the art style and every action was incredibly smooth. The battles themselves were quite entertaining and you can clearly tell they weren\'t trying to cut corners there, but quite frankly, the plot was simply lacking. It started with some momentum in the beginning, then dropped off a cliff for at least 2/3 of the season, then picked up again in the last 2-3 episodes. That\'s something you\'d expect from a fan service series -- not K, which clearly strives to play itself as a serious piece of work.K is a weak series for another reason. Instead of being plot-driven, it\'s mainly character-driven. In place of plot, you have a number of characters with strong and some would say memorable personalities that draw the audience in. The problem is that K doesn\'t even try to ease the audience in with the characters. Although you find out a great deal about each major character over the course of the series, it\'s mostly 30-second scenes here or there that make up for scattered pieces of information. Take Fushimi, who is the third in command of Blue King\'s clan. Although we\'re shown that he was originally a subordinate of the Red King, we end up never finding out just why it is that he decided to switch sides. Perhaps the directors of K want the audience to fill in the gaps, but it feels quite insulting to the audience who has no idea what the full history is behind most of the characters. There is a line between trying to be subtle and not really explaining anything. K\'s crossed the line just too many times.Personally, I dislike the analogy but K feels just like Guilty Crown. It looks great from the outside, but when you look closer, you can see that it has somewhat of a hollow core. The promise is there. It\'s just that potential isn\'t enough to make a series great. Although I personally enjoyed watching most of the cast interact and doing whatever they do, when I got to ep. 13, the ending felt bland and somewhat anticlimactic even. And the glaring plot holes here and there make it hard for me to fully recommend this series. Bottom line is, if you\'re not totally into plot, love flashy animations, and just want to watch cool character say and do cool things, K is something you\'d enjoy a whole lot. If you demand serious plot depth on top of all that, though, kindly move on. to their colors. For all intents and purposes, their superiority over the rest of humanity is absolute.

It was ranked around #200 on MAL before episode 1 even came out.But by episode 1 or even 2, people were complaining that it was horrible with no plot and just pretty art. Some were calling it the next Guilty Crown.First episode of K and we have so much stuff happening and not a lot of explaining. While I love K, I do admit that is what threw a lot of people off.K throws its audience right in the middle of things and...expects us to quickly understand the situation. It plays out like we know the king system and all the characters when really we don't...or at least not yet.I think the real problem with K is that it had to many characters introduced and some many events happening, but not enough episodes to make it work. K would of worked better if it was a 24 episode anime. Then it would have time for character development and to be able to stretch out so many events without making it look like it is trying to stuff it all in.I personally think that K would be better if the manga and light novels of K were released a year before the anime aired instead of the same year. It would of gave people time to understand K's world and basic background.While there are a few faults in K, I love the anime because of the characters (especially team Homra). K has characters you find yourself fallling in love with.To be honest the writers could change the plot and make it an anime just about Homra (like K~Memory of REd) and I would be okay with that. The art/animation of K is just beautiful. You can really see that the animators worked hard on K.Overall I give K : 9 expects us to quickly understand the situation.

They introduce so many arcs all at once that it just leaves you confused and distracted, and when they do try to resolve it, it's either so rushed that it will just fly past you or makes no sense whatsoever. The saddest part is that there are some storylines and character arcs that seems promising.I think the real problem is that they just didn't have enough episodes to work with, not enough to tell and develop this grand story - which is definitely a shame.Character:Rating - 2Like the story, the characters are underdeveloped as well.The series tries to be an ensemble cast, switching from one group of characters to another, which didn't really give them sufficient time to develop and flesh-out each one intricately.Their sad attempt of character development is just giving them weird quirks, but weird quirks is not equal to character development, they just ended up seeming more outlandish and two-dimmension that they already are.And no one is given the opportunity to show lovable traits.I failed to be invested in the characters and in turn failed to care about their issues and problems.Art:Rating - 10The only thing that K really has going for it is its art.The visuals are gorgeous, the character design is quite attractive, the action sequences are very well animated and the color is manipulated well to reflect the mood of the scenes - too bad the sound flushed it down the toiletand on that subject-Sound:Rating - 1I was first commending it for not using stock anime background music but K bit my ass and forced me to take back what I said.I'd rather much have the the stock anime background music than what K offered. On their own they're pretty good, but the problem lies within the integration to scenes.During an action scene where you'd expect an upbeat tune to keep you riled up and on your toes, K gives you a...ballad?One would think that it might seem innovative and unique, offering a different experience, but no - it was completely unecessary and served no purpose.Like I said - the action sequence is animated well, but with the ballad it came with made it seem slow and boring.There was not enough energy with the bg music, making the whole anime more bland and hollow.The Seiyuu's performances were forgetable and the same goes for the OP and ED (both of which had atrocious animations).Enjoyment:Rating - 2Aside from the art and animation, there was nothing I really truly enjoyed with K. There wasn't enough interesting and amusing character interactions to keep me going, no interesting storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat.I don't know what mindset you should have to enjoy K. Maybe if you have time to kill and want to appreciate some gorgeous visuals then sure - be my guest. But like I said before, there is nothing fullfilling about this anime.Overall:Rating - 3K was something that seemed so promising with it's interesting concept and batch of characters, but it just failed to deliver.It's rushed, the pacing is awful, the atmosphere is nonexistent and the characters are all underdeveloped..There is no pay-off to the build-up - which frustrated me most and the world building and principles isn't established as well as it could've been.However I mostly blame all these to the limited ammount of episodes they had to work with.

It was intriguing in the first few episodes, but it seemed like the developers were throwing in random plot twists every now and then. And then another flashback. One character is introduced and then two episodes later is killed. The plot was completely bogus until the very end, where everything tied together and made sense. However, a lot of the background questions...are still left unanswered: Who are the Kings? Why do they exist? How did they become Kings? Did they just randomly gain magic powers? Confusing.Animation: 9/10Animation was pretty good. Fight scenes were pretty intense. Some nice visuals and the backgrounds were also fairly intricate.Characters: 8/10Characters were actually decent, even though the plot was something else altogether. The MC is pretty annoying at first, he might seem like an air-head, but he has good intentions, so I\'ll give him that. Side characters also had some good character development, especially some of the HOMRA members.Sound: 8/10Soundtrack was good.Voice characters were pretty believable, especially Mikoto\'s.Enjoyment: 7/10I actually hated this anime up until the very end. I hate watching characters going, ""What? Huh?"" and feeling the exact same way as them because you have absolutely no clue what is happening.

This is the reason why: (1) Like many people are saying, and I do agree with them, the story lacked character development and it felt scattered about the place. I was just here observing various events unfolding, having absolutely no idea what was going on. I was like, ""Oh, so this is happening and that is happening. Oh look, that\'s happening and it\'s so strange. Now what\'s happening? Is this really happening? Why isn\'t something more beneficial tot he plot happening?  Okay, I see......well let me just watch and wait... and hope."" I must say, though, that it does have an interesting idea to the plot, but a story not very well told/portrayed, so I\'d say it\'s fair.The art is great. I like it a lot. That guy with the skateboard had a scene while riding where it looked like someone was videoing him through a fish-eye lens camera. Just as you would video someone skateboarding in a stunt video. Makes it feel urban. Some of the fight scenes were very nice too especially with that Kurou guy that had the sword. As for the sound, I must say that I love the urban atmospheric feel of the soundtrack. There were several of them that sounded really nice so i downloaded the anime\'s OST.

No bone! No ash!"" -  HOMRA [K Project]That\'s the best quote from the anime and the most memorable. I decided to watch this anime when I was watching random videos on YouTube x) And it caught my attention.Story: In all honesty, even though I was quite interested in the first episode, I kind of got bored afterwards. Don\'t take it the wrong way though, because it\'s actually a pretty good anime. Trying to find the murderer of an old friend is basically the whole entire point of the plot line; not to mention seven Gods that posses special powers with a clansman...that follows their orders. Despite  the fact that the story goes slow at times, there are those good and enjoyable moments that makes up for it. Besides, there\'s some action that grabs your attention as well.Art: The animation is probably the best attribute of K Project. In fact, it\'s one of the best art style that I\'ve seen so far. The colors, the light, the shading; all of it was just outstanding. Put it all together and it makes a beautiful setting of the show.Sound: The music was something that I\'ve quite enjoyed as well. Though, I do wish that they could\'ve added an intense or catchy music when it got to the action scenes, because they just played a smooth sound to it when things got serious, that way the viewers can get more into it. But either way, it won\'t bother you as much.Character: I have to admit that I wasn\'t really fond of the protagonist, since he was too carefree and too dependable on his two companions. But he did got more serious and acted like a leader later in the show. The other characters were quite likable since they had their own unique personalities and their little charm that everyone knows of. I also like the HOMRA group, since they acted more like a family than the others. Mikoto, Anna, and Misaki were my favorite characters amongst all the others; just saying ;POverall, K Project was a pretty good anime with very few bad points.

However, I found the story rather enjoyable. Shiro, a boy with amnesia, gets blamed for doing something he has no memory of doing and goes in search of the truth. I liked the idea of the swords and the clans, but some of it was very confusing. It\'s not bad for a short anime but others like No.6 explained things a lot better with short amount of episodes.Art:9Now here\'s something the anime did really well. The art was fantastic - one of the best I\'ve seen. It had a different...feel than other anime.... Kind of a ""tropical"" feeling, with all that blue. Backgrounds were really well done, not crap quality at all.Sound:7The opening and ending songs were great, not the best though. I don\'t have any problem with those. One thing I just have to mention are the soundtracks, especially those played during fight scenes. Can\'t they have something more... Intense? It doesn\'t really suit the mood of the anime.Character:8I didn\'t like how Shiro was actually someone else, but that aside, this anime had good characters. I started watching this anime because Shiro and Kuro look like Kanda and Allen from DGM, however Shiro and Kuro were unique in their own way.

Everything from the opening song ""KINGS"" by Angela, to  the ending song, ""Tsumetai Heya, Hitori""  by Mikako Komatsu, and everything in between is great.

In short, the series follows Yashiro Isana, a high school student, who is being accused of the murder of Tatara Totsuka, a member of HOMRA (HOMRA is one of the groups pursuing him). Throughout the show, it is up to Isana to prove his innocence to the crime, or be killed by one of his many pursuers.In general, the plot is easy to follow, and it has enough curves to keep you guessing until near the end. While there are still holes (which will hopefully be filled with the various manga series and the movie that is due for release), the story is still good, just not the best you\'ve ever seen.The characters in this show work with the limited time we have with them. We are introduced to many, and while some are not all too important, for the most part, they don\'t fall into the ubiquitous cliche characters that we are seeing so often in anime these days. Given the number of characters in this 13 episode series, and the various factions they represent, we are not given as much character development as I would like to see.Characters like Reisi and Mikoto obviously have so much going on that we never really get to see, so the viewer ends up feeling a bit left out and things that could have had much more impact fall a little short.In general though, most of the characters are likable or fill their roles nicely.Overall, this anime has a lot going for it, but falls short on some aspects. I feel that with more episodes, these flaws would not be so prominent, but that is up in the air. The show is definitely worth the watch, just for the art and soundtrack alone, as they are stylistically some of the best in anime.

Its like having some special ritual power or something. One thing to note about the plot is that they let shit things happened first before explaining. Although they didn’t really make it exciting and mysterious like other anime, it still explain the event fully and clearly...for everyone. The storyline isn’t that rush at all, as season 2 will be airing this October, So the story still goes on.Art & Character Design: 8/10The animation is simply stunning, if you remember the scene where Yata in his skateboard chasing Yashiro around the streets of Tokyo. The CGI effect for that part was amazing, you wouldn’t feel it unless you watched it in either HD or HQ. Likewise for the character design, I like the way they design their character where they are mature looking and looks like a character that you would see in a proper and serious anime.Entertainment & Execution: 7/10It was definitely entertaining as it shown some cool fighting scene and chasing scene. It wasn’t that exciting as you already have a feeling what’s coming next. That’s something that will kill your mood for entertainment. But still, the execution of the story is the one that bring this segment into having a high score. The execution of the story was done perfectly, you don’t feel confusing even if they skip plots and explain all of it later.

Well, it wraps the story up in the last episode in a mildly curious way, but the entire execution of the plot dragged the story out so much that the ending, no matter how decent it was ""supposed"" to be, just made me want to punch a hole in the wall.Characters: You...have one neko-woman who managed the annoy the living daylights out of me, a samurai wannabe whose character was the only tolerable one, A few ""Kings"" whose characters are are laughably recycled and uninspiring, a clairvoyant Loli chick, A couple of idiotic sidekicks who try to be gangsta and the list of cliches go on.The animation was new and lively- one of the reasons why I stuck through to the end.

It's a weird feeling to compare these shows and at the same time regard them as completely different. The bottom line, however, is that K, much like Durarara!! is very, very good.In an alternate version of modern-day Japan (WOW HAVEN'T...HEARD THAT BEFORE), not much is truly different from the world we know as reailty. Sure, everything is more technologically advanced by a good 10+ years, but overall, things seem rather normal. But the setting (again, much like Durarara!!) has a hidden side to it. Years ago, instead of continuing on with the normal flow of government, Japan tried something new. A mysterious relic was found that bestowed power on certain people. These people would come to be known as Kings. These Kings, with their new supernatural abilities, grow their own small clans and maintain power over certain sectors of Japan. Unfortunately, as with most ruling bodies, there is conflict among the clans (hmm clan conflict, where have I heard that before?....okay I'll stop with the DRRR!! references). Our main plot begins with the murder of one member of the Red Clan. Now, the Red King and his followers are out to find the murderer and get their revenge. Enter Isana Yashiro, or Shiro for short. After an incriminating video is displayed for the whole city to see, he is made the number one suspect in the murder case. And it's not just the Red Clan he must avoid, but also the police-style Blue Clan who wish to bring him to justice for his crimes and a man by the name of Kuro, who has his own motives for wanting to harm the boy.This is where DRRR!! and K differ. While Durarara!! loves to focus on the individual lives and mindsets of the ever growing cast, K gives you everyone right away and lets the story proceed easily, which I prefer to DRRR!!'s waiting 5 episodes to even focus on the 'main' character again. The supernatural aspect is also much more...straight-forward I suppose. The abilities these kings and clansmen have, while not overly detailed, seem more natural then the slew of things that go down in Ikebukuro (I realize I just said supernatural events are natural, but you get the idea). It's a gripping story throughout with plenty of twists and turns, and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.The characters are really good in this one. From the kind and slightly idiotic Shiro to his shape-shifting, reality-morphing cat, Neko, to the cold, yet tasteful bad-ass that is Kuro, the main cast is just as entertaining as some of the more developed side-characters. And yes, the side characters do receive slightly more development because this show suffers from what I call 'TGS' or 'Tokyo Ghoul Syndrome' where the main character is kinda useless for the majority of the episodes. He's not as whiny or boring as Kaneki, but he is somewhat pointless from time to time. The side characters are honestly some of my favorite SINCE Durarara!!. The violent Red Clansmen of HOMRA and the stern Blue Clansmen of SEPTER 4 play off each other so well, and while there isn't much emphasis on the clansmen, especially compared to the Kings, the ones that do receive attention are really enjoyable to watch.Animation. Oh. My. God. I LOVE THE ANIMATION STYLE OF THIS SHOW. Sure, action scenes are few and far between and the supernatural aura stuff isn't a work of art, but the use of color in this show is breathtaking. Each episode is tinted. I know that sounds weird, like why not just have a dark show or a colorful one, but what they do with the tint in marvelous. The majority of the episodes will be grayish-green or grayish-blue, nothing really pretty, but then you have moments when the supernatural aura appears or when the show wants you to really focus on something and there's this HUGE splash of color on an otherwise toned-down palette. It makes for such a nice effect that I completely forgive the show for being such a gross color a majority of the time. You look forward to seeing these parts of the animation and it works so well.Soundtrack I can't say as much about, unfortunately. It's not bad by any means, but nothing stood out to me. There was one song that you hear repeated a few times toward the end that was really nice, but it didn't stick with me well. However, I need to give props for the opening theme, aptly titled 'Kings', and the ending theme used in episode 6. The opening doesn't seem like much, but it quickly grew on me and I found myself singing along to the subtitles (poorly, of course, but still). As for the ending theme of episode 6, titled 'Circle of Friends', it may not seem to great for just listening to, but after watching the episode it's used in, it almost made me cry how perfect it was. So yeah, not a GREAT soundtrack, but not bad by any means.For a mere 13 episodes, this show has been really great. The last show that was this short that I liked this much was Death Parade. Luckily, a second season is coming out in just a few months! K, while simple in name, is a fantastic supernatural show and a great show in general. Its similarities to Durarara!! are obvious, but it's its own being that stands strongly by itself. I highly recommend this show.Positives:+Good opening theme and great ending theme used in episode 6+Characters are great, whether seen a lot or neglected a little+Animation.

The two are similar, indeed, but each is special and unique in their own ways. K is a fantastic tale from beginning to end and I cannot wait for more content to come out. If you watched Durarara!!, like supernatural or mystery shows, or just want to watch a great show in general, I HIGHLY recommend K.

It is truly a fantastic anime.And that's why K gets a 9/10"", ""I first found K on YouTube. Being the fangirl I am, when I first saw Fushimi Saruhiko, I HAD to watch K. I wasn't looking for anything big, just a few bishies for eye candy. I was blown away at how amazing it was.Character development: The character development is very different than any other anime I've seen. It's obvious that certain characters have history together, but you don't really see that history. Unlike most short anime, there aren't too many flashbacks to create history. Because you aren't exactly sure what happened, It feels more realistic. There are characters that get flashbacks,...but it still doesn't cover the whole history.Art&Sound: The way the art was done was very unique and beautiful, when you combine the art, amazing soundtrack, fantasy aspects, advanced technology, and realistic characters, you get a very surreal feeling that works perfectly with the unique storyline.K is very easy to enjoy and appeals to a lot of different tastes. It's a kind of ageless story that I think absolutely anyone over 10 or 11 will enjoy. but it still doesn't cover the whole history.Art&Sound: The way the art was done was very unique and beautiful, when you combine the art, amazing soundtrack, fantasy aspects, advanced technology, and realistic characters, you get a very surreal feeling that works perfectly with the unique storyline.K is very easy to enjoy and appeals to a lot of different tastes. It's a kind of ageless story that I think absolutely anyone over 10 or 11 will enjoy."", ""Story: 6The main plot of K revolves around several clans, each run by a king associated with a color. After a murder takes a place, a video is released showing the murderer to be the slightly air-headed high school student, Yashiro. You can imagine some people were a little pissed at him.Anyhow, the plot line in and of itself wasn't exactly original, it still wasn't your everyday stroll in the park.  The anime is still very intriguing, and difficult to resist cannon balling. The plot wasn't exactly executed greatly, especially in terms of pacing, but it still revolves around the characters nicely.One...may argue concerning the clash of genres, but in my opinion, I believe that the genres complimented each other well enough. The show didn't appear to force anything in, and so I believe that the abundance of genres was merely due to the fact that it was just how they wanted to execute said plot line, and I don't believe they could have taken much out. That being said, they could have organized and paced everything much better.Art: 9The art in K is absolutely gorgeous, there's no denying. The animations are fluid, the colors are vibrant, the backgrounds are detailed, and the effects are gorgeous. The action scenes were all very well done, and the animation style did fit the show nicely. It truly was beautifully animated. Props to GoHands.Sound: 9As with the art, I believe sound was very well done, although I'm extremely biased because all of the music was right up my alley. I have a several songs on my iPod. And have been listening to them on repeat for like, days. Anyhow, yes, the soundtrack is pretty fantastic. In my opinion. It goes nicely with the anime and really helps with some scenes. The voice acting is also fantastic, portraying the characters very well.Character: 10So, I'm totally going against so many reviews with this one. So yes, some of the character development isn't very well done and is slightly bland, but considering the massive cast of characters and there being only a thirteen-episode arc, I don't see how they could have done much better without focusing entirely on only one or two characters.The characters are definitely what I really loved about K, though. Something that has always appealed to me in anime's are a diverse, larger cast of characters. Angel Beats! And Durarara ! are some of my favorite anime's just based around that one fact.So what happened when I watched K, was that I was critically judging the not so good storyline, but then all of the characters came along. And I kinda fell in love. HOMRA's (the red) clan was pretty much my drive to watch the show, and Scepter 4's (the blue) did a fantastic job of scaring me. Well, Fushimi did. Mi....sa....ki?The characters may seem difficult to relate to at first glance, but they are all completely tragic and with their own flaws. That being said, I couldn't hate anyone.K might have just used various cliches and stereotypes, but does it mean I love characters such as Mikoto and Yata any less? Nope. Still love 'em.Enjoyment: 9Now, this is where things get complicated. Although this show isn't 'technically' good at all, I still enjoyed the hell out of it. I also cried. So this is me subtly bring up the ending, because I bawled, and then I watched it fifty more times. To be honest, that ending may have made jaded my entire opinion of the show. Because that was one of the most freakin' beautiful endings I've ever seen for an anime.But yep, definitely enjoyed K.Overall: 8My comments for overall are basically the same as my comments for enjoyment: it's technically lacking and mildly cliched, but I still couldn't help but love it. may argue concerning the clash of genres, but in my opinion, I believe that the genres complimented each other well enough.

As many of you already know, this anime has received a notable income of poor feedback, and it\'s share of rather fair reviews as well. However, I find a lot of these responses to be either biased or not written correctly, and I intend to give what I find to be a reasonable resolution to the actual quality of K.In short? I enjoyed it. Despite some easily forgivable flaws, K: Project wasn\'t actually a terrible process. In some areas it could definitely sharpen its blades of mastery, but regardless of what other reviews are claiming, K is not as...bad as it seems. In fact, if you\'re into a story like this, I would even recommend it to people. It certainly is worth a look; and I would by no means say the quality of this anime is ""shallow"" or ""poor"".In length? Let\'s begin.Story: (8/10)The plot of K isn\'t a completely unseen topic, as it has been touched upon by some other anime. Despite the unoriginal sequence of events, K: Project has decent storytelling and it isn\'t by any means ""cliche;"" hell, it could even be pleasant to watch. Some astonishing moments have hit me in the story, but it could be difficult or confusing to follow if you haven\'t got time to read the Wikis for extra information.Some of the storytelling is rushed or delivered improperly; and some of the events flowed too quickly, leaving your head spinning if you don\'t rewatch a few moments of it. I\'m not afraid to deny I have done my share of Wiki reading and revisiting old episodes to understand the plot, but I\'m also just as happy to claim that it was never less enjoyable every time. In fact, understanding the plot could leave you enjoying the story more - but not everyone has time to read the Wikis like me.Art: (10/10)The art of K: Project - especially towards the beginning - is astonishing. K\'s quality of visuals allured me into the plot more, even if the latter is a bit slow in the beginning. Throughout K: Project, we were given the beautiful detail of Tokyo\'s streets through well-placed fisheye cameras that were absorbed in light, depth, and amazing style, as well as astounding shots of fire, ice, and electricity that the Clans in this anime used. In K, I never found myself dissatisfied with the well-polished touch-ups to glare, lighting, or use of tints, despite what others are saying.In contrast, I have to mention slight animation failures towards the ending episodes where several characters\' seem to have several ill-proportioned limbs or awkwardly big eyes, but the overall delivery of the style is more than enough to make up for this flaw. If the story alone doesn\'t entertain you, then the art should be plenty to let you watch this anime.Sound: (9/10)Regardless of other opinions I\'ve seen on this, K: Project has given us memorable music quality, especially through multiple combat sequences and opening shots. In particular, I listen to many of these soundtracks to this day - and the impact of some of these still lingers there. The tracks were original, from what I\'ve seen, and I haven\'t experienced anything close to the likes of some of these moments since I\'ve been watching anime - and K: Project was the second anime I ever watched.However, on the other hand, I have to rate this section as a ""9"" because more than just two of the tracks were boring, forgettable, and had no flowing rhythm. That being said, some of these soundtracks are so poor to the point I\'ve forgotten some of them entirely. In adjustment to this, there were plenty of good songs to choose from.In particular, the opening and ending songs were nothing special, in my taste, and they never change in the first season - and I did have to skip through the opening a few times to ignore this choice of music.Character: (7/10)I love K\'s characters, I really do - but this anime, for just 13 quick episodes and rather rushed plot, has such an overabundance on characters and side-characters that it took me over three times of watching this anime to even remember half of them. In specific, SCEPTER 4, which has many branches of military and command, have a certain section known as the ""Swordsmen"" that consist of up to 8 independent characters, and almost none of them had screen time or significant development.On the other hand, the main characters - Yashiro, Kuroh, and Neko - were somewhat enjoyable as the story started, but none of them were talked about progressively throughout the story and little was known about Kuroh or Neko\'s childhood. Yashiro, on the other hand, was given an episode, I believe, to focus on his history, but this may be due to the plot significance of his story.Less-important characters, primarily focusing on HOMRA\'s and SCEPTER 4\'s supporting cast, were scarcely touched upon at all, although multiple links of characters from both appeared to have some connection with each other. Yata Misaki and Fushimi Saruhiko are the two notable exceptions of this and despite that fact, they are still required to be read about on the wiki to even know where they originated.Even less memorable characters - the school characters, respectively - are present through K: Project. To this day I don\'t remember what any of the schoolgirls\' names are, and they\'re all rather transparent and cliche, and despite their forced roles in the story, aren\'t plot-critical and could have been left out altogether.Enjoyment: (8/10)K: Project, through it\'s visuals and enticing character design, was a formidable experience for me. I would rate it as an ""8"" here because I never found myself sitting through an uncomfortable or boring moment in this anime, although I have read speculations on this. If the characters are read about on other resources, a few exceptions are rather developed and interesting, and some characters like Fushimi Saruhiko, as I mentioned before, are relatable and layered.The plot, despite the flaws, is entertaining to watch in co-existence with its well-placed music and unforgettable animation. K: Project was, in particular, enjoyable and humorous in some areas, and some of the moments could have been considered shady or mysterious.Overall: (9/10)Should you give K: Project a try? I would certainly hope so. While the story may be one of the worst things here, it also has other areas of expertise that make up for this. Action-packed areas will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and some of the soundtracks will be in your memory undeniably. I would give this anime such a high rating because K is by no means a rushed or sloppy anime, and even if you don\'t like it after reading my thoughts on it, at least you could say you tried. Hell, even tell me what you thought of it if I inspired any of you border-edges to watch it.I recommend you K: Project because it is a horribly underrated, uncredited anime that is definitely worth a look! bad as it seems. In fact, if you\'re into a story like this, I would even recommend it to people.

I would certainly hope so. While the story may be one of the worst things here, it also has other areas of expertise that make up for this. Action-packed areas will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and some of the soundtracks will be in your memory undeniably. I would give this anime such a high rating because K is by no means a rushed or sloppy anime, and even if you don\'t like it after reading my thoughts on it, at least you could say you tried. Hell, even tell me what you thought of it if I inspired any of you border-edges to watch it.I recommend you K: Project because it is a horribly underrated, uncredited anime that is definitely worth a look!', ""K is an anime that, although flawed, is a great view.The story line was inconsistent and, at times, I got completely lost about what it was all about. There were parts left unclear, information not well delivered, and I had a lot of doubts that weren't answered in the anime (had to read the manga in order to comprehend better). However, once I /did/ understand, I liked it. I liked that the story had an unreliable protagonist and that the story, although confusing and variant, was always an inescapable cliff-hanger. I say this because there is no way to 100% predict what is going...to happen.However, what really did it for me... was the art. W o w. This series' art work and coloring is like a mix between NGNL (No Game No Life - an anime that, although I hated various parts, has beautiful visuals) and Hamatora (definitely recommended as well!). It is thrilling and entrancing and enticing. It charmed me, really. Whenever I thought about giving up on the series and not watching it, the visuals served as motivation for me to keep going. TBH I had to rewatch the entire first episode because I was so mesmerized by the art that I did not pay attention at all at what was going on and got completely lost.So, all in all, it's a good series with beautiful art, and I think you'd enjoy it :) to happen.However, what really did it for me... was the art.

The art of the powers are very well detailed. It was a little confusing on whatever is going on but it was still enough for basic understandings. The characters had each unique personalities that I enjoyed and added a lot into the story plot. The music also increased the dramatic situations and made the anime pretty easy going. Each of the main kings' personalities and how they treat their clans members gains my respect for them. "", 'The story of ""K"" is really interesting, the different Kings, clans etc.. But it leaves me quite frustrated as I don\'t feel they fully developped it. The first half of K is (let\'s say it) useless. Not even that funny, we don\'t really get what\'s happening, who is who and all that. But eventually, it leads to a really great story,  a great character development, but still we don\'t really understand what\'s the point of what they\'re doing, what\'s the meaning of the story and that\'s quite disappointing.

We don\'t really get what are the so called ""responsabilities"" of the Kings as we don""t even know what they\'re supposed to be. I get that we don\'t necessarily need to know where they get their powers from but still. Neko is also a mysterious character : we don\'t know who/what she is, why she\'s with Shiro. Kuro, at the beginning is a really boring character as he only talks about the Great Miwa Ichigen but : we don\'t know him, we never see him and he litterally has nothing to do with the main characters. In the end, the characters could be really great but they\'re not quite interesting enough, we actually don\'t really know them.In the end, I really enjoyed it even though it has many flaws in its plot and character development, the art and sound helping a lot there.

He is chased and accused of a crime he doesn’t remember committing and soon realizes that there’s something wrong with his memories…This scenario created a sense of intrigue and curiosity that eventually lead to an huge disappointment. The promising start was ruined with the poor development of the story that took all the fun out of it. The complicated plot and the little things left without explanation really annoyed...me because I felt that it could have been something so great and so epic and instead was just not that good.About the ending, it was an epic fight that left me with so many questions I hope will be answered once I watch the movie.Art and animation: 10This is probably the strongest point of this anime. The quality is excellent in every aspect and every character is design in detail until is perfect, all the surroundings and background are in full detail, very colorful and with no shadows. I was particularly impressed with the glow of the clan members especially during the fights (although there weren’t that many) and the beautiful colors used in the landscape.Sound: 8I enjoyed the opening and I think it is relatable with the anime, the ending song is average. The sounds used during the series to give emphases to the scene are great I really love them and they worked so well. However, there were a little repetitive and were used when not needed but it didn’t really bother me.Characters: 7The characters are so beautifully design that it is a shame their stories weren’t properly developed. You can tell that there is tension between the clans because of some event in the past but that part is never told, we were left with pieces of the past that don’t really connect. Of course that with only 13 episodes there wasn’t enough time to get into their history though I was expecting more.Otherwise I really like them and their unique personalities, they were just amazing. I guess I just wanted the chance to know them better.Enjoyment: 8Although it has flaws I really enjoy watching this anime mostly because of the excellent quality and the appealing personalities of the characters.

I'll try my best.Story: 9.5/10Simply: Kings, Clans, Superpowers and historical regard. Sounds pretty average, but it isn't at all.The main Story of the Anime takes place in Shizume Town, it'd be a bit too confusing to talk about the Manga scenery.The Story follows a young boy...named Isana Yashiro who's chased by weird looking man for no reason - actually, it has a reason.I won't tell anymore about the main plot for now, but I will talk a bit about the things that happened afterwards.Just a short time after Yashiro was chased by HOMRA, the Third and Red Clan, also Scepter 4, the Fourth and Blue Clan and lately the Second and Golden Clan start engaging into the action.K does may seem boring at the start, but with the actions of the other Clans more things, that are supposed to help understanding the storyline get exciting.After a few episodes of fighting between the rivals HOMRA and Scepter 4, their Kings Suoh Mikoto and Munakata Reisi finally are about to show their real power.Well, too many information already, but what the hell is a Synopsis.I just have to say about the Story: besides one other show it's the greatest Story I've ever seen. I like historical references and everything starts with World War II. It also takes other references (for example the Sword of Damocles), the Kings and their Vessels or the Characteristic of a 'real' King like we know it from history class.Art: 10/10K's Animation is more than flawless in my opinion. I like the bright colours whose represent their King's image perfectly, also the daker, dusty colours when Flashbacks are shown. The Animation when it comes to fighting scenes (in the first Season) are also pretty good, just as the Character Design itself.Sound: 8.5/10Suoh Mikoto's OST will probably be my favourite OST ever. I can't deny that I don't shed any tears while listening to it, GoRa did a great job with making an OST a perfect fit for various characters/situations. I'm often listening to the full Soundtrack because it helps me calming down and I made good memories with K. I can't complain about the Character Songs, every single one suits their Character perfectly.Character: 10/10K offers a huge selection of different Characters. Surely we got the stereotypes in there, but it didn't bother me lots.Most of the Clansmen from different Clans treat their enemies in a special way and they seem to have a favourite enemy in other Clans.For example, we've got the Tsundere and forever-virgin (thanks fandom) Yata Misaki, who's best enemy/friend is the master of provoking, Saruhiko Fushimi. Neither of them could forget about each other and I'm sure they never will. One of my #3 OTP's though.We've got the Red's Vessel Kusanagi Izumo and the Blue's Vessel Awashima Seri, who're having a pretty lovely, but secret relationship.Later on we're getting a psychotic King, we've got a King like it's written in history books, a King that fights for justice, a King that lives for his country and is feared by everyone and a King who hasn't been able to forget about the last 90 years.Every Character has their own backstory (for more information I would recommend the Manga-Series), every Character is holding a big burden, every Character has some characteristic potentional which is making them outstanding.Okay, you may get a bit confused by all those S4 and HOMRA boys, but it'll work out.Time to talk about my favourite Character!Suoh Mikoto is a King for himself. He doesn't care about his burdens, his reputation, about his obligations as a King. He never wanted to be a King but he's trying to make the best out of it. Of course he's stubborn and maybe a bit demanding, he's also using violence which isn't okay for everyone else but HOMRA but he's just doing all of it for one reason.The only reason he's still standing is his Clan, and his Clan only. He would give his life to every of his Clansmen if they would be in danger. It all has a reason and his reason is simply pain, on the other hand revenge.Mikoto lost his Aid and former Vessel just because some other King found it funny, it's obvious that his character changed drastically.From the K - Memories of Red Manga to the Adaption he went trough so many hells, but somehow he survived. The pain he felt would have ruined any other Character, but Mikoto is strong.All that is the reason that he is the only real King for me.Note: Character Developments are shown in Season 2 (S1 is only playing for a few days).Enjoyment: 10/10Well. K gave me a lot of Enjoyment, caused me a lot of pain and suffering, but also made me laugh so many times, the Anime sums up the given Genres nicely.It's the only show I've re-watched for more than 10 times and I'm still not bored of it and I guess that's a sign or something.Also K has one of the saddest Endings ever. It's still flashing me everytime I'm watching it.To every review a bit critism is needed I guess, so here we go:- On the one side the 13 episodes were enough, on the other side the plot rushed way too fast. I guess that can't be helped.- I'd wish for more backstory information about how the Slates has chosen the previous kings and what exactly is the course of the Weismann-Levels limit.With every more critism I'd spoiler a lot for the Second Season, but I also wrote a very short and spoiler-free Review for it a time ago.Overall: 10/10I don't care how bad Missing Kings or Return of Kings were. This is a Review for the first Season and that part of K will always stay as one of my favorite shows ever. I'm happy that I gave this show a look a long time ago.I would recommend K for everyone who likes beautiful and flashy Animation, historical references, fight scenes but also sad Moments and the bond of a Clan. named Isana Yashiro who's chased by weird looking man for no reason - actually, it has a reason.I won't tell anymore about the main plot for now, but I will talk a bit about the things that happened afterwards.Just a short time after Yashiro was chased by HOMRA, the Third and Red Clan, also Scepter 4, the Fourth and Blue Clan and lately the Second and Golden Clan start engaging into the action.K does may seem boring at the start, but with the actions of the other Clans more things, that are supposed to help understanding the storyline get exciting.After a few episodes of fighting between the rivals HOMRA and Scepter 4, their Kings Suoh Mikoto and Munakata Reisi finally are about to show their real power.Well, too many information already, but what the hell is a Synopsis.I just have to say about the Story: besides one other show it's the greatest Story I've ever seen.

There are scenes that made me wanna skip, and sometimes I would check if the episodes is nearly finished. I managed to bear through it wondering how it would end. At the end of a series, one would usually feel either ""ecstatic"" or ""disappointed"" but when I finished this, I didn\'t feel anything at all despite THAT ending.

K is an anime that made me want to speak my mind for the first time with the whole MAL community, so please bear with me. Am I here to bash K or to praise K? Neither. I just came to state my opinion, just like everyone else does. As you won’t hear me saying K was the best anime that ever existed, you will not hear me say it was the most epic fail of the whole fall anime season of 2012 (as I’ve read before).Story:Overall I think the story was very good. It had...everything to be perfect: a utopian city, Kings and their clansmen with supernatural powers, a hero trying to prove his innocence on a murder, a devoted and mysterious clansman, a girl/cat also with superpowers, you name it.However, and this is a common point between many reviewers so far, it had a lot to be explored and explained and that simply wasn’t. I feel like 13 episodes, for everything that HAD to be presented clearly to us viewers, weren’t enough. But I also think that for only 13 episodes it’s not as bad and horrid as many people point out. They made it 13 episodes long, we just have to accept the fact, it wasn’t our decision.Okay, so yes, there were many questions that arose to my head while watching the anime; probably they were the same as some of you viewers and reviewers had. Just to point out a few (spoiler alert):1. Who are these Kings, where do they come from and how did they get their powers (therefore also giving them to their clansmen)?2. Sword of Damocles? Okay, it’s apparently a “symbol of a king and manifests the truest image of its king’s condition” (Munakata, ep 10). From what little I could understand every time the Kings fight the Sword appears, but still… I guess this one relates to the first question.3. Weissman level? This one here got me really confused; I know Weissman had that experiment he showed to the future Gold King, but… I actually don’t quite get it.4. Kagutsu crater? From Munakata’s speech (ep 3) it was some kind of disaster caused by some excessive power usage, but it wasn’t fully detailed so one can only wonder.5. Also… what are those crazy robot things?! No one has mentioned them here at MAL yet in their reviews and seriously, their talking and crazy acting give me the creeps.6. And finally... what does K stand for?!Characters:Despite of the whole “poorly developed characters” speech I’ve been reading in pretty much every review, I feel like one should look at it with other eyes. If you can actually put that aside, you’ll realize that each character, despite their apparent complexity, actually has its own uniqueness to them. Even though you never get to know what they are thinking, you get pretty much a lot of dialogue between them that reveals you their nature. Don’t be lazy and actually try to read between the lines, don’t limit yourself to just listen to what the characters say.You can’t expect that in 13 episodes you’ll get major character progression. Dream all you want, but then you’d have no background story to focus on, just characters, their own life stories and relations.There are so many wonderful characters in this anime and the voice cast is as amazing as it can get (now this part may be a bit biased seeing as the cast counts with some of my favorite seiyuus of all times – Sakurai Takahiro, Miyano Mamoru, Fukuyama Jun and Nakamura Yuuichi).And, seeing as the characters are so complex, you get no insight and you have to do your own homework of trying to understand them, I could have only wished to more and more episodes just to unveil all of their pasts and relationships.Be aware of spoilers in the next paragraphs.For starters, my absolute favorite characters were Fushimi and Yata (along with their obvious lovexhate relationship). I love the fact that Fushimi is so sadistic and psychotic as much as I love Yata’s devotion to HOMRA and Mikoto. Yata is probably the earnest character you’ll get on this show (even more than Shiro). And even though you pretty much know their story (old friends, joined Mikoto and HOMRA, Fushimi gets jealous of Yata’s relationship with Mikoto, leaves out of said jealousy), I personally wanted to know more.What you probably wanted to know more of was the MunakataxMikoto relationship. First of all it’s obvious they knew each other prior to becoming Kings (in my understanding), but whatever happened between those two events (meeting and the ‘present’) we don’t know and pretty much will remain oblivious to if they don’t explain it further in the second season (which is a topic I’ll be addressing to in the end).Now one relationship that makes me conflicted: ShiroxKuroh. Okay, so most of us Westerns were wondering: “WHY THE HELL DOESN’T KUROH JUST KILL SHIRO RIGHT AWAY?!” (am I right, or what?). But one thing we have to understand is that Japanese mentality is nothing like ours. So the whole Shiro trying to explain himself and Kuroh not killing him right away became pretty much “acceptable” as soon as I passed that initial indignation phase.And I just talked about what appear to be the 3 main character bonds of the story.  But I was once more sunk into a sea of questions:1. Anna. She’s probably one of the best characters of this show by far. But everyone wants to know: the essence of her powers and why and how is she close to Mikoto in the first place.2. AwashimaxKusanagi. Like Munakata and Mikoto they obviously knew each other before HOMRA and SCEPTER 4, so… a little insight was needed on this.3. Miwa Ichigen. He’s pretty much a mystery and that’s it. We get to hear his “avant-garde poetry” and… that’s it.Art:I won’t delay myself in here, because it’s plain to see that the art is purely magnificent. So, there you go: magnificent.Music:I won’t talk about the OP and ED, just the BGM. It was simply fantastic. It’s probably one of the best anime soundtracks I’ve ever had the pleasure to listen to and the songs always fit perfectly into the mood of the scene.2nd Season:Okay, SPOILER ALERT (if you haven’t watched this anime yet, I recommend skipping the next paragraph. You have been warned).My whole question about this: how can there be a second season when the apparent main character is dead? When Mikoto himself is dead? Unless this second season is, I don’t know, just in depth episodes on the characters relationships, or we meeting the other Kings because something tragic is about to happen, or even ALL of our questions being answered, I simply HAVE NO IDEA as to what the second season might be about. Seriously.To end this, I don’t know whether I should recommend this anime or not. Like everything in life, it isn’t perfect. It has some flaws, and I’ve gone through some of them, those that I found the most relevant in my way of thinking. I think that, if you find the summary interesting, if the art captivates you, if you’re simply curious, or whatever other reasons you may have to want to watch this anime, go right ahead and do it. Take your own conclusions as to this is a great anime or not. everything to be perfect: a utopian city, Kings and their clansmen with supernatural powers, a hero trying to prove his innocence on a murder, a devoted and mysterious clansman, a girl/cat also with superpowers, you name it.However, and this is a common point between many reviewers so far, it had a lot to be explored and explained and that simply wasn’t. I feel like 13 episodes, for everything that HAD to be presented clearly to us viewers, weren’t enough. But I also think that for only 13 episodes it’s not as bad and horrid as many people point out. They made it 13 episodes long, we just have to accept the fact, it wasn’t our decision.Okay, so yes, there were many questions that arose to my head while watching the anime; probably they were the same as some of you viewers and reviewers had. Just to point out a few (spoiler alert):1. Who are these Kings, where do they come from and how did they get their powers (therefore also giving them to their clansmen)?2. Sword of Damocles? Okay, it’s apparently a “symbol of a king and manifests the truest image of its king’s condition” (Munakata, ep 10). From what little I could understand every time the Kings fight the Sword appears, but still… I guess this one relates to the first question.3. Weissman level? This one here got me really confused; I know Weissman had that experiment he showed to the future Gold King, but… I actually don’t quite get it.4. Kagutsu crater? From Munakata’s speech (ep 3) it was some kind of disaster caused by some excessive power usage, but it wasn’t fully detailed so one can only wonder.5. Also… what are those crazy robot things?! No one has mentioned them here at MAL yet in their reviews and seriously, their talking and crazy acting give me the creeps.6.

Take your own conclusions as to this is a great anime or not.', 'K Project or ""K"", has been the talk of the viewers since it was released. It was expected to achieve greatness, and in cases it did. However, it gathered it\'s own share of haters as well, mostly because of its incomplete and vague description of the story and setup. Personally I believe that K has described enough, it could have been much longer, however, it didn\'t HAVE to be any longer than now. This is going to be my first review, so bear with me.Story - 7The anime depicts the story of a student, Isana Yashiro, who was dragged into the battle of seven kings...with psychic abilities. Classic the story may be, the execution of that classic story was done quite well. The story, despite that was rather flawed. The explanations are quite lacking, the story occasionally got boring, and in the last episodes, too much story was crammed together. Even so it deseerves a 7.Art - 9The most impressive part about the anime is it\'s art. The backgrounds and characters are well drawn, except Yashiro, who had a disturbing length proportion. Even so it\'s art is one of it\'s strong points.Sound - 8The BGMs of this anime are very good. Character musics had their impact, which was quite crucial in this case actually. The OP and ED were decent, nothing particularly amazing. so 8 would do.Characters - 6The characters... well in this case K was lacking. Te characters were half-baked, not truly touching, and to be frank quite boring. Same old, same old, a carefree protagonist, a kind but violent king and a cold, calculative king.,funny female character, oblivious friends, uptight yet weird sidekick who appears to kill the protagonist and ends up helping him. They were fit for their role in the story, but regardless, a 6 would be enough.Enjoyment - 8I enjoyed the story. It was not something that would chain you with the chair, but it was good. However, it is notable that someone with  no taste in serious genre should not bother watching K. Because it\'s not dark, but it\'s pretty serious all the time.Overall - 7I wouldn\'t consider K to be an anime highly praised. However, I don\'t suppose it\'s that bad either. It has it\'s own charms, despite of it\'s flaws.Well, it\'s going to have a second season, so we can hope that the story would be expanded further. with psychic abilities.

And before everyone starts thinking ""Oh another one who didn\'t like K and just writes to make it bad"": NO, I think K has its good and its bad sites...Story:The story behing K is...complicated, to say the least. The first setting (seven kings and so on) sounds great and gives you everything you want. An interesting setting, a little bit of mystery and just enough comedic scenes to really entertain you.The problem is how the story evolved...without giving any spoilers, It just gets too complicated and too confusing. I liked...the flashbacks and everything but if you need a flashback in every episode to explain your story, something is seriously wrong -__-Art:The art...*sigh*...the characters itself look great. I really loved the details and the powers and everything related to their powers (the swords of damocles or what it is called) BUT for everything else...the colours were often just blurry or not strong enough. Some scenes just burned your eyes with the light colours and yea, overall, I hated the colours schemes of the anime.Sound:While the story was okay, the art a mix between good and bad...well, the sound...the sound was just awful. In action scenes the music took away everything related to action which rioned the scenes and sometimes there was no sound at all which was just annoying. The only good sound parts were the sad and touching scenes...argh...seriously I\'m getting angry just thinking about it...Characters:Like the setting -> just amazing! I loved the characters and the character design and they are probably the only reason I even finished the anime. The characters were great and I just wished some had a different story than they had...So for enjoyment and the overall score, K is a good anime. If you tend to fall for the characters and just watch a show because of them, K is perfect for you. If you want a cleanly drawn anime or some really exciting action scenes, watch something else. If you want an interesting story with a little bit mystery, good choice with this.I would recommend K if I knew the other person likes anime like this, otherwise no. But there is one light in the dark, the movie and the second season has better art and it seems like the sound is better too!!! So if you manage to watch this -> just continue, it gets better :D the flashbacks and everything but if you need a flashback in every episode to explain your story, something is seriously wrong -__-Art:The art...*sigh*...the characters itself look great.

So if you manage to watch this -> just continue, it gets better :D', 'As much as I personally love this anime, I\'m going to write this review unbiased...or try to.Know this: Alongside the anime are two mangas out. ""Memories of Red"" which is basically a memoir of HOMRA that comes before the anime, and ""Stray Dog Story"" which is Kuro\'s life before the anime. You don\'t need to read either of them to start the anime at all, but it is interesting for those who truly follow the franchise.Story: 8/10--It mainly follows three groups: Scepter 4, HOMRA, and Shiro\'s ragtag group (Shiro\'s being the absolute focus). It starts out very vague, and the very beginning may be a...turn off to some people because of the extremely broken English script, but once you get past that, it does pique your interest to see two feuding groups, and for no explicitly stated reason. The transition into the next episode is very vague. Rather, the whole anime happens to be vague a lot, but that may be a reason to keep you hanging on until the end, which isn\'t that far away considering it\'s very short (only consisting of 13 eps). A lot of times you will be left with a cliff hanger at the end, and even by the time you finish the whole thing, you\'re left with wondering questions. It\'s rather rushed, and we don\'t know the whole detail for anything really...Art: 9/10--The CGI incorporation is pretty amazing. The level of FX in this is above the standard for anime, which is what I really like. The art of the characters aren\'t too unique, but I do prefer the style to others. The coloring kind of threw me off. It\'s very bright in a lot of the scenes. So much so, you lose the details of some characters. The background art is amazing, while some things are rather bland, they did put a lot of extra details into the buildings, if you have an eye to pay attention to it. There are a few inconsistencies that can be spotted, but nothing too big or attention grabbing.Sound: 10/10--The soundtrack is very calming for the most part, but when the mood changes, it usually matches well. The soundtrack is also very limited. You\'ll notice that the anime repeats the same tracks in multiple episodes, but at least it\'s not annoying. It\'s rather intense. It\'s light sometimes and easy to listen to, and other times it\'s rather heavy, but nonetheless it does matches the mood quite nicely. I personally hated the OP and ED, but I don\'t usually count either of those when I rate the sound. The FX sounds were pretty good. I would say that they would make great ringtones as notification sounds. The voice acting: 100% right. I felt that all the characters were truly matched well with their given voice actors. Nothing felt awkward about their voices to the characters at all.Character: 7/10--Some people will say that there are a lot of characters, but it\'s not hard to fish out which ones are actually important. Pros: The characters strongly have their own personalities that sets them apart from one another. Those that get enough screentime definitely leave their mark. Cons: Some characters that should have gotten more screentime, didn\'t. We don\'t know enough about certain characters when we should. I\'ll tell you right now, reading the mangas won\'t tell you much even still. I did find one particular character to be intolerable, and that\'s Neko. It may just be how useless I thought she was, or how annoying she ended up being. Nonetheless, she happens to be a key character. By the end of this anime, you\'ll probably remember maybe 7 characters top and that\'s because they happen to get the most screentime.Enjoyment: 10/10--Despite there being a lack of a solid foundation, it does show promise. I enjoyed following what would happen between the two feuding kings, and now I still wonder what happened by the end of it. There was an announcement saying that there will be a second season, but I wonder what they will do since at least three key players that made, what little of the plot there was, the series continue. turn off to some people because of the extremely broken English script, but once you get past that, it does pique your interest to see two feuding groups, and for no explicitly stated reason.

It is rather pretty and frankly, the world is fun and interesting. I would love to see more of the world because there are definitely some other things that can be done. It was really good and for that alone, I fun watching it.The story was a bit much especially towards the end (not the actual ending that was a great way to end it though, it was just the last few parts). It kept doing twists and they...weren't all that bad but again after a certain point, the twists went from interesting reveals that furthered the mystery to reveals that were there just to rush the story ahead when it didn't earn it. The reveals they showed towards the end while not necessarily bad were definitely premature.The characters were fine but nothing amazing. Some say they were all the same (loner silent badasses) and while I understand that criticism I think there are enough different types of characters that it isn't fair to say that. It is mostly the kings who are like that and that is sort of commented on and makes sense for what they are going with. Now what can't be forgiven is that they don't develop at all. I can't think of an example of a character being developed and some really needed to be developed further to make the characters better. They should have fleshed them out more at the very least. They have really interesting characters with good concepts but for them to work in the story and to make the good concepts into good characters we need them to be fleshed out and they weren't which was disappointingI think someone said it best that this is a 24 episode series that got 13 episodes. The plot needed more time and so did the characters. Plus the world was interesting enough and a lot of it was left hinted at and unexplored that it would have been entertaining. It had a lot of potential and it developed that potential further but it just never paid off.Ultimately I had fun watching it and if you are interested in this and you want something fun with some good potential to watch then this is for you.

Well I hoped so too, But sadly K fails to work up its plot and characters for the sake of fan service, and looking cool in a very cringe way.In a typical story you would make sure your viewers understand the limits of this worlds power system, K didn\'t set limits, in fact K didn\'t try to explain anything at all about that. Powers were just there for the sake of looking flashy and cool. Another one of the biggest mistakes K did with it\'s story is to add an unnecessary school...setting. If you remove that part of the story, it would make it so much better. Because it simply didn\'t add anything worth while to the story. It should\'ve focused on it\'s main ""Mystery"" theme and developed it\'s main cast instead of adding a new character every episode. That would at least made it some what enjoyable, But the story just fell off because there never was any ground work to build upon it.In terms of Art direction K looks nice but sometimes the White filter gets so intense that the shots loose the initial quality they had. The animation team did a good job with it\'s choreography. All in all The art is what you\'d expect from from an average anime. The character designs were very forgettable and you can easily mix a specific two, because of the way they\'re introduced.The sound wasn\'t anything special. overall a fine soundtrack so don\'t expect a FLCL level soundtrack. The OP was ok, and the ED was very average.As for the character... oh boy! Their pacing was horrendous, characters would be introduced and in the next frame be a completely different person. There is a Cat-girl for some reason? doesn\'t do anything but fanservice. The only interesting characters were forced into the background and any interest I had in them would be gone by the time I saw them again, that\'s how little screen time they get. The show itself doesn\'t know which characters are important or which ones are not, so you get these very undeveloped side characters suddenly at the center of everything going on. The main trio were annoying and their friendship felt very forced. None of them drew me in or made me interested in them. One is fan service, one is shallow, and MC is very op because he is the MC.Lastly the ending was very anticlimactic and could\'ve easily been different if a single character could use 1% of their brain. The ""mystery"" was solved and I felt nothing. Even the characters were disappointed with it.I didn\'t get a lot of enjoyment out of this, besides some of the choreography. There\'s a sequel movie but.. why? I would only go for it if you like fanservice or some background noise.Overall 3/10, Wouldn\'t recommend. setting.

The only interesting characters were forced into the background and any interest I had in them would be gone by the time I saw them again, that\'s how little screen time they get. The show itself doesn\'t know which characters are important or which ones are not, so you get these very undeveloped side characters suddenly at the center of everything going on. The main trio were annoying and their friendship felt very forced. None of them drew me in or made me interested in them. One is fan service, one is shallow, and MC is very op because he is the MC.Lastly the ending was very anticlimactic and could\'ve easily been different if a single character could use 1% of their brain. The ""mystery"" was solved and I felt nothing. Even the characters were disappointed with it.I didn\'t get a lot of enjoyment out of this, besides some of the choreography. There\'s a sequel movie but.. why? I would only go for it if you like fanservice or some background noise.Overall 3/10, Wouldn\'t recommend.', 'Hype is a funny thing - it can either draw attention to a good show that would otherwise not receive any, or it can build anticipation for a show that otherwise would not deserve it. Unfortunately, K falls largely into the latter. It is not bad, but it certainly did not live up to expectations. The central conflict is so poorly defined that it is difficult to determine what the different factions stand to gain by winning, or why they are even fighting in the first place. This may be one of those things that is better explained in the manga or the upcoming second...season, but if that is the case then the first season of K looks even weaker as a result; a story that is intentionally vague because it is assumed that the audience is either familiar with the source material or is willing to stay for a second season does nothing but diminish any merit it has. While entertaining, K feels far too incomplete to warrant a second viewing and raises doubts as to the necessity of watching another season. season, but if that is the case then the first season of K looks even weaker as a result; a story that is intentionally vague because it is assumed that the audience is either familiar with the source material or is willing to stay for a second season does nothing but diminish any merit it has. While entertaining, K feels far too incomplete to warrant a second viewing and raises doubts as to the necessity of watching another season.', 'About the STORYAttention-grabber from the moment it starts. Cool and exciting appearances and fight scenes right off the bat. Interesting concept for the plot. However, it may not be as surprising if you have seen so many animes with the same storyline.  Every episode needs to be watched carefully in order to know and understand the mystery plot of the story.About the CHARACTERSFor a 13-episode long series, there’s a huge lists of characters to choose from. Almost all of them are interesting and would leave such impression which is very rare nowadays with the long lists of animes released every season. And besides the...interesting part, there are so many cool characters that any shounen viewers would enjoy.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDSThe animation is definitely one of the best of 2012 with its unique and intensifying graphics and effects. The fight scenes are one of the most exciting out there. That being said, it still lacks in the details department. If there are more details in the fighting rather than effects alone then it might be able to go on par with some famous resident shounen action series. The amazing animation is even accompanied by cool soundtracks. The character designs are very noticeable with its distinctive and gorgeous layouts. Another thing which makes the series a huge “project” is the gathering of almost all the most famous and multi-awarded seiyuus.About the ENJOYMENTNon-stop excitement and enjoyment for the plot but the flow of the story is not particularly new. And the action part has so much potential if only there are more details with the fight scenes. But still, it’s been a while since I’ve enjoyed anime this much. interesting part, there are so many cool characters that any shounen viewers would enjoy.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDSThe animation is definitely one of the best of 2012 with its unique and intensifying graphics and effects.

K is full of abstract settings, mysterious story, cocky shounen characters, good climax, nice art,  but nothing the nothing to hold them together. Like maybe the character build up could have been emphasized or just story could've been more solid. But unfortunately its all abstract be art, story or sound. Its one of those animes that don't disappoint much because they don't promise...much. much."", ""6 months ago, I have dropped this anime even thou I haven't watched half of the first episode..I don’t know why but I have came a cross it the other week and wanted to watch the first episode again to give it at least a chance.. Let me tell you I was done with the whole season in less than 6 hrs.It kind of grows on you. The story is so original and captivating. The action scenes are so creative..the best i've seen so far although there were few (too bad). The story builds up steadily but not with much details.Anyways, there is a...2nd season so I'm super happy about it..Can't wait to watch itSo glad that i gave it a second chance 2nd season so I'm super happy about it..Can't wait to watch itSo glad that i gave it a second chance"", 'I really enjoyed this series. Isana,Kuro, Fushimi, and Munakata were my favorites out of this series. I happen to think that there could have been more episodes to show what happened after the 13th episode. I hope to see more ', 'I thought K project was quite interesting. The graphics and music went really well with the flow of the show. The graphics caught my attention because it had much sharper images and it didn\'t look like any of the old style anime. The beginning of the anime was quite interesting, where Kuro, one of the characters attempts to kill Shiro, the ""good guy"". As the show goes, I my opinion, the plot does get interesting despite the holes and I did become curious about what was going on with the characters, but I was really disappointed with the last episode. I was able to accept...how slow the show went - but at the end - I was very pissed off because there were way to many pointless gaps - to the point where even if someone were to analyze the show, some of the events didn\'t add up such as - to avoid any spoilers I\'ll try to keep this vague as possible - the events between the red and blue king and their history. I would recommend that you watch this anime if you love action anime ( with a small twist of humor)  and are patent (or good and skimming anime) and if you love good graphics (one of the things that I loved the most). This anime kept me curious until the disappointing end, but I think the first 12 do have their interesting points to them. :) how slow the show went - but at the end - I was very pissed off because there were way to many pointless gaps - to the point where even if someone were to analyze the show, some of the events didn\'t add up such as - to avoid any spoilers I\'ll try to keep this vague as possible - the events between the red and blue king and their history.

K (or referred sometimes as K Project) is a 2012 anime series animated by the studio GoHands and directed by Shingo Suzuki, who also serves as character designer for the series.this series is very interesting indeed with a large cast and stunning animation its simply one of the best animes to come out in the 2012 fall period. however due to some kids poor ability\'s to understand a plot this anime has been getting poor...scores. these people are complete Baka they rate it so low because ""they dont understand"" or ""there\'s no foreshadowing"" something like that. also may i add that the same people who underrate this show also gave SAO 10/10 witch has more plot holes then K and also make\'s absolutely no sense.. anyway here is my reviewPlot: 7Yashiro Isana has lived a relatively ordinary, simple life. He lives in the technology-advanced Shizume City and attends Ashinaka High School, a notable high school that is located on an island just outside the areas. Yashiro is friendly with everyone. Nothing ever seems wrong about him, except perhaps his habit of forgetting where his school-issued PDA is.However, nothing normal has been happening since the recent murder of Tatara Totsuka, prominent member of the infamous HOMRA.

Seeking vengeance, the Red Clansmen of HOMRA set out to get Yashiro and kill him.OK now may i add not every plot is perfect and yes i agree K hasn\'t got the best story. is full of holes and most things were left an answered at the end of the 13th episode but you cant expect 13 episodes to explain everything to you. however the story was pretty interesting to watch waiting to see who\'s the killer and whatnot was really exciting. good thing there\'s a sequel .Art: 10i dont think i need to explain why this gets a perfect score.Sound: 9K has one of the best ED songs to come out in 2012 and is absolutely beautiful and the sound track is also lovely. that\'s about all i can say here im not very good in this areaCharacter: 7People who tell you that this show has weak character development or that the characters are generic are wrong.

It is well written to pull together action, mystery, humor, and even some feels. It is not particularly unique and is full of the typical anime tropes that most high school setting\'s entail. Additionally, the show starts off by giving you too much information, and hoping that you\'ll retain it all by the time everything starts to make sense. However it is one of those stories that gets better and better with each episode. From episode 4 on, the shows momentum cannot be stopped, and even the...flashes of backstory are well placed and only serve to improve your understanding of the plot.The characters in this show were easily the strongest element not provided by the production studio. Despite the small episode count, K included at least a dozen intriguing characters with the only major flaw being that we couldn\'t see more of them. The writers foiled characters to each other and provided just the right amount of backstory to develop several major players far more effectively than most 13 episode anime.There is not much I can say about this soundtrack that would do it justice. It is beautiful. I believe that anyone who watched nothing but the first 30 seconds could not honestly deny the quality of the music. Not only is it stunning, but it sets the tone for the show as a whole, and makes an ordinary scene come alive, while augmenting the impact of the more emotional scenes.The art is stunning as well, rounding out the incredibly positive impact the studio (GoHands) had on the quality of this anime.Ok, I added in another category below where I justify any other positives or negatives that wouldn\'t perfectly fit into one of the 5 categories provided. For example, I was incredibly annoyed by a few of the minor plot devices between episodes 2 and 4. I would also point out that many of the interesting characters were not fully developed in K, which was bothersome, but were developed in the second season.

That is how I feel about this anime.Though it starts out vague, pieces start coming together along the story, and it makes you wonder and crave for more. The interesting characters, the stunning artwork, and the battle scenes are all fun to watch and interesting to see.I find this anime to be one of my favorites, and here's why:...The story line is in fact a bit sloppy and the background is a bit vague, but I believe the series completely makes up for it.So here we have cute, happy-go-lucky, slippery, tricky Isana Yashiro. He kept me interesting right off the bat, being the lovable character he portrays. Getting himself out of sticky situations seems to be his thing, and he's great at it. His interactions with other characters is hilarious as well, and he's just the sweetest thing, even though he can be a little brat sometimes.All of the characters were unique and original, having flawed but lovable personalities and attributes, and you find yourself rooting for characters on all teams. There wasn't really any of them that bothered me at all, except for Awashima on SCEPTER 4. Because we all know that huge bobbed chick is on the show purely for fan service.Now, the plot line. While it starts off strange, I found myself getting engaged immediately with the mysterious, different atmosphere the anime gives off. The Red King and his clansmen were probably my favorites, aside from Shiro and the gang. Anyway, it's a little sloppy like I said, but it comes together in the end well enough, and it comes together nicely in my opinion. I can't say I am too pleased with how it ended, but I'm positive MISSING KINGS promising PV tells me the movie is going to make up for it. It was extremely interesting in my opinion, and I find myself rewatching it over and over again.The music was great. It was new and jazzy. Lovely, calming tunes to fun little battle tunes. I like to listen to the sound track once in a while, it's so leisure and I absolutely loved it!The sound was pretty good, and I didn't find anything wrong with it. They had the little details down perfectly.The art was very unique and refreshing, with very different looking characters. I'm always annoyed when I find art that makes all of the characters look similar, but this one definitely differs from the rest. I highly enjoyed how they did it.I absolutely enjoyed this to the max. As you can tell from my almost perfect ratings. I don't find many anime that I watch all in one day, but this one too the cake for sure. I watch it all the time and anticipate the movie. I think it was put together nicely and had a very nice feeling to it, and you grow attached to characters. Even though we didn't see too much of Totsuka, I absolutely fell in love with him!

Add in some strong characters and a good story, and I\'m in Anime bliss mode. If this is your flavor, I seriously suggest you watch ""K"".The total package is as good as I\'ve watched in years. The art work is among the best of the decade, the story is strong and complex enough to keep your interest, but not so complex as to leave you confused. At only 13 episodes, it goes at a fast pace and is totally binge-worthy. Good and diverse group of characters with adequate time...given to each for depth development. Great sound effects bring the amazing battle scenes to another level and the soundtrack itself is pretty darn good, too.A few down spots though, the build up was so good that it left something to be desired come the final battle. I didn\'t feel finished, luckily enough there is more that takes place after this. So, I suppose they were leaving us hungry for more to come. I enjoy fan service, but the character of Neko was just catering to the shadier side of Anime fans. Picture this; a curvy, magical, super loyal, cat lady who loves to run around naked... O_O ...wow! Something for everyone, I guess.Sub vs. Dub is a decisive win for the sub. Native Japanese works better in a series that takes place in Japan, yes, but that aside the Japanese cast out-performs the English one by far. Especially Kenjirou Tsuda as Mikoto, who just personifies the character perfectly with his calm, but powerful, performance.Anime fans everywhere should give this show a watch and should enjoy it greatly for in a show about kings, it does lay claim to a crown in pound-for-pound entertainment.

Cheers!', ""K was an anime that I honestly expected to like, but I was severely let down. In my opinion, it had great potential, but the story and characters weren't well-developed and were simply disappointing.I'm going to start with the things I liked about the show. First of all, I loved the art style and the scenery, the character design was also very much to my liking. The music was excellent and it perfectly fit the scenes. I have seen many people praise the artwork and music, but I do have a complaint regarding the artwork - the characters' faces lacked expressions. There were many scenes...where the characters, instead of looking shocked, just looked a bit surprised. I do think they could've worked on the expressions more, but other than that, I have no complaints.Moving on to things I didn't like. First and foremost - the very first episode. We are introduced to way too many characters at once and are given no time to connect with any of them. The story isn't even properly explained until the third episode. I think that this could've all been fixed if the show had around 25 episodes instead of only 13. That way, we would've had enough time to get to know the characters and the story would've been explained a lot better. Another big problem is that the characters have barely any personality, which makes it very difficult to connect with them and care about them. The main character is just your stereotypical protagonist: nice, funny and outgoing. He doesn't even get enough screentime with all these other characters around, so that's pretty much all we know about his personality. This brings me back to the problem I mentioned earlier - Too. Many. Characters. You can't have 15-20 important characters in a 13 episode anime. Having a lot of side characters is okay, but having so many characters that serve a purpose in the plot is quite overwhelming. Again, this would've been fixed if the anime was longer. The story was an interesting idea, but poorly executed. We don't even get introduced to all the kings during the first season, which I found very disappointing. The plot twists would've been much more shocking if - you guessed it - the show had more episodes.Overall, I expected more from this anime and I'm sad that it couldn't have been longer and better developed, because it truly had great potential and could've become one of my favorite anime series. where the characters, instead of looking shocked, just looked a bit surprised.

The motion is fluid, from fights to skateboarding to just running, and it just carries you along with it in a wave of awesome. The characters are drawn extremely well—most of the time, their emotions are shown beautifully in their expressions, eyes, or postures. And, of course, there are the comedic moments with all the sparkles and big eyes, also drawn very well.SOUND: 9The soundtrack amazing. There are a lot of fairly unmemorable tracks, and a few that are just bad, but for the...most part, the soundtracks of both seasons are brilliant, and are great to use as background music when cleaning or doing homework. Some of my favorites from both seasons are Knock-On Effect, If You Die (all the sarumi), Kindling, Knight, and Kitten, but I honestly love almost all the tracks. As a background soundtrack for an anime, the music is wonderful, too. It always fits the scenes brilliantly, and is very pleasant to the ears. There are times when the most soothing music is played during a high-energy battle, and it seems strange, but somehow it all comes together perfectly.The voice acting, too, is great. The emotions of the characters are captured brilliantly, and even the nameless characters sound realistic, natural, and unique, for the most part.STORY: 8The first season was amazing, amazing, amazing! The plot reveals everything to you very, very slowly, allowing you to know barely anything more than Shiro, the main protagonist, did, while teasing you with enough extra information to make you want more. There are lots of twists and turns, and the show keeps you guessing the whole while, and then pulls the rug out from under you in a series of interesting twists, some of which make you relieved, others of which make you want to cry. The first season, on its own, would get a 9 or even a 10 out of 10.The second season was a bit of a let-down after the first, as the first few episodes really seemed to drag. In addition, there was a lot more fan service in the second season, and I mean really blatant boob and panty shots, which was annoying and unnecessary. However, about halfway through, it picked up again, and even lessened the fan service a little, going more into some interesting new characters and bringing even more twists and turns, although these weren’t quite as engaging as those of the first season. The ending, however, was solid—once again, a rug was pulled, and once again, it was done well. The second season also some some interesting character development from characters that weren’t developed that much in the first season, which was nice.All in all, the story is mostly amazing, with some disappointments and downhill moments here and there, but in the end it all really comes together and leaves you satisfied.IMPORTANT NOTE. There is an end credit scene in the final episode of season two, which will tie up some loose ends, so you’ll have to watch for that.There’s also K: Missing Kings, a movie set between the seasons that explains what happened in the year that passed between them. You don't need it to understand RoK, but you should watch it anyway because it's pretty good, although there are some fight scenes that last way too long. I skimmed through it, and only watched parts that interested me, but I'd still recommend watching it for those few particularly great scenes.CHARACTERS: 9I saved best for last—despite not having the highest mark of the four topics I discussed, the characters of this show are probably my favorite part about it. They’re all engaging and unique, but not so exaggeratedly unique that it feels forced, and all of them have strengths and failings that you often can’t help but love. The antagonists are fascinating, whether they are malicious or misguided or just bored, and the protagonists… well, you either want to bow to them or hug them tightly and give them cake. Or both. Even the secondary and/or nameless characters, as I said before, are given just enough variety in the background to make them seem like unique individuals, rather than just one, faceless mass. The main characters also get a lot of development, be it personal characteristics or ideals, strengths, weaknesses, friendships, or other, which are sometimes executed gradually, and sometimes happen all at once, but it always feels natural, and the characters are almost always better characters for it. There’s even more development to be found in the light novels (for example, Misaki and Saruhiko’s story in ‘K: Lost Small World’) that adds on to everything in the show, helping you to understand why the characters are the way they are, or how they changed during or in between the seasons.All in all, K is a ‘masterpiece’ in my list, and I love its art, sound, story, and especially its characters. It’s 26 episodes in total (not including the movie), and I honestly think that that’s 8.67ish hours well spent, so, regardless of who you are or what you usually watch, you should watch this. most part, the soundtracks of both seasons are brilliant, and are great to use as background music when cleaning or doing homework. Some of my favorites from both seasons are Knock-On Effect, If You Die (all the sarumi), Kindling, Knight, and Kitten, but I honestly love almost all the tracks. As a background soundtrack for an anime, the music is wonderful, too. It always fits the scenes brilliantly, and is very pleasant to the ears. There are times when the most soothing music is played during a high-energy battle, and it seems strange, but somehow it all comes together perfectly.The voice acting, too, is great. The emotions of the characters are captured brilliantly, and even the nameless characters sound realistic, natural, and unique, for the most part.STORY: 8The first season was amazing, amazing, amazing! The plot reveals everything to you very, very slowly, allowing you to know barely anything more than Shiro, the main protagonist, did, while teasing you with enough extra information to make you want more. There are lots of twists and turns, and the show keeps you guessing the whole while, and then pulls the rug out from under you in a series of interesting twists, some of which make you relieved, others of which make you want to cry. The first season, on its own, would get a 9 or even a 10 out of 10.The second season was a bit of a let-down after the first, as the first few episodes really seemed to drag. In addition, there was a lot more fan service in the second season, and I mean really blatant boob and panty shots, which was annoying and unnecessary. However, about halfway through, it picked up again, and even lessened the fan service a little, going more into some interesting new characters and bringing even more twists and turns, although these weren’t quite as engaging as those of the first season. The ending, however, was solid—once again, a rug was pulled, and once again, it was done well. The second season also some some interesting character development from characters that weren’t developed that much in the first season, which was nice.All in all, the story is mostly amazing, with some disappointments and downhill moments here and there, but in the end it all really comes together and leaves you satisfied.IMPORTANT NOTE. There is an end credit scene in the final episode of season two, which will tie up some loose ends, so you’ll have to watch for that.There’s also K: Missing Kings, a movie set between the seasons that explains what happened in the year that passed between them. You don't need it to understand RoK, but you should watch it anyway because it's pretty good, although there are some fight scenes that last way too long. I skimmed through it, and only watched parts that interested me, but I'd still recommend watching it for those few particularly great scenes.CHARACTERS: 9I saved best for last—despite not having the highest mark of the four topics I discussed, the characters of this show are probably my favorite part about it. They’re all engaging and unique, but not so exaggeratedly unique that it feels forced, and all of them have strengths and failings that you often can’t help but love. The antagonists are fascinating, whether they are malicious or misguided or just bored, and the protagonists… well, you either want to bow to them or hug them tightly and give them cake. Or both. Even the secondary and/or nameless characters, as I said before, are given just enough variety in the background to make them seem like unique individuals, rather than just one, faceless mass. The main characters also get a lot of development, be it personal characteristics or ideals, strengths, weaknesses, friendships, or other, which are sometimes executed gradually, and sometimes happen all at once, but it always feels natural, and the characters are almost always better characters for it.

Its one of those animes full of sensory overload. Bright colors, beautiful music, and great characters ....... oh wait it is missing something great characters. Peoples beef with this show is that that characters are not flushed out and the story is very all over the place. The real problem of the story is not the story the characters or length. Its the fact its too complicated to put into show formula. Let just compare this show to another one that i think is very much like it. Air Gear... we got kings, big tits,...guy who can fly, amazing sound track, good art, and a strong sense of story. The problem is just like Air Gear this is a go read the manga or search on the internet kinda anime. Wtf is the Sword  go on goggle or read the bible.What does yata mean again go to the internet. What is the colorless kings clansmen power .......... go read the ..... wait their is not source material. So unlike airgear this is a go read the 5 other manga i published while making this show kinda anime. Overall if your a fan of airgear and your willing to slum it through the internet to read the manga (if its even available online) its prob a decent show but its not because it does not have any cohesive plot that is contained in one manga. guy who can fly, amazing sound track, good art, and a strong sense of story.

The story arc of this show is very much like an exponential curve, with the first few episodes going incredibly slow, being inconsistent in mood and pace and overall being a hot mess of storytelling. I went into the show expecting to get a mix...of lighter mafia drama and some supernatural stuff, and what do I get? Excessive screentime of a white-haired school kid running around the place with his umbrella.However, the tension finally begins to rise when the gangs are finally thrown into the mix. And it rises high. An excessive amount of characters normally goes south very quickly, sacrificing quality for quantity. Not here. They are all different, yet understandable and full of secrets. They feel like real people.And don\'t even get me started on the ending. That was awesome.It is pretty clear that this show attempted to do what I call ""puzzle-solving"". All the pieces, seemingly unconnected, are laid out in the beginning, and in a series of mind-blowing plot twists are brought together to finally all click into place, preferably in the last episode. Shows that did this incredibly well are Baccano and Durarara, K however lacks in that department.So what makes this show worth watching?The emotional appeal. It\'s true that the storytelling could have been improved, that the choice of main character was kinda weak and Mikoto Suoh got barely any screentime, but in my opinion this is exactly the reason why the ending is so strong. As viewers, we got to experience the birth of a legend not from the perspective of a king, but from his clansmen. We experienced two kings making all the wrong decisions because they couldn\'t possibly know the whole picture, while we could only sit and watch. We saw all these characters who couldn\'t be more different from each other being defeated by their own flaws one after another.The details in building the world and characters, like that the clans actually named themselves in a way that would come natural to them in the real world instead of just using the color terms. The red king\'s earring that they don\'t even bother to draw attention to. The fact that they only hint the existence of a green clan in the background, and that everyone who bothers to count realizes that one clan is completely missing. An entire character only developed to show the flaws of the whole clan system by possessing the power of two.The whole show feels like a work of art, with powerful symbolism all over the place, visual appeal to the finest and one of the best soundtracks I ever heard.Because what genuinely great puzzle-solving shows like Baccano didn\'t manage to do, is to get on my emotional side. Too much violence and mindfuck makes the show feel like a game of who can connect the dots fastest. I am an adult, I love it when they dare to kill characters. But when a show like K make me wish for plot armor, I know that it did something right.K was a show that missed many chances, but still managed to be great.That is the true tragedy, knowing that it still could have been so much better. of lighter mafia drama and some supernatural stuff, and what do I get?

This may be due in part to the budget and the short length of the series, but I am disappointed by how this anime threw away its enormous potential by limiting the much needed character development of its protagonists. I was attracted to Mikoto but did not know enough about him to actually fall in love. :( Such a shame because Mikoto had all the personality traits to drive a girl like me crazy (i.e. good looking, bad-ass aura, reserved, caring, and powerful) but too little was revealed about him to...leave a lasting impression.This anime is solely eye candy. If you want an interesting plot look somewhere else. Also leave a lasting impression.This anime is solely eye candy. If you want an interesting plot look somewhere else. Also', 'Story:9Our story begins with our friendly slacker guy Shiro. He\'s basically the silly guy that everyone loves. He gets accused of killing a gang member begining his quest for clearing his name. The story itself is quite confusing, and kinda slow at the beginning, but overall it\'s pretty good. Once your done you\'ll probably end up wanting more.Art:7 and Sound:7Pretty good art work. Though its the kind you can see with most other anime. Though the fight scenes and anything magic scenes were really cool. Though one thing I question is if the artist\'s are fans of BL. I just saw a lot of scenes...where I thought ""that\'s pretty close to kissing."" maybe it\'s just me. As for sound the battle music, or maybe the before battle music was the only thing that stood out.Characters:8The characters were interesting. Despite the show only having thirteen episodes they\'re relationship were developed it quite well. Though even with these I thought BL... I don\'t know why? It made me question if they were trying to make us ship characters.Overall:7There was times when I felt this show kinda dragged on but once I finished it I realized I really enjoyed it. I\'m not a big fan of action so action fans should watch it probably. Though BL fans that like BL that\'s implied should watch it.

The plot can be confusing at times considering the anime seems to leave out explanations and clarifications for the audience, but by the end, I think that the watcher might be able to figure the majority of the missing pieces.Story 7: As mentioned above, the plot seems to be missing a few explanations from previous events prior to the time setting that this anime takes place. Despite spending a good...amount of time being confused, I still enjoyed the story.Art 10: Probably the best quality of this anime is the art. It's very clear and crisp; which I think helps see what is going on exactly during the fight scenes. The art is beautiful and it will stick in your mind the most.Sound 6: Personally, I'm not a huge fan for the urban genre of music that is played throughout the show. I'm not going to be rude and give it a terrible rating, because in all honesty, it wouldn't be fair of me to do that because it's not my taste and it's not a terrible soundtrack either. It fits the style of the anime and the scenes well, considering it takes place is a busy city in Japan. The music could be a bit more dramatic in my book, especially for the final battles and such. The opening is strange, but I think the ending song is great.Character 7: This is probably where K is most cliche; the protagonist is a cheerful guy, a mysterious, skillful 'sidekick' and a cute, perky chested, ditsy female friend. Sure, it's cliche but these type of characters are sill and always will be enjoyable. The only problem I had with the characters that I found it hard to make some kind of emotional connection with them. This probably has to do with that there isn't much focus on character development or the past of the characters. There are small flashbacks here and there in some episodes, but it's not enough to fully understand why the characters are the way they are (with the exception of Shiro). This is probably due to the fact that this is a 13 episode anime, which often doesn't allow much room for development of the characters. Overall, the characters are still enjoyable and favorable.Enjoyment 9: Despite the lack of character development, I still managed to enjoy this anime very much.Overall 8: Yes, K has plenty of flaws (I'm pretty sure every anime has it's flaws; no anime is perfect), but with the exceptional art, interesting small plot, and cool characters, it's a good anime and will keep you guessing what will happen next. The ending is unexpected (in my book), but amazing.

I actually quite enjoy this show, a lot, actually. I finished this show in 2 days, because I had stuff to do, but along with finishing this, I watched the movie of K, and the first episode of Return of Kings. This series is great, and I have to review it now, or I\'ll kill myself.Story: 9/10The story is great, calm down. Most people seem to think the story is horrible (I think, I kinda avoid reviews and scores) but the story is my favorite thing...after the characters. The story is absolutely fantastic, and I cannot be bothered writing much about it, I\'ll try to put it simply. A simple boy named Isana Yashiro is a normal boy at a high school, but after one day, he must go on the run from everyone because he killed someone without having any memory of it at all. My first reaction to that scene, where he talked was ""Lelouch? Jun Fukuyama?"" but... no, a completely different voice actor. But, Jun Fukuyama is in this series.Art: 8/10Simply put, the art is very good, the art style and the animation, good. Very. I don\'t really have much to say about it, just that it\'s good and it fits with the anime. That\'s it.Sound: 9/10The soundtrack is really amazing, my favorite track especially is Suoh Mikoto\'s theme. It\'s just so beautiful and the whole soundtrack is beautiful. It\'s one of the reasons I came to love the anime even more.Character: 10/10The characters in the show are really amazing, I can\'t think of any other show that has this great of characters, well, that\'s lying, I can think of plenty. But, Suoh Mikoto wasn\'t one of my favorite characers at first, but once a lot of stuff happened, he became one of my favorite characters in the series. He\'s such a great character and so is everyone else, but Suoh Mikoto is probably my favorite character out of them all.Overall: 9/10I give this anime an overall rating of 9/10.

I'm not sure why, but I guess most of those people want something that's easy to understand without having to actually think about it. I personally enjoyed this series a great deal. In fact, this is one of only three or for anime that I've personally enjoyed to the point where I'm giving it a 10/10.Story: The story is about a young man named Isana Yashiro, who supposedly murdered a member of a gang called Homra, and now several different people are after him. This 12 episode series follows his...journey as he tries to prove his innocence, discover the real killer, and learn more about himself in the process. Despite how that makes it sound like some kind of mystery series, I can assure that it's not - not fully, at least. If I had to call this series anything, I'd say it's a mixture of action, comedy, and drama with a little bit of mystery mixed in. It's also a very intelligent series, with a complex storyline and a large cast of characters.Artwork: The artwork in K-Project is absolutely gorgeous. Truly top tier. In all honesty, I think the artwork in this anime is better than almost any other anime out there. All of the characters are well-designed, and the backgrounds are just stunning. I don't think I've ever seen backgrounds that were so beautiful before. All of the characters also stand out quite well. The color pallet used for the characters creates a differentiation between background, main characters, and side characters. Furthermore, the use of 2D and 3D artwork is done rather seamlessly. I can tell they used 3D art in here, but it's done in such a way that you don't notice unless you really know what to look for.Animation: This is probably one of the few anime whose animation is almost completely without flaw. Throughout the entire season, I didn't find any of the mistakes that most animations tend to have. It was fluid and the transitions were smooth. What's more, all of the fight scenes were beyond amazing. I've watched a lot of anime with action in them, and very few can keep the same level of fluidity in their action scenes that they do in a normal scene where there isn't much going on. This one does that, and it does that well.Characters: One thing I truly loved about this anime definitely has to be its characters. All of the characters are well-done, fully-fleshed out, and have unique personalities, which is really quite amazing, considering how many characters this anime has. The three main characters, Isana Yashiro, Neko, and Kuro are all well-crafted. Yashiro acts like a lazy high school student who just wants to enjoy life, and yet you can tell that there is a lot more to him, even at first glance. There's a lot of mystery surrounding him. And, of course, there is Neko, the mysteriously beautiful girl who can turn into a cat. We don't know much about her backstory, but she has such a vibrant personality that we don't really need to. I loved watching her and seeing all the things she did. Kuro plays the straight man in this group. If Yashiro is lazy and Neko a glutton with little common sense, then Kuro is the one who keeps both of them from doing something stupid. Watching the three of them was a pleasure because every scene they had was interesting. Of course, there are many other characters, and each of them is unique and feels real.Also, can I just say that I ship this pairing so freaking hard? I do. NekoxShiro has officially become one of my favorite pairings of all time. In fact, if there is one thing that I was disappointed in with this anime, it's that these two never got together. I feel like these two were made for each other. Yashiro acts like a lazy young man whose kind of reckless and just likes to go with the flow, while Neko is a fun-loving girl who is completely devoted to him. I'm going to be honest, if these two don't get together in season 2, which comes out this October, I am gonna be so pissed off - so, so, so pissed off. I want to see them kiss so badly, and I really hope the animators make that happen. If not, I'm going to write a very strongly worded letter about how they've ruined my life by giving me such a cute couple and not going anywhere with it.Sound: I normally don't have a whole lot to say about sound quality, but I have to admit that it was really something here. First off, the opening theme song is beautiful, just beautiful. I absolutely loved it. The music has a rockish feel mixed with opera vocals. It was very provocative, and the ending theme song was also gorgeous. The sound effects were all nice to, and I loved the voice acting, both from the dubs and the subs. In fact, I think the English dubbing was even better than the subtitled version this time. The voice actors who played these characters in English really knew how to put emotion into their voice. It was quite good.While some people complained about this anime, I'm not going. People are welcome to agree or disagree with me, but this is definitely one of my favorite anime of all time. journey as he tries to prove his innocence, discover the real killer, and learn more about himself in the process. Despite how that makes it sound like some kind of mystery series, I can assure that it's not - not fully, at least. If I had to call this series anything, I'd say it's a mixture of action, comedy, and drama with a little bit of mystery mixed in. It's also a very intelligent series, with a complex storyline and a large cast of characters.Artwork: The artwork in K-Project is absolutely gorgeous. Truly top tier. In all honesty, I think the artwork in this anime is better than almost any other anime out there. All of the characters are well-designed, and the backgrounds are just stunning. I don't think I've ever seen backgrounds that were so beautiful before. All of the characters also stand out quite well.

The title implies that the producers were lazy in their naming, yet the animation is breathtakingly detailed. There\'s more bishounen guys than many a shoujo series, yet there\'s also a cat girl who shows up naked in your face all the time. The show is supposedly an original piece, yet it borrows heavily from other works. So what is K? Other than being a letter in a character\'s name, I\'m not sure what the title implies. Regardless, the series is about a dude who has apparently committed a murder. He now must prove his innocence while avoiding an insurmountable...opposition, his only hope being that there are multiple parties after him with differing goals. The series takes place in an alternative modern world where supernatural ""kings"" somehow have a political and economic control over Japan without the general populace knowing about it.While K is potentially a very deep series, way too many of the details are kept from the viewer, and important details are repeatedly kept until far too late in the series. K is not a series that hooks you on the plot, despite the interesting-sounding plot synopsis; this is mostly because the protagonist is an enigma who really isn\'t worth deciphering. Really, if it wasn\'t for the painstakingly-detailed animation and interesting technology in this parallel universe, I wouldn\'t have made it through this series. If you\'re looking for good action and outstanding animation, you\'ll be wowed by this series. If you\'re looking for a coherent plot or character development, I cannot recommend this one. There\'s supposedly a sequel for this series, maybe it may one day redeem it to some degree.Animation:Absolutely stunning. Expect excellent lighting, shadows, coloring, and detail everywhere. The file size alone per episode should give you an indication of the production quality- a rarity to find something with almost UFOTable levels of detail and lighting. Character-wise you have a fairly large cast, most of whom are easily identifiable. Most of the guys are drawn in a bishounen style yet I\'m pretty sure this is not targeted as a shojo. The only real downside to the animation is the depth of character expression. Perhaps the protagonist is supposed to be hard to figure out, but seriously sometimes you just can\'t tell what anyone\'s thinking/feeling. There\'s a significant amount of CGI usage though it isn\'t as bothersome as in other series.This is primarily an action series so you\'ll have quite a few battles, some of which have really nice choreography in addition to magical attacks/effects. When each of the kings fights, a huge CGI sword appears over them in the sky, signifying something that is never really explained. Expect a fair amount of blood and death. As for ecchi, you have a cat girl whose hair strategically covers certain body parts- but who is otherwise naked for quite a few scenes. This isn\'t an ecchi heavy series otherwise as supposedly the mood is medium-heavy.Sound:K\'s high production quality continues to shine in the audio department. The show opens with an Engrish song that makes no sense lyric wise and melody wise. However, it redeems itself with a superb ED sung by none other than Neko herself. It further redeems itself with a unique sounding BGM with some nice melodies, giving the series a cool and crisp feel to complement the shiny blue/green animation.K also has a lot of high-powered VAs as well. Daisuke Ono takes a primary role, and a lot of big VAs join him as supporting characters. Unfortunately, character development is something the producers overlooked so a lot of the talent is wasted. We even have Mamoru Miyano voicing a sadist, but with so little character background they could have used anyone!Story:What starts as a confusing, wtf show with lots of fighting and confusion ends up resolving with a really confusing wtf conclusion. There\'s just one central plot line with many flashbacks throughout. The series keeps progressing the central plot while giving you teasers about the past until finally, at the conclusion, everything is explained. And by everything, I mean nothing. Virtually 99% of the important background on characters and events is inexplicably left out. While this may work for a horror/psychological thriller, it totally doesn\'t make sense here and really ruins any expectations of a good score from me. There are two primary ways that a series can convince me to stay interested storywise- either have a strong character cast that I grow attached to or a cohesive and/or interesting plotline. This series lacks both.Character:You have a lot of characters to deal with in this series. There are students at the school, gang members in team red, cop wannabees in team blue, random ad hoc supporting characters for our confused protagonist, and an assortment of other kings. And to be honest, most of them are completely irrelevant to the plot. For instance, you have a loli girl who can magically move red spheres and predict where people are. Other than catering to loli-lovers, she has no role in the story whatsoever. Remove her and the overall plot would be virtually untouched. This same litmus test applies to a dozen of the ""supporting"" cast.Focusing on our protagonist, he\'s a confused dude who acts nonchalant all the time despite having to constantly run for life. You eventually learn a bit about who he is but not really anything significant enough to relate to him. He\'s supported by a cat girl and a tsundere Daisuke Ono, who both have virtually no explication whatsoever. They\'re basically there to save Yashiro\'s ass when he gets into trouble.So you have a lot of characters with interesting traits but virtually no development or viewer attachment. Relationships are likewise vaguely defined but never challenged or utilized. My displeasure at the characterization is practically equivalent to my enjoyment at the show\'s visuals.Value:In the end, K is barely an O-K series. It can be considered valuable from an artistic point of view with entertaining visuals and fight sequences. However, I abhor series with poor character usage, and this is a striking example of such. A pity that a series with so much style ended up with so little soul. opposition, his only hope being that there are multiple parties after him with differing goals.

When I saw it on my Netflix though, I quickly turned it on and re-watched the 13 episodes of sheer amazing art quality and enjoyed the characters once more. This anime sent me through a wave of emotion. Why? Well, let's see here.Story: 9I gave this story a 9 because it was greatly deserving of it. Just a little short of outstanding. The plot could be confusing every now and then, but in the end I felt they wrapped it up the best they could to fit those thirteen...episodes (main reason I'm waiting for season 2!). Another reason why I wish they would translate the manga to English already.Art: 10The art is simply MARVELOUS. Sure, it had some fan service with a certain girl we all know, but the lighting, the effects, oh my it was just stunning. I wish to be an animator, and this art... to animate something so beautiful... it would be an honor to one day do the same.Sound: 9I personally when I found out there was a dubbed, watched that after knowing the subbed voices. Neither version disappointed me. The Red King's raspy, bad boy voice made me so happy. I could almost say I like his voice better in dubbed, but his Voice Actor's do truly deliver and give us extra along the way. (Not to mention I found Yata's voice very fitting as well.) Sound effects, the battle scenes, made me feel like I was right there myself.Character: 8This will be my lowest rating. Why do I give the character's an eight? Well, for one, it kinda made me sad they didn't talk more about some of the background characters. (Like Eric and Chitose from the Reds as an example.) I did mention this earlier though, they did only have thirteen episodes. So I completely understand the focus not being on them (C'mon Season 2!)  Yet, while I found they did relations with the Red King and Tatara very well, they didn't reveal a whole bunch about the Red King and Blue King and how they really knew each other. Why does the Blue King care for the Red King? Vice versa. This is referring later into the end of the series, so you'd have to watch it to know what I'm speaking of. Again though. Thirteen episodes. Completely understandable, but I still deduct two points.Enjoyment: 10I would watch this series over and over and over again! I love all the characters featured and how they are all connected! Ugh this show!Overall: 9Watch it. Seriously. You will enjoy this series so much if you liked the look of the synopsis.After that, watch the movie.And stick around for SEASON 2~! episodes (main reason I'm waiting for season 2!).

Absolutely phenomenal! A true work of art!! A hidden gem that is sadly looked over by many!Let's talk about story.Sure the anime jumps right into it and the timing is a little bit wonky, but that shouldn't be an excuse to let this anime go. It was enjoyable to put the pieces together to see what was going on (Note that i did not read the summery so i went in purely out of curiosity and i regret nothing!). The more you dive deeper into the show, the more things to come into to play...and the more things come to light of. The story is simple and beautiful.Now about Art.Let me say one thing clear, the art is magnificent! I mean really an art work! Whoever worked on the art really deserves a bonus on their pay and then some because the amount of detail that goes into art, the characters, the background is simply stunning.Sound.My. Favorite. Soundtrack. Of. All. Time. I play this soundtrack when i drive, when i do homework, when it's quiet at my job. Its so relaxing, it's so chill, hell sometimes I play this when there's guests and I need some chill background music. This soundtrack (just like the whole series) is amazing!!Characters.Ah, yes, my favorite part. Characters. Let me just say the characters are BEAUTIFUL!! Each to their own characteristics, hell, even the background characters, HAD A PERSONALITY! From Kuroh, Neko and Shiro, to Homra, to SCEPTER 4, they were all simply amazing! Sure some may say they were drawn for fan service (not gonna lie they look ridiculously attractive) but that's not what got me attached. What really got me was how they were portrayed; strong willed leaders and their loyal followers, friendships being made and dedication for their loved ones. The emotions that the voice actors AND the anime portrayed was simply magnificent.Enjoyment.Watched 7 times by myself. Watched it 5 times with my best friend. Got her hooked. We stayed till 7 am to re-watch it. Yeah, that's how great it is. I laughed and i cried. And it wasn't that wee little tear or the small sniffling. Oh no, it was a full on waterworks, my face was wet, snot was coming out of my nose, i was shouting at the T.V., cheering the characters on. A whole roller coaster of emotions i go through and every time i watch it, it's just like my first time.Overall?100000000 out 10 would recommend. If anyone were to ask me what my all time favorite anime would be? It would be this. Seriously give it a try. I love this anime with all of my heart. Each character i love (well most of em) but their character build is great, dynamics are great! I could go ON AND ON about this anime if someone were to mention it in a mile radius! Yes that's how good it is. Yes! I recommend it! Dont sleep on this show, cause it's just-  its fantastic. and the more things come to light of.

There are many characters, so you\'re bound to like some of them. The show also managed to be surprisingly meaningful (at least for me), raising questions about the price of power, the addicting beauty of combat, and the strange bond that arises from violent competition. It seems at times that enemies locked in an exhilarating fight have a greater love and more vital dynamic between them than any other characters. This show captured that idea beautifully, and that is why I enjoyed it.Story 9: In this...show, there are two main plot lines that converge. The mystery around Shiro, the mc\'s, identity, and the war between the Blue and Red Kings. I found the latter much more compelling. The fights between the two super powered ""gangs"" are exciting and emotional, conveying the fascination, beauty, and consequences of extreme power. The exploration of Shiro\'s past was interesting, but a bit confusing and less moving than the conflict and subtle friendship between the Kings.Art 10: Beautiful, modern, lots of eye candy. :)Sound 10: I loved the soundtrack. It added so much to the fight scenes, making me literally get up and want to dance along with the characters as they sparred through the night sky. Rather techno, but interesting combination of violin and piano as well. Made me cry too.Character 9: Shiro, the main character, is the sly yet outwardly cheerful type. At times he seemed almost shallow or airheaded by how little he was phased by the situation. Yet he is also intriguing as we find more about how he has moved behind the scenes. He doesn\'t seem to change much in a compelling way by the end of the story though, so I found myself not caring much about him. I watched this show for the Blue and Red Kings, the leaders of the two main superpowered gangs. I love stories that have ""frenemies."" These characters are often fighting, yet have great respect for one another, and seem to love the constant challenge between them. The seesaw of power and trust between these characters is the heart of this show, with unique twists and a heart wrenching conclusion.Enjoyment 9: This show was exciting. The characters themselves are swept along by the obsession and exhilaration of powers and fights. It is contagious and carries us alongside to revel in revenge, violence, and friendships tested through fire (literally). It also balances the fights with emotions of grief, fear, and mystery, which made for a great combination. show, there are two main plot lines that converge.

Okay, anyways.This anime, I think, is overall very great. It has interesting plot and character developement. Sudden twists and turns just might be surprising indeed.If you are put off by the amount of characters on the cover, don't be. It is centered mainly around five kings(so far).

This anime made me cry at one point too so tragic. ;-; I enjoyed the coloring and the art the most during the action scenes.Sometimes throughout the story I would get confused though because I couldn't remember...what exactly happened in the previous episodes.

The pacing may be slow in the beginning but once the story unravels, you will be hanging off the edge of your seat. A lot of people found the start of the anime to be confusing, and slow and more; however, I thought the beginning of the anime was a great way to slowly introduce the characters, the pleasing visuals, the environment and much more without compiling everything together along with the mysterious plot all at once.Moreover, I had a GREAT laughing spree during the early episodes of the anime. It was so funny!...The cat, the robots and even the characters. After every episode you will want to watch more just to see how the plot fits together.

The voice acting is superb (we'll forget about the English speaking in the beginning.) and they always know when to play a certain song at a certain time.

And as said, a battle between the 7 kings, I...don\'t know why it\'s just the 4 of them who were caught in the fight and the 3 others were not involved.They didn\'t even introduce all of the kings, making me wonder who were the other 2.  And the finale is the only part I didn\'t liked very much which is a sad end. And that\'s why whenever I see the name of the anime K/ K project, I said to myself ""oh that\'s the one with a sad end"" then remembers what happened in the last moments of it.If you\'re going to watch this, just don\'t expect too much when it comes to the romance part.

The reviews that came in for this one are debatable but it just boils down to personal taste & as for myself I\'m neutral about my stance on that & the series.What probably gets K the most praise is the artstyle, which i\'m very fond of. I\'m not going to note anything original about it anyway, so I might just leave...it at that. I just love the way everything looks really.Given that I love soundtrack music, K made some nice points here too. There aren\'t that many songs that play throughout the series but for how few of them there are, I\'d say a nice selection has been made for a 13-episode series like this one. It fits K\'s ambiance really well & from a personal perspective it\'s something I\'d listen to casually.Being conflicted about how the plot developed, the character cast with the addition of the fact that I\'ve not watched or reviewed a single series for a while, I\'ve come to the conclusion that plot & character departments are the show\'s biggest selling points, but not very good ones, hence why I\'ve given K a 6 overall. To sum it up, you\'ll enter the Kverse not knowing what is going on at first but as the series goes on a fair bit of light will be shed on what the series was leading you onto since the beginning, which is a fair surprise but the rest of it is either misleading, messy, or both. As for the characters, nothing that has never been done before. Too big of a cast to be equally supported in only 13 episodes but I don\'t necessarily hate it.If I had to boil down my experience with the first K series in one sentence, it\'d be something among the lines of ""I wasn\'t impressed, but the series\' continuation probably has a redemption arc that I\'m interested into with how everything was layed out in 13 episodes."" it at that.

This anime is more in depth than they\'d like to admit, even characters. Before watching the series, i\'d recommend watching K seven stories, movies 1-5, not 6 as spoilers for the end. 1-5 will help you understand the characters a little more, but you can watch confidently without watching it.People complain about a weak story, when the only difference is the story is personal to the characters than to the audience. What i am trying to say is, it\'s not about the world, or some OP villain. The plot is centred...simply around the characters, their feelings, emotions. The plot centres them, and they did it very well. Then comes characters, most people say they are shallow and under developed. However, lets take Mikoto, red king. He is quiet and seems cold heated. People will look at him and say ""he\'s shallow"". i disagree completely. That man is more human than many characters in anime. Take a deep look in his personality, when you\'re close to him he seems a little cold, yet from an outside view he looks caring. He deeply cares about his clansmen, showing compassion to them. Furthermore the man is showing an insane, yet calm attitude, balanced with a layed back persona. I may not have explained it well, but take a look at him and you\'ll see how human he really is. You can clearly see the connection he has with the people around him, and the comfort he has given to the people of HOMRA.Even fight scenes, they look fluid and are engaging. I can\'t remember any fights where they copied and pasted the same animation to save budget, the movements, attacks are very well animated. The art style is exceptionally well done.The sword of damocles isn\'t very well explained in the anime, but take one look at how it is represented and what\'s said and you\'ll understand immediately. It doesn\'t take much effort, because all you need to know is that if it starts to crack, and crumble the king is going to die soon. That is all, it is very relevant to the entire story of K and simple enough to understand. The very definition of Damocles means that at any given moment, something bad could happen to them. The name gives away what it represents, and the blades condition represents how close they are to it.Their powers are simple enough to understand if you watch the anime. Just pay attention and you\'ll understand where it came from.My final thoughts, ignore the haters that payed no attention to it, i\'d recommend watching  K seven stories, K, K missing kings and K return of kings and you\'ll have a very good time simply around the characters, their feelings, emotions.

K-Project is one of a kind, and that can be a good and a bad thing. I loved it in this case, for the characters, for the emotion, the story and for the window it gave us into a fascinating world. But you need an open mind.On that note, here a fact: Yashiro is the POV character NOT the main character. The story does not revolve around him, his plot thread is but one of many that result in the big end-game.Alright: here goes.Let's start with Art.It has a unique art style...with too much fanservice, but fan service that is purely art and has almost no impact on the narrative. The art is important here, since much of the story and emotion is expressed through art choices instead of dialogue ones.Considering the heavy burden, I assign it a 7 as a standalone, though an argument can be made for higher marks. (just... the fanservice annoys me a little.)Sound is ok, fit the mood but nothing special to say here.The voice acting on the other hand... 9. (Ignoring the fact that Suoh Mikoto's voice is literal sin.)Mikoto's VA gets accross his exhaustion, Saruhiko is brilliant and all the others fit well and work well, just don't spring out to me as much.Character is where things get complicated. There is not much in the way of character development. That's true, but the static characters themselves are brilliant. Some, like the nominal protag don't get that much time to shine (watch the show and you'll see why), but the support cast (esp. the story driving characters - HOMRA) is brilliant in the depth of both their characterization and their interaction.The reason why this is hard do see is because the nominal primary cast - neko, silver haired boy - both have ... well. Story related character issues?And then we get to the story. Oh dear. Ok, in my opinion the plot was great and tied several character conflicts to the end resolution, but others complain that there barely is any and at this point I think I need to issue a slight spoiler warning.Simply put, we don't focus on the primary impetus of the plot. We see the parts to the story, but they aren't presented as a normal plot is and as such you can think at first that the story is about a school kid. It's not.The main protag is actually only very nominally part of the plot. They're an observer, largely, and while they have their own subplot, their main job is to view the plot from an independant third angle. I think this works well. Others strongly disagree.One final thing is that the narrative doesn't explain anything in dialogue, beyond the bare bones. The rest is expressed visually. I like it.In summary: not for everyone, but definitely worth a try. with too much fanservice, but fan service that is purely art and has almost no impact on the narrative.

I know that many people say that they thought that it was not that good, but I loved it. I cannot wait to watch the next season to see more of Isana, Yashiro. ', ""Since the '90s, the first episode of Escaflowne has been my benchmark episode. It is very well done with beautiful art, animation, music, and special effects on top of a well paced story that ends on an incredible hook. It is so good, even if people don't watch anything else, they absolutely should watch that single episode just to see how great anime can be.Likewise, the first episode of K will blow people away. The colors, the camera angles, the scenery, interesting characters, lushly animated crowd scenes, and intriguing plot are simply put, compelling beyond belief.You have two warring factions under leaders called kings. The...op tells you that the show will be about these two groups fighting each other. Then there's a mystery set up later on in the first episode about Yashiro Isana, who you can see is listed as a main character on this very page. It's set up to be an action show with slight comedic elements, say like Rurouni Kenshin.You know what? I'm going to stop writing for now. GO WATCH EPISODE ONE. It is amazing. Then come right back....Back? Okay! Now you can skip the entire rest of the show. Don't waste your time on it. It's clear just from episode two that that they blew two to three episodes' worth of budget on episode one. That's not the major problem, though. While Escaflowne falls apart at the end, K falls apart in episode two. Specifically, the show turns into a light comedy with action bits. Those two kings in episode one? They don't really hate each other. Those two warring factions? They don't really fight each other very much at all. Eventually, they even pull a piece of animation out of the op and use it in the show. o_o Then they do it again with the same piece.So, yeah, the production values take a nosedive in episode two and never recover, as the recycling increases more and more. The intense action-packed show that's set up in episode one dissolves immediately at the very start of episode two because they can't keep up the pace, and that mystery? Trust me when I say that whatever you think the answer is will be a much more satisfying answer than what they came up with. ~_~;A note about scores. I use a traditional 5 point objective scale:1 terrible2 bad3 average4 good5 greatThis is stretched to 10 points, so everything is multiplied by 2 with no half-points allowed.Overall series animation gets a 2 and art gets a 3.After watching all of Escaflowne and knowing the sad fate that befalls the end of that show, I still found it compelling enough to purchase the whole thing on DVD. On the other hand, I would not buy K.So, the bottom line is everyone should see episode one of K, then just imagine how the rest of the series goes. Enjoy! op tells you that the show will be about these two groups fighting each other.

This anime is really good:even if there is no character development, the art and characters are cool.Story- Not a very original story. A guy wakes up one day and has lost his memory. All he has is a cat and an umbrella. Then he remembers everything (like that his name is Yashiro Isana) but remembers nothing about before a week ago or so.

The art was excellent, i sometimes find myself deciding whether to drop an anime because of how poor the graphics are, but this gripped me not only via the storyline and easily loveable characters but also because of how good the quality of the graphics were.I would recommend this to anyone who...likes supernatural and psychological animes, it even has a touch of shounen ai mixed in with the story line.I loved it. likes supernatural and psychological animes, it even has a touch of shounen ai mixed in with the story line.I loved it.', 'K is a beautifully well written anime in my opinion. It\'s short and concrete, there\'s nothing really confusing about it and it\'s easy to understand. The world in the anime is slightly different than our own, and involves various factions of groups, each one with it\'s own entertaining characters. There is a sense of good and bad, though even characters from the ""bad group"" are entertaining, have good intentions, and vice verse with the ""good group"" each group is led by a king who holds this sword which gives them a specific sort of power or trademark, almost like magic. for instance there is an...immortal king and you can probably guess his trademark. (hint. it isn\'t the ability to summon ducks) The music is well portrayed, and seems to have a belonging there. It is a warm, soft hearted anime, a comedy at times, but also a endearing drama, with enough action, chaos and plot twists to keep the watcher involved and thinking. The story, again, is well thought out and seems to do justice to the overall story. The art is very well done, as you can imagine from a 2013 anime. I enjoyed it very much, and i cannot wait for the second season. I highly recommend this short superb anime to anyone. immortal king and you can probably guess his trademark.

I usually look up background info before starting up an anime, because I really don't like following the 3 episode rule. So this time I if ignored my past ways, and dove right into K! And I'm sure glad I did.Story: 8K starts with your typical white haired boy named Shiro. He's well liked by everyone at school....Life for Shiro is peaceful, until he is attacked and chased by these guys while he was out for a school errand. Running away, he accidentally gets cornered, and when all seems doomed, you have the black haired boy, Kuroh dash in from of the sky to save Shiro. What seemed like a rescue turned out to be Shiro's turn of luck because now he's being targeted by these enemy groups called HOMRA- the Red Clan Scepter 4- the Blue Clan, as well as the boy Kuroh, for having murdered one of their so called Kings and a member of their group?!?!?!Characters: 8I shouldn't even be giving them an 8 by the sole fact that there was 0 character development. But, I'm not since I thoroughly enjoyed the little hints that were thrown here and there and because I quickly grew to like the characters and even have favorites. One could quickly note from the little that was revealed, how the character's personalities were. Although the characters didn't get any background exposure, you can read that stuff in the novels. To my knowledge, they have been translated in English by fans. You can easily find them if you google around.Art: 9Oh man. The hype the anime got for the art is pretty spot on. The characters which you can easily see on the promo posters, are made really nicely. it doesn't stop there though. The expressions and movements they make are highly detailed. The first 2 episodes were brilliantly made. The scene were Yasu is riding his skateboard through the city, and the action filled scenes, showed the true wonders of how cgi should be in anime. These scenes had me awed in amazement. People keep bashing that the team focused too much on the visual concept instead of the story, but that's just wrong. The visual concept is PART of the story. K wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't like this. The colors are a major aspect that set off the ongoing and non drifting mood that is recurring throughout the anime.Overall: 8The anime only has 13 episodes, which I think is good since animes that drag on (especially with useless filler episodes) are annoying. But for some reason, this seemed to be the major issue to others. Some think it was rushed and badly made, but I actually found this anime really enjoyable since I watched it all one sitting, and was at the edge of my seat at that. I love and find the the whole concept of clans and kings to be really original.

Maybe you have to watch some parts two times.But i also have to say that i don't like what happens to two of my favourite characters at the end of the anime. I have to admit i cried really hard ( T.T ). The shouting of the team gave me the rest.But overall i can say it's really worth to watch and a regret nothing XD "", ""When I started watching this show I thought it was stupid and made no sense. While the plot development leaves much to be desired, and the characters could be more well-rounded, the Art, music and the ending of the show were fantastic.  If you're looking for a very well developed story with more depth, then I'd check elsewhere. This series has it's good points and even thought the characters weren't well-rounded or developed, they were still fantastic characters, some of which were easy to relate to. This is one of those stories that in a sense simple and and has an unbelievably unexpected ending!...Even if you start this series and say 'I'm not gonna finish this.'

Though the Soundtrack itself wasn't purely mediocre or banal, due to the improper use of it, it felt out of place, thus not living up to its full potential.

I never really found anything that made the story and character development worthwhile to mention.The art is simply fantastic. It pops out, and it actually looks extremely pretty. The scenery gives a feeling of happiness that completely mirrors Shiro\'s happy-go-lucky personality. The characters are also particularly cute, especially Shiro. But the other characters all have artistic aspects of them that make them particularly likable.The sound synergizes well with the art, meaning that it\'s particularly beautiful. It is the third anime out of thousands...that I openly went ""Woah! The music is incredible!"" (After Code Geass and Owari no Seraph -- and this music is better than that from those animes!). Mikoto\'s theme is notable because I love the combination of the drumset and partial orchestra. Shiro\'s theme is pure beauty. The opening theme is beautiful and the type that you wouldn\'t get tired of listening to for thirteen episodes straight.

Truly, Mikoto is the best king that anyone could ask for, with a hidden side of compassion mixed with his anger. Totsuka shows the power of peace. Yata is amazingly stereotypical of an angry teenager, but that\'s more likable points from me. Izumo is an oddball for his ability to stay calm (even weirder since he\'s part of HOMRA).

The only judgment for the story is the wow factor at how such an original idea came from an original work.

It is a deep, philosophical story, with loveable characters, beautiful animation, catchy soundtrack, and a well handled storyline. It needs some concentration and patience to appreciate, but if someone is ready to think, and look behind the surface, it turns out to be a real masterpiece.First, the story. To be honest, at the beginning, it doesn't seem to be a big deal. It starts in medias res, the viewer literally has no idea what's going...on. There are the kings, but we don't know who they are, what are they capable of, there is a strange crime story, but we don't know what happened, who was killed and why... we are in the middle of the chaos, and it's easy to sympathise with the main character who is as lost, as we are. We get a lot of hints and symbols that give the chance to put together the whole picture before the reveal, but the writing is smart enough to divide your attention - you won't figure out anything before the eighth episode, and even then, you have to think. When the big plot twist comes in the eleventh episode, everything clicks into place, you get a whole new perspective of the story, and you have the finale left which is powerful and sometimes heartbreaking. You want more, you want to continue, but at the same time it is a nice closure, and only a few questions are left unanswered - if there wouldn't be a second season, I would say they were left open intentionally, letting the viewers decide what they think.The philosophical side works as well, the story deals with a lot of important questions - it mostly revolves around the question of power, how you deal with it, how you avoid it's corruption, how you shoulder the responsibilities it comes with, and if you are not the one in position of power, how you think about the different leaders, who is the good king in your opinion. But it also deals with smaller, more personal matters, friendship, grief, the struggle to help someone, and save him from himself... these parts make the anime really strong emotionall.The art is beautiful. The character desings are not always perfect - for example, I was awfully annoyed with the fanservice in case of Neko and Awashima. But the main characters are memorable, well drawn. I'm sure Mikoto's red fire required an awful lot of work from the animation team... it has an amazing range of colors, several shades of red, a little pink and purple, it is simply beautiful. The fight scenes are dinamic, the different fighting styles are carefully animated, and they don't drown in the effects - you can easily follow how Kurou fights in a traditional japanese ways, while the Blue Clan uses europian sabers, the Red Clan shows a variety of unique styles... it's really good to watch. Also, the Swords of Damocles are beautiful and once again, each and every one of them is unique. The music creates a special atmosphere, sometimes it's really emotional, and there are a lot of catchy little tunes that will get stuck in your head. There is even a song in the sixth episode, and it's beautiful and sad. The OST is perfectly good to listen to individually as well.And the characters. My biggest problem with most philosophical stories is that the characters rarely get any real developement. They are slaves of the plot, archetypes meant to show a message, and not real, well developed figures - the story doesn't want you to emotionally invest into their journey, maybe with the exception of the main character. This is not the case with K. Here, we do have the archetypes, Mikoto as color red, Reisi as color blue, Weismann as color silver, Kurou as the classic right-hand man/knight... but still, they are well developed, you get to see their inner struggles, failures, fears, you get drawn into the story emotionally as well as in mind. My personal favourites were Shiro, Reisi and Mikoto... Shiro is one of my favourite anime protagonists. He is fun, understandable, hopeful, and playful, but when the time comes, he can be just a little manipulative, with a good intention. Reisi seems like the cold-hearted, calculating leader, who is ready to sacrifice anyone and anything for the cause - but we see that he does struggle to always keep his distance, and always decide rationally, never letting his emotions get in the way. And Mikoto... well, he is the king, who never wanted any power, and as such, he is one of the most loveable characters of the series. But there are a lot of amazing characters, Kurou, Fushimi, Anna... they are all unique.Overall, I think this story is certainly worth a watch. I enjoyed every second of it, and it doesn't seem like it will let me go soon. on.

Suffice it to say, as i watched the anime i didn't feel most of these emotions. Though there was that sense of intrigue that few other shows have managed to instill in me till now. I won't be going too deep about any particular element, just scratch the surface of what i believe have been, quite unfortunately, poorly understood or appreciated. I definitely recommend watching the anime though.Now, i actually...saw the first episode of this anime quite a few years back, at least 3. Back then, i believe i was in my 'action badassery' phase and wanted all main characters to be this sort of OP and decisive guys. And i had kind of dropped this back then because the mc, surprise, wasn't. (the shounen ai elements didn't help as well, or what i interpreted as such).So coming back into this with that view, and to persuade anyone who might be wary due to 'weak' characters, i found all characters (except one annoying cat) to be quite great, including the MC. There's a lot you have to read between the lines here. Much of the relationships between the characters aren't exactly spelled out, especially those between the kings (i really loved those). And while many reviews seem to say there are a plethora of characters and not sufficient time between them and what not, without going into spoilers about the factions, there are in fact only a handful that the show ever truly focuses on. You won't be getting an exact dismantling of each thread that makes up the characters, an exacting analysis of what makes them tick (would that even be interesting), but try to understand what their motivations are and the show gives sufficient hints to fill out the answers. A fair compromise for a show with only 13 episodes. (Really though, half the time with most complaints its like 'It tells too much!' or 'It tells too little!'. You should just see the anime and see for yourself which case it is, i suggest).Then the other part, plot holes. Or an incoherent plot. The show takes its time, but it, again, focuses on whats important, leaving just enough to let you answer most other questions. And try as i might, i can't just think of any particular plot hole or thread that remained to be resolved (well a few, but that's mostly related to the conclusion which im sure is dealt with in the sequel).For the rest, art is a bit strange in terms of colors sometimes, but its not bad enough to prevent anyone from watching, so dont let it stop you.Sound, again nothing great, nothing bad, shouldn't even be a reason why someone doesn't watch anything to be honest (unless its reaaal bad or creepy).As an overnight marathon, i had great fun with it. And also the feeling that i may not have appreciated the show as much had I watched it all those years ago. My mind says, 8/10. The heart, 9/10.(Eh, that was kind of long, thanks for reading. i also believe this is my first review? Let me know if there's anything strange in there, thanks again.) saw the first episode of this anime quite a few years back, at least 3. Back then, i believe i was in my 'action badassery' phase and wanted all main characters to be this sort of OP and decisive guys. And i had kind of dropped this back then because the mc, surprise, wasn't. (the shounen ai elements didn't help as well, or what i interpreted as such).So coming back into this with that view, and to persuade anyone who might be wary due to 'weak' characters, i found all characters (except one annoying cat) to be quite great, including the MC. There's a lot you have to read between the lines here. Much of the relationships between the characters aren't exactly spelled out, especially those between the kings (i really loved those). And while many reviews seem to say there are a plethora of characters and not sufficient time between them and what not, without going into spoilers about the factions, there are in fact only a handful that the show ever truly focuses on. You won't be getting an exact dismantling of each thread that makes up the characters, an exacting analysis of what makes them tick (would that even be interesting), but try to understand what their motivations are and the show gives sufficient hints to fill out the answers. A fair compromise for a show with only 13 episodes. (Really though, half the time with most complaints its like 'It tells too much!' or 'It tells too little!'. You should just see the anime and see for yourself which case it is, i suggest).Then the other part, plot holes. Or an incoherent plot. The show takes its time, but it, again, focuses on whats important, leaving just enough to let you answer most other questions.

And here comes the firts problem in my opinion, the series has an lenght of 13 caps and in my opinion its just too short for actually see how some characters develope at least for a couple of them, but even then this its not so much of an problem because the series itsefl doesnt pretend so much from a beggining and its not so story driven in general.One of the most annoying things and worts things that this series has its firts those few planes showing the women underwear or those zoom in their private parts  in certain character (yes i talking about you awashima seri) which the series doesnt need, and there are serious moments which are taken away because of this things , the other which its at the same lv  its that subtle bromance that you can see from early episodes for example from isana yashiro towards  munakata reishi i mean  i just dont undertand even what kind of affection or emotion the protagonist has for munakata in certain moments its just random its feels like some kind of fanservice without context and more importantly doesnt serve in anything to the series.The animation looks really good and in my opinion beautiful and shines even more in those secuences of action or planes showing the enviroment. the color also has that kind of saturation but in a good way that gives an unique feel to the series, in those aspects i cant really complain. And  the desing of the characters under my personal view i really like it they all looks like ikemen hahah but to my its doesnt a bad point.The sound in general leaving aside the op and end that are actually freaking dope the ost its really chill in from my experience with the series didnt have a single track that were memorable even nevertheless i think it gave some kind of seal to the series.The characters are not really interesting and are usually most of them just some kind of archetype that we has seen in many other sereis of this nature,  they  doesnt became in anyhting really outanding as we move forward in the series, and there are some kind of cliches like that girl cat that just shows the boobs and has some kind of attachment without so much justification for the protagonist.In few words k project its an good anime that if we know in what we are getting into, its gonna became in a good experience, its accomplish what tries to deliver really well without many compromises in between, i could give more puntuation if wasnt for those bad point that i mentioned above. always say depending of how many characters you introduce and focus on, its depends the amounts of episodes that the series should have because if not the series would feel rushed or bad paced with many plot holes and bad developed characters, and in this case we can see from the begginng how slowly we are introduced an handful amount of characters along the series which even althought their roles in the series varies from each one i can say surely that most of them fullfill an important rol.

I\'ll try to keep this short as much as possible and with little to none spoilers.STORY : 7Basically, K all starts with finding the person involved in the murder of a clan member. And all the members of this clan hunts down Isana Yashiro, who is said to be the murderer. Not very original, yes. We all know the story of revenge for family and friends. ( nakama, remember ? lol. ) But even though it may be like this, there are still unique concepts that can only be found in K. I don\'t about...the others but the supernatural concept of ""kings"" is new for me here. Also, there are certain parts that may be confusing since it kinda progresses in some sort of a time hop way and shows some flashbacks. But, it all gets clear as the story goes on and all these ""sub-plots"" will later be connected.ART : 10Honestly, the reason that I\'ve watched K in the first place is because of its art and I wasn\'t disappointed. From the very first episode, i have been mesmerized by its art and animation. Personally, I love it when it sorts of zooms in and out and there\'s some sort of angles effect. It\'s as if there\'s an actual camera following the characters. Not to mention the characters, all of them are very well drawn.  ( bishies !! * w * ) Even side characters such as the Scepter 4 and Homra members weren\'t neglected when it comes to their apperances. And unlike other anime that I\'ve seen, K maintains the same quality even during fight scenes. The characters\' movements are fluid and the details aren\'t forgotten.SOUND : 8I liked the soundtracks specially the ending song, ""Tsumetai Heya, Hitori"". But sometimes, i just find myself laughing because even if there\'s this fight-to-death sort of scenario, the ost will always be this solemn, dramatic background music. Don\'t get me wrong, the osts are beautiful but I think they could work out the timing and appropriateness.With regards to the seiyuus, hands-down. No problems there. The cast includes the best seiyuus and each are appropriate to their respective characters.CHARACTER : 9For me, its great that every character have their own personality and that you just can\'t hate anyone (well maybe except with the Colorless King.) Characters who make a great impact such as Kuroh, Misaki and Saruhiko in the story were dedicated with a sub-plot that mainly shows each of their past and shows its impact to their present self. K is just a 13-episode series and there won\'t be that much time to develop each and every character like what the others are looking for.ENJOYMENT : 9For me, K is an amazing series. I liked stories with plot twists, and this gave it to me. The only flaw I guess is the ending of some fights were kinda not what I have pictured. But all in all, I\'ve enjoyed every episode.OVERALL : 9I wrote this review by the time I\'ve finished re-watching it (because there\'s a second season.) And despite the fact that this is already the second time I\'ve seen it, I still enjoyed it. That fact itself, already shows that its an amazing anime and worth watching.Did I say I\'ll keep this short ? Well maybe not.

The seven kings, powers, gangs, factions, this whole ordeal with a war and how the powers originated, but it wasn\'t properly explained. There are seven kings, Silver, Gold, Red, Blue, Colorless, but yet there was no mention of the seventh king. Upon further exploration on the wiki, apparently there\'s a green king, but this information must\'ve been gathered via a different series or movie about the same anime universe. There were many points in which the words ""I\'m confused"" came out of my mouth during this anime. So much so, that I started to worry I was just...an idiot. But, unshockingly, it wasn\'t me, it actually was the anime. This show didn\'t explain many things, and the things it did, they barely went into detail. Besides their lack of detail, the story was interesting, and I was always at the edge of my seat. The amnesia  was a very cool factor in the beginning episodes, which made the series overall, fun.Art - 8/10The visuals were shocking. Very bright, at times, too bright. And the effects when the kings started using their powers was very cool, but overall, not unique, which was disappointing. But still very pretty. I\'m not all the smart when it comes to detail in the art, but at times, it lacked detail. At other times, the detail was immense. So I wont take away too many points.Sound - 7/10I watched this series on Netflix, and because their subs suck, I was forced to watch a dubbed version. It wasn\'t amazing, but I liked their voice actors (for the most part).Characters - 6/10The characters were disappointing. The only two I was actually impressed with were Adolf K. Weismann and Kurou Yatogami. Even though they were both cliche type characters, Weismann really took the cake with his caring for even the most evil, such as the Colorless King. There were background stories on Weismann, Misaki and Saruhiko, but only a little for the latter two. This part the anime is where it lacked most. If I wasn\'t such a softy, I wouldn\'t have cared for any of these characters, because they\'re just cardboard cutouts and honestly, at times, quite boring. But, I still loved them all, and because of that, this section doesn\'t quite fall down the drain.Enjoyment - 9/10I quite enjoyed myself! While this anime lacked explanations on many parts and was a little chaotic, it was still enjoyable, and re-watchable. I had fun with the characters, especially during the beginning.Overall - 7/10Overall, this anime was a decent one. It wasn\'t terrible, but it wasn\'t the ""Anime of the Century,"" at least, in my opinion. And that\'s what this is all about. Opinions. If you thought it was terrible, so be it. If you thought it was wonderful, good for you. I think you should be the judge. Just don\'t go telling everyone that they must accept your opinion. an idiot.

When I did I fell in love, whole heartedly. The story was good focusing around Yashiro Isana, Shiro. Shiro with his ""cat"" (who I cannot even begin to explain her since I\'m not sure if she\'s a person or cat) Neko go on an ""adventure"" (really trying not to give any spoilers). This adventure can be described as a mystery. It is a mystery after all. For me up until the end I loved Mikoto Suoh (The Red King) though he wasn\'t really focused on in the...anime and I fell in love with Misaki Yata (Yata). For me, I need some storyline most often, and this had a good one, very good one in fact. In the anime there are Kings who have abilities and followers who have the same abilities, though not as strong as their respected King. The anime did a good job at focusing the story without going all over the place. The anime did not go into depth on any character that really had no purpose which was something I love. I hate to know about characters that are not part of the anime or are just there for one episode. All in all, the anime was amazing. I would rewatch it 1,000 times over except the ending. I don\'t know if it was just me but I cried (so you are warned) though I can\'t watch the ending of several animes since I know their endings thanks to my friends so...

When I watched K, I didn\'t read a single thing about it and just simply watched it straight through. If you want to get the full enjoyment out of K, you have to be careful, because- some of its greatest moments (plot twists and such) being ruined could decrease K\'s value probably in half.-I\'ve read many reviews stating that K is a 3 or 4, that there\'s hardly any character development. Well, I\'m here to explain.\tFirst off,- K is slow.-Yes. I think most everyone can agree on that....You don\'t find out anything of consequence regarding the universe until episode 3. And this is out of 13 episodes. The entire first half, and a good portion of the last, you’re just- thinking ""what the hell is going on?"" And I loved that.-Every time-K gave you an answer to one of your previous questions, you got about two or three more questions you wanted answered.-It left me feeling like I had to finish, even though I\'d been up for 24 hours straight, so I could know how it ended.-It kept me entranced the entire time.-And yes,- if you don\'t pay attention, to nuances or facial expressions or (especially) dialogue, you are going to be so lost and never catch up,-leaving you with a bad opinion. Comparatively, dialogue is limited in this anime, and-nearly everything said in it has a purpose.-Even inconsequential actions and words at the beginning come back towards the end as something BIG. Now, secondly, I\'m going to address the whole ""barely any to no character development"". I\'m going to say this:- K was never meant to be a standalone anime!-It\'s merely meant to be a glimpse into this universe and at these characters to get you hooked.=There are manga, novels, and even CD/Radio dramas that flush out characters that you barely even noticed in the anime.-Pretty much everyone gets their spotlight, and there are still more coming out to help give these characters meaning. So, yeah, if you don\'t want to invest the time in such a lengthy story, then this might not be for you. Because, personally, I believe that stand alone, the anime is good. However, if you want it to be great, if you want to be so emotionally invested in these characters that when you re-watch the anime you are nearly in tears, then invest. It is well worth it. The mangas and novels and such are mainly prequels.-These show characters interacting that you thought only had a hate or disinterested relationship with each other and having their very core shaken by the other. These show why the characters are so emotionally invested in one another. These show why the characters do what they do.-The anime is the end, the exception being the few sequels that have come out and the movie, and you watch it first. (Seriously, watch the anime first.- Don\'t think ""Oh, I\'ll just go read all of that stuff then watch the anime."" They won\'t make as much sense then or give off the impression they were meant to.)-You come in after the betrayals and death and bonds being formed and have little to no idea how they formed. Then you go back to the beginning and read about these characters that have so much hope and so many plans. You see characters that were dead when the anime started alive and kicking. You see their lives and how they affected those still living.- Left with the epithet, ""This is a story full of happiness,"" (it\'s only meant for Memories of Red but it felt like it applied to all of them for me)you really realize the depth and emotions of these characters.-Okay, now that I\'ve finished that little rant, I\'ll go on to mention what everyone else tends to mention.-The art is beautiful. The sound track is amazing.-I still sing the opening because it\'s just so beautiful.-The story plot at first appears generic, but it gets its own interesting twist to it through all the sci-fi and fantasy in the story.-Once again, I will mention how slow the pacing is.-The entire second episode seems almost completely pointless, though it\'s freaking hilarious.-The tone of the story seems to shift from humor to serious so many times in the first half until it settles on almost entirely serious about half way through. There\'s still a little humor up until the final few episodes, though. It gets really fast at the end, and a lot of people criticize this. Personally, I feel it fits.-The last half is a dramatic rush up to the climax. I don\'t feel as if the writers were just rushing to tie up loose ends, but more like they had planned the pacing out and had intended to make the pacing match the mood of the story.-The ending is rushed, because the characters themselves have become rushed. While at the beginning, the characters were frantic, yes, they weren\'t as frantic as the last four episodes or so.Personally,-I think GoHands is genius. Not because of the story, but because of their smart marketing style. This is one of the main reasons why I feel all the flaws people point out in K aren\'t really flaws, but intentional to further sells.-This might piss some people off, but I personally see no problem with it.- This is their livelihood after all, and I see no shame in them trying their best at making money and appealing to fans. Which is why I don\'t fault them with their obvious fan service-. It doesn\'t detract from the story in my opinion, and some of it even goes with the character\'s personalities.-Instead of seeing ""GAY"", just think of it as that person being an ""in your face"" type of guy.-(Not to mention socially awkward with no regards to personal boundaries.)-That\'s how I choose to view it, and am happy to overlook the obvious panty shots and over the top cleavage. -So, give K a shot, and keep an open mind about everything. I think it\'ll make your experience much more enjoyable. I give the anime probably a 7.5-8/10 and the whole enterprise an 9/10, but honestly I\'m not good at that kind of thing so you might not want to take those numbers to heart. You don\'t find out anything of consequence regarding the universe until episode 3. And this is out of 13 episodes.

There\'s still a little humor up until the final few episodes, though. It gets really fast at the end, and a lot of people criticize this. Personally, I feel it fits.-The last half is a dramatic rush up to the climax. I don\'t feel as if the writers were just rushing to tie up loose ends, but more like they had planned the pacing out and had intended to make the pacing match the mood of the story.-The ending is rushed, because the characters themselves have become rushed. While at the beginning, the characters were frantic, yes, they weren\'t as frantic as the last four episodes or so.Personally,-I think GoHands is genius. Not because of the story, but because of their smart marketing style. This is one of the main reasons why I feel all the flaws people point out in K aren\'t really flaws, but intentional to further sells.-This might piss some people off, but I personally see no problem with it.- This is their livelihood after all, and I see no shame in them trying their best at making money and appealing to fans. Which is why I don\'t fault them with their obvious fan service-. It doesn\'t detract from the story in my opinion, and some of it even goes with the character\'s personalities.-Instead of seeing ""GAY"", just think of it as that person being an ""in your face"" type of guy.-(Not to mention socially awkward with no regards to personal boundaries.)-That\'s how I choose to view it, and am happy to overlook the obvious panty shots and over the top cleavage. -So, give K a shot, and keep an open mind about everything. I think it\'ll make your experience much more enjoyable. I give the anime probably a 7.5-8/10 and the whole enterprise an 9/10, but honestly I\'m not good at that kind of thing so you might not want to take those numbers to heart.', ""Almost watched the whole thing twice because I forgot that I watched it at first, it's pretty not memorable. The character designs are enticing.The ecchiness throughout and music is more meme-y for sure lol. Music didn't match its scenes and it made it more comedic than action-serious.The subtleness of romance caters to the gay community, pretty cool.The other reviews are true about K, it's rushed and the anime wasn't probably executed well by their director. =/If you like to see cute boys blush at each other and meme-y moments of how the anime was developed, go for it.

Shiro is a regular student, enjoying his popularity in the Island-Academy he\'s attending. But despite his friendliness and well-likedness from everyone, he soon finds himself in trouble, as the cat he used to take care of is suddenly transformed into a human, and Shiro finds himself in the middle of a war between the 7 K (kings), humans with psychic abilities, leading gangs or organizations with the purpose of becoming the absolute rulers...

But while K is shy and mysticistic about its sexual preferences, it is quite honest with its marketing tactics. I know the main purpose of animes is to promote their mangas but there is such a thing as ""subtlety"" and K seems to constantly miss that.

When I was watching K however, I felt a gun, cruelly pointing at my balls. ""How are these two characters related anime?"" I fearfully ask. ""Buy the manga to find out b!tch!"" the anime angrily replies. ""Can you give me some more information about this completely unexplained setting of a town, anime?"" I ask innocently. ""Buy the f@cking manga and READ nerd!"" the anime replies as it kicks my stomach. ""Why are these two supposedly opposed people at kissing distance from each other and rolling on the grass, anime?""

And saying the plot was all over the place would be one thing, but I couldn\'t even tell what the ""K"" in the title stood for either! The anime takes the ""multiple interpretations"" approach, with various words such as ""King"" ""Killer"" etc being possible meanings for K, similar to how ""V"" could mean ""Vendetta"", ""Vandalism"" or ""Viagra"".""But that\'s not all there is to us! Look! We also have incredibly beautiful battles and action!"" No anime, you don\'t. What is indeed beautiful is the quality of the graphics, which, truth be told, blows all antagonism away. But having good graphics and descent animation DOES NOT equal good battles. This was mostly evident when the skater kid tried to take on a SWAT-y strike team with practically break-dancing moves. While other animes could have easily handled this with amazing choreography that could really get out blood pumping, K somehow completely fails to utilize the ""magic"" of the fight, proving that despite the pretty masks it puts on, K IS deep down a closet yaoi anime that wants nothing to do with action of any kind other than ""bed"".

Wait, now that I think about it...', '""K"" is a bit of a mixed bag. While it does have some impressive visuals, the story and characters leave a lot to be desired in a series that could only do so much in 13 episodes (and a movie I\'ve yet to see).The story of ""K"" is easy to follow, but it is also a a bit hard to understand because of how it is presented. Certain things are revealed and certain characters make decisions throughout the series that exist more or less because they need to push the plot along.The characters are rather bland to me. It never really feels like their...motivations are genuine, but rather that they exist to move the plot. Misaki and Fushimi are the most developed in my opinion because they are really the only ones that have any of their history explained. Kuroh and Yashiro are entirely too uninteresting to be the main characters of this series. They serve their purpose, as does everyone else, but they don\'t have anything about that that make them interesting away from the main plot.The art is great. The animation is greatly detailed, even in moments when there isn\'t a lot of action. My only issue is that the colors are a bit too washed out, but this is something that might not bother most people.The voice acting is fine. I liked Ben Diskin as Misaki. I also thought that Matt Mercer did well. Everyone else did well, but nothing to stand out. motivations are genuine, but rather that they exist to move the plot.

You know that feeling don\'t you?  (Yeah you do!).  Anyways, I didn\'t have high expectations, just a bit of hope.  From the opening few minutes I really liked it though..it really had a strong identity, was beautiful and stylish, with a laid back soundtrack that just oozed cool.  Of course, that is the spell that K weaves.  I can totally see it being hit or miss with some people really..[Story]  The story is very media res,...as a viewer you pick up as things unfold and there is a rich sense of history as we enter the story.  It\'s a little confusing at first but the info dump is not too bad.  The main plot is quite focused and there aren\'t a lot of confusing side plots, just a few nice character threads that add well to the main plot.  Pacing is quite good.  My only main frustration with the story is how passive the main character faction is.  All the cool stuff is driven by other protagonists, although that in itself is kinda the point in places.  There are some beautiful punchy fights that don\'t outstay their welcome at all and a lot of dialogue that is nice plot building.[Art/animation]  I\'ve never really heard of GoHands but they delivered some beautiful animation and design in this.  It is so stylish and fluid that at times you can be mesmerised by the riot of colours and action.  Shout out to the Misaki\'s skateboarding scenes as well (I wish I looked that good on a board).  This anime is total eye-candy![Sound]  I\'m not a bit fan of constant backing music invading almost every scene but in K it\'s part of the entire experience with a soft electo or piano and drums riff soundtrack behind almost everything.  It is quite enchanting, although it adds nothing to any action scenes since it calms the tempo of the animation a bit.  It does make this anime feel very chill though.  The OP and ED are totally forgettable though and I found myself skipping them a lot to get on with the story.  I tried both the sub and dub and they are both decent.[Character]  So conflicted on the characters.  I liked (almost) all of them but it\'s quite an ensemble cast so none of them get massive development.  The MC is likeable but by his nature so SOOOOO passive that a number of times I wanted to slap him about and shout ""Just do something useful!!"".  The real joy to the characters are that so many are done well enough for you to get to know them, but this is also a problem because you want MORE of them.[Enjoyment]  Oddly, K is an anime that is more than the sum of it\'s parts.  Whilst it does not feel altogether satisfying it is also not a waste of time.  It doesn\'t quite inspire any extreme feels but it is very nice to watch and listen to.  Aside from the ending (there is a sequel) it delivered some great fights, nice scenes, OK characters.  Just frustrating about that MC.[Overall]  I did watch the movie followup and sequel as I enjoyed it enough.

A few years later, I\'ve found and watched the entire thing, and I can say without a doubt it was worth every damn second of my time.Story: 8While there is the outwardly generic ""city-ruled-by-opposing-factions"" and the ""institution-vs-viligilante"" tropes, K follows the butterfly effect of a politically motivated murder. The pacing is superb because a lot of the time, you get both exposition and action at the simultaneously. Then, there\'s the constantly switching POVs, telling you more about the plot while focussing on a...character. It is essentially wrapping a rotten apple in sticky chocolate. Beautiful on the outside, it leaves you slightly horrified and traumatised by the end...tl;dnr: poison dart in a raisin tartArt: 10No one can disagree that K is a visual masterpiece.

Like Durarara it works with a wide cast, and it does sometimes leave you underwhelmed, but if you have any free time, I recommend it unreservedly.tl;dnr: go watch it', 'The plot is predictable if you have several years of reading, watching, and otherwise enjoying different kinds of media varying between books to anime and films.  Don\'t let that stop you from watching it. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the plot is the weakest point, that is to say, it is indeed predictable. Don\'t expect Pratchett\'s level of humor or writing, or in general, ingenious.The cast is huge, following largely three Kings, one lacking in memory (Shiro), who is, of course, the protagonist, and has his own little group. After that, there are two groups of lesser characters, Red-clansmen and Blue-clansmen. Two or three people you...follow more closely than others.This is a complete work, and although it has more after, at the moment my investment in the show has all but been completed. Which is really nice, it\'s not often I find anime that finish in the same season they started in. (I\'m looking at you, One Piece, among others.) I strongly suggest, if you don\'t have anything else to watch or want to find something new, watch this, it was worth watching it to the end.Anyways I\'m rambling and tired, so I\'ll continue.It\'s presented as a crime-mystery kind of deal. ""I can\'t have murdered this person, but that certainly looks like me."" At which point it spirals into a ""who am I"" in order to find what\'s ACTUALLY going on. It\'s a tragedy, which was an unpleasant, pleasant surprise. What makes this show a good anime are the characters and their interaction. Like I\'ve said, plot vise, it\'s very simple and very predictable, but if you think of it as a story where the plot is an excuse to have the characters, although not entirely waterproof, a lot better.Good points:Good character(s) (interaction).Not black and white, good and evil.Good soundtracks.Good, clean visuals.Sometimes okayish flashbacks.Tragedy.Doesn\'t over-explain or hand feed you every little detailBad points:Simple plot.Too focused on Shiro.Flashbacks.I\'ll try to explain my opinions cohesively. This probably isn\'t the best idea I\'ve had.With such a large cast, it\'s impossible to get everything very exciting, or more than one dimensional. Which I think is fine. There is some, little, character growth, again I think that is fine. Not every story or every character needs to change in some way or another. Not everything is a life-changing process, and with thirteen characters, three main-casts, there really wasn\'t any time. This isn\'t GOT. And again, the anime gave a lot of attention to Shiro, which was meh, he wasn\'t a very interesting character, one way or the other. The clans and their interactions were way more interesting.So, in accord with the guidelines, it\'s very hard to write a review without spoilers, which I always find ridiculous because I\'ve put through so many ""spoiler warnings"" that I have a tendency to reject something out of hand if people insist of talking about it ""without spoilers"". In other words, I\'m getting progressively more annoyed with myself, MAL, and writing this review for saying essentially not to put spoilers in. Ooh.Anyway, the characters follow archetypes more than personalities. But it\'s their interaction with each other and the world at large that\'s interesting. Shiro is interesting only when he\'s being chased by someone else. That said he has good interaction with Kuro and Neko, his supporting cast. One which is his loyal pet and the other tried to kill him. Leading to some rather interestingly gay moments and tickled my fancy rather well without actually being sexual or gay in nature. Which is always a bonus, don\'t ask why it just is.There is an antagonist, but he\'s such a tiny presence in the anime it\'s hard to even call him that, so for the intents and purposes, Blue-clan and Red-clan are the antagonists of the show. For their own purposes, they want to find Shiro. Funnily enough, neither of those clans are evil. Certainly, Red-clan supposedly causes more violence and destruction, but in their cases, it\'s more of shades of grey than good or evil. Pick your form of evil, essentially.Flashbacks are mostly something  I wholeheartedly reject and frequently complain about. Considering the slow but steady pace of the anime, there were instances where it was nice to see a flashback and other times where it was entirely unnecessary. Overfeeding information while providing little new information or context. Or the context provided wasn\'t needed. Like the origin of the Kings. Entirely unnecessary, entirely boring. So they pulled out the shitty version and the okay version.So there are several things that the anime didn\'t explain, like new gimmicks, it was oh, gosh that gimmick appeared, wow, and then no explanation. I like that because if everybody knows what it is on sight, then how the hell are you going to naturally explain it to the viewer? And if it\'s important to know what it is, include it naturally in the story and don\'t have a character or ""god voice"" shove it down my bloody throat.Shiro\'s arch is simple and one of the most predictable things in the entire anime. An overused trope, done in the way of tropes. And baptized in Trope.Anyway. I\'ll end it here.It\'s a good watch. It\'s not the best in the world, but I would recommend this to the right people.  I don\'t know if, you who have gotten this far, are the right person. I can\'t tell you that. Give it a try. Like with broccoli, you won\'t know until you try it. And there are some really bad ways to treat broccoli. follow more closely than others.This is a complete work, and although it has more after, at the moment my investment in the show has all but been completed. Which is really nice, it\'s not often I find anime that finish in the same season they started in. (I\'m looking at you, One Piece, among others.) I strongly suggest, if you don\'t have anything else to watch or want to find something new, watch this, it was worth watching it to the end.Anyways I\'m rambling and tired, so I\'ll continue.It\'s presented as a crime-mystery kind of deal. ""I can\'t have murdered this person, but that certainly looks like me."" At which point it spirals into a ""who am I"" in order to find what\'s ACTUALLY going on. It\'s a tragedy, which was an unpleasant, pleasant surprise. What makes this show a good anime are the characters and their interaction. Like I\'ve said, plot vise, it\'s very simple and very predictable, but if you think of it as a story where the plot is an excuse to have the characters, although not entirely waterproof, a lot better.Good points:Good character(s) (interaction).Not black and white, good and evil.Good soundtracks.Good, clean visuals.Sometimes okayish flashbacks.Tragedy.Doesn\'t over-explain or hand feed you every little detailBad points:Simple plot.Too focused on Shiro.Flashbacks.I\'ll try to explain my opinions cohesively. This probably isn\'t the best idea I\'ve had.With such a large cast, it\'s impossible to get everything very exciting, or more than one dimensional. Which I think is fine. There is some, little, character growth, again I think that is fine. Not every story or every character needs to change in some way or another. Not everything is a life-changing process, and with thirteen characters, three main-casts, there really wasn\'t any time. This isn\'t GOT. And again, the anime gave a lot of attention to Shiro, which was meh, he wasn\'t a very interesting character, one way or the other. The clans and their interactions were way more interesting.So, in accord with the guidelines, it\'s very hard to write a review without spoilers, which I always find ridiculous because I\'ve put through so many ""spoiler warnings"" that I have a tendency to reject something out of hand if people insist of talking about it ""without spoilers"". In other words, I\'m getting progressively more annoyed with myself, MAL, and writing this review for saying essentially not to put spoilers in. Ooh.Anyway, the characters follow archetypes more than personalities. But it\'s their interaction with each other and the world at large that\'s interesting. Shiro is interesting only when he\'s being chased by someone else. That said he has good interaction with Kuro and Neko, his supporting cast. One which is his loyal pet and the other tried to kill him. Leading to some rather interestingly gay moments and tickled my fancy rather well without actually being sexual or gay in nature. Which is always a bonus, don\'t ask why it just is.There is an antagonist, but he\'s such a tiny presence in the anime it\'s hard to even call him that, so for the intents and purposes, Blue-clan and Red-clan are the antagonists of the show. For their own purposes, they want to find Shiro. Funnily enough, neither of those clans are evil. Certainly, Red-clan supposedly causes more violence and destruction, but in their cases, it\'s more of shades of grey than good or evil. Pick your form of evil, essentially.Flashbacks are mostly something  I wholeheartedly reject and frequently complain about. Considering the slow but steady pace of the anime, there were instances where it was nice to see a flashback and other times where it was entirely unnecessary. Overfeeding information while providing little new information or context. Or the context provided wasn\'t needed. Like the origin of the Kings. Entirely unnecessary, entirely boring. So they pulled out the shitty version and the okay version.So there are several things that the anime didn\'t explain, like new gimmicks, it was oh, gosh that gimmick appeared, wow, and then no explanation. I like that because if everybody knows what it is on sight, then how the hell are you going to naturally explain it to the viewer?

Ugh why do awesome stories end so sad. "", 'Note: This will be a review of both seasons, plus the movie.Overview:""K"", also known as ""K Project"", is an interesting anime, to say the least. Instead of trying to do anything completely original, it borrows bits and pieces from various other anime, mostly urban fantasies, while also putting its own unique twists on them. The results are somewhat hit-and-miss; while it does manage to execute some of its ideas better than the anime it borrowed them from, in other cases it falls into the all-too-common trap of valuing style above all else, though ultimately the positives of the series outweigh the negatives, and it rewards...viewers who have a lot of patience.Story (7/10):""K""\'s two seasons both tell a separate story, both of which are connected by the movie ""Missing Kings"", which bridges the gap between the two of them. However, it\'s impossible to say anything about the movie or second season without giving away some big spoilers, so I\'ll stick with the first season. To put it simply, ""K"" is set in an alternate version of modern-day Japan, which, unknown to the public, has managed to become the wealthy country it is largely thanks to the power of Kings, all-powerful people who run the country from behind the scenes and most of whom are the leaders of a clan. There are seven of them in total, each of them being represented by a colour and having a specific set of supernatural powers, which their clansmen can also use to a lesser extent. However, this Japan is far from a utopia, as the Kings often come into conflict with each other, particularly the Red Clan, known as HOMRA, and the Blue Clan, SCEPTER4, who have been on bad terms for a long time due to their conflicting ideologies. Yashiro Isana, generally just called Shiro, is a seemingly ordinary 17-year-old who gets pulled into this secret conflict when a man named Kuroh Yatogami tries to kill him because he suspects him of being the ""Colourless King"". His evidence for this is a video of someone who looks exactly like Shiro murdering a member of HOMRA, despite Shiro himself having no memory of doing such a thing. Fortunately, Shiro manages to convince Kuroh that he\'s been framed, and the two of them, along with the shapeshifting cat Neko, set on a quest to clear Shiro\'s name while also avoiding the many people who want to kill him. The truth, however, turns out to be far, far more complicated than any of them could have anticipated.Sounds interesting and mysterious, right? Well, that\'s because it is. Unfortunately, it also takes a really long time to finally get going. The events I\'ve just described take place over the first 3 episodes, when they could easily have been covered in 1 and a half or 2, and it isn\'t until the sixth episode that we finally feel like we\'re getting somewhere. And if you were hoping that things would improve in the second season, I\'m afraid I have to disappoint you, as said season has frequent padding that makes it seem like the series is trying way too hard to spread the story across its 13 episode runtime, despite many of the anime\'s answers having been already given at that point. The only part of the series that has no pacing problems whatsoever is the movie, and that\'s mostly because it\'s only an hour and 15 minutes long. I still enjoyed the overall plot once it actually started to get moving, but the fact remains that that the sluggish pacing is guaranteed to put off some viewers altogether, especially if you abide by the 3 episode rule, which I fortunately don\'t.Even so, the actual plot of the story proves to be quite good. In some ways, it even feels like the story that ""Kaze no Stigma"" should have been, with warring clans with supernatural powers inherited from a king, the main character getting framed for murder and the themes of family and power, even debating the importance of one over the other, something ""Kaze no Stigma"" never did. There\'s also a great amount of nuance when it comes to the clans. For example, HOMRA, the Red Clan, are described as violent above all else, but that doesn\'t mean they\'re evil; rather, they\'re just far too willing to use brute force in order to get the job done. By contrast, SCEPTER4, the Blue Clan, seem like the good guys on the surface, but are obsessed with order to a fault and their relationships are generally very cold and professional, while it\'s obvious that HOMRA care greatly for each other. As such, any fight between the two clans isn\'t good versus evil so much as order versus chaos. So overall, I did enjoy the story, even if I also found the ending to be pretty lacking.Art & Animation (9/10):“K” is notable for nothing if not its visuals, which for the most part are absolutely breathtaking. All the characters and various buildings are incredibly detailed and well-drawn in an amazing art style, and the animation is very fluid and smooth. That being said, there are a few camera issues, like when it tends to focus on Seri’s enormous chest or panties, to the point that by the second season, they get shoved in your face practically every time she’s on screen, which is particularly jarring since the show as a whole isn’t exactly fanservice heavy. Nevertheless, the series does look fantastic from start to finish, to the point that it comes as a surprise that the studio, GoHands, has been involved in very few other anime projects over the years.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):The music definitely isn’t memorable, consisting largely of dubstep tracks that do fit the series, but tend to just blend into the background rather than emphasise what’s going on. Granted, it does improve a fair bit in the second season, as while the first opening and ending themes, “Kings” and “Tsumetai Heya, Hitori"" are fairly forgettable, the second opening, “Asymmetry”, is great while the second ending theme, “Kai”, is fantastic, being extremely catchy and fitting the show perfectly. As for the voice acting, it’s good but I’ve heard better. Sam Riegel, Matthew Mercer and Stephanie Sheh do respectable jobs as Shiro, Kuroh and Neko, respectively, and the series has a number of great talents including Johnny Yong Bosch, Todd Haberkorn and Patrick Seitz. There are a few cases of more than one character being voiced by the same person, but in these cases, one of them is almost always a background character, so this wasn’t too much of an issue.Characters (7.5/10):Yashiro Isana is a complicated character, but if I were to describe him in one word, that word would be “dorky.” He’s kind, cheerful and not much of a fighter, but also mischievous and quick-witted, being able to get away from Kuroh when they first meet using fast thinking and trickery. While he initially seems to be just an ordinary high school student, and believes himself to be at first, it’s eventually revealed that he is much more than he seems and who he believes himself to be. However, while he is a lot more interesting than he appears to be on the surface, I still found myself liking him the least out of the three main characters, since at a certain point he just always seems to know the right thing to do in almost any situation. He even assumes a leadership role in the second season, which I found to be pretty odd since he isn’t really in any position to be making decisions, since in his past it was his own poorly thought out decisions that led to the events of the series in the first place, something the series sort of acknowledges but overall just glosses over. And yes, I understand that I’m being very vague, but that’s because Shiro as a whole is a walking spoiler, so I can’t say anything genuine about him without giving away some major plot points. Overall, I can say that even if I had my problems with him, I did like him a lot. He’s just not my favourite.Instead, my favourite character would have to be the second main character, Kuroh Yatogami. The best way to describe Kuroh would be that he’s logical, even stating early on that he judges people by what they have done rather than by who they are. Unfortunately, this mindset leads to him almost killing Shiro when they first meet out of a belief that he’s the evil being he’s been searching for, based solely on a video that he doesn’t even think could have been fabricated until Shiro suggests it. However, while he seems cold at first, he’s actually pretty reasonable, as even when he believes Shiro to be a murderer, he’s willing to listen to any last requests he might have and even cook a meal for him, and ultimately gives Shiro a chance to prove his innocence. However, it takes a while for Kuroh to warm up to Shiro fully, signified by him going from calling him by his full name to calling him by his nickname. At his core, Kuroh is a kind man who is very loyal to those who have earned it, and it’s likely not a coincidence that he looks and fights like a samurai. Since Shiro isn’t a fighter, it’s up to Kuroh to pick up the slack, which thankfully he absolutely does, often solely with his sword skills rather than any powers, though he does have those too. Additionally, while he seems ultra-serious on the surface, there are times when he can be just as dorky as Shiro, particularly when he listens to the many wise quotes from his late master on a recorder (which Shiro finds creepy). He also gets his own character arc in season 2 that coincides with Shiro’s, when a figure from his past comes back to haunt him. All in all, I would say that Kuroh is the most developed and fleshed-out character in the series, and probably the most badass as well.Last but not least is Neko, who seems to be just Shiro’s cat at first, but is revealed to be what Kuroh calls a Strain, a mysterious being who has powers naturally instead of them being granted to her by a King. Now, one of my favourite types of character are those who completely go against everything you would expect them to be, something that sums up Neko perfectly. Instead of being snarky, rude, aloof and standoffish like cat characters normally are, Neko is cheerful, sweet, loyal and protective- in short, adorable. Her powers are illusion-based, which doesn’t seem particularly threatening, but is actually very effective, to the point that she manages to be a match for Kuroh of all people in the second episode alone, and proves herself a force to be reckoned with on multiple occasions. While she’s the primary source of comic relief in the series, she also has a tragic past like the other two main characters, though exactly how she got her powers is never totally explained. While I did find her annoying from time to time, she overall rounds up the trio nicely, and does a fine job at keeping up people’s spirits if nothing else, which Kuroh accurately calling her “unbelievably optimistic about everything.”The rest of the cast is a mixed bag, as while HOMRA and SCEPTER4 have a lot more members in them than the main group does, how fleshed-out and developed they are tends to vary a lot. In particular, SCEPTER4 has probably the biggest group in the series, yet only 3 of them- Reisi Munakata, the Blue King, Seri Awashima, his second-in-command and Saruhiko, the third-in-command and a former HOMRA member- are given any real focus or development, with the majority of the rest of them having names and little else. Contrast that with HOMRA, who have far fewer members but at least 5 or 6 that are decently-developed or have some kind of quirk to make them stand out. If I were to pick a favourite outside the main trio, it would have to be Anna Kushina, a young girl and member of HOMRA who serves as the focus of the movie. As for the villains, the villain of the first season is just a generic “evil for the sake of it” villain, but the villains in the second season are given a lot more depth, as well as a clear end-goal. The main villain’s goal, in fact, bares a strong similarity to that of a certain “Skulduggery Pleasant” villain, though of course I can’t say anything beyond that.Enjoyment (7.5/10):The show’s frequent padding means you’re pretty likely to feel bored from time to time, and I can certainly say I felt that way on multiple occasions. Additionally, while the fight scenes are beautifully animated, how exciting they are tends to vary, with some of them amounting to the characters just dancing around each other and occasionally clashing weapons, as well as a couple that just felt pointless. There is a fair amount of comic relief, however, and while there are some very dark moments, the tone is light enough that there’s always hope things will turn out fine.Overall:As a whole, “K” makes a number of big mistakes. It tosses in too many characters and doesn’t flesh them out, it drags out its story to the point that it sometimes feels the show’s length is artificially extended and its music varies from forgettable to passable, and occasionally great. Nevertheless, this is still worth watching if you like this kind of series, with a fantastic trio of main characters, an overall good plot and truly beautiful visuals.Score:7+9+8.5+7.5+7.5=39.5/50=7.9/10 viewers who have a lot of patience.Story (7/10):""K""\'s two seasons both tell a separate story, both of which are connected by the movie ""Missing Kings"", which bridges the gap between the two of them. However, it\'s impossible to say anything about the movie or second season without giving away some big spoilers, so I\'ll stick with the first season. To put it simply, ""K"" is set in an alternate version of modern-day Japan, which, unknown to the public, has managed to become the wealthy country it is largely thanks to the power of Kings, all-powerful people who run the country from behind the scenes and most of whom are the leaders of a clan. There are seven of them in total, each of them being represented by a colour and having a specific set of supernatural powers, which their clansmen can also use to a lesser extent. However, this Japan is far from a utopia, as the Kings often come into conflict with each other, particularly the Red Clan, known as HOMRA, and the Blue Clan, SCEPTER4, who have been on bad terms for a long time due to their conflicting ideologies. Yashiro Isana, generally just called Shiro, is a seemingly ordinary 17-year-old who gets pulled into this secret conflict when a man named Kuroh Yatogami tries to kill him because he suspects him of being the ""Colourless King"". His evidence for this is a video of someone who looks exactly like Shiro murdering a member of HOMRA, despite Shiro himself having no memory of doing such a thing. Fortunately, Shiro manages to convince Kuroh that he\'s been framed, and the two of them, along with the shapeshifting cat Neko, set on a quest to clear Shiro\'s name while also avoiding the many people who want to kill him. The truth, however, turns out to be far, far more complicated than any of them could have anticipated.Sounds interesting and mysterious, right? Well, that\'s because it is. Unfortunately, it also takes a really long time to finally get going. The events I\'ve just described take place over the first 3 episodes, when they could easily have been covered in 1 and a half or 2, and it isn\'t until the sixth episode that we finally feel like we\'re getting somewhere. And if you were hoping that things would improve in the second season, I\'m afraid I have to disappoint you, as said season has frequent padding that makes it seem like the series is trying way too hard to spread the story across its 13 episode runtime, despite many of the anime\'s answers having been already given at that point. The only part of the series that has no pacing problems whatsoever is the movie, and that\'s mostly because it\'s only an hour and 15 minutes long. I still enjoyed the overall plot once it actually started to get moving, but the fact remains that that the sluggish pacing is guaranteed to put off some viewers altogether, especially if you abide by the 3 episode rule, which I fortunately don\'t.Even so, the actual plot of the story proves to be quite good. In some ways, it even feels like the story that ""Kaze no Stigma"" should have been, with warring clans with supernatural powers inherited from a king, the main character getting framed for murder and the themes of family and power, even debating the importance of one over the other, something ""Kaze no Stigma"" never did. There\'s also a great amount of nuance when it comes to the clans. For example, HOMRA, the Red Clan, are described as violent above all else, but that doesn\'t mean they\'re evil; rather, they\'re just far too willing to use brute force in order to get the job done. By contrast, SCEPTER4, the Blue Clan, seem like the good guys on the surface, but are obsessed with order to a fault and their relationships are generally very cold and professional, while it\'s obvious that HOMRA care greatly for each other. As such, any fight between the two clans isn\'t good versus evil so much as order versus chaos. So overall, I did enjoy the story, even if I also found the ending to be pretty lacking.Art & Animation (9/10):“K” is notable for nothing if not its visuals, which for the most part are absolutely breathtaking. All the characters and various buildings are incredibly detailed and well-drawn in an amazing art style, and the animation is very fluid and smooth. That being said, there are a few camera issues, like when it tends to focus on Seri’s enormous chest or panties, to the point that by the second season, they get shoved in your face practically every time she’s on screen, which is particularly jarring since the show as a whole isn’t exactly fanservice heavy. Nevertheless, the series does look fantastic from start to finish, to the point that it comes as a surprise that the studio, GoHands, has been involved in very few other anime projects over the years.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):The music definitely isn’t memorable, consisting largely of dubstep tracks that do fit the series, but tend to just blend into the background rather than emphasise what’s going on. Granted, it does improve a fair bit in the second season, as while the first opening and ending themes, “Kings” and “Tsumetai Heya, Hitori"" are fairly forgettable, the second opening, “Asymmetry”, is great while the second ending theme, “Kai”, is fantastic, being extremely catchy and fitting the show perfectly. As for the voice acting, it’s good but I’ve heard better. Sam Riegel, Matthew Mercer and Stephanie Sheh do respectable jobs as Shiro, Kuroh and Neko, respectively, and the series has a number of great talents including Johnny Yong Bosch, Todd Haberkorn and Patrick Seitz. There are a few cases of more than one character being voiced by the same person, but in these cases, one of them is almost always a background character, so this wasn’t too much of an issue.Characters (7.5/10):Yashiro Isana is a complicated character, but if I were to describe him in one word, that word would be “dorky.” He’s kind, cheerful and not much of a fighter, but also mischievous and quick-witted, being able to get away from Kuroh when they first meet using fast thinking and trickery. While he initially seems to be just an ordinary high school student, and believes himself to be at first, it’s eventually revealed that he is much more than he seems and who he believes himself to be. However, while he is a lot more interesting than he appears to be on the surface, I still found myself liking him the least out of the three main characters, since at a certain point he just always seems to know the right thing to do in almost any situation. He even assumes a leadership role in the second season, which I found to be pretty odd since he isn’t really in any position to be making decisions, since in his past it was his own poorly thought out decisions that led to the events of the series in the first place, something the series sort of acknowledges but overall just glosses over. And yes, I understand that I’m being very vague, but that’s because Shiro as a whole is a walking spoiler, so I can’t say anything genuine about him without giving away some major plot points. Overall, I can say that even if I had my problems with him, I did like him a lot. He’s just not my favourite.Instead, my favourite character would have to be the second main character, Kuroh Yatogami. The best way to describe Kuroh would be that he’s logical, even stating early on that he judges people by what they have done rather than by who they are. Unfortunately, this mindset leads to him almost killing Shiro when they first meet out of a belief that he’s the evil being he’s been searching for, based solely on a video that he doesn’t even think could have been fabricated until Shiro suggests it. However, while he seems cold at first, he’s actually pretty reasonable, as even when he believes Shiro to be a murderer, he’s willing to listen to any last requests he might have and even cook a meal for him, and ultimately gives Shiro a chance to prove his innocence. However, it takes a while for Kuroh to warm up to Shiro fully, signified by him going from calling him by his full name to calling him by his nickname. At his core, Kuroh is a kind man who is very loyal to those who have earned it, and it’s likely not a coincidence that he looks and fights like a samurai. Since Shiro isn’t a fighter, it’s up to Kuroh to pick up the slack, which thankfully he absolutely does, often solely with his sword skills rather than any powers, though he does have those too. Additionally, while he seems ultra-serious on the surface, there are times when he can be just as dorky as Shiro, particularly when he listens to the many wise quotes from his late master on a recorder (which Shiro finds creepy). He also gets his own character arc in season 2 that coincides with Shiro’s, when a figure from his past comes back to haunt him. All in all, I would say that Kuroh is the most developed and fleshed-out character in the series, and probably the most badass as well.Last but not least is Neko, who seems to be just Shiro’s cat at first, but is revealed to be what Kuroh calls a Strain, a mysterious being who has powers naturally instead of them being granted to her by a King.

So...I remember I first watched this because I confused it somehow with K-On a few years ago and when I saw it again on Netflix, I decided to give it a shot even though I was so confused when I watched the first episode because I had no idea what was going on. At the time of writing, I actually finished the 2nd season a few weeks ago after watching the movie after the 1st season which serves as an epilogue--an important part. I\'ve always said that No...Game No Life is my favorite anime whenever I thought about it, but K definitely breaks that.Story (10)The two genres I avoid are action and adventure since it prolongs a lot to a point that it becomes stale (which is why I stopped watching Fairy Tail). Possibly because this was meant to be shorter than that, it\'s well done.People may complain about too much mystery, but my first reaction to finishing the second season was ""so season one was a set up to the next."" It isn\'t the newest plot, but it is in no way stale. I had no complaints in the beginning or the end (or the middle parts).Pacing is apparently too slow in the beginning and too fast in the end, but I didn\'t see it that way. I found the pacing nice since it introduces characters and the major plotline. I have no idea what you, the viewer, may look in a show when it comes to story, but this is a show I would watch again even though I know what happens and would choose this to show friends who don\'t watch too much anime to watch (of course given they don\'t hate this genre).Unlike my other reviews where I got annoyed at the ending of the shows, this is one of the few anime where I enjoyed the ending and was deeply satisfied by it (referring to Season 2, but Season 1 had a good ending from memory).Art (10)Okay, except for the 3D parts (which I understand since I wouldn\'t want to draw those scenes either), the art is amazing. I may or may not be conflating great art with bright colors (like No Game No Life), but the animation is smooth, the designs are sharp, and aesthetics are on point.If comparing to Fairy Tail and No Game No Life (as much as it hurts to say it), when it comes to fluidity of animation and character\'s shapes, this beats it. For slice of life watercolor-like art, this is on the same level as them, if not better. I would say that I would prefer the art of this anime in comparison to Mekakucity Actors or Blood Lad.I can\'t see any competitors in 2012 for art honestly. Especially since it was from 2012 while beforehand, we had things like Angel Beats, Fruits Basket, and Fairy Tail (love them, it\'s just that when looking back, it seems very choppy).Season two honestly had really good animation, but I do have a question on the gleaming lights of the buttons that seemed to be a major point for the Blues as well as the *ahem* certain physics of one character in particular... (why now did you choose to do this?! I understand she\'s the only adult female, but it was too unexpected)Sound (10)When I heard Mikoto\'s theme, I was captured immediately. The sounds fit perfectly with the alternative history futuristic setting. I would like to make a comparison to Mekakucity Actors if possible (though I watched that such a long time ago) since I remember it having a similar vibe (or not--I\'m planning on watching it later this week).If you\'re looking for a great soundtrack to listen to, I honestly think K would be a major contender. I\'m not crazy on the OP and ED of most anime (mostly since I skip them), but I remember really liking the beginning and ending. No Game No Life (my holy grail of anime at this point) was my favorite OST, beating Your Lie In April and My Little Monster, but seriously K beats all of them for being my favorite.Character (9)Although in season 1, character development isn\'t seen greatly since there\'s no need (in the sense that it focuses on the story of one person and the conflicts are based on our protagonist). But the range of characters is not boring. Although you can see the personalities as being generic, I actually think they were well-made considering the different clans and the type of people they make them, with one character being most interesting in his switch of clans.But, the whole cast isn\'t made of certain archetypes for no particular reason (or at least in my opinion). Comparing it to Fairy Tail\'s enormous and colorful cast with their own weird common sense, K is a lot more tone downed. Characters don\'t do crazy things to do crazy things (or at least not in the first season). Honestly, only about 15 characters are important in the whole show, which means a lot. Although the past of all of them isn\'t known in the anime, flashbacks and character interaction will tell the relationships between all of the characters. Because of the nature of the show, thrusting our MC into a new circle of characters (like in Fairy Tail and Aria the Scarlet Ammo--defined character bonds) with a major problem, the whole history can\'t be shown.The character dynamics between all of the various characters are the most interesting.

The plot was eehhh and the pacing was all over the place- i wouldn't praise it as a 'good anime'. I personally really enjoyed it because it was deep and quite entertaining, but i know clearly that this anime isn't for everyone and it's understandable why people wouldn't like it. I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys well written plots, but if you're prepared to go in without any expectations and just let yourself go along for the ride, then you should give the anime a go.Before I start reviewing the plot and characters...itself, let's talk about how beautiful the aesthetics of this anime are. If you're afraid the animation and art are going to be similar to Gohand's other works, don't be deterred. The animation and style of the characters is nothing like Handshakers, without any of the shaky animation that makes your eyes hurt. The shading is really pretty, and has this blue sheen that adds a lot to the mood.The soundtracks and the osts of this anime are some of the best I've ever heard; they add a lot to the mood and some of the tracks fall under lofi. I honestly recommend that you have a listen to the soundtrack even if you don't watch or don't like the anime.Now, other reviewers are talking how trash the plot is, and honestly, they're right. If you're looking for an anime that has great writing and is plot heavy, this anime really isn't for you. The pacing was truly not done well- even if the anime only had 13 episodes to work with. The ending was extremely rushed, and the plot threads were resolved in a really underwhelming manner- they even forgot to give the villain a motive apart from 'i don't like them'. This completely destroys the mysterious feeling the first half of the anime was building. The first half of the anime was really slow, but personally i really enjoyed that. It built up this tension and this mysterious mood that i adored. Some say it was extremely boring, and yes, they could have written the story better so that they didn't have to rush the ending. The premise was actually really interesting and they could have done a lot better if they fixed the pacing and developed the villains and so on.As for the characters... they were fine. The writers were really trying to make them feel deep like with Kuroh, but it just didn't work. I'd say that the only character who actually had detailed development was Shiro. The mystery of Shiro really could have been done better. He had so much potential and the reveal was just really underwhelming, but watching him realize he wasn't who he thought he was really entertaining. Much of the tension between the characters were left unexplained like with Fushimi and Misaki (but that was resolved in one of the movies from K: Seven Stories, however a good series should be standalone without having to make the audience watch a movie to know the details). The characters were fine, engaging while it lasted but in the end, are just sort of flat.One thing i will praise K project for is the mood. The first half of the anime was absolutely beautiful- Shiro eventually realizing he wasn't who he thought he was and the mystery behind the death of Red Clansmen. Although this was broken by the bad pacing, it was somewhat engaging and made an interesting premise while it lasted. The power system and the art/music/mood was enough to carry me to the end.In the end, to me, K project is a really unsatisfying anime that was really enjoyable. If you don't mind watching an anime you'll easily forget with bad pacing - then you'll get a little kick out of watching it. itself, let's talk about how beautiful the aesthetics of this anime are. If you're afraid the animation and art are going to be similar to Gohand's other works, don't be deterred. The animation and style of the characters is nothing like Handshakers, without any of the shaky animation that makes your eyes hurt. The shading is really pretty, and has this blue sheen that adds a lot to the mood.The soundtracks and the osts of this anime are some of the best I've ever heard; they add a lot to the mood and some of the tracks fall under lofi. I honestly recommend that you have a listen to the soundtrack even if you don't watch or don't like the anime.Now, other reviewers are talking how trash the plot is, and honestly, they're right. If you're looking for an anime that has great writing and is plot heavy, this anime really isn't for you. The pacing was truly not done well- even if the anime only had 13 episodes to work with. The ending was extremely rushed, and the plot threads were resolved in a really underwhelming manner- they even forgot to give the villain a motive apart from 'i don't like them'.

I personally enjoyed watching it and the ART IS AMAZING.It is more of a drama-type with lots of emotions, but it has a lot of fighting scenes too.I do find it sad. Maybe it's just because I really hate when characters I find interesting die, but still the story is MAINLY FOCUSED ON EMOTIONS.You will see a lot of action, but behind everything, you will be able to see/hear/read the character's reasons why they did that.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYBODY who likes to see more about human psychology and emotions.Kinda like nicer view...on humankind than Izaya from Durarara has. on humankind than Izaya from Durarara has."", ""K is an anime I remember hearing a lot about right before it came out and little after when it finally aired. From the trailers it looked amazing with exceptional artwork and dazzling characters, but I heard from people who had seen the show that it ended up being somewhat underwhelming. For that reason, I put this show off for a long time and finally got into it recently when I ran out of stuff to watch.While I can see why people were disappointed with this series, and despite its problems, I feel that the show doesn't get enough credit. In fact, I'm convinced it's...one of the more underrated anime out there. For anyone interested in getting into the show, I personally recommend going into it with as little knowledge as possible and as few expectations. For this reason, I'm going to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.The best part of the show is easily the artwork in every category: design, the backgrounds, character designs, the quality, and animation, all of it is absolutely breathtaking and some of the best in the industry to date. If this were a review based solely on the artwork, it would easily be a 10/10.The sound design and quality is also really good, though it isn't anything particularly unique (aside from its soundtrack). The voice acting was as good as could be expected for anime dubbing (yes, I watched it dubbed. Sue me.), but it's decent and the soundtrack, while well developed, interesting and stylish, doesn't exactly heighten the emotion like a soundtrack is supposed to do. That being said, for every thing the soundtrack does not do, it more than makes up for it by adding a fresh atmospheric layer to the series in a way that most anime are not able to do. You definitely can't say the sound team didn't try something new with its jazz piano and contemporary orchestral beats.The series oozes style! Aside from the art, this is the best part of the anime and the reason why it was such a highly anticipated show when it released, and nowhere is that more apparent than by the way the red's (one of the show's two main gang factions) were designed. Every member of the red gang has his own individual style and quirks, almost as if they grew up in the designer stores of Harajuku, Japan. The other characters, while not as flashy nor as interesting to look at as the red's, also come into their own style's as well (with one major exception: virtually all the blues). Everything, from the way the characters dress to the way they fight, tells a story in and of itself and says a lot about the characters in a way that the story was unfortunately unable to capture.That brings me to the first negative of the show. The quality of the characters themselves (style and artwork aside) is pretty mixed. There are some characters that are really good (pretty much anyone in the red's, Kuro, and Shiro) and there are characters that aren't as good (pretty much anyone on the blue's, Neko, Shiro towards the end, the colorless king, etc.). Not that the characters are bad, mind you, but if you've noticed, there's a disparity between the two gang factions; the blues and the reds. For those of you that have already seen K, why do you think that is?The biggest reason why the blue's aren't as interesting as the red's is largely do to the homogeneity that the faction is meant to create. Unlike the reds, who represent chaos and individuality, the blues are meant to represent order and the collective. The blue's all act the same, dress the same, and talk the same way and as a result, the characters suffer. The only blue that's ever somewhat interesting is Reishi and that's because he's a defector from the red's whose loyalty is always understandably in question.You might have also noticed that I haven't even talked about who are supposed to be the main character of the story, Shiro. He is a good character with his own quirks and personality (and fashion sense), and he's actually fairly well developed up until the final few episodes, but the other characters are so much more interesting and fun to watch that he's constantly stuck under the shadow of the red's and Kuro, the man who's trying to kill him.For that reason, it's admittedly difficult to get into the main story when the whole west-side-story-type gang war going on between both the red's and blue's is so much more interesting. In fact, if the writers had simply developed the series on solely THAT story instead, the score would have probably been higher. The main story involving Shiro, Kuro, and Neko and the mystery surrounding the Colorless king is still enjoyable, but no where near as interesting as everything else that's happening around them.And onto the story itself, for the most part it's fine. It's nothing to write home to about, and it definitely uses familiar tropes and borrows elements from other anime and stories to develop it's world and lore, but it comes into its own more and more as the series develops.K is kind of like a Guy Ritchie movie: tons of style, little substance, and that's largely due to this show's short runtime (13 episodes). The story that the writers wanted to tell was much more ambition and larger than what they had the capacity to create, especially in the manner they chose to develop it (a slow boil), and by the end of the show, the writers had to wrap up so many plot threads that it felt very rushed, and many of the twists and turns the show takes at the end were not only predictable, but underwhelming and undeserved.It's not exactly badly done though. The writers did the best they could with the time they were given, but they needed to make the show longer in order to better develop both the main characters and the main story. In fact, despite the short runtime, they had managed to wrap most of it up while leaving a cliffhanger for future stories relatively well. There are some plot holes here and there, but they're mostly minor details. And while the show is short, it's a very fun ride, especially for the first half of the show.CONCLUSION:I Loved K! For the first 5 or 6 episodes, I was thinking this was totally going to be an 8 or a 9 out of 10, and until the last few episodes, it would have been. The reason the show wasn’t as good as it could have been was because the writers bit off more than they could chew for a 13 episode runtime. K is not going to be your favorite anime, but I'm sure if you keep your expectations at a reasonable level, (don't go into this thinking it's going to be a masterpiece) you'll enjoy the hell out of it!SHORT VERSION:Story: 6/10 (Decent)Art: 10/10 (Masterpiece!)Sound: 8/10 (Really Good)Characters: 5/10 (Mediocre)Enjoyment: 8/10 (Really Good)Final Score: 6/10 (Decent, and the highest 6/10 I've ever given) one of the more underrated anime out there.

The only con really would be the pacing of the story, but even that picked up towards the end and made sense when taking into account the large cast.Art (10): The characters, the background, and the animations. Wow, just wow. Hands down some of the best I have ever seen and mad props to GoHands for this.Sound (10): Also a masterpiece. The sounds in K always seemed to fit the story and reminds me much of final fantasy with how beautiful they were.Character (10):...The characters were all very interesting too. The kings and their loneliness, the loyalty of the red clan compared to the subordination and discipline of the blues. The friendship between certain red and blue clansmen and mutual respect were all some of many aspects that developed and deepened my understanding of the characters and world.Enjoyment (10): I enjoyed this anime very much, for both the final fantasy vibes and animation. And even if I did not love the story, I would still stick through if not only for the beautiful sounds and stunning art.Overall (10): Although there were some aspects such as the slow start to the story people complain about.

What it lakes in story and character development it makes up for in the art and sheer enjoyment. the main characters your slighly more intellegent idiot but all the same highly lovable.The sound get kinda tedersome with at best  maybe 4 pieces of music being used throughout 13 episodes yet they are quite good. loved the OP and ED for this would definately watch his again along with the upcoming sequel "", 'Starting out K was very slow, but the more you watched the anime the more you began to feel yourself pulled into the story.The intense battles that happen later on in the show allow your heart to start to race with anticipation. You were able to get to know the characters of Homra and feel the hate...or at least dislike between the multiple clans; and frankly I liked this anime for that reason. Watching it I experienced intense feelings, those of sadness, joy, and confusion.Any day would I recommend this watch...I just wish there were more episodes. ;) ', 'I take several issues with this anime, most of which are excellently summed up in j_shark\'s review.  Really, anything I can point out, they already have, so I shall just streamline my concerns.+ / - The production value is of very high quality.  The animation for the fight scenes is clear, crisp, and smooth.  This, for the most part, makes this decent enough to watch and enjoy.  The best I can compare it to, for me, is Guilty Crown, which is amazing, visually, but has subpar plot and characterization standards.- As for characters, few are well rounded.  There are essentially...four female characters that matter, all of which are there simply to look pretty and be protected.  Even the Captain of the Blue King has to be protected three times in this anime by her subordinates all while striking some jarring and uneeded fan service fueled pose.  The other main female spends a lot of her screen time naked, which I\'ll leave at that.  The other two main females, three if we\'re somehow counting the static student council president as a character at all, spend their time not saying much and having no true motivations of their own.  There is some neat and intriguing interplay between the clans and clansmen which I appreciated, and it was one of the few things they kept me watching, actually.- The logic behind half of these characters is near impossible to follow.  For example, you should know by reading the plot synopsis that people are trying to figure out who murdered a beloved Red Faction, HOMRA member.  Everyone believes it to be Shiro, so they target him.  However, every time clans get together, they intrinsically fight each other, letting Shiro go almost every time.  I couldn\'t figure out why they couldn\'t work together to kill the same person, which is still poignant at the end when they have a shouting match over who gets to kill who. I still don\'t understand why any of this could have been avoided using words and properly explaining situations.  Character logic is very easily picked apart, such as a character disliking people who don\'t play by the rules...and then goes around and acts \'extralegally\' because he\'s somehow above the laws that govern everyone else.- Plot is thrown together haphazardly with this same degree of untraceable logic.  The villain is simply a villain who does villain-y things.  Every character does what they want without proper rounded motivation as to why they were even friends with so-and-so in the first place, or why they are so suicidal and reckless.  Mostly, as a viewer, you\'re going to be served a \'just because\' attitude underneath it all, which I find flippant and boring.  About the only character who seems to understand himself and has the better character development arc would be the Black Dog.  Even then, with him, I\'m not sure how he exists at all since before the story he should have had his powers nullified with the death of his old king.  Or how these people didn\'t get slapped with some sort of copyright infringement from the creator of D.Gray Man.  I\'m being humorous with this - but Kuro is totally Kanda Yuu.- They made a Nazi a good, sympathetic character.  I take severe issue with this and it shouldn\'t need much explanation as to why this is a problem.  His whole motivation resolves around ""I thought I was doing a good thing by making a super weapon capable of eliminating massive amounts of the population"" which is just...haphazard writing.  And completely unjustifiable.  Yet, we\'re supposed to feel sorry for him.  Why the writers did this is completely beyond me, aside from ""the Allies were awful because they killed someone\'s sibling"", and it\'s quite possibly the most awful portion of this anime\'s storyline.+ The themes deal with loneliness and isolation when dealing with higher powers, but without the proper support of exposition and explanation, it just barely makes it as a plus.  Many times during the show I found myself shouting for someone to just explain things already.  Many plot holes could have been shored up with a simple sentence, but we\'re left with \'just because\' to fill up the cracks.  Still, it\'s a surprising theme, and adds a strong tone of tragedy to a lot of character\'s actions.+ The first and second episode are the best out of them all.  These were the truly enjoyable episodes, and I wish the rest of the series could have played as such.  They were, after all, why I started watching it, going in with the expectations I had.You should spend time watching this.  Just do not expect masterpiece and emotionally evoking material.

It feels rushed and none of the characters leave a huge impact on the viewer. The main character's arc felt like a cop out. In the beginning it was quite slow and chill as if we were going to get a lot more changes to...the plot but it turned out to be stagnant until later on. The way they explained the concept of the 7 kings left a lot of questions, they were also missing a couple of kings, it was also explained pretty later on. The ending and the climax were pretty underwhelming, there wasn't enough tension at all. The villain should've appeared more frequently.Still if you just wanna kill time, listen to a good sound track while watching some anime tiddies and cool visuals sometimes this ain't too bad. the plot but it turned out to be stagnant until later on.

It has an interesting premise, a unique art style, and interesting character design. I wanted to like it so I watched the whole season, but I never got invested. The story was bland and uninteresting at best and confusing at worst. The stakes and drama never felt genuine, and I was very lost throughout multiple episodes. If the audience was given a little more clarification, the characters had a little more depth, or if the audience felt more of a personal investment in the stakes, it would be much more compelling. Overall, it's not the...worst thing I've watched, but I won't be thinking about it again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and I wouldn't rewatch it. worst thing I've watched, but I won't be thinking about it again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and I wouldn't rewatch it.""]"
