Beelzebub: Hirotta Akachan wa Daimaou!?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9120/Beelzebub__Hirotta_Akachan_wa_Daimaou,"[""Essentially this is just a preview of what's to come in the first 10-20 episodes of the anime. Don't bother watching this, just go straight to the anime.If you already watched the anime, do not watch this.This episode simply is meant to hype what at the time was the upcoming season, nothing more. And it does a good job of that, if you had previously read the manga. For those just getting into this, it might not make much sense. This essentially just spoils what are some very funny scenes and also actual plot.The animation style of this is actually also a bit different than...the anime.It's pretty solid as a summary, but honestly it is not worth your time. the anime.It's pretty solid as a summary, but honestly it is not worth your time."", 'If you\'re planning to watch this Special episode before starting the main Anime, I strongly do not recommend it.This episode essentially condenses the first 10 episodes of the Anime, with a few minor spoilers for the following 10 episodes. Being the eager viewer that I am, I thought watching it in ""chronological order"" would enhance my experience. However, this ended up ruining the surprise and excitement of those initial episodes - it was mostly a boring watch. I already knew what would happen, and it felt like a predictable sequence of events.Although the Anime takes a different approach to presenting these events, the outcomes remain...the same. This episode spoils the plots, twists, and character introductions for the first 10 episodes.I still recommend watching it, but only after you finish the entire anime or at least the first 20 episodes. It offers a slightly different approach to presenting events and executes certain aspects better. However, it\'s not worth spoiling the experience for yourself by watching it too soon.So, enjoy Beelzebub to the fullest, but save this Special episode for later. You won\'t regret it. the same.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Sailor Stars - Hero Club,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13931/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon__Sailor_Stars_-_Hero_Club,"['A weird and unnecessary entry in the Sailor Moon franchise, this ""Hero Club"" project is comprised of 3 weak recap episodes of Sailor Stars (the last arc) which aired in a TV time slot alongside other recaps like this from 1996 till 1997.Because it aired almost in the same time as Stars, I\'m guessing it was made to promote the show by showing us how good it is but it actually fails as a recap. The first episode show the defeat of Nehellenia but without the battle part (the most important), it shows some random dialogue and narration by some characters but it really doesn\'t...feel that tied up together.The remaining episodes spend time with random fights against Phages, Nezu appears from the Animamates team but we\'ll get a glimpse of Siren and Crow and we see Galaxia in only 2 scenes. The pacing is all over the place and it doesn\'t really help that we never see the end of the fight. It\'s like Toei made 3 30 minutes long previews to promote the main show and teased the hell out of the viewers. If you wanna know the plot you better read the synopsis from somewhere cause this anime won\'t tell you. The only think that you\'ll get here is that new enemies appear and the sailor soldiers have to defeat them (that if you didn\'t watch Stars).It\'s unwatchable before Stars and unwatchable after Stars (because we have Memorial), it\'s just a quick preview to hype/tease the audience and they never show the last battle against Galaxia or any cool fight from beginning to end.The only good part is that we see a lot of transformation scenes and some special attacks and we have some short narration but don\'t expect anything note worthy. Also the usual Starlights songs inserted from time to time.No Sailor Moon fan will get angry if you skip this one, you\'d be better off watching AMVs. feel that tied up together.The remaining episodes spend time with random fights against Phages, Nezu appears from the Animamates team but we\'ll get a glimpse of Siren and Crow and we see Galaxia in only 2 scenes.

Aoyama Goushou Tanpenshuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5578/Aoyama_Goushou_Tanpenshuu,"['Simply a masterpiece!Delve into the mind of one the greatest mangaka artists of the late-80\'s to early-90\'s era, whilst taking pleasure in his eccentric universe and fantastic storytelling. While this short was released almost 16 years ago--as of writing this review--, the legacy of Aoyama\'s great works carries on.His distinctive art-style left many, to this day, pondering whether to count it as a welcomed gift to the animanga world, or as a defiant far cry from the industry-standard of ""moe"", which have made it susceptible to criticism.The specials follow 7 episodes, with the 7th being an episode that details the process of making Meitantei Conan....These shorts are excellent, and let me tell you why: Aoyama\'s universe is unchanging, unflinching, and perfectly in sync. Classical stories, classical characters, and heck, even classical voice-overs, in an intact universe, where you get to see amazing characters that live within Aoyama\'s world besides Conan and Ran, and how they live throughout the day. Aoyama\'s stories display to us how he has an excellent command on combining a realistic worldview, authentic Japanese culture, with (sometimes) quirky low-level fantasy and magic of Sakura trees turning old samurais into youthful kend≈ç masters, genius children falling from grace, a ridiculously short detective that maintains a sharp image with a confident aura that surrounds him, and a crazy love story on the most special day in the most average man\'s life.These specials are short, and they\'re meant to be that way. These are normal characters in the Meitantei Conan universe that will probably never get anymore screen time, and that\'s only because their author opted for them to remain normal, yet, show us the most interesting day in their lives. The subtlety is what makes these specials so interesting.These characters will carry on their lives normally, but one thing for sure, is that Aoyama wanted us to take a glimpse of the most special and crazy day in their lives. Sanjuro will probably die of old age, living the rest of his life peacefully in rural Japan. And we will probably never know of what happens next, to the most awesome detective that is George and his new-found secretary, with their constant silly adventures. Keisuke will continue on with his life, but he will never forget that special day that made him fall in love with an idol.It\'s important to note that the specials also provide an entertaining look into Shinchi\'s parents, back when he was a small child. I believe this begs the question: do I need to watch Detective Conan to enjoy these specials? With the exclusion of the specials containing Shinchi\'s parents, the answer is absolutely not! These specials tell the short stories of characters within Aoyama\'s universe, and while they share the same world, it certainly won\'t affect the experience. Fans of Aoyama\'s works however, will certainly take a liking to this, as they crave more of his world outside of Conan and Kaito.In the end, why did I gave these specials a 10? Aside from the great stories, terrific characters, classical late-90\'s soundtrack, and exquisite voice-overs from seasoned veterans that voiced characters in the Meitantei Conan series, a comparative review could easily give this score over and over no matter how many times you look at it.In today\'s anime shows, we are constantly met with bland, cheap, or abusive stories. Just the other day I watched an anime short, and that pretty much gave me an idea of the industry\'s current state.The anime was about an otaku who married a normal girl, and while the premise was preparing for something very interesting, and even MAL listed its genre as seinen, it fell short right around the 2nd episode, where they added a shotacon filled with a deep brother-complex, fast forward to the 10th episode, and then you have an ensemble cast of weeaboos, ""quirky"" moe characters, absolutely no character development, no story progression, they just go to conventions and sell doujins, half the show was moe scenes. That\'s it.So if you ask me, in comparison to today\'s anime standards, does this deserve a perfect 10? Yes, yes it does. It\'s a complete and concise special that fills the gaps on every end, and certainly leaves you wanting for more. It\'s perfect. That would be my answer.Thank you for reading.

That would be my answer.Thank you for reading.', ""TL;DR Some interesting concepts.  A refreshing break from Detective ConanGosho Aoyama's short stories collection is a collection of, well, short stories.  There are seven stories in all, each of various length.  Some runs for the full episode length while others run much shorter.  Each of the stories are self-contained, although I like the fact that some of the stories are loosely connected in some ways.The stories are set in the Detective Conan world, but are in no way connected to any of its characters.  One story features a tiny-size detective, another story features an old man magically becomes young again....They are in the realm of fantasy, sure, but they work surprisingly well.  Just do not expect to have the same quality as Aoyama's more famous work, Detective Conan.  Speaking of which, some of the stories features Conan's parents, which is somewhat refreshing, because we don't see much of them in Detective Conan.If you are looking for murder mystery like those in Detective Conan, you should watch Detective Conan instead.  The short stories are nothing like DC.  They are light hearted, sometimes out of this world, and project a very creative and imaginary scenario to the viewers.  Some of the 'concept' from the stories work its way into the DC world.Throughout the stories, you might notice some cameo appearance by the cast of Detective Conan.  It was fun spotting Agasa or Mori or even Ran.  As the anime is done in the last century, the artwork is what you would expect from that era.  Art style are very similar to Detective Conan, with its distinctive Aoyama look and feel.  Some of the voice actors from Detective Conan can be clearly identified in these stories.  If you have watched Detective Conan for any considerable of time, you can easily tell the voice actors in these stories.As a whole, the short stories are a break from Detective Conan.  If you are open to small people, time travel and the likes, have a go at this.  It is not a top quality show, but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless.

Some are Awesome, and some are just your average anime tale (but with his characteristic style).My most favorite one was 'Play it again'. First because of the characters, and second because I'm an old soul myself, therefore, I miss the old days when samurai and knight values mattered, and no one thought those values were 'outdated', or 'toxic' or boring. That one story was worth the watch of the whole...bunch.The other ones vary from a 9 to a 6. But they are short, so you won't loose much by giving them a try. bunch.The other ones vary from a 9 to a 6. But they are short, so you won't loose much by giving them a try."", ""I really loved this. It's a bag of mostly great things! If you're a Detective Conan and Yaiba/Gosho Aoyama fan, you should definitely watch this (but recommended to watch at 150 or more episodes). When I watched this, I also happened to realize that Gosho Aoyama seems to love writing romcom-like stories, and that many elements of Detective Conan were shaped from these stories.My personal favorite was the first one in the collection; Wait For Me. It was one of the most beautiful and moving stories surrounding time travel that I have ever seen. Seriously, Gosho Aoyama is a god of romcom elements.The Making of...Detective Conan is also surprisingly good, and my second favorite; The Detective Boys (minus Haibara) are in the real world, where they enter the TMS Entertainment studio, believing that there are businessman attempting to kill Conan. However, the truth is, they're producing an episode of Detective Conan, and we get an entertaining, yet educational and short look at the main process. Unlike the episodes airing at the time that were animated in cels, the short seems to have been animated digitally.The Wandering Red Butterfly and Ten Planets in the Night Sky are prequels to the Detective Conan anime; It stars Edogawa Conan/Shinichi Kudo's parents, Yusaku and Yukiko. The first one takes place before Conan was born and before the two got married, and the second one is during their marriage and Shinichi is a toddler. We are shown that Shinichi was closer to his mother and even takes off from her.Detective George was my least favorite. It felt relatively slow, and was overall just alright, but seems to be an earlier prototype of Detective Conan.Santa Claus in Summer was another really great romcom, and I really loved the characters in the story. Without spoiling anything, the boy is the only one who can save the world, so to figure out how he is granted any wish, one of which is meeting his favorite idol.Definitely take the time to give these a watch, especially between Detective Conan episodes. It's really worth it.

They will definitely convince you that he is a seriously weird dude who would be writing seriously weird things if Detective Conan wasn\'t so popular and profitable. And, so, if you\'ve been watching Detective Conan and want a break, this is a fine option. It\'s fun, first and foremost. Any Conan fan can check these out. They\'re not just for completionists.The best thing about it for me was the character designs and general art style were still running on the 90s cel-animated Detective Conan aesthetic. I love the way Detective...Conan looks at the very beginning, and this is a slight bump in quality above that, to make it suitable for a direct-to-VHS OVA special.Most of the stories are fine-to-good. The first half are definitely the strongest, with the best gimmicks. I was hooked through the time machine one and the Christmas one had an interesting flavor. The interstitials about the Kudo parents from Detective Conan were fun, too. Who could say ""no"" to a Baby Conan story? The second half were not so good, especially as they leaned harder into not-quite ecchi territory that Aoyama is apparently not equipped to tread in. The kendo one was a snoozer that I watched at 2x speed. None of them are bad wastes of time, but some are stronger than others.

Bakemonogatari Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6948/Bakemonogatari_Recap,"['""Not all things are what they appear to be""Note: The following review will talk about not only the recap special, but also the episodes it covers.Bakemonogatari - recap special, shows the past events that circle around episodes 1 -5.The tale revolves around Koyomi Araragi, who has just recently survived a vampire attack, and under certain circumstances gets involved with many things regarding the supernatural (ghosts, spirits and the like). A mysterious girl falls from the sky one day, and his life is never the same afterward. Now if you have never watched the series up until this point then you‚Äôre probably thinking there isn‚Äôt a...whole lot of reason to check this version out, as it only recaps the first five episodes. However, I feel that it could in fact serve a good purpose to both fans of the series, and those who may still be debating on picking it up or not. These recap episodes don‚Äôt really contain too much in the way of spoilers, at least not any that are very relevant to the overall plot as of yet. People who have never seen it might be thinking to themselves that a story revolving around ghosts, vampires and other supernatural things, has been run into the ground too much to be of interest. However, every couple of years a company finds a way of doing it differently. And I am happy to say that ""Bakemonogatari"" is one of these anime titles. Being that the story does revolve around the supernatural, you might think things up to this point were all about action. But no, you would be wrong. The episodes are VERY dialog heavy, and wouldn‚Äôt be something you would want to watch without subs (unless you understand Japanese that is). In many of the episodes it all comes down to character discussions. They range from relationship talk, to spirits and creatures, to even talking about one‚Äôs personal situation and grief. Most of the inner turmoil and problems that the cast have, have some kind of relation to spiritual creatures, who represent said character\'s problem. When a form is actually located, it comes down more to a mentality at stopping it, and not with actual brute force. The script writing in this series is very well done, but that isn‚Äôt exactly what makes ""Bakemonogatari"" so special--as it‚Äôs not what the story is about, so much as how they present it. Both the plot and dialog are very artistic, even when it comes down to the characters simply talking about things that don‚Äôt really have a solid purpose to the storyline. If you have ever seen the ""ef"" series, then you will feel right at home with this title. Which is fitting, since both are made by the same producers (SHAFT). Even so, it does have it‚Äôs faults too, some of the conversations between the characters can feel bloated at times, without a solid purpose in mind. And because of it‚Äôs somewhat trippy style in telling a tale, some might also find it to be a bit too drawn out and weird at times. Still, if you are looking for a story that adds a unique twist on how it tells it, then you will enjoy these episodes.The art in this is really something special, the main focus of the animation is not with the overall picture, as it is so much with the characters themselves. Many times the backgrounds will be quite plain, and many times they won‚Äôt stand out much at all. As mentioned before this is a very ""artsy"" anime, and it tends to not stay on one animation scene for very long. This might annoy some viewers, as it does tend to change its scenery a lot. Many of the scene changes will only show a colored screen with a word or symbol on it, or will have a still image representing what the characters are talking about, or events taking place. It\'s a ""mind over matter"" art style.Soundtrack to this title is really good, it‚Äôs the same music that derives from the series. Most of them come in the form of creepy style bleeps and bloops, and really do great at setting the tone for the atmosphere. The opening and closing themes are more on the brighter side than the actual background music. The music in this series does good at complimenting the mood that the company wanted you to feel. Even so though, I wouldn‚Äôt really consider it to be a memorable soundtrack, and once you‚Äôre done with this recap (and the series), you‚Äôll most likely forget about it. The voice acting is top notch, and all characters match well with their voice actors.I would say that the characters are pretty deep in their personalities, you really are able to get into their head as the episodes progress. Many of them are not who you think they would be right off the bat. With the exception of Mayoi, most of the main characters talk very seriously in their tone, even when a joke is being played out. Some might find them a bit too calm (or even sleepy) at times, but once again, it fits with the eerie style of the show.Even for a recap special, I really enjoyed this. It marked all the key points to the story so far, and will keep you entertained. If you are thinking about picking up the series still, this special is a nice taste of how the anime works, without spoiling too much for the viewer. And if you have already seen the episodes up to this point, it‚Äôs still a nice refresher course, and could point out something you may have missed before. whole lot of reason to check this version out, as it only recaps the first five episodes.

Bubblegum Crisis,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1347/Bubblegum_Crisis,"[""Given that this is Bubblegum Crisis\\' 20th anniversary year, I\\'m going to start with some historic background.  In 1987, amid the boomtimes in the west, the rise of Japanese industrial and corporate power appeared to be potentially endless and the west seemed unable to match it.  Japan, and much of the first world was getting rich quick and advancing technologically in leaps and bounds; but at the same time, other countries were still stuck in a past age, unable to keep up.  For the first time socioeconomic concepts like the multinational corporation and the global market became realities, and the division between...the first and third world had never seemed wider.  While some revelled in the abundance, others feared it.Science fiction, ever the barometer of public fear, reflected this in books and film.  Alien, in 1979, brought the world a vision of space travel in the future that for once was filthy and corrupt and run by giant corporations with no morals.   The seminal Blade Runner stunned 1982 with the visually amazing concept of a huge, grimy neon tech-sprawl future LA of totally mixed ethnicity and robots that behave more like humans than humans do.  And William Gibson&rsquo;s famed 1984 novel Neuromancer gave the world a fevered, lavish nightmare of clashing technology and humanity embroiled in a tale of global tech businesses up to no good, in the process giving this burgeoning genre a name: cyberpunk.Where one media succeeds, others will follow.  Cyberpunk anime was as inevitable then as live action western versions of anime have become now. Bubblegum Crisis was the leading edge of that cyberpunk anime, taking the elements that worked for the rest and expertly marrying it with many of the elements that make anime unique.  Today, Bubblegum Crisis is one of those \\'classic\\' titles that anime fans need to know about, a Terminator or Star Wars of the anime canon.  Even though its popularity in Japan was only a fraction of the reception it enjoyed overseas, it&rsquo;s my contention that without Bubblegum Crisis there&rsquo;d have been no Akira film.But is it any good?  On one hand, detractors can say that this is a messy blending of many things that have already been done; a Blade Runner city with a flavour of Neuromancer-come-Alien-come-Aliens dystopian griminess and high-tech evil and full of Terminators and Robocops, filtered through that anime staple, mecha.  This is largely true, but doesn&rsquo;t matter.  Outside anime, nothing so ambitious could ever work; but within the totally created universe that&rsquo;s only possible in animation or CGI, and only really practical in animation, it not only works but excels.Originally planned as a series of 13 OVA episodes, it eventually ran to only 8 episodes, and some key plot points were altered because of this.  Another 3 episodes were released later in an OVA series called Bubblegum Crash, using elements of the 5 unmade episodes that never made it originally.  Each is largely self contained, but both multi-episode arcs of storyline and a loose overall plotline are also present.  Being an OVA, the time period and hence staff is not as fixed as can be seen with a TV series, the net effect of which being that pretty much every episode is different from each of the others, with different emphases and different priorities.  On top of this, half way through, some key decisions were reversed about the planned death in episode 5 of a character who, in hindsight, clearly stands out as the main protagonist.  Plus, the eventual premature demise of the series stemmed from the two owners of the franchise, Artmic and Youmex, taking each other to court.  DVD releases nowadays seem so snarled in legalities that the horrendous dubtitling is almost forgivable.  So, it&rsquo;s a total mess, basically.But like I say, this doesn&rsquo;t really matter.   What Bubblegum Crisis does so well, well enough that it relegates these things to positions of secondary importance, is cool.  BGC may not have a very sure idea of what it wants to be and do, in a general sense, but it does it with irrepressable style; everything about BGC is very cool.  Kenichi Sonoda, who went on to be the man behind Gunsmith Cats, designed the characters impeccably, including their incredible sleek hardsuit armour, which look like what Lamborghinis and Ferraris would look like if they were shaped like women.  Various other mechanical designs, by Aramaki Shinji, later to be mechanical designer for Evangelion and director of Appleseed 2004, largely borrows from much of early \\'80s sci-fi, and frankly looks fantastic.  There&rsquo;s a very brash, colourful, in-your-face &lsquo;80s vibe also driving the general design ethos, which might sound ghastly but is in fact perfect for crumbling, self-digesting neon dystopias.  Much of the visuals are, as mentioned, lifted from Blade Runner and run through a series of anime design quirks.  Animation is by no means stunning generally, but gets the job done, and when you factor in the fact that this is from 1987, it really has some very nice touches.No review of Bubblegum Crisis is remotely complete without mention of the music.  BGC is famous for its music almost as much as it is famous for popularising women kicking arse.  Synth-rock songs that are as artificial and processed as the nutrasweet in diet coke, tunes painstakingly designed to be catchy and memorable, are the order of the day; it is hard to express how much raw fun it is.  It\\'s also archetypally \\'80s, overblown and brash  - and outside of BGC, I generally hate \\'80s stuff.  The songs especially manage to encapsulate that B-movie feeling; like the irrelevant pop songs at the end of a film that was cheesy but still really entertaining, they are driving, infectious ballads with amazing powers of mood-lightening.  Many have noted the similarity between the opening of the first episode and the start of the 1984 film Streets of Fire; but the integration of the music into the story in BGC is much smoother.  And, while I love the music, it\\'s immediately obvious it\\'s the kind of thing that\\'s likely to provoke strong responses that won\\'t be positive for everyone - a gamble any series that relies so heavily on music must make.  Even if you\\'re not keen on the sound, though, there\\'s no mistaking the skill, high production values and copious amounts of effort behind it.By having the rock singer character as one of its toughest protagonists is a move that trumps Streets of Fire\\'s equivalent role in every way.  BGC\\'s other characters are far from original by modern standards, but it\\'s worth remembering that they set many of those standards themselves.  These are archetypes, not stereotypes; those that set the trend, not those who follow them.  No-one looks down on Dirty Harry, just because he spawned a thousand maveric cop characters.It can\\'t be denied that there are some fairly major things wrong with BGC.  For one, it\\'s almost totally episodic, with no real overarching plot and little other than the strong, well rounded characters to link one episode to another.  For another, the characters may be strong and extremely charismatic, but they don\\'t really change much or develop like they should.  For a third, it suffers from the lack of an ending; the last story just stops like any other, and you reach for the last disc...and it\\'s just music videos (also real fun).  These problems are at least addressed in the 1999 remake, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, but at the expense of design, music and general coolness.  What the remake did not fix, however, is the basic implausibility of the whole thing.  Bloodsucking robots, transforming motorbikes and mecha-tentacle beasts strain one\\'s suspension of disbelief unpleasantly at times.Nonetheless, Bubblegum Crisis, or, to give it its full title, \\'Bubblegum Crisis MegaTokyo 2032: the story of Knight Sabers\\' (yes, BGC was in fact the origin of the now-common phrase MegaTokyo - another example of its wide influence), remains immensely enjoyable popcorn anime, and remains fascinating for anyone interested in the history of anime.  After 20 years, that\\'s pretty damn impressive. the first and third world had never seemed wider.  While some revelled in the abundance, others feared it.Science fiction, ever the barometer of public fear, reflected this in books and film.  Alien, in 1979, brought the world a vision of space travel in the future that for once was filthy and corrupt and run by giant corporations with no morals.

The direction and editing, and hell even the music are all excellent and ensure the OVA gets off to a cracking start.  80\'s cyberpunk at its best!The story follows four plucky young women with nothing better to do in their spare time than to don cyber-outfits and blow crap up, preferably those pesky rogue boomers who keep appearing all over the city.  The combined IQ of these four women finally figures out that Genom corporation, which apparently ""accounts for 68% of the world\'s cars"", might have something to do with these incidents and so Bubblegum Crisis delivers 8 episodes of pure unadulterated fun in a way only 80\'s anime can.Mega-Tokyo, 2032.  This is the future, but seen from the eyes of the 80\'s.  Each decade\'s vision of the future is idiosyncratic, and so each decade produces strange and brilliant works of genius or garbage, with Bubblegum Crisis firmly in the strange and brilliant camp, albeit lacking both genius and garbage, though still retaining quality production and vision.  Plenty of great directorial choices, POV shots, pans, zooms, it\'s all dynamic and makes up for the dated, yet still decent, animation.No matter the humour or clunky dialogue or 80\'s sprinkled aesthetics in hair styles and clothing, this is cyberpunk at its peak.  Everything associated with the genre is present, the connective nature of society, the paranoia of having satellites hovering above your head with the capability of blowing you up, biotech suits, corporate power run amok.  In a sense Bubblegum Crisis is more cyberpunk than a lot of cyberpunk anime out there which sometimes jettison a lot of the genre\'s traits and settle for dystopic hijinks with the occasional robot AI thrown in.  Bubblegum Crisis revels in the genre and doesn‚Äôt leave anything out.The anime came out at what might be seen as cyberpunk\'s peak of influence and exposure in the mainstream, and as such is worth a watch for its historical significance, in terms of impacting the genre of cyberpunk in anime and also being a window to the time.  It\'s so classy it even has time to throw a shout out to The Third Man!It\'s flawed, but packed with so much creative ideas and flair, you can\'t help but bop along to the 80\'s tunes.  Each episode starts with a cinematic musical montage of 80\'s soft rock/pop and narrative-advancing imagery. This isn\'t on-par with cyberpunk like GitS, you have to accept the humour and gaping plot-holes as part of the charm, or you\'ll just not be involved and will tune out.  The AD Police are written as what a 12 year old imagines the NYPD are like, complete with the gruff black police captain arguing with the rookie cop.There\'s lots of subtle visual flair in this OVA, the directors knew what they were doing. (Except for episode 5 and 6.  That director probably went to the school of Koichi Mashimo, though he wasn\'t helped by the screenwriter for those episodes either)  Too often in post-millennium anime there are tons of \'arty\' shots that are meaningless and the camera either flies around the place like a steadicam-operator on crack, or pans laboriously across the screen as if directed by an old age pensioner, but back in the 80\'s/90\'s they knew how to pace episodes just fine while choosing narrative-coherent viewpoints to the action.  I guess I\'m harping on about that old clich√© of modern day anime being too shallow with emphasis on looks rather than content, but considering that this anime is packed with very clich√©d jokes that were old even back when this was released, the argument is kind of moot.If you want to go extra deep you could propose that Bubblegum Crisis is yet another exploration of the relationship between man and machine and clearly veers on the side of external mechanics and views bio-implementation, or to be simple about it: cyborgs, as a threat to the world.  Even though boomers are technically robots, though the distinction is rarely made clear especially when they all have such charming personalities, their humanoid form isn\'t a random creative decision.  Boomers, anyone associated to them, and augmentation in general are clearly bad for your health and the only way to make the world a better place is to jump into exoskeleton mecha-suits and be a master of cybernetics, not a slave to them.  It\'s possibly an archaic almost Luddite philosophy, especially in the 21st century where bio and nano-technology is getting more and more traction.  Yep, I just analysed an anime with \'bubblegum\' in the title.But you get the gist, Bubblegum Crisis is consistently entertaining and has very good direction to boot, and its shortcomings can be seen as part of the package; a conscious decision and not a by-product.  You\'re meant to laugh at the ridiculousness of the entire premise, especially the glorious last episode\'s tribute to the character of Nene, and you\'re meant to lap up the universe presented because you\'re a cyberpunk fan.

I think in some ways a review that the reader can relate to can sometimes improve their watching/re-watching of a series.So onto the matter at hand Bubble...Crisis 2032, an OVA series which 3 top notch studios (AIC, Artmic and Youmex) gave their all towards in the 80s and in my opinion really raised the bar when it came to what you could achieve in animation and also among all of these talented people was none other than legendary designer Kenichi Sonoda. Unfortunately the downside of having so many good chefs, is the inevitable arguments over who owns what, which in the end was the downfall of BGC.First lets talk about story, BGC gets a lot of flak over its story, many arguing that it is poor or lacks any real overbearing plot. Now i have a problem with this, yes you could say that if you're comparing it to syndicated series which run with week by week episodes and are produced much quicker, but BGC was not produced in that manner and was never intended to be, its release of 8 episodes was staggered over 4 years due to the amount of work it required to do it to the level of technical quality wanted. At the time most of us never were able to see all episodes back to back like people now get to do, the producers knew this and focused on trying to convey EMOTIONS in each episode. The dying of a loved one, loyalty and vengeance for a friend, saying goodbye for a last time, fighting a losing battle, all of these concepts were tried to be portrayed using a situation and an fitting background song, right up to the end credits music and background image the directors were trying to convey a feeling with their story above all else. And i think that was a good approach, since the episodes had more impact on me and i was not simply waiting to see the next episode like i do with anime nowdays, i was instead thinking about the episode i just watched, which was a very good thing since the next episode was likely weeks if not months away. A lot of money was put into this series, and it was risky even for the time but im grateful they decided to do it this way as it leaves a lasting impression on most that watch it, sometimes subconsciously.The characters themselves were a revelation, they were a new breed of tough woman leading the fight in mechanized combat suits. That was barely common to have only woman as leads in the action genre.Though with only 8 out of the 13 episodes completed they did what they could with depth, but its what the characters represented that was most special.They covered a broad spectrum of female heroines, Priss a tough, bike riding, battle hardened fighter who happens to be a singer, Linna the represented average aerobics girl of the 80s but with the ability to be able to tranform that athletism into fighting prowess, Sylia a smart weathly elite who isnt a afraid to drop the high class lady act and dirty her hands when she needs to, and lastly Nene a computer and electronics specialist willing to put herself in the battle zone.What made them even more special though was they all had their weaknesses, and the designers wanted us to know they were not perfect individuals and this added something to the characters that was largely absent in other action movies of the time.Priss is poor and has had a rough life, its also implied that she never was well educated but she does what she can to get by and enjoy her life and improve the life of people she knows...or at least exact justice on their behalf.Sylia is seen as the cool headed leader, but secretly she has an immense hatred for Genom Corp inside her which is strong enough to impair her judgement and cause her to lash out at others.Linna although generally up beat is not living the life she wants, she would love a glamourous life and a great boyfriend but she is stuck in the mediocrity of being a below middle class person in Megatokyo, a cycle she cannot break out of. Then theres Nene, she desperately wants to be more physically imposing and it frustrates her that she isnt given much respect, she doesnt just want to be known as a computer geek at a police department and really would like people to know what shes really capable of.Art and character design, I think the series gets its deserved ratings here. Personally i think its a masterpiece of its era, using methods an approaches that will never been done again since they would be unfeasible today. Its a testament to what human artists are capable with just simple tools and hundreds of hours of painstaking work that they simply poured to their hearts into. If you're an artist or have ever worked with professional artists you will understand it and appreciate it for the true paramount achievement that it was. If you're not an artist, just look at it like this, BGCs artwork is very much like a Ferrari F40, its not the best car ever made, but its a representation of what was achievable by the experts of that era, and for that it will never be replicated again because the technology changed, people have changed and the mindsets have changed. For that reason its look will always be unique and special.The sound, for me the music production was the best id ever come across, in both English and Japanese the production quality was supreme, the musical ability of the producers and the vocal ability of the singers is as good as it got for any form of entertainment in the 80s, and that's saying a lot considering how great an era for music and movies the 80s is considered as being.Lets talk about the english version music first, since for me its unbelievable to say there are some tracks that are actually better in English (Rock me & Don't Forget). Now if any of you are familiar with older anime, you'll know that how botched english versions can be, but with BGC they really gave excellent attention to it so it could stand alone as an equal in quality.Though the Japanese version is better overall as expected, Ohmori Kinuko really giving a vocal performance that's as good as it gets.Voice acting though is just average for both English and Japanese versions. Nowadays we have near Hollywood quality (or Japanese film industry quality) voice acting in games and anime. So BGCs voice acting is a couple notches below, it just lacks the substance that you get with newer productions that really drive home the characters intentions. The relative background silence you get during speaking is typical of the sound production of the time, that is one area I am glad is gone these days.In terms of enjoyment, if you're a person of the era there is no way you would say this is anything less than a 9 (i say 10), because you simply hadnt seen anything like this at the time, especially if you were outside of Japan. Taking nostalgia out of it and looking at it just as an Anime fan...a knowledgeable anime fan would certainly understand what was achieved here and in that case its an 8 or even 9 still. (If you got this far i want to thank you for reading this rather long review)Overall, its a 9/10 for me and if you grew up in the 80s and are an anime watcher you absolutely must watch Bubblegum Crisis. Crisis 2032, an OVA series which 3 top notch studios (AIC, Artmic and Youmex) gave their all towards in the 80s and in my opinion really raised the bar when it came to what you could achieve in animation and also among all of these talented people was none other than legendary designer Kenichi Sonoda.

That was barely common to have only woman as leads in the action genre.Though with only 8 out of the 13 episodes completed they did what they could with depth, but its what the characters represented that was most special.They covered a broad spectrum of female heroines, Priss a tough, bike riding, battle hardened fighter who happens to be a singer, Linna the represented average aerobics girl of the 80s but with the ability to be able to tranform that athletism into fighting prowess, Sylia a smart weathly elite who isnt a afraid to drop the high class lady act and dirty her hands when she needs to, and lastly Nene a computer and electronics specialist willing to put herself in the battle zone.What made them even more special though was they all had their weaknesses, and the designers wanted us to know they were not perfect individuals and this added something to the characters that was largely absent in other action movies of the time.Priss is poor and has had a rough life, its also implied that she never was well educated but she does what she can to get by and enjoy her life and improve the life of people she knows...or at least exact justice on their behalf.Sylia is seen as the cool headed leader, but secretly she has an immense hatred for Genom Corp inside her which is strong enough to impair her judgement and cause her to lash out at others.Linna although generally up beat is not living the life she wants, she would love a glamourous life and a great boyfriend but she is stuck in the mediocrity of being a below middle class person in Megatokyo, a cycle she cannot break out of. Then theres Nene, she desperately wants to be more physically imposing and it frustrates her that she isnt given much respect, she doesnt just want to be known as a computer geek at a police department and really would like people to know what shes really capable of.Art and character design, I think the series gets its deserved ratings here. Personally i think its a masterpiece of its era, using methods an approaches that will never been done again since they would be unfeasible today. Its a testament to what human artists are capable with just simple tools and hundreds of hours of painstaking work that they simply poured to their hearts into. If you're an artist or have ever worked with professional artists you will understand it and appreciate it for the true paramount achievement that it was. If you're not an artist, just look at it like this, BGCs artwork is very much like a Ferrari F40, its not the best car ever made, but its a representation of what was achievable by the experts of that era, and for that it will never be replicated again because the technology changed, people have changed and the mindsets have changed. For that reason its look will always be unique and special.The sound, for me the music production was the best id ever come across, in both English and Japanese the production quality was supreme, the musical ability of the producers and the vocal ability of the singers is as good as it got for any form of entertainment in the 80s, and that's saying a lot considering how great an era for music and movies the 80s is considered as being.Lets talk about the english version music first, since for me its unbelievable to say there are some tracks that are actually better in English (Rock me & Don't Forget). Now if any of you are familiar with older anime, you'll know that how botched english versions can be, but with BGC they really gave excellent attention to it so it could stand alone as an equal in quality.Though the Japanese version is better overall as expected, Ohmori Kinuko really giving a vocal performance that's as good as it gets.Voice acting though is just average for both English and Japanese versions. Nowadays we have near Hollywood quality (or Japanese film industry quality) voice acting in games and anime. So BGCs voice acting is a couple notches below, it just lacks the substance that you get with newer productions that really drive home the characters intentions. The relative background silence you get during speaking is typical of the sound production of the time, that is one area I am glad is gone these days.In terms of enjoyment, if you're a person of the era there is no way you would say this is anything less than a 9 (i say 10), because you simply hadnt seen anything like this at the time, especially if you were outside of Japan. Taking nostalgia out of it and looking at it just as an Anime fan...a knowledgeable anime fan would certainly understand what was achieved here and in that case its an 8 or even 9 still. (If you got this far i want to thank you for reading this rather long review)Overall, its a 9/10 for me and if you grew up in the 80s and are an anime watcher you absolutely must watch Bubblegum Crisis."", 'Okay, so Bubblegum Crisis isn‚Äôt the greatest anime of all time. It‚Äôs not even the greatest cyberpunk anime of all time. It‚Äôs not even the greatest cyberpunk anime of the eighties, because critical opinion placed that crown firmly on Akira‚Äôs head long, long ago. And yet Bubblegum Crisis, not Akira, or Ghost in the Shell, or even Evangelion, is far and away my *favorite* anime out there - nothing else even comes close. Admittedly, I‚Äôm something of an obsessive person. I‚Äôve been latching onto sea-tossed fandoms like a memetic lamprey for years. But why BGC?Because it‚Äôs fucking awesome, that‚Äôs why. Because it‚Äôs a synthesis of...things that I like in this point in time. Because its open-endedness, its willingness to focus on action and put all the existential stuff in the backseat, the sense of what BGC could have been rather than what it is, make it more than the sum of its parts.But that‚Äôs a fairly vague reason. Let‚Äôs ignore the sum and focus on the parts first.Story: There‚Äôs admittedly not a lot of story or super-deep psychoanalytic shit going on in BGC. There are Boomers, which are like Terminators with big meaty muscles. There is a megacorporation that produces them. There are some cute anime girls who don cuter power-armor to wreck their shit. There are some Miami-Vice-meets-Robocop police dudes who dick around and get their shit kicked in by the Boomers.Of course, the synthesis of these disparate elements could have all gone together in a very bad way (Lookin‚Äô at you BGC 2040). But each episode - there are only eight, and three of them are barely TV-episode length - generally does its best to not require deep viewing and following the plot to enjoy the spectacle. There is a metaplot running between episodes, but it‚Äôs diluted by the fact that the creators clearly had no idea what they were doing at first, and the fact that the director‚Äôs seat kept changing after the original trilogy of videos. You have to dig into wacky fan speculation to get mileage out of the plot, and that‚Äôs fun don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it‚Äôs not as engaging overall as, say, Stand Alone Complex, which in my mind sets a high bar for thrilling conspiracies and weird cyberpunk shit mixed together. But plot is only one half of a compelling narrative, which brings us to the...Characters: Some may say that the original four Knight Sabers are all to some degree stereotypes. I think there was another review awhile back that argued that they were more archetypes, more forerunners for the character molds that have become so essential to anime nowadays. (Supposedly a proposal for a BGC ‚ÄòHot Springs‚Äô episode mutated into Tenchi Muyo, the godfather of harem anime. Wacky, eh?). And indeed each main character has their own thing going on - a distinctive voice, distinctive character design, distinctive behavior. They play roles, yes, but those roles are always interesting and compelling and aren‚Äôt as shallow as they seem to be at first glance.In particular I love the character of Sylia Stingray, the cool-beauty ‚Äòbig sister‚Äô of the Sabers. Her voice is Yoshiko Sakakibara at her best, somehow warm and loving yet stone-cold cool at the same time, not the brutal villainess of Haman Karn nor the resignation of Shinobu Nagumo. No, Sylia Stingray is sort of what happens when you cross James Bond, a Bond Girl, and a Bond Villain all in one package. She‚Äôs beautiful, capable, knows what‚Äôs going on for the most part, is implied to be some sort of cyborg, and isn‚Äôt afraid to stab her enemies in the throat. Also she runs a lingerie shop as her secret identity. There‚Äôre very few other characters like her in anime and that‚Äôs a pity. Also Priss is fun to watch smash her way through obstacles and occasionally get her shit kicked in. All told BGC‚Äôs characters may not be vividly realized portraits of pain or emotional melodrama, but they have depth to them. It‚Äôs like how a few choice strokes can be a landscape in the human mind as much as a photorealistic painting can be. The characters of BGC work because they are a few strokes placed very well.Art: 80‚Äôs cel-shaded awesomeness - explosions and lighting and lasers and color mixed in with urban grunge, the kind of stuff it takes a real budget to show off. Mecha range from simple yet elegant (hardsuits) to hideously baroque (the Hyperboomers from Episode 6) but for the most part they all feel like they‚Äôre inhabiting the same high-tech high-octane universe. Sure, Megatokyo goes from being a gritty Streets of Fire-y hellhole to a brighter, cleaner urban sprawl over the series. Sure, the art style changes to reflect which director is in the seat this time around. But, again, each episode mostly stands on its own as a collection of awesome set pieces, plot be dammed. They don‚Äôt make em‚Äô like this anymore.Sound: Okay, so the sound effects aren‚Äôt necessarily memorable. But BGC indulges itself in the style of 80‚Äôs MTV music videos, especially in the iconic opening sequence of the first episode. Hardcore 80‚Äôs J-Rock, some of it using the vocals of the Sabers themselves, pops and crackles through the beginning and end credits of every episode, each time a selection of unique songs. You can tell that part of the revenue from the OVA was trying to get people to buy the soundtrack on tape. Hell, the voice of Priss ended up being a real singer instead of a voice Actress. You haven‚Äôt lived until you‚Äôve listened to her belt out ‚ÄòKonya Wa Hurricane‚Äô intercut with a Combat Boomer wrecking the shit out of a whole bunch of cops. If nothing else, watch that sequence, you‚Äôll be surprised how much it makes you want to watch the rest.Enjoyment: This is an awfully vague category, so I‚Äôll use it to talk about the BGC fandom - or what‚Äôs left of it. See, BGC was a big deal in the 90‚Äôs, especially during the hot times of the VHS boom. Even after Sailor Moon took the West by storm, even after Evangelion upended weeb‚Äôs conceptions of what anime was capable of, people still wrote a good deal of BGC fanfiction and posted it on their Geocities or Usenet forums. Much of it is bad, yes, but there‚Äôs so little of it compared to the vast seas of shit that dominate fanfiction today, that the good stuff floats to the top easily. And that good stuff is usually consistently good, because it was written by adults who got weirdly into the series‚Äô metaplot and tried to wrap up its unexplored threads to varying degrees of effectiveness. Really, though, the reason BGC is so good for fandom is because it builds its world and its plot in those same broad strokes. It‚Äôs up to readers and writers to interpret, elaborate, accentuate what‚Äôs there to make more comprehensive stories, ones that aren‚Äôt just mashing two characters together to make them kiss.(By comparison, say, Ghost in the Shell is a more complete work, yes, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same spark of manic vitality that lends itself to writing fanfic (at least I think so). No wacky mecha, no melodrama, no flawed characters, just Tom Clancyesque cyberespionage and tactical combat.)What else is there to say? Bubblegum Crisis is a product of its time, yes, that‚Äôs why the Vaporwave gif makers of the internet have latched onto it without appreciating it, but it still holds up remarkably well today. It has the stuff hobbyist fandom used to look for in anime, and seems to have forgotten today, as our collective taste is drowned in a sea of VTubers and gacha games. It‚Äô s lightning in a bottle, a cool concept backed up by cooler design work to make a series that, like many of the action movies of the eighties, has a sort of iconic feel to it, something that, once you put in Konya Wa Hurricane, cannot be denied. things that I like in this point in time.

Which is mainly...to fight the androids that went berserk and the other kind of special cases just like Rick Deckard did in it\'s Blade Runner Universe.We have four main girls here; Stylia, the calm intelligent and founder of the group, Priss, which is also a popular singer in bars and it\'s the ""action"" girl of the group, Nene, the infiltrated girl in the police but pretty coward and annoying in the action field and Linna, the average girl.We also have Leon McNichol, the AD Police detective which is interested in Priss the singer and he turns out to be a pretty dependable and interesting character (thus leading into his own OVA series).The overall mood of the series runs smoothly ranging from comedy to dramatic and cyber punk obscure scenes and the story flows without much relation from one episode to the other making the series quite episodic, there are indeed some episodes that are stronger than others, but in the end they tend to be a ""Case of the Day"" alone episode type of stores with just small links between them.We have either good characters like Priss Leion and Styllia and annoying characters like good for nothing Nene, though she redeems herself in the last episode which was also a nice way of putting things.Oh yeah, the opening scene of the first OVA is simply great, with Priss singing her popish 80\'s cheesy songs and showing some police scenes in between. Classic. Hearing that music these days sounds pretty nostalgic.It is definitive a classic anime sci-fi of the 80\'s and a must watch nevertheless. The classic Blade Runner atmosphere just can\'t be ignored.

From the opening scene, it features strong women who don't take any nonsense from anyone, has a sizzling score to keep my heart racing, and I immediately recognized the unique graphic style of ArtMIC from the Captain Power video/game that I used to play at my grandparents' house. I know that aesthetic isn't for everyone, but it's like a drug to me. The flashiness doesn't seem to distract from the action like so many special effects suffer from these days, but skillfully...directs attention to where the action is.

Watching it 30 years after its debut almost feels surreal, because it is SO pop culture laden, so aesthetically referential to other works of its time, it almost feels like something made in TRIBUTE of the 80s, like the video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, but nope,  Crisis is true blue authentic, and it is AWESOME.Bubblegum Crisis EMBODIES ""cool"" as its primary driving force. A cyberpunk future where illegal robots called Boomers are made to stir shit up for shady megacorporation reasons that are never really explained because dammit, that isn\'t...what you\'re here for. Crisis has eight episodes and while there is some light continuity between them, it knows you aren\'t here for deep introspective plot full of sympathy motivations for villains - it knows you\'re here to see four kick ass girls in power armor duke it out with cyberpunk androids all set to some fantastically good original music set in the style of synth rock and pop of the time. There\'s evil AI cars that go on the fritz, sexbots from the moon, a couple of buddy cops who can\'t get a break trying to clean up the streets of their city, and... aerobics montages. Yeah, its very 80s, as I said before.While the story is not the focus, it isn\'t terrible all things considered. A few episodes have some continuity between them and the individual plots of each episode all have an interesting hook to them as well. They aren\'t groundbreaking, but they get you interested and aren\'t BAD either. Character is where the series shines stronger as a narrative: all four of the Knight Sabers are fun, distinct individuals who all bounce off each other very well both in armor and out of it. Priss is a hot headed go getter who moonlights as a rock singer, Sylia is the aloof and cool headed leader who operates a successful business to fund the Knight Sabers, Linna is social butterfly who works as an aerobics instructor and is constantly looking for a new boyfriend, and Nene is the bubbly, brilliant minded hacker who also works on the inside as a police officer. Aside from the Sabers, the other major recurring characters are the police officers Leon and Daley, who always try to stop boomer crimes within the law with limited success. They\'re a traditional buddy cop duo, with Leon as the go-getter cowboy cop and Daley as his more relaxed, humorous counterpart. Every episode\'s own original characters are also strong presenters, making up for their lack of depth and screen time with excellent presence.Last but certainly not least to mention is the aesthetics. Crisis is all about style, and ESPECIALLY the music: every episode has an entire original soundtrack, including an original opening AND ending theme, complete with original animated footage. Every episode feels distinct from one another with its own sounds and songs, and the series is worth watching easily for just the music. For visuals, you have some of the best looking mech designs of the decade, be it the sleek armor of the Sabers, or the bulky police armor, the stylishly cool police vehicles, the strange and bestial looking Boomers, or just the overall lo-fi used future boxy clunky neon designs that defined the 80s being beautifully rendered in some of the best hand drawn anime art I\'ve seen. Crisis is a treat for the eyes and the ears.The only real negative to say about the series is its infamous non-ending. Originally scheduled for 13 episodes, we only got 8, and that last one was ironically the mid-series suit upgrade for the girls so they can face even tougher opponents. If you really want a conclusion, there is Bubblegum Crash which condensed the remaining 5 episodes story material into 3 more episodes, which does give some closure but is overall a weaker product than Crisis, lacking the high quality art and sheer amount of original music that Crisis boasted, plus some plot holes. Still, with or without an ending, Crisis stands out as a testament to 1980s anime, a shining champion of style. If you\'re into the retro anime scene, you owe yourself to watch this. Even if you aren\'t, Crisis is just that good enough it deserves watching anyway. This is one of the milestone series that will remain important throughout history. what you\'re here for.

Even if you aren\'t, Crisis is just that good enough it deserves watching anyway. This is one of the milestone series that will remain important throughout history.', ""Bubblegum Crisis is a cyberpunk series from AIC, you may remember them from such titles as Sasameki Koto, Viper's Creed, OreImo and Battle Athletes. It's also one of those uncommon series where the anime is the original work rather than being based on a game, manga, light novel or something else. The series has had media based on it including video games, a western comic book from Dark Horse and even a tabletop RPG. So what is it about this OVA that enabled it to grow into a full blown franchise? Let's take a look and see.Our story takes place in a not too distant...dystopian future. There's a rise in crimes involving robots called Boomers and there's a corrupt multi-national corporation called Genom, because dystopian stories always have to have  corrupt corporations. I wouldn't be surprised if Genom sent an ordinary worker  into space for no reason and forced him to watch cheesy movies while monitoring his mind. Genom may very well be involved in many of these crimes for their own purposes. Unfortunately, the AD police force charged with handling Boomer crimes isn't quite adequate to the task. Fortunately, the Knight Sabres, a female vigilante group, is there. Possessing powerful technology and highly skilled, the Knight Sabres take up the fight against Boomers. Each episode tells the tale of one of the Knight Sabre's adventures, either fighting Boomers or taking on  tasks for money. The story isn't particularly unique, but it is compelling. Those episodes that do tie into each other directly do so in a clever way, the world is fascinating and I like that there are positive aspects of Genom instead of it being just another needlessly evil corporation in a dystopian cyberpunk story. The basic premise has been done a huge number of times, but this does provide a creative and unique take on it. There are some issues with it, however. The most obvious being that the Knight Sabres are kind of crap at safeguarding their secret identities. There are several cases when they should be found out, but aren't. For example, there's a scene early on where they go in their armour to hear about a job from a military group. After leaving they notice a satellite's tracking them. So they meet up with their mobile base under a bridge, ditch the armour and exit out the other end. In spite of no one else being near that bridge or having gone under it, they are not found out. No one watched the footage and thought it was strange that these two women mysteriously appeared right when the Knight Sabres vanished? There are also quite a few episodes that focus on a situation involving someone who just happens to coincidentally be closely connected to one of the Knight Sabres. This is a group of mercenaries/vigilantes, you don't have to give some contrived reason for them to get involved.The characters in this are mostly really well handled. All of the Knight Sabres get episodes focusing on them and all of them get character developing moments. The characters are largely complex and interesting. They also have some great interactions with one another. There is one notable exception, Mackey. Mackey is the younger brother of the Knight Sabres' leader, Sylia. To call him incredibly obnoxious would be an understatement. He's a perverse little worm who's there to serve as an errand boy and perv on the Knight Sabres, including his own older sister. In fact, she's the one he pervs on the most. Fortunately, he isn't a major character, but the few scenes that feature him are frequently downright unpleasant.The art is very meticulous. It's a bit dated, but you can tell a lot of effort went into getting all the details right and making the world expansive. The action sequences are suitably epic, the tech is really cool. It just looks excellent. That being said, there is one issue with the art. That's right, there's excessive fan-service. There are semi-long scenes of the ladies changing into their suits for the sole purpose of getting some nudity into the OVA. Frankly, they could have done one changing scene and had it make sense since it does show you something about the way the suits work, but it isn't something that needed to be seen multiple times. There are also some fan-service costumes at several points and some other scenes that have little purpose aside from titillating the heterosexual male portion of the audience. Because that's totally worth interrupting the fluidity of the narrative for. Wait... what?The cast in this is really good. Hiramatsu Akiko, Sakakibara Yoshiko, Oomori Kinuko and Tomizawa Michie are all great in their roles as the Knight Sabres. The music is excellent. Each episode has about three or four songs and they're all really damn good.The ho-yay factor is a 5/10. The relationship between Priss and Sylvie is pretty homo-erotic. Nene admires other girls' beauty on multiple occasions, as does Linna. There's also some flirtation between two men in the AD Police, Leon and Daley.That's Bubblegum Crisis. All in all, it's a really good OVA. The voice acting and music are top-notch, the story is really good, the art is great and most of the characters are really well done. Its biggest issues are Mackey, the occasional story element that doesn't work, Mackey, excessive fan service and Mackey. Still, it is a great cyberpunk series and I do recommend checking it out. My final rating is an 8/10. Next week I'll take a look at Slayers Return. dystopian future. There's a rise in crimes involving robots called Boomers and there's a corrupt multi-national corporation called Genom, because dystopian stories always have to have  corrupt corporations. I wouldn't be surprised if Genom sent an ordinary worker  into space for no reason and forced him to watch cheesy movies while monitoring his mind. Genom may very well be involved in many of these crimes for their own purposes. Unfortunately, the AD police force charged with handling Boomer crimes isn't quite adequate to the task. Fortunately, the Knight Sabres, a female vigilante group, is there. Possessing powerful technology and highly skilled, the Knight Sabres take up the fight against Boomers. Each episode tells the tale of one of the Knight Sabre's adventures, either fighting Boomers or taking on  tasks for money. The story isn't particularly unique, but it is compelling. Those episodes that do tie into each other directly do so in a clever way, the world is fascinating and I like that there are positive aspects of Genom instead of it being just another needlessly evil corporation in a dystopian cyberpunk story.

In fact, it isn't innovative at all: the plot is so episodic you realize there really isn't much of a story, the characters don't really develop or grow much as the show advances, and it's really clich√©d in many senses.But Bubblegum Crisis gets away with this for the...following things: visually, it looks neat, cool, amazing, thanks to the artists (Keinichi Sonoda making beautiful character designs, to note just one aspect); the music is classic 80s, but it isn't annoying like that of anime series concurrent to it; and thirdly, it is precisely this cyberpunk setting that gives it so much life.The series has one of the best introductions, opening with the aformentioned glorious music and a display of MegaTokyo, Boomers, the AD Police, and many of our main characters. That alone hooks a viewer into the show. That alone is an important factor, because a show that doesn't hook a viewer isn't worth the viewer's time.Ther series isn't without its faults: as mentioned before, the plot is practically nonexistent, with the series being of a highly episodic nature; it's pretty clich√©d (the eeeeeevil megacorporation and its schemes threaten MegaTokyo! And only a band of sexy, classy girls in power armor can stop them!). But that doesn't make it a really bad series. One can simply disregard this (the series makes it easy for the viewer to do this) and enjoy it for what it is: an old, 80s, generic (but highly-influential) animation series that holds on its own thanks to its visuals and music.I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious to what was some of the first exposure of mainstream anime back twenty years ago. following things: visually, it looks neat, cool, amazing, thanks to the artists (Keinichi Sonoda making beautiful character designs, to note just one aspect); the music is classic 80s, but it isn't annoying like that of anime series concurrent to it; and thirdly, it is precisely this cyberpunk setting that gives it so much life.The series has one of the best introductions, opening with the aformentioned glorious music and a display of MegaTokyo, Boomers, the AD Police, and many of our main characters.

It seemed to be very popular in both the US and japan at the time of it's release, but nowadays nobody seems to be talking about it at all, maybe that's due to the fact that it hasn't got a new installment in ages, or just that it doesn't jive well with modern audiences, among the people that do talk about Bubblegum Crisis is considered something of a classic, and i think that it's reputation definitely holds up well in that regard.This series LOOKS fantastic, it's probably my favorite looking anime from the 80's, from the character designs...to the art style to how fluid the animation can get. this show looks amazing. It only gets better and better as it goes on, and more interesting character designs get introduced, and the characters that we already know feel more expressive and more well animated, like the staff had gotten a lot better at drawing them by episode 8.The music is so 80's it hurts, and i mean that in the best way, it has this distinct sound and feel that just gives off a unique sound that you really aren't going to hear in modern anime, i love it.The plot is where it starts to get rocky, this show absolutely shows the fact that it was cut short, episode 8 was far from a satisfying ending, but this show did get a continuation though. It's very episodic, and that sometimes gets in the way of delivering a plot that leaves you feeling something, but i felt that Bubblegum crisis' highs aren't really in whats going on in the plot, the story is pretty simple and surprisingly uneventful, it's mostly just fighting villains of the week, and the supporting cast are also mostly one-off characters that aren't particularly interesting or memorable. the best parts of this show are the ones that are just the main four girls interacting with each other, whether it's in their civilian lives, or on the battlefield as Kight Sabres, the chemistry between all four of the main characters palpable. each one of them is also a stand-out, recognizable. memorable character, and their characterization is where the show thrives. You get enough of the main characters together that Bubblegum Crisis feels like a worthwhile series, despite the fact that the regular episode to episode plots were so lackluster.Overall, Bubblegum Crisis is a classic, a great series that is definitely worth a watch, even if it happens to come with a few issues, it's still a fantastic time all around. to the art style to how fluid the animation can get. this show looks amazing.

However, the rest is average.  The narrative is weak throughout the series, with some plot points never being explored.  With the exception of several scenes none of the characters are really developed.  While the action is well animated the other scenes are lackluster in comparison.  The designs and overall artstyle, as previously stated, are a joy to look at.  The action scenes are fun to watch and well executed.  The animation seems to take a backseat towards the end of the series...in favor of attempting to develop the characters more, but it is a little too late.  The OST is also worth a listen.  While Bubblegum Crisis caters to sci-fi and animation enthusiasts, those seeking a thought-provoking story and well-developed characters should seek elsewhere. in favor of attempting to develop the characters more, but it is a little too late.

""cyberpunk"" context of the  story was what really drew me.I recommend it.', 'Bubblegum Crisis has one main issue, and that is focus. The focus of the budget seemed to have gone towards the aesthetics, many of which happen to be lifted directly from Blade Runner, and while the aesthetics are certainly good, you need more than that for a series to thrive.So, accounting for the absence of focus towards other areas, the one that is most negatively affected is the story. With that said, it is an action series, which are typically sparse in story for the obvious reason that if you have to regularly include action sequences, then that‚Äôs going to subtract from the available time...to produce a story. Bubblegum Crisis seems to have all the intent to set up a story with the makings of something like Robocop, i.e. an action series that actually has a well thought out and multi-layered story, but calling the story surface level would be generous ‚Äì the issue with Bubblegum Crisis‚Äôs story is not that it is too generic or too black-and-white, the problem is that there is almost no story in the first place. The basic premise is that robotic people named Boomers are knocking about, mostly hiding in plain sight with the rest of society, and some of them do a competent job of hiding in plain sight, looking like just like regular people, whereas other people are built like The Terminator. In general, there appear to be a wide variety of models of Boomers, some of which don‚Äôt attempt to hide at all and just look completely like regular robots, and it seems the majority of Boomers seem to exist for the main purpose of beating the shit out of people, although when it comes down to it they‚Äôve probably got more in common with people from Ancient Greece than people from the 1960s, considering they all insist on fighting naked. In any case, the Boomers don‚Äôt really serve much narrative purpose apart from the fact they exist, these particular robots superficially resemble humans, but there‚Äôs not any particular reason for it. They‚Äôre largely lacking in any actual humanity, there isn‚Äôt any reason for them to keep that fake human flesh on, they aren‚Äôt wrestling with a sense of self-awareness, or perhaps mistreated on account of being Boomers, or anything at all. They‚Äôre just robots who appear to enjoy committing terrorism, because I guess that‚Äôs what robots like to do.But, what‚Äôs more critical than an absence of story, is that there is not a huge amount of consistency in the small story that is told. While in the majority of the episodes, it‚Äôs kind of small, there are some wherein it becomes a huge focus, and the main characters, the Knight Sabers, are vaguely developed. Not much to say about the main characters, they‚Äôre women, they wear these combat suits and fight the Boomers. However, once or twice, they do try and develop these characters, by trying to get them to talk about their feelings, and it just does not work. A series needs consistency to work, you wouldn‚Äôt want something to completely change genre halfway through, and the same goes for subtler things like the episode composition. When it changes from finding and killing Boomers to the main characters talking about their fear of abandonment, it‚Äôs a less than welcome paradigm shift. And, that‚Äôs the main issue, there is not much consistency, while sometimes the episodes are good, nothing astounding, not something that‚Äôs going to permeate my psyche the way Robocop did, but the kind of thing you can tune in to with a chippy in one hand and a drink in the other, and just have a good time. But it does not consistently offer that experience, and that‚Äôs the issue, it‚Äôs not consistently good, yet it‚Äôs not consistently bad either, which leads to a conflicting feeling. And, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily object to them changing the tone or the pacing now and then if it was actually integral to the central questions the viewer may have. A major one that comes to mind is how society evolved into the way it is, to which you‚Äôre given ‚Äúa war happened‚Äù, and that‚Äôs it, or how Boomers cultivated into the way they are, or who the Knight Sabers are, their backstories aren‚Äôt particularly compelling, and neither are they. Soldiers who begrudgingly fulfill their duty to kill the Boomers, and there‚Äôs not a huge amount else to say about them, as for their backstory, the most you get is that they also happen to be rockstars, but that certainly doesn‚Äôt correlate to their character, there‚Äôs no sense of rebellion you‚Äôd expect from a rockstar, they don‚Äôt even make musical puns when they fight, it‚Äôs a detail as insignificant as their blood type. They don‚Äôt tell you any of these basic details, but they throw in a ton of pointless side characters, like some photographer who appears in the last episode, who is about as important as you can typically expect a character introduced in the last episode to be.The aesthetics are certainly impressive, the visuals of the city look great, and there were some legitimately cool looking robots once or twice, although this is somewhat held back by a poor budget, it‚Äôs an action series but they don‚Äôt seem to have the budget to properly orchestrate action sequences, most certainly not the sort that involves them jumping around like crazy, so it can feel a bit disjointed at times. And, while I‚Äôm typically opposed to any more than one music video put into a single series, Bubblegum Crisis just barely gets a pass for having music that‚Äôs a lot better than usual.In summary, Bubblegum Crisis is a shit sandwich with some nice sprinkles on the top. It‚Äôs got a couple good parts, and some decent ideas that could probably work if they were elaborated upon, but it‚Äôs got some major problems, and even with its good points, they are held back by its shortcomings, resulting in a work that ranges from mediocre to somewhat good, depending on which episode it is. to produce a story.

There are really some particular elements from the show that are outstanding. Set in a dystopian future, humanity is heavily dependent on technology in the form of Boomers, autonomous androids, that have various uses. The story of Bubblegum Crisis, or rather the premise as a whole, isn\'t particularly unique. The Knight Sabers, a group of mercenaries, often meddle in the abuse of Boomers and the Genom Corporation.The art in Bubblegum Crisis is wonderful. It is refreshing to see the detail that can be achieved...through hand drawing. Current techniques using computer modeling is unable to produce similar results. The same could be said about the quality of the sound. The opening song, ""Konya wa Hurricane,"" is very emblematic of the sound of the decade. This theme is captured throughout the series.The characters of Bubblegum Crisis are each very identifiable. Priss expresses very human-like traits and acts accordingly with her personality. However, I feel that there is little room for development due to the episodic nature of the series. Each episode is approximately 45 minutes long and does well to engage the viewer from start to end. Still, little carries over from one episode to the next aside from the characters themselves.Bubblegum Crisis captures the 80\'s through its audio and visually striking style. Due to its episodic nature, the potential of the series was limited. Nonetheless, I felt that the series was still very enjoyable and can be used as a gateway into other shows with similar animation such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Gunbuster. through hand drawing.

This is a kind of mech anime from the late 80s that tells the story of 4 women who are the ""Knights Saber"". They basically take hired jobs and fire enemy robots to try and stop the evil Genom corporation. This OVA has 8 episodes, and contrary to many reviews I\'ve read I think it ends in a pretty descent place and if this was the end and there were no sequel I would have been OK.The good:Awesome soundtrack that is 80s goodness, the intro and outro of each episode...play like an 80s music video.Interesting characters who each have unique personalities.PG-13 but shows boobs, which I think WAS PG-13 in the 80s.Each episode is like a stand alone movie in the universe, minus a few plot points that are carried forward through the series.Basically, everything cool and awesome about the 80s is in this anime.The bad:Pretty poor graphics.A story that basically goes no where.Little to no character development... people die and no one seems all that bothered for more than a few seconds.Overall: It is neat. If you have some time to kill and like the 80s and mech/fighting anime you\'ll enjoy this. play like an 80s music video.Interesting characters who each have unique personalities.PG-13 but shows boobs, which I think WAS PG-13 in the 80s.Each episode is like a stand alone movie in the universe, minus a few plot points that are carried forward through the series.Basically, everything cool and awesome about the 80s is in this anime.The bad:Pretty poor graphics.A story that basically goes no where.Little to no character development... people die and no one seems all that bothered for more than a few seconds.Overall: It is neat.

Every creation comes from an era of media culture, and even the most ‚Äútimeless‚Äù productions can‚Äôt help but reflect contemporary trends and zeitgeist.‚ÄúBubblegum Crisis‚Äù is the opposite of timeless. Its creators, voracious creatures of popular media culture, slathered a goopy concoction of everything that was hip at the time onto each animation cel. The series has no original bone in its body. Everything is a reference. It has nothing to say other than, ‚ÄúThis is what cool is.‚Äù As a result, it is one of the purest anime time capsules you can watch.BGC takes place in a true-to-genre ‚ÄúMegatokyo‚Äù, a turbulent east-meets-west...cyberpunkian metropolis in which shadowy megacorps pull the strings. Murderous Replicants and Terminators prowl the neon-lit streets, kept in check only by a super-sentai bishoujo team and their transforming mecha-motorbikes and acrobatic power armor. Lasers and explosions dance across kaleidoscopic chrome to full-vocal 80s hard rock. It‚Äôs adolescent hyper-kitsch fit for an otaku.What it lacks in taste, it makes up in design-work. The joy of watching BGC today is its now-retrofuture world of chunky appliance-like computers, physical media, handheld gadgetry, toy-like vehicles, colorful fashions, and range of sci-fi-appropriate architectural & interior-design styles from modern, postmodern, and high-tech.

And sometimes, an otaku just needs it raw.', ""Bubblegum Crisis looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, and generally speaking, feels beautiful. However, its writing leaves much to be desired. This is an anime best enjoyed with your brain turned off. Watch for the characters, aesthetics, and action.Now, there are episodes that are extremely well written, such as the cool ass car episode. What I mean by poor writing is that the overarching story itself never really goes anywhere. If you go into it knowing that, you'll probably be less confused when you've finished the last OVA. I was certainly a little puzzled.Why? Because there are mysteries set up about certain characters, well, one in particular,...that I expected to be wrapped up by the end. The last episode is cute, but not a finale. Definitely a good episode, but - again, perhaps I expected something I shouldn't have in Crisis.I haven't seem Bubblegum Crash yet, but from a cursory glance of reviews, I doubt it answers the questions I have about Crisis.Oh, and now that we're farther into the review, I won't spoil per-say with my next comment, but I will let it be known. There is an episode that tries desperately to make the viewer care about some newly introduced characters - and while other episodes achieve this quite easily - this episode does not. The episode after it continues the narrative, but failed to make me care even then, though the antagonist certainly uplifted the experience tremendously. Those two episodes, while as pretty as the rest of the show, definitely felt like the weakest link, only held up by the crazy shit the new bad guy introduces.And before I close off this review, Bubblegum Crisis has disappointing bad guys. The antagonists feel too easily defeated, kept along for an episode or two. Only one of them makes the protagonists struggle, but not for long at all.Still, I tend to overanalyze that side of fiction.Anyway, it's still very good. And you should watch it, if you haven't already. that I expected to be wrapped up by the end. The last episode is cute, but not a finale.

And you should watch it, if you haven't already."", ""One of the glorious things about being an anime fan in this day and age is that so many anime is readily accessible and it gives me a chance to watch some of the great classics of anime from a time often forgotten for the very first time.Despite the anime being 36 years old it still holds up and is absolutely timeless for its accurate portrayal of cyberpunk and everything it represents. The plot of bubblegum crisis focuses around a vigilante force of 4 female members (Priss, Sylia, NeNe, and Linna) which go by the alias of the Knight Sabers in order to protect...the city of MegaTokyo from Boomers which are robots with advanced weaponry that have the ability to disguise themselves as humans created for the most part by the Genom Corporation. The Knight Sabers do this through the use of their power suits that give them such a wide array of combat abilities in order to fight the boomers since the Ad Police (the primary police force in order to combat boomer crime) have a tough time with regards to how monstrous, dangerous, and deadly these boomers are.Originally this series was suppose to be 13 episodes long but due to disputes between Artmic and Youmex, the series was unfortunately discontinued. However, for the 8 episodes that did happen, we got introduced to a beautiful world and an engaging story that was never afraid to show it's audience that no matter how beautiful of a futuristic world that is presented to us, it can often times be an ugly world that can be so ungodly unfair. The greatest thing with regards to these episodes is the way that they're presented they often feel like it's own movie because each episode has an engaging title that happens at the very beginning which pretty much sets you up for what your about to experience. However, all depending on the story that needs to be told the length of these episodes tend to be very inconsistent. One episode's length is as short as 26 minutes, while the longest episode can run as long as 52 minutes. The episodes in themselves do an excellent job of telling the overall story of the Knight Sabers but often times the episodes feel completely out of place. The final episode (Scoop Chase) is probably the most light-hearted episode of the series and it doesn't feel like a proper farewell to this OVA. Episode 6 (Red Eyes) feels like a much better episode to end the OVA with because it offers the best and most epic climatic final battle of the entire series.I think the strongest factor that contributes to the timeless nature of this anime is that it does a good job of representing the strongest aspects of what makes the concept of cyberpunk right. You might think the series is just about 4 attractive ladies wearing power suits fighting enemy robots and in a shallow way it is, but it does it with a lot more depth into respecting what makes cyberpunk great. This anime can get brutally violent with some really gruesome deaths and sometimes it can be incredibly raunchy with regards to some of the knight sabers being nude but it never wears out its welcome and it never detracts you from the strongest aspects of this anime which is the action and the story. This anime can be incredibly cruel and dark with regards to it's storytelling because even though every episode has a proper and adequate conclusion there is a slightly sad undertone to it all. The ending for many of these episodes is not the happiest it could be because people die who are absolutely imperative to the story being told but it's a true strength of unapologetic storytelling when your not willing to pull your punches in order to tell the best story with regards to what is being presented. That's life  - people die, sometimes your best intentions will ultimately lead to your own demise and it's these unfortunate circumstances that shape some of the strongest character development in this entire series. The main protagonist of this series Priss even considers quitting the Knight Sabers because she is sick and tired of seeing people hurt despite her best efforts to rid the world of these boomers and the evil corporation that builds them.Despite the series being only 8 episodes long, they do an adequate job of building proper character development but there is simply not enough time to give each of the knight sabers the attention they deserve. Priss herself gets a ton of story development, more so than any of the other knight sabers because in hindsight she is titular main character despite not being the actual leader of the Knight Sabers while the other members definitely get their time to shine, but sometimes character development does have to be sacrificed in order to tell the best story you can because you only have 8 episodes to do so. Out of the 4 knight sabers, Priss and Nene probably get the most development throughout the series with Linna and Sylia often being put on the back burner to a slight degree. The anime understands they have a short amount of time to tell their story and they definitely try to address as many things as humanly possible. There are also many other characters that the anime addresses such as members of A.D. Police and members of the Genom corporation so the anime often has to juggle between character development and the action but thankfully and for the most part it does an excellent job at succeeding with the juggling act. Each episode has it's own unique set of characters that gets brought into the fray and for the most part they're only ever seen in the episode in which they're needed, but thankfully they're contributions to the story never interrupts the great action set pieces of each and every episode.With regards to the Knight Sabers themselves, each of the power suits are completely independent in the sense that not one power suit is the same even though they may look similar in appearance. Each power suit is designed differently with each suit having it's own set of weaponry in order to deal with the boomer threat. Each suit is pretty much designed in great detail all depending on the character that is wearing that specified suit. Talking about the Knight Sabers and their suits, I really have to give credit to the action in this series. The power suits that these ladies wear are indeed powerful, but yet one thing I can appreciate about this series is that the fights are not one sided no matter if its coming from the villain or the heroine. These ladies and their power suits take a ton of battle damage and in some episodes the Knight Sabers suffer various injuries while fighting these boomers and I actually really enjoy that because even though the Knight sabers have the best weaponry to fight the boomers compared to the A.D. Police they still have their struggles against the boomer threat. Fights consistently go back and forth and this eventually leads up to the ambition and desperation that the knights sabers will use  everything at their disposal to defeat these boomers no matter how powerful they are. The knight sabers even have their motorcycles that double as exo-suits just in case they need an extra bit of firepower in order to deal with some of the most powerful boomers in this entire series. Even the boomers themselves are animated incredibly beautifully with a lot of attention to detail because there are a wide array of deadly boomers throughout the entire series that the Knight Sabers have to fight and some of them are so different and deadly that the Knight Sabers have to keep their guard up in order to defeat them.Another strong aspect of this anime is its music, and it's a beautiful time capsule to not only the positive qualities of what 80's pop music represents but it's done with so much care that it blends in well with the cyberpunk world that it's placed in. Music is a big part of this series because every episode has its own opening and ending song which shows how much care was put into making every episode stand on its own with its own individual merit. There really isn't one weak track in the entire soundtrack and it's incredibly amazing that each song contributes to the overall aura of the episode and what is waiting for you at the start and at the end of each episode. Some of the background music compliments the anime incredibly beautifully. The soundtrack is simply god-tier and there is no better way to put it.For as wonderful as this anime is it does have a few small problems. I think the biggest most noticeable problem with this anime is the quality of the animation. One thing that I've personally noticed is that the further you get into the episodes the animation actually becomes better. In the very beginning the animation for this anime is very jagged and rough and not as smooth as it should be especially for the action scenes it wants to showcase but if you stick with the series long enough you'll notice a huge improvement over the animation especially when you reach episode 5 (Moonlight Rambler). However the rough janky animation is not really that noticeable unless you really take the time to look at it. There is a lot of care to make the animation stills as incredibly detailed as possible and you can see how much care was put into the animation especially when it came to the action scenes after episode 4.As a lifelong English dub fan even I have to admit that the English dub is not really the best and there is not a lot of care taken into consideration with regards to the English voices syncing up with the animation. Some of the characters are okay while others are just plain bad. I think the anime deserves a brand new English dub, no offense to the original English voice cast who I'm sure tried their best with what they were given especially since the English dub existed at a time where anime was still trying to find an audience in the Western world. I do recommend that if you want to enjoy this anime to the absolute fullest you watch it with the original Japanese dialog with subtitles with regards to your own native language.Even though this anime has a few minor gripes such as inconsistent animation, volatile episode length, and a poor English dub. It's strengths greatly surpass it's faults and this anime is still held in high regard for all the right reasons and it's an excellent example on how to do a cyberpunk story right while still showing a little bit of blood and a little bit of raunchiness. The music and action is top tier and despite it's dark and unapologetic nature, it does have it's share of comical moments as well which is always a welcome addition.Check it out because it truly is that timeless.9/10 the city of MegaTokyo from Boomers which are robots with advanced weaponry that have the ability to disguise themselves as humans created for the most part by the Genom Corporation.

Don't let the name fool you this series packs serious heat, despite its age.  Maybe they call it Bubblegum Crisis, because three of the girls look like teenagers.  Much of the focus in this series is on Priscilla (Priss) the brunette and her boyfriend from the AD Police.  The focus towards the end and especially in Bubblegum Crash (the finale) shifts gradually towards Sylia Stingray the brains of the outfit (literally).I thought the story was very enjoyable and complex.  Do yourself a favor though and buy the Blu-ray version as you don't have to shuffle discs....When a new Boomer arrives it's up to the Knight Sabers to stop them; Priss, Linna, Nene, and the mentor Sylia.  The Knight Sabers suits remind me of Iron Man's suit as they fly, blast things, and are pretty durable.  The Boomers are mechanized machines and Genom is bent on world domination.  The AD Police try to help, but mostly get in the way.  Who's that pink haired girl who works for them?  Anyways, when the Knight Sabers get in trouble it's up to the AD Police force, I mean their backup to save the day.  I liked the premise of the show, with heroines and the romance.  Bubblegum Crash does a nice job of tying up loose ends.The animation was decent, but passable.  I would give Bubblegum Crisis (Crises) animation a 7.5/10 and Bubblegum Crash (Crashes) animation a 6.5/10.  The titile menu for Bubblegum Crisis on Blu-ray is immaculate.The sound was like a shining star and made a good anime series very good.  The songs are mostly dubbed in English and actually play a new song during each of the eight episodes.  You listen to the music as the animation flows with the music.  It adds excitement to every episode, but Bubblegum Crash doesn't have this.In conclusion, fans of older anime will love this one.  It hits hard and ends with a crash!

With that aside, what is presented is a fair anime with some strong points but a few misses.The story to Bubblegum Crisis is fairly easy to follow and at time both very good and enjoyable. However at other times it can feel forced or convoluted. Unfortunately, that leads to some episodes being really good and others being okay. The show begs to be more of an overarching story line and while I'm aware that would've been uncommon for the time, it's episodic format leaves a lot to be desired and makes the overall...show feel really disjointed.Art is good for the time and periodically correct. Sound is good and the songs are, for the most part, enjoyable even dubbed. Acting is good.Character design was enjoyable and each character feels and looks sufficiently different.

I wasn\'t sure if I\'d like this due to its 80s\' cheesiness, yet said characteristic is the one that creates such a beautiful retro-futuristic world, with one banging song after the other (the first ten minutes are honestly incredible) and stylish outfits throughout, set against this alluring nocturne urban landscapes. The animation is the one to thank for this aspect, as well as for some truly pretty shots that have landed their way in most of the ""slow+reverb"" videos. Nonetheless, storytelling wise lacked strength, it would\'ve been...beneficial to this anime a full-on dramatic arc, from first to eighth episode, instead of a different adventure each installment. Although the episodes are told with a patience, the fights are so brief it was a let down. Not only it would\'ve benefit the story, but the character development too, as you barely know their backgrounds and motives to join The Knight Sabers. I\'m aware that most of the animes at that time weren\'t use to break archetypes, still, it had the potential. On a good note, for an anime this old, it was very upbeat to watch that most of the characters were women, especially this group of strong women that fight with little to no help from men, showing little and teenage girls that they hold power too. Generally, Bubblegum Crisis wasn\'t the most deep or perfect anime I\'ve seen, yet the flaws, which are mostly dated, can\'t ruin the nicely build episodes and how enjoyable everything is, showcasing friendship and aspects of anime that are mostly attributed to a male demographic in an unapologetically girly way. Liked this one quite a bit, I\'m feeling a light to decent seven on this one. beneficial to this anime a full-on dramatic arc, from first to eighth episode, instead of a different adventure each installment.

Its an anime that was wildly revered but these days its largely unknown (at least from my perspective) outside of the odd gif here and there. From an outside viewer a title like that sounds more fit for a romance anime than anything. However you\'d be severely wrong.Short version: its a lil cheesy and for its time but it has its charm and I think you should watch it even for historical sakeLong version...:Bubble Gum Crisis as the synopsis suggests is a... well cyberpunk anime with all the typical cyberpunk tropes and the likes. If you like cyberpunk , it has it by the bunch. This doesn\'t mean its grim like a lot after it - our heroes are usually unscathed and there is quite a positive wrap up for this series in general.  In fact I\'d say it is pretty tame by today\'s standards.This is not to say it isn\'t an OVA for a reason : like a lot of 80s ova there is of course nudity and mild blood. Again most  is fairly tame,especially to other OVAs released during this time.Ironically I think its less fan service   than your ""average"" harem anime of today. There was the odd scenes here and there that made me go ""ehhhh that\'s rather weird"" (the younger brother perv  needs his ass kicked but he does get better as the show progresses) but nothing that ruins the show for me.On the blood side it really depends on episode- the robots (funnily called boomers) sometimes have orange blood , sometimes not. People break bones and get scratched but at most its pg 13 .Action and story wise its pretty much similar. Its story is bad by no means but it is fairly simple. Being a 8 episode OVA it spares fat and there is questions to still be had by the end of the anime.I think the weakest link are some of the supporting cast like Leon  but overall solid. The action is hit or miss. Being animated in the 80s its not as  fluid as one would expect but it does its job. The later episodes  improve action and animation wise from something that\'s passable to something that could be put in a sakuga edit.Voice acting and music is probably its strongest point - even if its very 80s. Each actor fits their role and its believable. It can be cheesy but i think thats apart of the charm that makes it very enjoyable to me You can\'t go a single episode without at least one song that you search up afterwards.However I do not suggest the dub. If you have ti its fine but it suffers from being from a time where nobody in the west really knew what to do with these new ""asian cartoons"". The main cast is not bad by any means but they just sound way too old to be playing young adults.Overall if I had to summarize this anime it would be ""for its time""- Its not super dated by any means but it does have its moments. I think the reason behind this is just because a lot of its tropes and qualities can be found in a lot of cyberpunk anime after its release. There are a lot of elements that you can see the origin of today that were really popularized by it and its much more successful younger brother Akria.I would say if your new or old to cyberpunk you should check this one out even just out of a historical value. For episode highlights I suggest Revenge Road , Red Eyes and Scoop Chase.7.9/10 - I would love to see this be remade - cheese and all. :Bubble Gum Crisis as the synopsis suggests is a... well cyberpunk anime with all the typical cyberpunk tropes and the likes. If you like cyberpunk , it has it by the bunch. This doesn\'t mean its grim like a lot after it - our heroes are usually unscathed and there is quite a positive wrap up for this series in general.  In fact I\'d say it is pretty tame by today\'s standards.This is not to say it isn\'t an OVA for a reason : like a lot of 80s ova there is of course nudity and mild blood. Again most  is fairly tame,especially to other OVAs released during this time.Ironically I think its less fan service   than your ""average"" harem anime of today.

It was almost a flagship title at a time when anime were still fairly niche in America and everyone was watching tame sitcom cartoons. It was in a way the Neon Genesis or Ghost in the Shell of the 1980s, or the Psycho Pass of the 2010s. Historical importance aside, nowadays it is closer to a skeleton of a good story, since it had lots of good ideas but didn‚Äôt do much with them.In terms of production values it holds up pretty well. Made at...a time when everything was hand-drawn with multiple layers of shading, it doesn‚Äôt become instantly aged as the CGI monstrocities of today. The world is also your standard sci-fi dystopia, the claustrophobic high-tech megacity almost all sci-fi stories depict so it‚Äôs easy to dig it if you are used to that sort of setting. The heroines have the ‚Äú80‚Äôs anime look‚Äù (huge eyes, Barbie-like hairstyles), which can seem weird compared to the far more down to earth sceneries. The battles don‚Äôt have much choreography and body movements tend to be choppy. Animation is average at best. Also there is a rather high amount of fan service, as 80% of the cast is pretty girls undressing or moving around in underwear several times per episode/OVA.Voice acting is decent but not great. The music themes have some powerful pieces and in fact this series has the honor of being the first title to use voice actors both for voicing characters and singing the songs (Priss).The plot is rather typical. There is crime, corruption and crazed androids running around in a futuristic city. Laugh all you want at their name being Boomers that can‚Äôt adjust in a high-tech society. The normal police have their hands full, until a group of vigilante super chicks, called the Knight Sabers, storm in and save the day. Their identities are hidden, their motives are unknown. So far, the story is like watching Batman. But under the surface, every girl has its reasons for being in the team and there are several secrets behind the origin of the berserked robots. I make it sound much more interesting than it actually is, since both the plots and the revelations are fairly basic stuff. The animation studio had budget issues and couldn‚Äôt finish all the episodes it intended, thus it kept the plot almost episodic and open-ended. A later version did a better job at wrapping things up, but even then the finale was more silly than sad, with the girls being butt-naked as they fall down from space and resolving the conflict like it‚Äôs a naughty fairy-tale.Nowadays, there is nothing fresh or exciting about it. It‚Äôs more of a nostalgic rule of cool type of title you watch for getting that 80s vibe that is completely absent today. The story is half-serious, the plot is loose or slow, the ending is open or silly. The main idea of the series is used in better ways elsewhere. Fan service wasn‚Äôt that great. Action scenes weren‚Äôt that great. I can‚Äôt recommend it as a must-watch classic. a time when everything was hand-drawn with multiple layers of shading, it doesn‚Äôt become instantly aged as the CGI monstrocities of today.

Busou Renkin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1536/Busou_Renkin,"['We all have those series. Which for some unknown reason we can\'t help to love. We know we shouldn\'t, we know it\'s not good. But we can\'t help but watch the series and be totally entranced by it. Buso Renkin is that anime for me. It\'s a totally predictable, cliche, crony shonen anime. It\'s nothing new, it literally brings nothing new to the table, but I just can\'t help but love this series.Buso Renkin is your typically shonen experience. It\'s got a main character who is given a power by another and mysteriously keeps powering up and doesn\'t ever seem to...lose any of the battles he is in. This literally sums up Buso Renkin, it\'s fight after fight, power up after power up, but Kazuki doesn\'t ever seem to lose. Each episode for the most part does have some pretty humorous comedy in it. Just random outbursts by the characters ect...but it helps keep the action somewhat fresh. It\'s got some nice romance that develops along the way(I am a sucker for anything love related). One thing that was a let down was the action in this show. I have never been one to enjoy shonen\'s were it is just power ups and beat downs. There is one really amazing fight, where I can only imagine most of this anime\'s budget was spent. But the action isn\'t that good in my opinion.Despite this the show is still incredibly enjoyable. If I had to attribute why this show is so enjoyable, I would have to say it\'s the chemistry. Everything comes together so well, and I would have to say this show\'s main success is the pacing. It lays everything down in front of the viewer in a very logical coherent path. Nothing is ever rushed. Despite Kazuki gaining as many power ups as he does, it never feels overwhelming. It never feels like he is always meant to win, or that he is over powered. It feels like he is just growing. The show allows time for comedy, but it never forces it. It doesn\'t add comedy in dramatic moments for the effect of comedy, it simple puts comedy in places where it belongs. Even the relationship that starts to develop between Kazuki and Tokiko isn\'t forced. You really get to see the chemistry between these two characters grow and  you get the see the feelings manifest, something of which I did not expect to see in this anime.The show\'s characters(Mainly Tokiko) also made me fall in love with this shows. While Kazuki isn\'t anything new in terms of characters, he certainly isn\'t bad. He is just a typical shonen good-guy. He wants to do what ever it takes to protect everyone around him, even if it means scarfing himself. However Tokiko is the real star of this show. She starts out, cold, brash, and filled with hatred. But by the end of the series she is, open, shy, and full of love to give. She truly goes through amazing development through the series. Most of it comes from being around Kazuki, and beginning to learn what it is to like to love and want to protect things dear to you. Now what made Tokiko so awesome in my eyes, to be blunt, was the fact that she was a badass. Screaming ""I will rip out your guys"" killing all the Homunculus in her sight, and to be honest, not to many people can sport a scar as hers and remain that sexy. Her personality and development just made her a truly enjoyable character.At the end of the day, nothing changes with Buso Renkin though. It is still your predictable, cliche shonen series were the good guy always wins. This series brings nothing new to the table, but at the end of the day it\'s enjoyable. And that is all that really matters.  So if you are looking for a good action anime(That mixes several anime concepts), with some very awesome characters, and a good mix of comedy and romance. Then I suggest you try Buso Renkin. lose any of the battles he is in. This literally sums up Buso Renkin, it\'s fight after fight, power up after power up, but Kazuki doesn\'t ever seem to lose.

Then I suggest you try Buso Renkin.', ""Busou Renkin is a story that takes many of its elements from other anime.  You'll see elements of Fullmetal Alchemist, Ruroui Kenshin, Shakugan no Shana, Fate/Stay Night, and probably a bunch more.  Though Busou Renkin was developed by the creator of Rurouni Kenshin, Nobuhiro Watsuki, it is not as epic as the story of Kenshin was.  However, despite some of the obvious points of this series, Busou Renkin manages to uphold fairly well and be a relatively enjoying series.Busou Renkin means Arms Alchemy.  In this story, there are homunculi that are running about the land and its up to alchemic warriors,...using these Arms Alchemy devices (which spring forth a weapon based on the users personality) to vanquish the homunculi.  This does sound a little bit familiar but Busou Renkin does manage to throw in its own elements and enough plot twists to keep it original.  Deep down, however, its still your run of the mill &quot;regular kid rising up out of nowhere to save the world&quot; theme.The animation is up to par with todays standards, but in some episodes however, you'll see it lacking.  Or rather, in some places and characters.  Otherwise, there isn't too much to complain of about the art.The music and such in Busou Renkin isn't all that bad, but its also nothing spectacular.  The opening theme song is pretty catchy and the music scores during battles do raise your tension a bit, but what I found missing from this particular anime was that one, catchy song, piece of music that reels you in no matter what was happening in the anime.  And thus, at some points, I found myself losing concentration a different points in the show.Nobuhiro Watsuki must have some kind of fetish with scars, because as with Kenshin, the main female protagonist here has a defining scar too (though the scar is not as important to the plotline as Kenshin's was).  Anyway, back to the characters.  Kazuki, the main male lead, is your typical hero who I found to be a little too perfect.  Without giving too much away, you can say it was hard to go against him in battles.  However, Kazuki was your only typical character.  Nobuhiro Watsuki has created a plethora of unique (and some rather a little *too* unique if you ask me) characters which is a nice change of pace from the norm.All in all, a lot of Busou Renkin is pretty cliche and obvious as to what may happen.  The ending, in my taste, was a little too premature, in other words, it seemed as if it was put together forcefully to have that particular ending.  The pace of the story starts off rather quickly, immersing you immediately without giving all the details, but soon starts to slow back down to a reasonable pace.If you're looking for a series that's 26 episodes long that's rather enjoyable to watch, but nothing &quot;eye-popping,&quot; as well as something with romance, Busou Renkin is something you definitely should check out. using these Arms Alchemy devices (which spring forth a weapon based on the users personality) to vanquish the homunculi.

Watch the first three (or four) episodes, consisting of Papillon. If you enjoy them, continue watching. If you don't, stop watching. It's as simple as that.The first three episodes is like the mini-arc going into the main arc, setting the scene, and making the expression known. If you do not enjoy the style (art, characters, all around) then you won't enjoy the rest. I'm not saying that it's all exactly like that, but it is enough to tell if you will like it or not.This was a generally good anime. Though some of the aspects of...the anime are stereotypical (Boy with strong convictions, girl who doesn't understand, fall in love when they understand eachother, etc.) there are some atypical points to it. And watching it along side by side with Shakugan No Shana has made it very interesting.STORY: 7First off; the Story is relatively good. Not great, but good. The plot goes along the lines of &quot;Hidden Monsters inside the City that we have to eliminate&quot;. Very stereotypical. They eat humans to survive, and they must prevent this. But, there's an added danger. Humans can become these homunculus creatures. Albeit they never actually take advantage of this added conflict, there is a point where it is used. I would've liked to have seen more of this aspect, to diverge itself from the other anime. If i could give this story an &quot;Average&quot; score, i would, because it's definitely an average story.ART: 9The art was very impressive, and very flashy. The combat scenes were definitely Shounen, along with the other &quot;relaxing&quot; scenes, from the vibrant display of femininity in certain characters, all the way to the flashy display of masculine grittiness. I enjoyed the art sometimes more than the story, because a lot of the time they'd have pretty pictures to go along with the flashbacks that usually distracted me.SOUND: 7The opening was fairly good, but nothing that inspired inspiration for me to watch it again, like Bleach or even Erementar Gerad. The ED sequences were fairly interesting, though by that time you're usually just wanting to go on to the next show (whether to see what happens, or in my case to get it over with).CHARACTERS: 7 (10 for Tokiko)The two main characters were interesting enough, but my favorite characters were the captain and tokiko. I enjoyed the captain because he strayed away from the typical &quot;I will do the right thing, in my own opinion&quot;, and went with &quot;I will do the right thing whether it hurts me or not&quot;. And, i enjoyed Tokiko because she went out of the stereotypical beautiful female lead, and was more masculine and gritty rather than perfectly manicured fingernails while weilding a sword. That was my favorite aspect of the characters, was that she was animated and voiced perfectly for the role she was in. I didn't like the submissiveness of the other characters, because it seemed like it was too convenient for the Writers. I give the general cast a 7, and Tokiko a 10.ENJOYMENT: 8Overall, it's fun to watch. To see how everything turns out. But that's why you watch them after episode 1, yes? There are plenty of good love scenes, mainly battle scenes, in all its purest Shounen. This was a great anime to watch on a sick day. It definitely makes you happier and in some cases it'll make you angry with &quot;The Man&quot;. So if you like action sequences and Dragon Ball Z style &quot;Levelling up because i am inspired&quot; sort of deal, then this is the Anime for you.OVERALL: 8I enjoyed this Anime, for its atypical points more than not, but frowned upon the easy plotline. This isn't as epic as Rurouni Kenshin, or as deep as some of the other anime developed by these people. Though, if you start watching this show past the third or fourth episode, you might start to enjoy it! Be warned! It is enjoyable as a whole, but not really much unique value. The best part, i will say, of this series is past episode 18. You think that after the first three episodes that the plotline is over (Which it could've been), then new circumstances arrive.I'll just leave you with this. Watch the first three episodes, if you like them, continue. If you don't.

Stop."", 'Busou Renkin is an anime for those who are looking forward to see lots of action, great battles and a great variety of weapons and characters. So if you are a Naruto/Bleach fan you should watch this one, it will be for sure of your liking and probably (in some aspects) may be considered better than the previously named animes.The story in this anime is pretty much straight forward, those of you who are familiar with Bleach plot will find the storyline very tentative and it will be very likely of your interest, being similar to Bleach\'s. A boy wakes up from a nighmare, in...this nightmare he protected a girl from a monster, but he was murdered in the process. Later on he realizes that he really died and that, what keeps him alive, is a alchemic artifact known as ""Kakugane"". Tokiko-san (the girl who saved him) explains that this artifact materializes it\'s warrior\'s battle instict into the form of a weapon, an arm, Arms Alchemy: Busou Renkin. The enemies here are called ""Humunculus"" (is this similar to Full Metal Alchemist by any chance?) and do have ""another type"" of alchemy power. This monsters have a strong appetite for humans because of the unconscious desire they have to recover the humanity they\'ve losed. Then there are other more powerful enemies like Human-Humunculus (Humunculus with Busou Renkin powers), Alchemic warriors made into something similar to humunculus, you get the point. Similar indeed to Bleach\'s concept of Vizards, Hollows and Arrancars.Also the story has a very common sequence, used in most action-shounen animes: you first got a treat to eliminate, you eliminate the enemies in episode one then another more powerful enemy comes in episode 2 and another and then another, the usual. But this sequence asures that the anime has a very wide range of characters which makes the story more interesting and worthwhile. It got it\'s twists, almost all being around the main character (Kazuki). This twists are what really will make you keep watching the anime to the end, because you will feel very attached to Kazuki, but not to any other character really.The artistic design is in a very high level. The locations look very good, even when thay get destroyed, and believe me, this happens a lot. But on the other hand the character\'s design is a bit... gay. Characters like Papillon and Moonface really look like taken out from fairytales. If you have watched animes like Speed Grapher you will find the appereance of the characters (enemies specifically) very similar and probably like it, if not and you are planning on watching this then get used to it, but don\'t worry you will learn that this characters really are scary (excluding Poke-Moonface Mooooooooon! Definitely one of the most stupid character\'s I\'ve seen.)Continuing on let\'s talk about the sound. I have to say that this anime\'s soundtrack rocks. The opening is superb and almost all sountracks are just the perfect match for the Busou Renkin concept. Without the appropiate music the battles really would have been boring but, actually, the strength of this anime lies here: the battle soundtracks are stunning, they do give the battles more drama and spice and definitely makes them feel really sort of heroic, far from being boring. The ambience themes are also perfectly inputted and give the peaceful / critical feeling depending the situation.Characters are as various as episodes are in the anime. We\'ve got personalities from idiotic and childish to sorrowful and really evil. Most of the characaters, as mentioned before, have a staraflarious look that doesn\'t escape from being stupid. But even so the personalities are not reflected by the looks. Take Papillon for instance: he may look like a butterfly, and some times act really gay but when he get\'s serious he really does look scary as hell. Every character has a different power (at least those who posses a Kakuganes). These powers are really original and different, are mainly represented as weapons. But actually each weapon have a different property, this properties go from high speed regeneration to gravity control, so really a wide difference between weapons.Regarding the personalities itself I have to say it\'s impossible not to take notice Kazuki\'s stubborn and ""I wat to save everyone"" behavior. At some times the way he acts is really annoying but you will get used to it and, at the end, really love this character. Also these guy get\'s trashed really bad and, supposedly,  killed many times (I counted 4). But somehow he manages to stand up and win the fights, so we\'ve got a hero that always wins and never gives up, even if he is supposed to be dead. A pretty often used model of character in modern Shounen animes to create sympathy around the main lead. The character development, again, only centres around Kazuki. He goes from having no powers to become the most powerful warrior in the Alchemic Society, and that progress does take time but still it gives a good amount of anxiety to go on watching it. Also note he always learns new techniques and, at some point, he unleases his real powers.This is a pretty good example for an anime that is good, not perfect, has factors similar to other animes, and can still manage to deliver great fun and satisfaction. I really enjoyed watching Busou Renkin. It ended good and there was not need for more content after it\'s conclusion. I recommend it to anyone, it doesn\'t matter if you don\'t watch this kind of animes, because really it\'s just the same formula that other animes, like Bleach, use. But Bleach is popular isn\'t it?  So that means the formula works, it worked for me at least. this nightmare he protected a girl from a monster, but he was murdered in the process. Later on he realizes that he really died and that, what keeps him alive, is a alchemic artifact known as ""Kakugane"". Tokiko-san (the girl who saved him) explains that this artifact materializes it\'s warrior\'s battle instict into the form of a weapon, an arm, Arms Alchemy: Busou Renkin. The enemies here are called ""Humunculus"" (is this similar to Full Metal Alchemist by any chance?) and do have ""another type"" of alchemy power. This monsters have a strong appetite for humans because of the unconscious desire they have to recover the humanity they\'ve losed. Then there are other more powerful enemies like Human-Humunculus (Humunculus with Busou Renkin powers), Alchemic warriors made into something similar to humunculus, you get the point. Similar indeed to Bleach\'s concept of Vizards, Hollows and Arrancars.Also the story has a very common sequence, used in most action-shounen animes: you first got a treat to eliminate, you eliminate the enemies in episode one then another more powerful enemy comes in episode 2 and another and then another, the usual. But this sequence asures that the anime has a very wide range of characters which makes the story more interesting and worthwhile. It got it\'s twists, almost all being around the main character (Kazuki). This twists are what really will make you keep watching the anime to the end, because you will feel very attached to Kazuki, but not to any other character really.The artistic design is in a very high level. The locations look very good, even when thay get destroyed, and believe me, this happens a lot. But on the other hand the character\'s design is a bit... gay. Characters like Papillon and Moonface really look like taken out from fairytales. If you have watched animes like Speed Grapher you will find the appereance of the characters (enemies specifically) very similar and probably like it, if not and you are planning on watching this then get used to it, but don\'t worry you will learn that this characters really are scary (excluding Poke-Moonface Mooooooooon! Definitely one of the most stupid character\'s I\'ve seen.)Continuing on let\'s talk about the sound. I have to say that this anime\'s soundtrack rocks. The opening is superb and almost all sountracks are just the perfect match for the Busou Renkin concept. Without the appropiate music the battles really would have been boring but, actually, the strength of this anime lies here: the battle soundtracks are stunning, they do give the battles more drama and spice and definitely makes them feel really sort of heroic, far from being boring.

""I\'LL SPLATTER...YOUR GUTS!""This is an IIP- ""Impossible is possible"" anime. The story revolves around alchemy and although it is SUPER played out this anime does well of  lacking straying from any comparisons to FMA Quite frankly the only good plot in ALL of Shonen Jump\'s manga turned anime.The art is pretty great. What would you expect from Nobuhiro Watsuki? I\'m amazed that Xebec ACTUALLY did great designs. The fight scenes are quick, but leave you wanting more....The final fight between two epic characters is so brilliantly colored and shaded that it leaft nothing to be desired. The only problem I have is that some characters look plain. Mahiro looks so stereotypical... But Papillon is such a fresh character that he makes up for it.The BGM in this anime is a bit bad. It goes in at the moments when not needed. (Romantic music AFTER Kazuki talks to Tokiko about his feelings) The dubs for both the Japanese and English are great, but my complaint is Tokiko. Her mouth flaps at the weiderst times in both dubs. She\'s not even talking at some points. It IS Viz after all.All the characters are here. The pervert, the fat guy, the tranvestite, the love sick loser, the ditz, the tsundere, etc. They aren\'t really original, but they do their job. Plus, this is the only anime where I was pairing up characters.I did enjoy this anime and well worth the 60 bucks on both sets. I highly recommend it.Pros:- Great plot that moves fast and doesn\'t leave you hanging.- Papillon is the most vibrant character in history.Cons:- The characters are a bit stereotypical.This anime is out now by Viz Media.

The story isn't CRAZY original but how they portray it is really good so it makes up for it. One of the things that the story packs in a lot into each episode BUT it really flows. The plot twists are pretty good and there aren't many spots were things just seem too convenient, which a lot of anime tend to have. One thing that this story has that I really like is that the story has dark moments but also has good humor that lighten things somewhat.I try not to give away spoilers in reviews but This story is good so...WATCH IT!!!Art: Great animation in my opinion even though there isn't really anything that sticks out here the fight scenes are well done and character design is really good.Sound: They did really well on choosing voice actors!!! Everyone does well on voice acting which is suprising because usually there is usually at least one person that just drives you nuts with their voice but Busou Renkin does a good job of not having that.Character: Characters are great in this anime! While the two main characters have similarities to Shakugan no Shana's two main character these two aren't nearly as annoying. Both characters are genuine and make since while the supporting characters are interesting and not worthless.The only problem I had with the characters was that the supporting characters had more air time BUT with the air time they did have its awesome so its very minor just it would've been nice to have a lil more character development on themEnjoyment: I really thought this anime was awesome because there wasn't any issues that really stuck out. There weren't any &quot;too convenient&quot; parts that were just out of no where. Also, due to the voice acting being good, you didn't have to deal with annoying voices that drew you away from the anime. The fights were interesting as well plus some of the parts of the series have you smiling from hwo things work out.Overall: GREAT SERIES!!!! I just wish it would get more recognition because this is far better than shakugan no shana, which it is similar too.I def recommend this to anyone looking for a truly enjoyable anime.

Nobuhiro Watsuki has made another hit anime series and I'm telling you, if you thought Rurouni Kenshin was good then you'll love Buso Renkin. To think I just learned about this today!!!! That made this one so extremely happy. Besides getting a crap load of books and movies this weekend I also get to watch Buso Renkin, sweet sweet hunny. (GRINS) I can't wait to watch it later on this afternoon. This tale with Kazuki will leave an impression!! "", 'This isn\'t my favorite genre of anime with all it\'s magic action, but because this was like the anime that made me watch anime (I think it\'s called a bridge anime?) I thought I\'d write a short review on it. I may be biased since it brings back memories of when I first started anime, but Busou Renkin was really enjoyable for me, and I think others should give it a try. Busou Renkin is actually a show more fit for kids - teens, not so much mature adults.Story: In the world that Busou Renkin takes place, there are monsters called homonculus, and the...power of alchemy. The protagonist, Mutou Kazuki is a normal high school student whose life changes forever one night when he died (stabbed in the heart) while trying to save a mysterious girl, Tokiko from a monster (a homonculus). Feeling guilty for his death, Tokiko saves Kazuki by replacing his heart with a kakugame, an item that contains the power of alchemy. It\'s revealed that Tokiko is an alchemist warrior that works for an alchemy organization that fights off homonculus\'s in order to protect the human race. Kazuki then joins the organization as an inexperienced rookie warrior filled with potential (but sort of rejects his role), and later as he goes through suffering and lots of crazy twists, Kazumi finally accepts who he is and his destiny (He gets a lot stronger). There are lots of action scenes, but in addition to that, there\'s normal school life, lots of funny comedy, and tragic mysteries that unravel beneath the surface of everything that goes on. The story isn\'t all that great or original, it\'s just your average shounen anime, but I really did enjoy it.Art: The art isn\'t fantastic, but it\'s still good. I really really liked the portrayals of all the character, especially one of my favorite characters ever: Captain Bravo! The kakugane and the weapons that the alchemy forms were well drawn up. Art is so hard to grade...Sound: The opening song for Busou Renkin was really energetic & exiting and it really set the mood before every episode. There were lots of great soundtracks during action, and sad scenes that elevated my sense of emotion. For example, ""Hoshi Akari"". One of my favorite anime soundtracks ever, made me tear up when it played. The voicing for each character was really nice, Captain Bravo had a deep voice~! ‚ô•Character: Probably the best part of the anime was the diversity of a lot of highly enjoyable and likable characters. There were so many villains, but there really was no real bad guys. All the bad guys had a reason for their actions, they almost all have a tragic past, and there\'s just no character you can hate. I guess the main antagonist would have to be ""Koushaku Chouno"" who is one of the funniest, most-likeable villains ever. He honestly isn\'t all that evil. In fact, for most of the series he helps the main character because he doesn\'t want anyone else to defeat him; he wants to defeat Kazuki himself in a fair fight (they have a friendship developing beneath all the hatred). The good guys were all so likeably! Captain Bravo!! ‚ô• Tokikok\'s character development was unbelievable as well as Kazumi\'s. Honestly nothing to dislike about the character\'s except for maybe Chouno\'s very disturbing cloth and nature.Enjoyable: A very solid anime. I\'m going to have to re-watch it again to refresh my memory of it but I remember enjoying it so much that I decided to watch other anime. But there\'s no scary, psychological, or ""deep"" side to the anime, it\'s just pure enjoyment and comedy/action. The characters are all soooo likeable! power of alchemy.

The characters are all soooo likeable!', 'The first thing to mention, is that Busou Renkin uses terms like ""alchemy"" and ""homunculus"". I want to make this clear, Busou Renkin is not a full metal alchemist rip-off. (because that\'s what I thought it was when I read the plot summary... boy was I wrong.)Story:Busou Renkin\'s story is fairly simple ""us"" vs ""them"" goodies vs baddies. But it\'s the way it\'s executed that makes the story great. Although there are not many actual plot twists as such (there are a few good ones, though) the plot manages to keep the viewer guessing. What\'s going to happen? Who is the main villain? How will...they defeat them? All these questions are asked, and depending on which episode your at, they have totally different answers. You might be able to guess where the series is going, but it\'ll jump in leaps and bounds. What might take another series 10 episodes to do, Busou Renkin does in 3. This is a good thing, because it means there is little filler in Busou Renkin, all the battles and every episode serves to progress the plot/characters. It\'s a well-lengthed series, that really ramps up at around episode 7.Art:One thing to say on this. It\'s ""magnificent"". The battles are great, the CGI is well used, but more prominently are the character costumes. This anime has some of (if not the most) memorable characters ever... (although, those that have seen the series, sometimes wish they were not so memorable...)Sound:The intro theme in particular is one of the most catchy, hot-blooded and awesome pieces of music in anime. The in-series sound effects are good, and likewise the voice acting. I couldn\'t fault the sound at all.Character:This is where the series shines. The characters are ... well. Words simply can\'t describe them without plunging into spoilers. Let\'s just say, the characters make the series. The are unique (which is a hard thing to do in modern anime) and there are enough of them for everyone to find at least 1 character to love or hate.Enjoyment:Busou Renkin is a thoroughly enjoyable series. I could liken it to the comedic-yet-serious nature of Trigun or Kenshin, and I say it\'s one of the best.Overall:It\'s not for everyone, if you want a serious, dramatic anime, your out of luck here. But if you want a good, enjoyable, action packed, but believable anime, Busou Renkin is for you. It really must be watched, and then you can come to your own conclusions.

But since I like Bleach, I said ""why not give this a shot"". I did and I was very pleased with this anime. It can relate to Bleach and Shakugan no Shana in several ways. In Busou Renkin, you have this boy (Mutou Kazuki) who has died trying to save this girl (Tokiko) who saved him by giving him the power of this kakugane. As I predicted, he wants to save everyone with this new power and protect the ones he loves.Of course he struggles and gets stubborn at some...times but he grows stronger, not only his powers but his character too.The story stays interesting and it has a couple of plot twists but it is worth watching.

Great series overall.', 'Buso Renkin is a fun show to watch. It does have a lot of the typical shonen elements that\'s to be expected: like the main character wanting to fight fight fight all so he can fulfill the glorious role as the noble ‚Äúprotector‚Äù also there are those battles where they spend most of the time explaining how great each other\'s powers are and then of course pull that one ‚Äúmiracle move‚Äù out of their ass. I never understood the point of all that fighting and explaining. Either way Buso Renkin has a lot of this and yet nonetheless I  found it enjoyable perhaps mainly...because it could all be interpreted as making fun of itself as well as the entire Battle/Adventure genre. At times it is so damn tacky it\'s magnificent!~ ArtA little above standard as far as post millennial anime goes and as with most of these type of multi-fighter battle adventure anime you will see plenty of weapons and super-powers that  provide some incredible special f/x. With this show in particular the fights seem to be on a much larger scale with powers being a little too grand. That\'s why personally I prefer fighting shows where they have swords or use martial arts because the movements are smaller and more intricate and when animated properly, they can be ten times more amazing than this shit...i.e., Cowboy Bebop, Kenshin and Samurai Champloo just to name a few.  But some of the f/x in this show I was pretty impressed with, like most of the pyro f/x and also that one scene where like a million missiles were launched at the same time.~ SoundHonestly? Not impressed. Right off the bat I\'ll tell you I had  an issue with the English voice cast on this one. While they sound cool they do not emotionally match up with the character\'s expressions. You can pick up on this instantly from episode 1, the dude gets stabbed thru the heart and yet he sounds like he\'s surfing on a boogie board? Dude! you just got stabbed thru the [effin] heart by a giant [bleeeeep] tentacle! you should be SCREAMING like bloody murder and sputtering and choking on blood, guts and shit...not go ""whooooooaaaaa"" like you\'re Keanu Reeves! And she, the heroine Tokiko, at this point calmly and coolly says ‚ÄúThis wasn\'t supposed to happen...‚Äù WTF reacts that way, seriously? Don\'t get me wrong the VA for Tokiko has a nice smooth voice but it\'s a total miscast for her to play this role. Though sophisticated it is a little too mature for a teenage voice....and I just think her emotional range is rather limited. Same for most of the other casting, they\'re good but they lack a certain amount of that genuineness or intensity as a particular scene may have required.The OP song is this totally sped up rubbish pop-wannabe-rock music stereotypical of shonen anime; couple this with the visuals of seeing that guy, whatshisface Kazuki, running around all amped up like some crack-head doofus with all this pseudo-aggression on his face was enough for me to skip the intro altogether. Both ED songs were decent but not enough to make you want to get the soundtrack or anything.~ StoryBuso Renkin has a pretty straightforward story: guy gets imbued with super-powers, guy meets nemesis, fights nemesis, of course saves the world [which is always in peril these days] and finally [...inevitably] gets the girl, the end. Typical fare for shonen-type anime which is usually a thinly veiled excuse to get all violent and fight and demonstrate superpowers. And of course there are the beach scenes and the fan-service, but the show is also very funny...I\'ll give it that.~ CharactersThis show has a pretty large cast of characters, and they are drawn in standard anime fashion. My favorite character hands-down is the Butterfly Dude [Papillon] he is a freak!  But there are many many more for you to choose from.~ The VerdictIt\'s cute, and it has it\'s funny moments. Nothing epic but a great way to pass the time if you have nothing better to do. I would only buy this if it were on sale, otherwise Youtube or Crunchyroll. because it could all be interpreted as making fun of itself as well as the entire Battle/Adventure genre.

Same for most of the other casting, they\'re good but they lack a certain amount of that genuineness or intensity as a particular scene may have required.The OP song is this totally sped up rubbish pop-wannabe-rock music stereotypical of shonen anime; couple this with the visuals of seeing that guy, whatshisface Kazuki, running around all amped up like some crack-head doofus with all this pseudo-aggression on his face was enough for me to skip the intro altogether. Both ED songs were decent but not enough to make you want to get the soundtrack or anything.~ StoryBuso Renkin has a pretty straightforward story: guy gets imbued with super-powers, guy meets nemesis, fights nemesis, of course saves the world [which is always in peril these days] and finally [...inevitably] gets the girl, the end. Typical fare for shonen-type anime which is usually a thinly veiled excuse to get all violent and fight and demonstrate superpowers. And of course there are the beach scenes and the fan-service, but the show is also very funny...I\'ll give it that.~ CharactersThis show has a pretty large cast of characters, and they are drawn in standard anime fashion. My favorite character hands-down is the Butterfly Dude [Papillon] he is a freak!  But there are many many more for you to choose from.~ The VerdictIt\'s cute, and it has it\'s funny moments. Nothing epic but a great way to pass the time if you have nothing better to do. I would only buy this if it were on sale, otherwise Youtube or Crunchyroll.', ""My first review ^_____^I have no idea on what to expect on this anime before I watched it since I don't really know this title.Now I'm glad I watched this.The story is typical with the action genre, putting emphasis on battle scenes rather than the plot of the story.The action scenes are good, but not that extraordinary. Just what you would expect of an action-genre anime. But what I think that makes this anime unique is  the absurd comedy scenes. I just can't stop laughing while watching this.What also makes it unique is how the idea of alchemy is applied in this anime. One...that will watch this will surely enjoy it and I hope that they will enjoy it as much as I did.Mutou Kazuki and Tokiko Tsumura are good progtagonists. Mutou Kazuki symbolizes a common protagonist, someone that is weak at first and then an incident changes his life that causes him to have powers. Tokiko is also a typical heroine, someone that will eventually fall for the main character.I also liked Chouno Koushaku(my favorite character), one of the antagonists of the story. I really like how he transformed from one that is just trying to survive to being one of the best antagonist I have seen in a while (though I'm not a fan of his mask and clothes :P)Overall, the story is good. I have no problem with the plot. I also have no problem with the characters of this anime.I also liked the comedic scenes in this anime.Overall I gave it a score of 8 out of 10.

I mean I get how some newer viewers can have a jaded opinion about this anime cause they have seen a ton of similar shonen anime but if they give this a true chance they will find a great anime that had a lot of potential. This was definitely great for its time.Story:The story is pretty straight forward at first but takes an even more dangerous turn later on that really surprised me and helped me enjoy this more. It\'s not a hugely amazing story in the beginning but its one of...the better stories in shonen. My only real issue with this is that i saw SO much more potential with this series if it expanded beyond just 26 eps but oh well.Characters:Man, there were a good amount funny, charismatic and overall interesting characters for a 26 ep series. Ill focus on the two leads though. First, the male lead Kazuki has one of my favorite Male MC personality. I love how hes a really driven, determined and yet really funny MC. I know it sounds like there are a ton of him but its actually pretty rare to see an MC that has his type of charisma that pretty much influences all others. Also for Tokiko the female MC, i just like her tough personality but i liked even more how she started to become a ""defrosting ice queen"" so to speak cause of the MC. They matched each other well and are pretty much one of my favorite ""Battle couple"" teams ( im using anime ""tropes"" incase your confused).Other:Anyway, the art and animation were pretty good for its time and the action was great in many areas and overall i enjoyed this a lot. If your pretty biased against shonen manga cause you seen so much then skip this but if you enjoy older anime and can give every new series its own individual chance then id recommend this the better stories in shonen.

The show is generally deemed as a thing ""Similar to FMA"", and i can\'t for the love of my god understand why. The only thing that they have in common is the fact that alchemy exist, but they handle it in very different ways.Story: 8Not too generic, not outstanding. As far as shonen standards go, the plot is good enough to keep you watching.Art: 8Considering its time, it\'s preety good. I don\'t remember particular scenes where they fked up or did something outstanding, but it keeps up with the time. Don\'t like Papillon...artstyle doh.Sound: 10Ok, maybe i like the OP a lil\' bit too much. Anyways, OST was preety good, even if it wasn\'t too large.Character: 7Probably the worst part of the show, basically no one receives an in depth arc for them, since the show is divided in a 3 ep mini-arc, and the main arc. Papillon sometimes is annoying, and secondary characters exist just for the sake of getting beaten.Enjoyment: 10Even doh it has its flaws, i really liked Busou Renkin for what it was, a funny shonen that isn\'t neither bad or outstanding.Overall: 9 artstyle doh.Sound: 10Ok, maybe i like the OP a lil\' bit too much.

Busou Renkin was a bit more 'relaxed' which made it more enjoying to watch for sure. Although I wasn't really ecstatic about the ending, overall I have to say its an anime to watch if you like sci-fi, romance and supernatural stuff all in one =D "", 'I regret watching this, and I\'m here to save you time.I watched this because the source material comes from the creator of Rurouni Kenshin and it\'s a far cry from what I was expecting.Having not read the manga, I still can\'t help but feel this was an attempt to cash in on the alchemy craze of the early 2000s thanks to FMA. The protagonist is randomly killed and given a magical alchemical power in the first episode. He uses this power to fight enemies who want to steal more of these Buso Renkins. I\'ve basically just spoiled the entire story for you. I...find little relevance in this story that would require it to revolve around alchemy. Sure there\'s ""alchemy"" and ""homunculus"", but wheres the actual transforming of one object to another? they\'re all just empty jargons that could have been easily replaced with any other word. It all boils down to a medallion that repeatedly transforms into a specific weapon. What about the actual fights, this is what people come for right? I felt like the fights left much to be desired as well due to not being able to take the villains seriously. It feels as if comedy was of much greater importance than writing a good story or animating exciting action scenes. See the guy on the cover with the butterfly mask and the black lace skin-tight leotard? He is the main antagonist and he is just as obnoxious as he appears. In my opinion, the best fights were between the main characters and this incest duo who pretended to be married.

I guess is because I was planning to watch some cliche shounen anime, and Busou Renkin just surprised me in a very good way.I loved the anime! The story is not something very impressive or original, but in some way, it was very nice.The sound... what can I say of it?? I just loved the first ending! And the opening was great, too. The second ending... well... it's hard to describe it with words, because it's very random... It left...me with a weird feeling: I didn't know wether to laugh or stare at the computer dumbfounded. You'll understand me when you'll watch the anime.I really love the main characters! Kazuki is kawaii in my opinion, and Tokiko, at the beggining, she's somewhat scary and cold, but she changes during the story, and she becomes a very nice and smiling girl at the end, because of her love for Kazuki. The love relationship between these two it's just adorable, and it develops in a good pace.I really, really enjoyed watching this anime, and I'm very happy to gave it a chance, because I wasn't very sure to watch Busou Renkin, but now I'm relieved I started to see it. me with a weird feeling: I didn't know wether to laugh or stare at the computer dumbfounded.

Tokiko, an alchemist warrior, feels responsible and revives him by replacing his destroyed heart with a kakugane (Ê†∏ÈâÑ). The kakugane is an alchemical device which, when activated, takes a weapon form based on its user\'s...personality, forming a buso renkin‚Äîthe only thing that can destroy a homunculus. Kazuki creates his own buso renkin and joins Tokiko in the fight against the homunculi and their master, Koushaku Chouno. Chouno, who has renamed himself ""Papillon"".Sometime you don\'t need a well written story just an entertaining show to fill your time and have fun with it.I especially like the main pair with Kazuki and Tokiko, they might have just become one of my fav couples ever :)The story itself is rather interesting, the fights were done well for its time, although it can feel like it is a little outdated by today\'s standard but anyone who grew up watching similar shows from that time should find it easy enough to watch.This was also written by the same mangaka that wrote Rurouni Kenshin, so you can tell that it uses quite a few similiar features as that series but is different enough that it is not carbon copy eitherFrom what i researched, this actually got prematurely cancelled later down the road and that is why it feels kind of like it skipped a few things and plot holes but they still managed to wrap things up quite nicely. It actually developed the romance side of things smoothly unlike say naruto or most other shounen titlesI recommend it for anyone who wants just a simple story with action and comedy and a happy ending. personality, forming a buso renkin‚Äîthe only thing that can destroy a homunculus.

After he starts training with Bravo, Kazuki\'s power unreasonably skyrockets. All the anime I have seen until now will include romance , because the hero always becomes strong fastly because he wants to protect the loved one, but in this the only romance is the only part that they kiss in episode 23 end, and the part that a new male rival comes after nearly 15th episode even though he loses in winning her heart. So this is what made me give 5% romance.8% comedy + fantasySome non-lame comedy was not bad, gave me a good laugh. Fantasy is the idea of the powers and the powers strength and use.6% non exaggerated actionOnly at the starting of anime because the hero\'s power had not yet started to skyrocket.6% slice of school lifeEven though the anime is all about some homunculus and alchemy weapon, they managed to pull of some school life with the hero and heroine which was not bad.AND THE MAIN PART COMES HERE FOR WHY THE WHOLE STORY IS JUST A EXAGGERATION1.

Actually this whole story became a bullshit at episode 24.The hero takes Victor with him and lands on moon by passing through space without rupturing any body parts or blood vessels.2.

It wasn't exactly what I expected to see and I was quiet excited to watch the series at first.The idea is not bad, basicly we have Alchemic warriors who are killing human eating homonculus.Series start with the main character accidently getting involved in the fight. However, later on he gets completly dedicated to this new job.What put me off is that somehow I couldn't get into the atmosphere and half naked villian who thinks he is beautiful and keeps making weird poses, doesn't really help. Or when he keeps wearing weird outfits, even...Burger cafe workers of the show couldn't handle it. Was thinking of dropping it several times.However, at around episode 9 when twins get introduced show actually starts to pick up. It starts to involve more things and actual story seems to just start. Since then show mostly kept getting better and you start to forget about some random stuff like Papillon's weird outfits.To be true, Papillon started to become really entertaining and different. He is not like your typical villian out there, weird outfits are part of his uniqness. Also more characters gets introduced and some of them are quiet fun, twins are part of that good cast.Despite being shounen series, we actually get some decent romance development which doesn't ruin the story. Characters start to grow in strengh and emotionaly. They start to change and you become more attached to them.I actually wanted to raise my mark till 8 but decided against it because of very cheesy ending. It is not bad, but not my type... so 7 it is.Basicly if the show still doesn't interest you after episode 10 (small twin arc), series are not meant for you then.

I just wanted to input that this is an example of an anime where one can really enjoy  the process w/o being off-putted by the objective story line (as this is not unique by any means).Again your enjoyment of an anime is based off your personality/values and what nuances of a 'story' you enjoy most. for me this hit a lot on them right on, making it one of my top 3 at this point.Story/Character- I really liked this because it is a good example of 'non-remarkable' protagonist who has a good nature and wants to...help people. Probably what I liked most is the lead female character, I just really enjoyed the character dynamic shown throughout. Even the 'filler' content was very enjoyable. help people.

Even the 'filler' content was very enjoyable."", 'Busou Renkin is a shounen anime. I don\'t really like shounen, and I started (and dropped) Busou Renkin in the past. Still, I recently decided to watch it again...I would say it is pretty much Shounen done right. Characters do not throw angsty fits, do not preach mid battle, there are plenty of comedic episodes inserted into the story, and fights do not last two episodes. Animation is quite fluid, even though art style is somewhat simple. There\'s nice music, and the whole thing feels believable, or even touching at times. It is much, much, much better than I expected.Detailed breakdown below:Story - it is...fairly simple/straightforward story about a school boy getting powers, meeting a companion and then fighting enemies. However what sets it apart is light-hearted handling of many scenes, many nicely done comedic moments. I would say the story finds just the right balance between drama/fights and slice of life elements. Rather than plot devices characters look like actually believable people, and for most of the time events that happen sorta make sense. So, while the story is relatively simple, straightforward and even stereotypical, it is quite pleasant to watch.Art:Art is quite simple, however, the animation is of high quality. Even though characters have  fairly low amount of detail, they move very fluidly in most scenes. There\'s some CG that doens\'t *quite* match the 2d art, but it is tolerable enough.Sound:Music is generally nice, and opening theme is entertaining. The ending of the second half is interesting to listen to. It is not very memorable, but it works to complement the story. I would say it is slightly below the level of music in Keijo (where musical part was done perfectly.Characters:There are three or characters total that pull this anime through and make it memorable. Those are Tokiko, protagonist\'s sister Mahiro and one of the initial bad guys (with very interesting fashion sense). Tokiko is just plain adorable at times, and rather easy to sympathize with. As far as I can tell, she is supposed to be an archetype, but in the end rather than archetype she looks like a person, plus seiyuu did a great job voicing her. The second important character was mahiro, who mostly works as comedic relief, and even though does not really have much of a character on her own, she does a great job adding comedy when she arrives. And then there\'s bad guy with strange fashion sense....In comparison to strong female lead, protagonist himself is rather generic ""shounen good guy protagonist"". Thankfully he isn\'t spineless, isn\'t perverted, doesn\'t preach too much, isn\'t prone for fits of angst, so for this kind of anime the character works quite well. However he is not very memorable by himself.Enjoyment:I liked first half a bit more, since it had more of light-hearted episodes. The 2nd half for a while looked like it is about to devolve into standard cliched anime with drawn out fight, but it narrowly dodged it. Overall first 12 episodes were definitely more interesting for me.Overall:It is interesting to watch, mostly because of female lead and light comedy that often pops up across the series. The art is a bit low on detail, but it is compensated with very fluid animations, which makes the whole thing much more entertaining. Decent music, great voice acting on main heroine, and even though it is fairly cliched, the story was not boring.I\'d recommend to check it out, if you have the time. fairly simple/straightforward story about a school boy getting powers, meeting a companion and then fighting enemies.

Giant weapon in one hand, power that literally suffocates, disturbing egotistical villain, and don\'t forget the sweet and sour girl with short hair. It is a bit like Bleach met DBZ and they compromised on the level of seriousness with a pinch of that ""no need for unnecessary fights"" you get from some protagonists. Maybe not a must see, but definitely a should see. ', ""Whoever said this show was your typical shounen experience couldn't be further from wrong.Sure this show is based on things that make up a typical shounen anime, but if you actually watched the entire show, and noticed the depth of the messages they were trying to send, you'd see.Everything about this show is simply beautiful. It doesn't try to hard to make it too gushy, and as the plot develops, as the show goes on, it just gets better and better.I really liked how well done they portrayed the romance in these shows. It gives you a sort of feel that other media fails to...achieve.The main antagonist in particular is a guy who you can't help but like, even tho he's an antagonist, and it's just--tbh, I can't explain it.

In my opinion from watching previous animes, it needs a bit more work. The only problem with most peoples reviews when others have looked into the anime is what other animes compare to that anime that was just watched. There are other animes just like this one currently, it may have nothing to do with the alchemy or the monsters in which they were facing up against but I have seen the reviews of others and I just plainly don't care for either of them. They tell you...about the anime, if you want to know what it's primarily about, all you have to do is read the introduction next to where it explains what the entire anime is about. However, people want to know what other animes are similar to this sword/ weapon experience. There are numerous of animes, you have FMA, Full Metal Alchemist, You also have this one which is Busou Renkin. You have Sword Art Online. Sword Art Online is a personal favorite because the primary character logs into this Virtual World and is forced to stay there against his will and must fight for his life to get out. Very good anime in my personal Opinion and as sad as it sounds, it's much better than Busou Renkin is every single aspect. about the anime, if you want to know what it's primarily about, all you have to do is read the introduction next to where it explains what the entire anime is about.

It's a solid action show that's well worth watching.Busou Renkin kind of reminds me of the first season or two of Bleach before it became BleachBall Z, if you get what I'm saying.It had some solid theme songs too.If you haven't seen this one yet get to it, you won't regret it. "", 'Intro to the Review: (skip 2 paragraphs to get into the review)After reading some of the reviews for this anime, I am somewhat surprised that many express the same thoughts: ""this anime was generic as heck, but I still love the darn anime and give it an 8 or higher!""For me, this anime should not receive anything higher than a 6 because it does not bring anything new to the table of overused concepts and cliches. Most, if not all anime, share some of the same concepts, but exceptionally good ones bring a twist to them that make it enjoyable. For this anime, not...so much. However, I think those who like the anime might be due to the guy in the butterfly mask (in the anime cover picture), known as Papillon or Chouno in the anime. For more info on that, gloss over to my Character and Art portion. In the review below, I\'ll explain why this anime is ""mediocre"" and not ""very good"".Story:It\'s pretty much like Bleach. Mysterious girl meets boy who saves her...girl gives guy immense power and later you get to meet the organization that she works for. What\'s different in this anime is that the organization is not as established as the one in Bleach. Instead of meeting a few of them little by little, you meet chunks of them in an episode, giving you time to barely care about them. You barely know about it and the rest of its members until more than halfway through the anime. And then there\'s the Kakugane (what every alchemist warrior in this show has) that has the ability to transform into a powerful weapon. What is so annoying about this is how the kakugane makes so much BS in the show and yet it is given the least explanation and care about it. But of course, how is our main protagonist going to power up if we can\'t add some random superpowers along the way? The comedy was stale, the fight scenes were somewhat boring, and there was less and less suspense as the show progressed.Sound:The first ED was the main reason why I wanted to watch this series. The song had a beautiful and sad melody to it and it felt poignant to me. This music didn\'t fit in with 95% of the anime, which was mainly filled with corny jokes, generic fight scenes, and nakama moments. The second ED and OP were cheesy, so it went with the anime. The OST in the anime is pretty much your typical shounen fight scene music.Art:The animation was consistent throughout the show; not noteworthy, but not poorly done a majority of the time. The setting in the beginning of the anime is in a generic school scene. What does make this anime memorable to most who have seen this anime would be the character design, most notably Papillon. Shown in the poster of this page, he is not your typical antagonist (at least in the fashion sense). His flamboyant attire is the only thing he\'s got going in terms of ""uniqueness"" and it overshadows the rest of the characters.Character:Speaking of characters, let\'s start off with Papillion since that\'s what the show ever cares about (he even has the entire second ED to himself). At first, I thought he\'d have a major impact in the story, but he\'s just there ...to be there in all of his bizarre glory. I swear that whoever made this story up made a character as flamboyant as he was just to hide the fact that the story is lackluster and offers nothing new in the shounen category. If you have seen HxH, he might remind you of Hisoka, an antagonist of a story whom several anime watchers might like because of his eccentric attitude, attire, personality, and strength. To me, Papillon gave me the feeling of, ""Oh, it\'s you again"" (kinda like Team Rocket) every time he appeared on the screen. I just feel like he is more like a moth than a butterfly...always flying over your head, making sure you don\'t forget about him. His personality and reason for going against the MC is so lame that sometimes you think the author just threw on a butterfly suit on him just to make him more appealing as a villain. If you pay attention enough, he\'ll say hypocrite whenever he appears.All you need to know about the MC, Muto, is that he is the perfect mold of a shounen character: he\'s got the hair, the ""I gotta save the world without getting anyone killed"" catchphrase, the power to overpower anyone that overpowered him before in less than a month, and the ability to easily overcome life and death situations every time. You can\'t hate this guy as the MC, right? Right? One thing I do like about him is that he doesn\'t have a sad past like the common shounen character.Then there\'s Tokiko, the blue-haired girl with a scar across her face. She\'s a stern and serious girl, but she\'s also very caring inside. I do give her credit though for being able to hold up in most of the fights she\'s been in, despite the fact that Muto has been doing the heavy lifting a majority of the anime. That\'s pretty much it about her. The rest of the characters felt so generic, forgettable, and disposable, that you get expected responses from Tokiko and Muto and you probably won\'t remember their names while watching the show. Like I said before, a chunk of characters get shoved in one episode and over a span of some episodes, making you go ""meh"" every time they show up on the screen. There\'s really nothing exciting about the characters.Enjoyment:What was there to enjoy in this anime? The characters were boring and annoying, the comedy was cheesy and short-lived, and the battle animation was sub par. Just because it adhered to the typical shounen genre with the flashy battle scenes and added in some weird characters that didn\'t really belong in this show, I didn\'t enjoy it at all. It didn\'t excite me enough to want to continue to the next episode.Overall, the story, it\'s characters, and the art didn\'t captivate me. Things that annoyed me the most were the lack of good storytelling, disposable side characters who waste precious screentime and an ordinary MC who preaches the same thing, and convenient power ups that feel like a cheat to a game. so much.

This anime seems to have quite a fair bit of drama, depressing tones and reality behind it. The anime from start to finish had a good going of emotional scenes which captivated me to watch this series in a few days, despite my busy schedule. Anyways, the way Kazuki changed the people and environment around him was...excellently scripted, in my opinion. This is one of the best fighting/adventure animes I\'ve watched, with regard to the amount of fighting and emotional scenes balanced. And for me, there are no story ""holes"".Art:8The colour is quite dull and lacklustre, but all the action scenes all quite well done.Sound: 9Good, especially the bgm played during emotional scenes.Character: 10Arguably the best ""selfless character"" I\'ve seen been constant, from start to finish.

It is a very standard enemy-of-the-week arc-based super hero show, notable mostly for its superb OP (Makka Na Chikai) and some very amusing characters (Papillon).However, if you want one of these sorts of shows and don't want a massive time sink, it's worth looking into. It's only 26 episodes and has a standard two-arc plot - a first villain who was NOT THE REAL VILLAIN and a power up etc etc.Some of the supervillains and superheroes have creative abilities, often underused (like the 3 guys who form a Getter Robo/Macross homage) and some get the...short end of the stick (the girl whose power is atmosphere manipulation, for example). The fights, the bread-and-butter of the series after all, are exciting (even if the final confrontations are a little anticlimactic) and don't rely too much on sword clashes followed by dramatic shouting. There's some good fight choreography, even if the villains are very much set up to be in a league above the sidekicks.However, as a straight character comedy/action show it is very enjoyable despite the plot not being anything special. The dub is not bad at all, either. Well worth giving a shot if you want something funny, exciting and formulaic. short end of the stick (the girl whose power is atmosphere manipulation, for example).

Upon investigation, he sees a fantastic serpent-like creature stalking a schoolgirl.  In the moment that the monster strikes, Kazuki leaps in and knocks the girl aside, saving her life but also dying instantly as the serpent\'s spined tail pierces his heart.The next thing Kazuki knows is that he has gained consciousness atop the school building, where the mysterious schoolgirl, Tokiko, has brought him...back to life by joining his life force to the power of a mystical artifact known as a Kakugane.  Tokiko is an achemist warrior, protecting the world from the cannibalistic creatures known as Homunculi by using the powers of her Kakugane weapon, and Kazuki has just been drawn into her fight.  The world of alchemy and the continuous battle between alchemist warriors and homunculi is now Kazuki\'s world as well.This anime strikes a good balance between lighthearted humor and more serious themes as Kazuki balances his new life as an alchemist warrior with the everyday concerns of education and dorm life.  The pacing of the story is quite good and has both action and drama throughout.  There seem to be two main story arcs in this anime, the first being the extermination of the LXE, the evil League of Extraordinary Elites, and the second arc concerning the rise of the being known as Victor and the struggle to bring him down.  Other minor themes are woven into the mix as well, including the developing relationship between Kazuki and Tokiko, Kazuki\'s training within the Alchemist Army, and Kazuki\'s interaction with his nemesis, the fabulous mastermind Papillon.There is a fair amount of objectionable content in this anime; I would give it about a PG-13 rating.  Most notable is the violence, of which there is quite a lot, with limbs being sliced off and blood (red and other colors) splattering around everywhere during battle scenes.  Generally the only fatalities during these battles are the monsters, however, and no grievous injuries are sustained by human characters due to the regenerative powers of the Kakugane weapons which heal even extraordinary wounds fairly quickly.  From what I can tell, there is a bit of language in the Japanese version with subtitles, nothing major really and such language is not frequent at all.  In the English dub, most of the profanity has been replaced with less objectionable language.As in most anime, there are a few bath scenes and a character does have his clothes vaporized in one battle scene, leaving his immortal body inact.  During these scenes, however, nothing much is ever shown; in the bath scene, for example, everyone is in the bath, or fog covers all the naughty bits, etc.  There is a bit of sexual innuendo at places however; at one point all the guys compare the relative sizes of their manhood while in the bath, resulting in general despair and disillusionment.  One of the diabolical characters, Papillon, a male homunculus, wears a rather revealing leotard-like uniform and a mask (which leads other characters to refer to him as a ""masked pervert"").  At other times, Papillon wears only a thong or a rather awful suspender-type swimsuit (keep in mind this is a male character).  Given Papillon\'s obsession with Kazuki (although not in a romantic manner), his flair for melodrama, and his ""fabulous"" sense of style and taste in clothing, it is implied that he may be gay, though such an assertion is never explicitly declared.  There is very little female fanservice in this anime (if any).  Refreshingly, this is not a ""harem""-style anime where tons of girls are all interested in the main character.What really makes this anime shine is the interesting characters; some of them are kinda stereotypical, but there are also some that are a little different from the usual.  I really like Tokiko\'s cool, mature, level-headed vibe.  Then there is the ultra-macho Captain Bravo, who never introduces himself by his real name because ""it\'s just cooler that way.""  Kazuki Muto is kind of a cookie-cutter hero-type who will sacrifice himself for others and ""wants to get stronger,"" but he is still a likeable enough character despite being generic.  My personal favorite is Kazuki\'s nemesis Papillon, a diabolical genius student dying of a rare disease who seeks the power of alchemy in order to gain immortality.  Papillon\'s transformation from an unsightly caterpillar to devious butterfly master is quite entertaining and Pappy\'s violent and flamboyant personality makes things interesting.All in all, this is a well-balanced anime with interesting characters and a decent storyline.  If you like anime with lots of action, cool powers, and not too much ecchi content, this anime might be for you.  Also, it has a happy ending.  I give this anime a hearty thumbs up. back to life by joining his life force to the power of a mystical artifact known as a Kakugane.

From what I can tell, there is a bit of language in the Japanese version with subtitles, nothing major really and such language is not frequent at all.  In the English dub, most of the profanity has been replaced with less objectionable language.As in most anime, there are a few bath scenes and a character does have his clothes vaporized in one battle scene, leaving his immortal body inact.  During these scenes, however, nothing much is ever shown; in the bath scene, for example, everyone is in the bath, or fog covers all the naughty bits, etc.  There is a bit of sexual innuendo at places however; at one point all the guys compare the relative sizes of their manhood while in the bath, resulting in general despair and disillusionment.  One of the diabolical characters, Papillon, a male homunculus, wears a rather revealing leotard-like uniform and a mask (which leads other characters to refer to him as a ""masked pervert"").  At other times, Papillon wears only a thong or a rather awful suspender-type swimsuit (keep in mind this is a male character).  Given Papillon\'s obsession with Kazuki (although not in a romantic manner), his flair for melodrama, and his ""fabulous"" sense of style and taste in clothing, it is implied that he may be gay, though such an assertion is never explicitly declared.  There is very little female fanservice in this anime (if any).  Refreshingly, this is not a ""harem""-style anime where tons of girls are all interested in the main character.What really makes this anime shine is the interesting characters; some of them are kinda stereotypical, but there are also some that are a little different from the usual.  I really like Tokiko\'s cool, mature, level-headed vibe.  Then there is the ultra-macho Captain Bravo, who never introduces himself by his real name because ""it\'s just cooler that way.""  Kazuki Muto is kind of a cookie-cutter hero-type who will sacrifice himself for others and ""wants to get stronger,"" but he is still a likeable enough character despite being generic.  My personal favorite is Kazuki\'s nemesis Papillon, a diabolical genius student dying of a rare disease who seeks the power of alchemy in order to gain immortality.  Papillon\'s transformation from an unsightly caterpillar to devious butterfly master is quite entertaining and Pappy\'s violent and flamboyant personality makes things interesting.All in all, this is a well-balanced anime with interesting characters and a decent storyline.  If you like anime with lots of action, cool powers, and not too much ecchi content, this anime might be for you.  Also, it has a happy ending.  I give this anime a hearty thumbs up.', ""This anime is shonen, first and foremost, and any and all judgement you pass upon it should be made while taking this genre into account.People here won't behave logically.Everyone will shout out their lame move names right before launching them.Laws of physics apply as long as it's convenient for the story, and the next episode they go in absolute reverse.SFX are shitty power-rangers tier ka-shangs and booms.main characters are glorified for no reason.no one with more screen-time than 15 minutes will die, and MC will do his worst to save lives of his enemies and other shonen shit.all military formations in the world...(including the alchemical army, which should be doing this shit on daily basis) are painfully inefficient, incompetent, and overall a bunch of SJW protesting for their gender rights has more destructive power.The only unique quirk this anime has is that the main antagonist is a psychotic gay butterfly lover who just wants to be acknowledged by his peers and family. sigh.Well, despite all this, I did enjoy this anime. If you have a craving for shonen, and have already run out of all your good shonens, this'll do the job. Definitely second class though.

Papillon. He is one of the most interesting villains I have ever seen, and one of my personal favourite anime characters. He's a supervillain that's so sick he could cough up a lung any second while making his evil diabolical speeches. He is absolutely fantastic.Seriously, it is worth seeing this whole series JUST for him. Take him away, and you still got a pretty decent shonen battle anime. "", ""Busou Renkin is in essence a typical shounen Anime, it starts with the protagonist being given a special ability and takes it upon himself to save the entire world, being shounen it is a fun show to watch that never delves too deep into any drama.Art/AnimattionThe overall look was well fitting for the series, every character was drawn well and because everyone had a different weapon their attacks had to be animated differintely, the animation was pretty good and did make use of a few still shots during a fight now and again.SoundThe music used is good but it isn't great, the opening is a...decent rock song and the music used during battles helps keep things going by adding tension or excitment, the sound effects are all ok, they make good uses of the sound of walls being destroyed and the waves in the ocean. Voice actors are all well cast, now i'm talking about the English dub because i never watch the Japanese version, the one's that stood out for me were Papillon, Moonface and Captain Bravo, these three stole the spotlight when on screen with their unique voices.CharactersKazaki Mutou the main protagonist is a very bland shounen character in my opinion, at the start he is given a speical power and decides he wants to use it to save everyone with zero sacrifices and this can get annoying but you will grow to like this guy, Tokiko is our second protagonist who can go from fighting mercilessly to getting embarresed when wearing a swin suit. Papillon is a unique antagonist in that he is very camp in the way he acts and dresses, he also has a Gauron type obsession with Kazuki. All the other mini antagonist and good guys all were unique people who you can never get bored of, and the main characters friends were all fun and added a comic effect at times.OverallBusou Renkin is an enjoyable shounen action series with a little romance added in there, it's sure to keep you interested with its wide range of original characters out main guy has to defeat or work with and is sure to please any fan of the genre. decent rock song and the music used during battles helps keep things going by adding tension or excitment, the sound effects are all ok, they make good uses of the sound of walls being destroyed and the waves in the ocean.

Well it's not THAT bad, it just felt like one of those typical anikes thats out there just to support the anime comunity.The story is a lot like FML, there are a few elements of alchamey that  Buso Renkin does a bit diffrent, but it was about alchamey and i think my love for FML completly drowned the feel and effect of Buso Renkin. The characters are ok, I did enjoy the female character, I thought she was pretty bad***. Her relashionship with the leading male was good and clean, but it was...like all those other guy and girl anime relashionship which also makes this even more unoriginal.

The manga gave me such nostalgic feel I had to add this 26 episode show to my watchlist. It may be alittle silly especially with anime nowadays, but as someone who enjoys classic anime (back when anime was in parts, dvds, or cable tv), this brought me back to a time where I where I genuinely enjoyed Shonen work.When they first mentioned alchemy, I couldn't get FMA out of my head, but a great story otherwise. I really enjoyed the unique style of weapons...that came into play and how they were used to defeat each opponent. They did change some scenes from the manga, but you wouldn't be able to tell unless you read it first.Regardless I still feel like they wrapped up the show quite nicely and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a classic Shonen feel and to those who want a nice wrapped up anime to watch on their free time. that came into play and how they were used to defeat each opponent.

It has a heroic- high school age protagonist, a large cast of fun characters with extraordinary abilities, it has interesting villains, it will include moments of laughter and moments of tragedy, and it has epic fight scenes.Buso Renkin is also written by the  author of the highly acclaimed series, Rurouni Kenshin. Buso Renkin is an all around passable anime. It isnt particularly great in any regard, but it doesnt have any glaring flaws. There are a few aspects about it that...make is refreshing compared to many of the other shounen battle anime.The anime is 26 episodes. No filler arcs, no slow paced episodes, it doesnt require you to watch hundreds of episodes, its tells a concise story in 26 episodes. If you dont like shounen battle anime because they are so long, this might be the shonen for you!Its main female character who supports the lead is an awesome character. She is strong, intelligent, has an intriguing origin, and is an all around bad-ass character. Shounen anime dont always offer the most compelling female leads, but Buso Renkin does.A simple aspect that you think would be standard, but it really isnt met in the shounen battle genre. There is a romance involving the main characters, the romance has an impact on the characters, and the romance actually progresses. Again, its not a romance anime, but having a little romance actually present during the main storyline is a refreshing aspects of Buso Renkin for me personally.I watched it on a whim due to my love for the classic shounen battle experience, and I was pleasantly suprised. The storyline has some interesting parts, I would almost compare it to Full metal Alchemist in some ways.Buso Renkin is a solid battle shounen, nothing more, nothing less.

Me too. This was not my first anime, but it /is/ the first series I ever watched from beginning to end, and as such it holds a special place in my heart. That was my disclaimer to let you know that I'm reviewing one of my favorite series, and while I tried to mitigate it, there may still be some inherent bias found within. Busou Renkin is a fairly unimpressive production, but was the first anime that fully captivated me with its entertaining characters, exciting battles, and easygoing attitude.Busou Renkin's animation is about par for the course for 2005. That is...to say: the visuals are probably its weakest element. Some of Watsuki's character designs are fun and original, but a good few are just uninspired or bland. The animation can range from bad to pretty good, but it's never really great. Characters are semi regularly off model, and there are budget shots abound, but also infrequent creative direction that really takes advantage of the digital medium. Conspicuous CG is present in most episodes, and while it doesn't look great, it isn't overly obtrusive.Much like Dragon Ball, this is one of those series I can only watch in English, just because the voices are so ingrained into my memory and experience of it. That said, it's a pretty middle of the road dub. The lead roles are cheesy yet fun, but many side characters are dismally devoid of emotion in their delivery. I've only tried to watch a few episodes in Japanese, but I'm sure it's just as good if not better!I simply adore the soundtrack, but that may be reinforced by my love for the series. I don't think it does anything bold or surprising, but it serves its purpose nonetheless. The tracks range from light and whimsical, to atmospheric and mysterious, to grand, powerful orchestral pieces. The opening, Makka na Chikai, is a classic to me, with its squealing guitars and overwhelmingly hot blooded shounen attitude. The first ending theme is sweet, sappy, and stuck in my head, while the second is dark and fabulously groovy.The characters are where Busou Renkin really shines, and are the reason why I love it so much. While none of them are terribly deep or complex, their strength lies in their simplicity and relationships. Many fit typical shounen archetypes, and most of them don't have much depth, but the easily understandable dynamics between them are delightful to watch.Kazuki's friends that are entirely separated from the battles are always a hoot, and give me the warm fuzzy feelings in their moments of sincerity. Papillon is a wonderfully developed rival for Kazuki, against whom the romantic rival Gota pales. A few important opponents have actual back stories, but for the most part enemy characters simply are their special powers. There are more characters still that I would like to detail (Bravo!), but let's keep this review rolling.If you're looking for a compelling, nuanced narrative, you probably won't find it here. Many twists, turns, and character actions are cliche and predictable, but I still have fun going along for the ride every time. Of course all the enemies become allies, and nobody really dies when they're defeated, so as long as you can forgive standardized shounen tropes like these you'll be fine. It risks an atypical narrative style in the final episodes, which makes it feel a bit slow, but this may just be the anime adaptation. For as much as I love this series, I still haven't read the whole manga, which I'm pretty ashamed of.So who should watch Busou Renkin?

From the second half, the anime takes a slightly different path and the end is also not so certain.In other words, the story is mainly about struggles with one or the other little enlightenment.The actual ending and final battle was really flat.Animation / pictures:The animations were anything but the yellow of the egg. It was mainly still image animations, which caused the dynamics to shrink to almost 0%. In some scenes, however, they tried to animation more smoothly, but these were completely rare.I have to give a plus point to the environment, they made it quite pleasant and did not neglect it.Characters:The characters also presented themselves quite sympathetically.The protagonist looked like the usual 0815 number, which he was in the end. He was a thick skull who just kept going through the day with his ""I want to protect everyone"" talk. His personality, on the other hand, left enough room for development and humor, because apart from his monotonous approaches, he also had other likeable qualities. For example, the protagonist was not particularly stupid and could land a pretty good gag sometimes.The female protagonist was less likeable , but she wasn\'t annoying, she was rather dominant. Fortunately, she had no characteristics of the usual female protagonists.There were almost all different roles among the supporting characters, luckily they were also given a suitable character design and none of them in the foreground, let alone annoyingly implemented.And of course there was also the butterfly Darling, which was definitely the most personable character of the entire series. His personality, ambitions, design and his way of articulating himself, everything has made him special.Unfortunately, much of the characters in this work, something like a depth of character. They responded very quickly and gave them hardly any real screen time, which was sacrificed for the long struggles.Music:The intro by Busou Renkin had a very special style of singing, which means that I can by no means call this style depleted. The text and the picture were also not bad and the intro had even better animations than the anime itself.The first outro left a lot to be desired and was now nothing special.

If you‚Äôre interested in a fast-paced  fantasy anime with cool magical fighting scenes and a hint of romance then this one‚Äôs for you.Story 9/10The setting is the ancient, magical realm of Chinese folklore. I‚Äôm not Chinese so this is how it came across to me. The story started strong with the main character (Orchid) already coincidentally meeting the villain-protagonist of the show (The Demon Lord) on the first episode. Since each episode is only 15 minutes long, every episode is packed with progress and...would want you to watch the next episode right away. It also delicately showed the beauty of Chinese folklore so if you‚Äôre a person interested in a country‚Äôs culture, then this one is for you.Characters 7.5/10I wouldn‚Äôt say they were perfect especially Orchid‚Äîshe might be a little too loud and annoying for you BUT that added to the comedic relief you will see in the entire show. There were a lot of other really strong characters you will see with depth so you‚Äôd definitely enjoy seeing them being played out in the anime.Graphics 10/10I can‚Äôt take my eyes off the scenes where they do spells and the other magical stuff, because it was so beautiful! Very characteristic of Chinese animes. The backgrounds change into elaborate patterns whenever a character shows their power! I love it a lot. You hardly see anything like this in Japanese anime! This is definitely my favorite element in the whole entire show.Overall 9/10I would recommend it to people who want to watch something to pass the time and just enjoy. Nothing too cerebral about this show and that makes it enjoyable to watch when you want to relax and see a good anime. Also, it makes me want to learn a little bit of Chinese because it sounded fascinating. I suggest you give this anime a try ‚ô•Ô∏èAlso, there‚Äôs a Chinese live action for it so if you‚Äôre interested, just check Love Between Fairy and Devil on Kissasian.

Very characteristic of Chinese animes. The backgrounds change into elaborate patterns whenever a character shows their power! I love it a lot. You hardly see anything like this in Japanese anime! This is definitely my favorite element in the whole entire show.Overall 9/10I would recommend it to people who want to watch something to pass the time and just enjoy. Nothing too cerebral about this show and that makes it enjoyable to watch when you want to relax and see a good anime. Also, it makes me want to learn a little bit of Chinese because it sounded fascinating. I suggest you give this anime a try ‚ô•Ô∏èAlso, there‚Äôs a Chinese live action for it so if you‚Äôre interested, just check Love Between Fairy and Devil on Kissasian. I‚Äôm currently watching it and I keep on squealing at the romantic scenes üò≥‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÇ', ""So far, it is actually good. Episodes are short, so the plot seemed a bit rushed in the beginning. It does become clear though, and the progression is done at a good pace. I don't think I've seen this particular storyline used before, so it is nice seeing something new. Side characters have depth that is actually interesting. The animation is nice with detailed character designs. The interactions between the two MCs become comedic and they begin 'rubbing' off on each other. You can tell that their personalities are beginning to change due to their different lifestyles. Overall, it's definitely worth the watch. ""]"

But it's not really a special episode more than it is a cut-and-paste from the existing episodes. It makes sense as a pilot episode, however, and as an introductory it is very good.

"", ""Detroit Metal City: Birth of the Metal Devil is a good introductory episode for Detroit Metal City, it features a good opening to show the viewer what it is all about whilst introducing the characters and the overall taste of the anime. For those that have already seen the anime then it wouldn't be much of a loss to dismiss this as it's just showing parts throughout the show, for new viewers I wouldn't be worried about being spoiled some of the best parts as it doesn't give away too much.

Doraemon Movie 29: Shin Nobita no Uchuu Kaitakushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6930/Doraemon_Movie_29__Shin_Nobita_no_Uchuu_Kaitakushi,"['My overall take: Was not a big fan of the original, but the changes here largely fell flat.This is a remake of The Records of Nobita, Spaceblazer (1981), in which Nobita and Doraemon meet the pioneering settlers of a distant planet and protect them from an evil corporation that wants to mine the planet\'s resources. As with the other early movies to come out of the 2005 Doraemon anime reboot, this is a very visually interesting movie that experiments a lot with the art and animation style. Although the general story remains the same as the original, there are also some substantial changes to the...plot. I liked that in this version, Doraemon offers a reasonable-sounding solution to Nobita\'s request to provide a new vacant lot for him and his friends to play in, instead of the bizarre ""solution"" he comes up with in the original (which is to bring out a miniature baseball field so the kids can watch miniature figurines play baseball... potentially interesting, but not quite what they asked for).Besides that, however, I thought most of the other narrative changes fell flat. The biggest alteration is the addition of an entirely new character, Morina, who goes through her own subplot that turns out to be critical to the final resolution of the movie. Unfortunately, despite having a tragic backstory, she doesn\'t come across as particularly sympathetic or involved with the main plot for most of the film. As a result, I didn\'t find her story arc very engaging, especially in contrast to the resolution of the original movie, which made elegant use of a gadget (the Time Cloth) that had been set up earlier in the story. So even though I\'m not crazy about the 1981 film, I still recommend it strongly over this version. For whatever faults it might have, it at least tells a more cohesive story than the remake. plot.

To make it more fun, the show decides the main bulk of the plot should take place in one empty room.

But rather than indulging in standard power fantasy tropes against forgetable villains, this anime takes a slightly different approach.Our MC, while previously all-powerful, is now severely nerfed due to the significant lack of mana in this world, but despite that he remains more powerful than the average person when he does use it.

Yet another series where the show tries to act edgy and then becomes the most generic crime/mystery/thriller. What did I expect from the same author as Durarara? Terrible CGI that litters the scene, blatant fanservice to bait the viewers in, and a reverse-isekai protagonist that somehow goes absolutely nowhere, this show has nothing of value.Somehow, I\'m supposed to care about a ""converging storylines"" plot revolving around the most revoltingly cringeworthy characters in the world. Let\'s not just talk about Polka himself, but the other characters. Everyone is a scumbag. Look no further than the criminal broker, Kuraki. She gives...out a job to kill Polka and ""somehow, her sins are absolved"" as she gives Polka a free place to stay in exchange for her not disclosing the people who hired the hit on Polka. That\'s real sound logic, I\'m sure. Did you know that because Kuraki was like, totally annoyed by the client\'s attitude that the crime of brokering hits on random high school students is completely justified and she\'s actually a good guy? And Polka\'s original body was like ""Yeah I forgive you too,"" to really hammer the point in case you don\'t know who the good people are. The narrative constructs itself around the fact that all of the hitmen and criminal intermediaries are ""the good guys."" Yeah, I don\'t know about that. I\'m all for multi-faceted characters that end up being criminals, like Monster or Attack on Titan. But...this show doesn\'t show any psychoanalysis, discussion of morality, or even shed people in a bad light. It\'s literally just that these characters happened to be criminals but otherwise are good people. Haha, look at them, they\'re happy-go-lucky. Apparently, it\'s not a cut-throat business and it\'s all fun and games. The only time they act seriously is when they are killing other people, but even then, it feels like the story is forcing the narrative that they\'re holier than thou when fighting other people. Well, because it has to. They\'re the side characters of the main protagonist, Polka. It\'s disgustingly cringe.  It\'s much worse than mindless edgy killing shows for how contradictary the characters are.Well, let\'s discuss Polka himself. Apparently, he has ""gray"" morals. No he fucking doesn\'t. What a lie. A person with gray morals would be someone like Kugane Muruyama from Overlord, or even Yogiri from Instant Death. These characters are consistent as how they live clearly shows their indifference towards life or their twisted value system that they arbitrarily come up with. No, Polka\'s just a convenient protagonist that seemingly is edgy, but in reality, very shounen and has goodwill. This is fine if this was the goal of the story, but somehow, the show pretends that Polka\'s a ""bad guy"" or at the very least, someone with gray morals that\'s dangerous. No, he\'s basically just a psychopath. He starts a complete massacre in his former world, killing who knows how many millions of people, and then somehow wants to live his new life ""peacefully."" Basically, he just changes his personality completely to become a good person. Now, this isn\'t how the anime describes Polka, but that\'s because the anime has the most inconsistent writing and characters in the world. There would have been exciting discourse of Polka\'s reincarnation into a human person and the intertwining of souls causes Polka to regain his humanity, or at the very least, clash with his lich/necromancer soul and bring in some sort of motifs into the show. But no, of course not. Why don\'t we just shove some tits in your face and a generic psycho-girl that\'s obsessed with him instead? Wow, peak comedy and story guys!!Ugh. Please, for the love of god. If you want to include edgy elements, actually follow through. Don\'t masquerade gang violence with cringe slice-of-life scenes as if that\'s the reality of things.

If You get that reference we can be friends.A powerful necromancer called the ‚ÄúCorpse God‚Äù, who transcended his humanity is defeated in combat. Before his demise he casts a spell that allows him to reincarnate to have a peaceful life. Well‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt work exactly as planned. He got thrusted into the freshly dead body of a 16 year old boy in today's japan. Thanks to a series of not so fortunate events he gets entangled with people from the underground. Despite being in a different...world he still wants to find a way to live a peaceful life. Despite his goal, life has a strange way of keeping him on his toes.To be fair it is a part one of the seasons and it kinda feels like it. All the episodes function more like a prelude and world building than anything else. Unfortunately it works to the detriment of the 12 episodes.But let‚Äôs start with the main cast.Corpse God - our main protagonist. In his former life he was hunted as an evil calamity and slain as such. Despite that it does appear he had some pretty good reasons to be a dick the people he killed. To no one's surprise he has a tragic backstory because‚Ä¶ of course he does. Tragic backstories to MCs nowadays are a dime a dozen in manga and anime so I‚Äôm not even gonna pretend it‚Äôs interesting because it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs the same generic shit You saw a million times‚Ä¶ but with a skeleton. So I guess You haven‚Äôt seen this iteration all that often. Still boring. Despite being in a new world he‚Äôs tragically passive. Yes, he has a goal and even starts a business but most of the things that happen to him happen ‚Äúto him‚Äù and not ‚Äúbecause of him‚Äù which leaves him as a reactionary hero. Something I truly despise. He has no personality to speak of and, to my surprise, the show acknowledges that in the last episode and even gives a half assed excuse for it. It is more that most shows give about the lack of personality so i guess it‚Äôs a plus. As he is now he is another nerfed but still pretty OP, boring protagonist with no personality. A pretty good premise turned lacklustre execution.Polka Shinoyama - the 16 year old boy who got killed and whose body is now inhabited by the Corpse God. Not much is known about him except he is an heir of a rich family, has more empathy than brain and is kind. His soul now inhabits a shark plushie, something he doesn‚Äôt seem to mind in the least. To be fair in the grand scheme of things he‚Äôs just a useless mascot who gets himself in ecchi situations once in a while.Misaki Sakimiya - The girl who killed Polka. She‚Äôs a hired gun with a reputation of putting down other killers. She seems to be emotionally unstable and detached from reality. To be fair in the beginning, both in her design and character she seemed to me like an amalgamation of Junko Enoshima and Toko Fukawa from Danganronpa. Not a bad place to start and her character does go in a bit of a different route than those two. After getting killed, mostly by accident, by the Corpse God, she gets resurrected as a zombie. Something she‚Äôs perfectly ok with and even has some fun with her new skills. She is tragically underutilised in this show as she‚Äôs the best part of the main coterie.Takumi Kuruya - an information broker who uses his drones and hacking skills to keep tabs on important things. Despite being suspicious of the Corpse God in the beginning he warms up to him rather quickly. He even helps with his fortune telling business venture. Not a very original character and as such is pretty much forgettable.Now that we have the coterie out of the way, let's talk about writing.It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well.. It‚Äôs everywhere and nowhere all at the same time.There is a plot somewhere there, hidden behind all the world building and characters introduction. It‚Äôs a shame that the plot isn‚Äôt run by the MC but everyone else. Let me explain. Our hero is stranded in a new world, has a goal in mind and even an idea on how to achieve it. But every dramatic thing that happens is a result of someone else's decisions and action. It‚Äôs more often than not that he gets involved by chance or because of the body he inhabits. He has little to no real power as a story catalyst. Like I said before: Things happen to him, not because of him. That changes a little in the last two episodes but before that he‚Äôs just there along for the ride.Apart from that the story is actually pretty interesting. It starts out as almost a dark comedy reverse isekai but the longer the show goes on the more it shifts into a pretty solid thriller with its very own secret organizations fighting for power, assassinations and even some supernatural elements for good measure. It‚Äôs a solid idea.The problem is that all that needed a set up. That‚Äôs what those 12 episodes are (I really hope so) - a setup to something more grand. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, You can still have a good time watching them but at the end You will be left with blue balls and a WTF face. I honestly am a bit hyped for part two because I hope they will deliver on the type of thriller (maybe even a political one) that they set up.All in all I think that despite its flaws and being just a prelude to more things to come it‚Äôs a solid watch. If for nothing else the premise and Misaki are rather enjoyable. world he still wants to find a way to live a peaceful life. Despite his goal, life has a strange way of keeping him on his toes.To be fair it is a part one of the seasons and it kinda feels like it.

Not a bad place to start and her character does go in a bit of a different route than those two. After getting killed, mostly by accident, by the Corpse God, she gets resurrected as a zombie. Something she‚Äôs perfectly ok with and even has some fun with her new skills. She is tragically underutilised in this show as she‚Äôs the best part of the main coterie.Takumi Kuruya - an information broker who uses his drones and hacking skills to keep tabs on important things. Despite being suspicious of the Corpse God in the beginning he warms up to him rather quickly. He even helps with his fortune telling business venture. Not a very original character and as such is pretty much forgettable.Now that we have the coterie out of the way, let's talk about writing.It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well.. It‚Äôs everywhere and nowhere all at the same time.There is a plot somewhere there, hidden behind all the world building and characters introduction. It‚Äôs a shame that the plot isn‚Äôt run by the MC but everyone else. Let me explain. Our hero is stranded in a new world, has a goal in mind and even an idea on how to achieve it. But every dramatic thing that happens is a result of someone else's decisions and action. It‚Äôs more often than not that he gets involved by chance or because of the body he inhabits. He has little to no real power as a story catalyst. Like I said before: Things happen to him, not because of him. That changes a little in the last two episodes but before that he‚Äôs just there along for the ride.Apart from that the story is actually pretty interesting. It starts out as almost a dark comedy reverse isekai but the longer the show goes on the more it shifts into a pretty solid thriller with its very own secret organizations fighting for power, assassinations and even some supernatural elements for good measure. It‚Äôs a solid idea.The problem is that all that needed a set up. That‚Äôs what those 12 episodes are (I really hope so) - a setup to something more grand. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, You can still have a good time watching them but at the end You will be left with blue balls and a WTF face. I honestly am a bit hyped for part two because I hope they will deliver on the type of thriller (maybe even a political one) that they set up.All in all I think that despite its flaws and being just a prelude to more things to come it‚Äôs a solid watch. If for nothing else the premise and Misaki are rather enjoyable."", 'Words can\'t express how happy I am right now! I needed this type of anime bro it\'s been a long time since I watched a well written anime man it was a blast! I wouldn\'t call it a great anime yet because the 2nd season is yet to be released of course I am hyped for it!I really like the introduction of the anime, There was a fighting scene a warrior fighting a Corpse God as a reader we all expected the Corpse God to be a bad guy but the writer said no to our face and reincarnated him to another world and made...him the main character! I was imagining that the Hero will die defeating the Corpse God and he would get reincarnated! ""Well played writer""!Now let\'s talk about the anime we now know that Corpse God has borrowed the body of Polka, Shinoyama and in first that wasn\'t a big deal until he learned about Polka\'s background and confronted his father! Now there is the interesting part he is sus man real sus and a Gigachad aura as well I mean he believed in his story so well then he didn\'t even question what\'s going on as if he has his own experience in this type of matter! I am thinking his father is going to be a big role in the second season! Then there is this secret organization & that symbol now Corpse God saying that this symbol is from his world and now I want to talk specifically about episode 12 as the story continues I lost a lot of information like half way I was confused but what I understand from Episode 12 that organization I forgot the name but there was a man with a umbrella asking him ""A bastard child of Sabaramond"" then Corpse God was shocked to know how he knew that then he asked some question then that organization was confused to what he was saying! This is the part I am confused in what happened? My speculation in all of this is are this all just a coincidence but then again it\'s too good to be true! This is all so confusing the anime ended with very lack of information though I wouldn\'t complain because it made confusion, doubts & question to the readers and that make something more interesting it\'s makes us look forward to things!I am amazed by this season (I meant this Spring 2023) I can\'t name any anime which is that bad a friend also said the same thing to me!

In the middle of a serious conversation, random a silly goofy unnecessary humor breaks the whole vibe, and it\'s never even funny. It\'s as if it feels sorry for being ""too edgy"" in some moments, that it keeps trying to lighten up the mood by bringing ""humor"" into every scene...so off-putting.Thought i was getting into something like Tokyo Ghoul, only to...find a similar experience as with ""Fire Force"" and it\'s awful fan-service timings.I\'m surpriesd ""Comedy"" isn\'t even included for its tags.Great animation, okay characters, okay plot, interesting enough, but could have been so much better.

Remarkably, it has managed to not clash so severely that it pulls me out of the show, though I will say that episode 7 was not particularly strong to me.Regardless, this unpredictability is perhaps...Dead Mount Death Play‚Äôs primary selling point. It regularly vacillates between various genres and moods to evoke a sense of ‚Äúwhat the heck is happening and why is it so fun.‚Äù Using the first episode as an example, it starts out as a high fantasy and quickly transitions to mystery isekai, then to a survival action flick, and then ends on whimsical, self-parodying comedic note. This pattern of ‚Äúnon-pattern‚Äù has been consistent through the show to date, which could be a turn off for people wanting a more predictable experience.Thematically, the rapid mood changes have not been distracting towards the overall direction of the story. I would admit that once the show settles into a routine, it would probably be fair that it is taking a slow burn approach towards the final conflict of the season. It is still worth noting that the show does manage to be focused. The main character wants peace, and the story revolves around him seeking peace in a bizarre situation.The story overall has a satisfying degree of self-awareness and has some particularly charming characters, especially Misaki, Arase, and Iwanome. However, it is probably fair to say the character writing is not the strongest in the Spring 2023 season.DRAWING, ANIMATION, SOUND DESIGN, and OVERALL DIRECTIONRegarding the quality of the show‚Äôs production, what I was not expecting to enjoy as much as I have is the impressive sound design, particularly whenever magic is used by the main character. Without spoiling anything, the character‚Äôs magic has a unique ‚Äúcrunch‚Äù and fuzzy quality that uniquely harmonizes with their magic abilities. Further, the magical effects themselves have strikingly different style than the rest of the show. It clashes, but in an interesting way. However, I can imagine some people being distracted by it.Whatever your opinion is, it is fair to say that fight scenes are impressive, especially episode 1 and 5, and the general quality of the show is high.CONCLUSIONI initially put this show on hold because I could not keep up with all the shows I wanted to watch. However, the first episode ended up being so memorable that I swapped this show with another one. It is fun, chaotic, and can easily swoop you into its world.

Well, that was bad assumption. It starts with great first episode, then it becomes dull.While main character is somewhat enjoyable and more or less is properly built into story, the rest is kinda meh.Characters 4/10 - Corpse God (MC) is enjoyable and in first half you can see some logic in that character. This fades away with more episodes. Regarding other characters I can\'t say much without spoilers, however it\'s important to remember: characters are not sticking to their role. Story...is trying to describe to you some character, who is then behaving in different way 2 episodes after. A lot of it actually doesn\'t make sense.Story 5/10 - The idea itself is great and world around MC too. However nobody took much care to properly develop it into some working status. Thus story becomes dull and boring. For me personally last 2 episodes were like ""I have to survive those 2 episode to finish it."" On top of that it looks like anime is trying to undermine itself, which is weird? It isn\'t proper comedy, it isn\'t proper action anime, it isn\'t proper isekai, it isn\'t proper fantasy. What it is then?Animation/art 8/10 - Not much I could complain about. It looks nice and effects are fancy. Animation isn\'t part of the problem here.Music/sound effects 6/10 - While I think OP and END are cool, it didn\'t blast me away and casual sound effects and music in anime itself are ok-ish. Nothing really special, nothing really bad.This anime is basically trying to lure you with its first episode and then provides nothing. There is already announced another part, now there is question whether it\'s worth to even try it or not.

I hate overly sad story which keep you awake at nights).Story: Great, keeps you wondering what is going to happen next, definitely not predictable as I thought it would be. 8.5/10Art Style: Good for the type of story it is going for. 7.5/10Reactions: Good, not filled with fake wowww's...and oh my god's 7.5/10Enjoyable?: Definitely! and oh my god's 7.5/10Enjoyable?: Definitely!"", 'The greatest inventions of the 2000s are back to rock our world...though this time it\'s kind of a mixed bag, to be honest.If you aren\'t the classic connoisseur who reached out to the list of anime shows in the 2000s that are worthy of being deemed worth watching, you would\'ve missed out on two shows that made the mark and are still talked about to this day: Baccano! and Durarara!!. That\'s right, acclaimed novelist Ryohgo Narita is back for a 3rd rondo at the anime scene once again after a decade of straight gas-lit successions with the anime adaptations of both shows, starting with the...former in 2007, all the way to the latter in 2016. And he has returned with his newest and latest work: Dead Mount Death Play, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Durarara!! in terms of storytelling, but in a reverse Isekai setting.The typical case of the typical ""hero vs. demon lord"" scenario, this is the story of the powerful necromancer, simply known as the Corpse God. At the heels of the finish line, the legendary hero known as Sir Shagrua Edith Lugrid is about to attempt the biggest undertaking of his life to slay the Corpse God, but amidst his best efforts, the necromancer uses a unique magic skill that reincarnates it to another world, in modern Japan in the city of Shinjuku, taking over a certain young boy by the name of Polka Shinoyama, who just had his throat slit by an assassin. Out and about from that harrowing incident, with a different and fresh new soul, the Corpse God aims for a peaceful life, only to familiarise himself with the Shinjuku underworld that targets him for the supernatural. In a world where obtaining a peaceful life is far from ideal, the Corpse God, via Polka Shinoyama, must make sense in and between the lines of hidden enemies that threaten his well-being, other than his soul transferring into a shark plushie, which I thought was the cutest thing ever.In the world of the just and unjust, there is no equal to the ongoing battle of good and evil, which transcends time and place. Despite Polka\'s unknowing realisation of the Underworld, there is a troop of people willing to aid him: the legal bar-cum-illegal freelance agency Youtoukorou, headed by Lisa ""Clarissa"" Kuraki, along with the tech contractor Takumi Kuruya and, to the surprise of many, Polka\'s own assassin Misaki Sakimiya. Speaking about Misaki first, the first thing that you\'ll instantly know about her is her eccentric yandere personality, because she was a victim of her own circumstances, having lived off in an orphanage after the brutal killing of her family, only to grow up to become a hitman to take revenge on her family\'s murderer. She finds joy in working the bone-chilling assassin job, but with the encounter of the Corpse God through Polka, he kills her and turns her into a zombie after killing his original body to only then be revived, and that creates the infatuation of fascination from her to him, that Lisa/Clarissa orders her to look after him. The same task is given to Takumi, who is the tech nerd of the agency, who unleashes objects such as drones as part of his surveillance network around Shinjuku. Together, both Takumi and Misaki have a burden on their hands, but keeping tabs on him is easy as pie, for his Isekai power is just as able as it was back in his own world.Nevertheless, external forces threaten to derail Polka\'s peaceful life on Earth. Take the Shinjuku Metropolitan Police, for example. Under the control of Tsubaki Iwanome and Kouzaburou Arase, they undertake Polka\'s case of weird and mysterious supernatural proportions that threaten the city\'s livelihood, and also have to deal with some weird beings flourishing around, like the Phantom Solitaire Ten\'a Sorimura. It\'s very clear that there is behind-the-scenes work being done in an otherwise nonsensical fashion, and having to figure out the many plot points that lead to more questions and answers is a tedious job in and of itself. That\'s the story and plot for now, and with Part 2 coming back in Fall, it will bring back these Q&As again to make sense of the ever-changing landscape in Shinjuku, potentially to Japan\'s destruction. Joke or not, it remains to be seen.I feel that ever since Geek Toys got a hold on producing the later Date A Live franchise with the Date A Bullet OVAs and Season 4 (and soon to be Season 5), that is easily the studio\'s best effort thus far, and it really shows in Dead Mount Death Play. That\'s because it has director Manabu Ono at the helm, doing the scriptwriting and series composition roles (along with his directorial input) all at once. It\'s not easy when a director has more roles than he/she can handle, and in this case, it foreshadows the limitations of what he can do at best. But being the director for shows like SAO: Alicization, he knew what Geek Toys could muster from Ryohgo Narita\'s source material and, as a result, produce some good animation and even some convincing scenes at times. It\'s very good, without a shadow of a doubt.The music, on the other hand, is just alright.

No spoilers, as I only spoil what I enjoyed.The base idea is fantastic, but the execution quickly falls short of the writer\'s ambition. Not one, not two, but several plotlines occur all at once, neither intertwined nor converging in a meaningful way; it just so happens that the same characters are involved, simply being present. It was difficult for me to keep up or care, blame my new gen attention span, whatever - anime is not a book unless based on Nisio Isin\'s works, and ought to be more focused. Eventually,...we wind up confused and oversaturated with different things that don\'t get enough exploration.The characters are too numerous for the treatment they get - and that treatment is, as usually the case, quick exposition with no developmental follow-up.

Compared to him, Corpse God really underachieves.The production value is... okay, I guess? For 2010 standards, at least. Nothing to drool over. The choreography is piss poor, the animation subpar, the CGI not at all flattering. The music is forgettable at best.Perhaps if I hadn\'t dropped this anime, I would\'ve gotten a better grasp of the power system in DMDP, but as it stands, it makes no sense to me as far as the villains such as Lemmings go. The show acknowledges Corpse God\'s powers as magic, denying the same of the others, but it\'s never elaborated on beyond ""they\'ve gone past the human limitations"".The show began intriguingly, and by episode 5 I was already bored out of my wits.

I find this pacing got me hooked quicker than Durara, and given today's competition and how fast paced anime are I feel like the mangaka has recognised the need of the age and delivered. A great start, but I recommend going into it without any expectations or biases from the previous works of the mangaka and it will truly be a rewarding experience.

Maybe less inherent when considering that this show doesn\'t set up any ""big super end boss to defeat by season 6"" perse.Apart from those two things, dead mount really makes the best of everything that it is given.

To me, it takes me a bit out of it. We have seen these characters many times in many different shows, which to...me seems just lazy writing. But because the story is so complex and fast paced, it may be a good thing that the characters are easy to understand. And there are a lot of characters.The characters with the mad/crazy/lunatic traits are intolerable, and there are more than one. This is clearly a show targeted towards edgy teenagers who ''are not like the other kids''.The animation...... I hate it. On the action scenes it is almost god-tier but when there is no action it just regresses to slideshow quality. It is annoyingly clear where the animation focus has gone. me seems just lazy writing.

At first the series seems like a very generic isekai, minus the starting scene which while cool doesnt really make you care for the proceeding events and characters by itself. However, this is one of the cases of a series really hitting it's stride as it goes on. Polka while not a super interesting MC, his motives and values make him likeable enough. Misaki comes off as a pretty generic manic pixie dream girl but the show does at least give her some character moments here and there plus that aspect of...her didnt end up nearly as overwhelming as it seemed it would be. The show's main strength comes from the fact as things go on you do get invested in all the characters and how the mystery is set up. I think the show honestly did very well in making a bunch of the characters all have different knowledge levels and making you interested in seeing how they uncover and go about uncovering things. Plus the mystery and way the plot progressed to that point honestly wasnt super predictable to the point of being boring. Overall I'd say while the series does give off the air of being very generic, edgy, and with no substance at the start; as it goes on it really does feel like there is a vision to the story and characters that gets you invested. Giving it a mixed feelings because I still don't think it's an amazing must watch, I still feel like there was more quality to this than I and others might have thought.

His personality ranges from Lord of the Dead, to ""I want to build orphanages"", which is honestly very interesting.Secondary characters are all quite cool as well.

The animations in the first two episodes are particularly impressive and the characters and setting just work. The series is as funny as the situation in which a necromancer has to cope in our world is weird.But unfortunately the series develops...into a mystery anime, which is all about the connection between the old life and the old world of the corpse god and his new one, and also why the boy whose body he is now in was stabbed to death.And the series couldn\'t have made a worse decision.

Originally, I thought this story would be similar to Overlord in a how a skeleton necromancer would win the battle and go on it way to rule the world or the story of an overpowered hero who is looking for another foe to fill is desire to find stronger opponents. That's when I found out that I was incredibly wrong, see it...turns out this is a reverse isekai.Yeah there been reverse isekai before from Devil is a Part Time Worker, Uncle From Another World, and Gate in how each one comes to grasp in living in society from military interaction, implementing their learnings from another world to society norms, and the comedic struggles of working part time. But this anime does it a little differently from the others, see the necromancer has to deal with the dark side of society and work to live around it from hitmen, psychos, corrupt police, and connections to previous lives from his past and to his vessel.The Main Objective of the story is for the Corpse God wanting to find a peaceful life in his reincarnation but this isn't possible do to the person that he is inhabiting. The Corpse God possesses the body of a recently murdered boy who has a dark past that is connected to both powerful company men and hitmen. In a world were magic isn't to strong and utilizing the skills that he had from his previous world. The Corpse God must find a way to make a living in Japan while avoiding those connected to his vessel and to find ways to utilize his magic to protect those along the way.The Story Writing: Written by Ry≈çgo Narita the writer for Baccano!, Durarara!!, and Fate/Strange Fake. That's already a good sign of character development, characters having connections to those outside of their group that has impact to the story, and some funny moments to lighten the mood. I won't lie as it is a little bit slow but the action scenes really make it up to continue to watch the show. similar to that like Durarara!!. However, I found myself enjoying the story as they found ways to make the main character work around situations based on his skill set to interact with the dead since he was a necromancer.  This resulted in moments on gathering information from ghosts, being able to revive someone from the dead, and utilizing his limited spells to protect himself in danger.The Characters: They aren't the most exciting but their still entertaining to watch like buying the newest Call of Duty but than realizing their is a crap ton of the same game with different story telling at the center of it.Corpse God: A powerful necromancer that desires nothing more than a peaceful life and will go great lengths to ensure it happens. His  perspective of humanity is that he sees them as toys/dolls and that he wants to keep them safe but will use them by how he sees fit.Polka Shinoyama: Not much is known about the boy since he was murdered by an assassin but as time goes on more of his past is shed into light that affects how the Corpse God lives as he possesses his body. Currently Polka soul dwells in a shark doll but can't speak but yet still displays a lot of emotions in his movements.Misaki Sakimiya: An assassin that was murdered by the Corpse God in self defense but was soon resurrected by the Corpse God to be a zombie. Her personality is similar to that of cat, she's innocent and fun as well as enjoys killing those in her way but she is loyal and caring to those close to her.The Animation/Design: The animation was done by Geek Toys, Inc. that done works like Hensuki, Liar, Liar, and Date A Live IV. The animations are smooth and utilizing the usage of CGI in Corpse God magic isn't to bad as it's similar to that of Fate/Stay UBW. The design of the characters aren't the most memorable but their definitely eye appealing when watching the story but if I showed you a figurine at a anime convention, you won't know who that character is unless it's Polka or Corpse God.Overall, its a good show and I enjoy how far their going to add meat to the character Corpse God, I won't go to much into depth into the future episodes but they really flesh out his past, ideals, and his teachings from his past life into today's society and how to approach them without making himself to noticeable to the extras apart of the story. turns out this is a reverse isekai.Yeah there been reverse isekai before from Devil is a Part Time Worker, Uncle From Another World, and Gate in how each one comes to grasp in living in society from military interaction, implementing their learnings from another world to society norms, and the comedic struggles of working part time.

The ensemble cast and multiple interconnected plotlines is reminiscent of Durarara or Baccano, if they were written by someone on stimulants. There are like four plotlines occurring at once and only one is remotely enjoyable‚Äîthe main characters just chilling in their apartment, running an amateur fortune telling business. Its plot is rapidly paced, wildly unpredictable, infrequently funny, and borderline incoherent, resulting in genre-bending trash. The premiere will give you the impression that the whole series won‚Äôt take itself too...seriously, but that is not the case.A necromancer named Corpse God dies in an epic battle, then finds himself reincarnated in the body of a recently murdered Japanese boy, Polka Shinoyama. He quickly becomes entangled with gangs, criminals, police, and other killers. As soon as he assumes the boy‚Äôs form, he fights off some crazy woman, Misaki Sakimiya (an assassin who murders assassins?). Corpse quickly kills her with necromancer magic. After Misaki failed to kill Polka, she Corpse resurrects her as a zombie. Corpse is morally centered, despite his name, he only wants a peaceful life, resulting in a very dull and monotone character. One of his first actions is transferring the original Polka's spirit to an adorable shark toy.Throw all your logical thinking out the window because none of this shit makes sense. Corpse's powers are inconsistent, characters behave in unbelievable ways. I can't grasp how this came to be. It‚Äôs like the writers simply expected viewers to be children who‚Äôd follow along with whatever nonsense shit they threw at the wall. There‚Äôs barely any character progression, but there are a few flashbacks to develop the main characters.Upon resurrecting Misaki, her mediator, Clarissa, strangely grants Corpse God a place to live as long as he works for her group. Clarissa has two people in her group join Corpse God, Misaki and an info broker, Takumi Kuruya: a Shinjuku informant who collects data illegally using drones. Corpse puts a police investigator's spirit in a pen to obtain information, which slowly reveals clues to solve mysteries. The little CGI pen writes on its own and wows clients. These oddballs form a found family and help Corpse work as a fortune teller, as well as dealing with Polka‚Äôs very wealthy family. As the story progresses, it becomes more complex, and new questions arise, leaving you wanting a clearer sense of where it's heading. Ghosts, gangs, supernatural criminals, magicians, etcetera are thrown into the melting pot with little cohesion. Despite its flaws, Dead Mount offers LGBTQ+ representation through Clarissa... and Misaki? She is working through it. For ecchi fans, you get some steamy lesbian action. The fanservice seems pretty intense for a show as edgy and juvenile as this one, but we already have all the other genres, why not add ecchi?At the very least, there‚Äôs occasionally a fight scene involving thrilling necromancy magic.The action scenes themselves? Meh. The choreography isn't the best out there, if you know what I mean. On the bright side, the characters have simplified designs that make fights look more dynamic. But hey, don't expect consistent quality here, folks. Sometimes, it feels like you're staring at talking heads and struggling to pay attention. Oh, and let's not forget the chibi art style they throw in during funny moments. The jokes rarely land, but it's cute, sure, and probably saved them budget. Overall, the animation is okay. Though the art has improved from previous Geek Toys animated eyesores, it's not going to blow you away.Dead Mount's biggest selling point is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not as funny as it should be. With the help of Misaki and Takumi's colorful personalities, Corpse God's fortune-telling business was consistently the funniest plotline in the series. They successfully run the business using genuine readings and gimmicks. It‚Äôs pretty comical and they use ghosts to solve mysteries. The sixth episode played off their fortune-telling scheme. It was perhaps the most exciting episode for telling a self-contained murder mystery story, including espionage, natural world building, and a shocking conclusion. As well as developing a couple of characters without relying on flashbacks or exposition dumps, as the series does.You must pay VERY close attention to the plot at all times, despite the monotonous by-the-numbers storytelling, or you‚Äôll lose track of the sequence of events and complicated character motivations. Due to the rapid pacing, lackluster storytelling, numerous colorful characters, an overstuffed plot, and rapid tonal shifts, it quickly becomes a confusing viewing experience. It‚Äôs a shame because I love Baccano and can see the inspiration in Dead Mount.Dead Mount Death Play pushes storytelling boundaries, but for the wrong reasons. It presents an ensemble cast and multiple interconnected plotlines reminiscent of Durarara and Baccano. However, the rapid pacing, excessive characters, and lack of coherence make it a tedious watch. While the main character's found-family provides comedic relief and the occasional fight scene adds excitement, the overall execution falls into monotony. Although the series attempts to balance humor and serious storytelling, it struggles to do so. Ultimately, Dead Mount Death Play may appeal to those who enjoy genre-bending narratives with ensemble casts and are willing to overlook its shortcomings, but for others, it may prove to be too confusing and inconsistent. seriously, but that is not the case.A necromancer named Corpse God dies in an epic battle, then finds himself reincarnated in the body of a recently murdered Japanese boy, Polka Shinoyama. He quickly becomes entangled with gangs, criminals, police, and other killers. As soon as he assumes the boy‚Äôs form, he fights off some crazy woman, Misaki Sakimiya (an assassin who murders assassins?). Corpse quickly kills her with necromancer magic. After Misaki failed to kill Polka, she Corpse resurrects her as a zombie. Corpse is morally centered, despite his name, he only wants a peaceful life, resulting in a very dull and monotone character. One of his first actions is transferring the original Polka's spirit to an adorable shark toy.Throw all your logical thinking out the window because none of this shit makes sense. Corpse's powers are inconsistent, characters behave in unbelievable ways. I can't grasp how this came to be. It‚Äôs like the writers simply expected viewers to be children who‚Äôd follow along with whatever nonsense shit they threw at the wall. There‚Äôs barely any character progression, but there are a few flashbacks to develop the main characters.Upon resurrecting Misaki, her mediator, Clarissa, strangely grants Corpse God a place to live as long as he works for her group. Clarissa has two people in her group join Corpse God, Misaki and an info broker, Takumi Kuruya: a Shinjuku informant who collects data illegally using drones. Corpse puts a police investigator's spirit in a pen to obtain information, which slowly reveals clues to solve mysteries. The little CGI pen writes on its own and wows clients. These oddballs form a found family and help Corpse work as a fortune teller, as well as dealing with Polka‚Äôs very wealthy family. As the story progresses, it becomes more complex, and new questions arise, leaving you wanting a clearer sense of where it's heading. Ghosts, gangs, supernatural criminals, magicians, etcetera are thrown into the melting pot with little cohesion. Despite its flaws, Dead Mount offers LGBTQ+ representation through Clarissa... and Misaki? She is working through it. For ecchi fans, you get some steamy lesbian action. The fanservice seems pretty intense for a show as edgy and juvenile as this one, but we already have all the other genres, why not add ecchi?At the very least, there‚Äôs occasionally a fight scene involving thrilling necromancy magic.The action scenes themselves? Meh. The choreography isn't the best out there, if you know what I mean. On the bright side, the characters have simplified designs that make fights look more dynamic. But hey, don't expect consistent quality here, folks. Sometimes, it feels like you're staring at talking heads and struggling to pay attention.

Final Fantasy VII: Last Order,https://myanimelist.net/anime/408/Final_Fantasy_VII__Last_Order,"[""Let me begin with saying that if you are reading this review, you probably have played Final Fantasy VII or at least know the basic story of the game as Last Order is not a show that you will randomly watch.  You really need to know the story behind the game in order to fully appreciate what the people at Square-Enix did with Last Order.Last Order basically gives the gamer what they have wondered since seeing the flashback in the basement of the Nibelheim Mansion - what exactly is the history behind Zack and how does he fit into the grand scheme of things....If you paid attention to all of the minute details in the game, you can get a decent idea of who Zack exactly is and what his role is.  Last Order tells us that story and Zack's relationship with Cloud and Sephiroth and how Cloud ended up with Zack's buster sword.The animation is flawless when you consider that they needed to convert all of the Final Fantasy VII world into an animation.  It's a completely different project that what Advent Children was about because that was computer graphics, not anime.  Cloud, Zack, Sephiroth and the members of ShinRa are all drawn very well, pretty much to perfection.The music is done very well and the voice actors they gave to each of the main characters seem to fit them quite well.  My only qualm with it is the music selection.  Don't get me wrong, the music was great.  But I feel they should have used some of the music from the game to capture the real essence of FFVII.Because its approximately only a 30-minute show, its hard to judge anything about character development.  BUT, it does do a great job showing the relationship between Zack and Cloud and exactly the closeness of their friendship.  The show also does well in portraying how the ShinRa wanted to capture Zack and Cloud at all costs.Overall, this 30-minute show will answer many questions and leave viewers with a satisfied feeling as they witness the background story of Zack and his relationship with everyone.  The big battle scene between Zack and Sephiroth is amazing and showcases Zack's skills very well.  This is especially the case when Zack and Cloud are on the run and its Zack vs. the entire ShinRa soldiers at one point.Definitely a 10/10 worthy show and if you've played Final Fantasy VII and liked the game, chances are you probably already seen this because most avid Final Fantasy gamers are simply on top of everything that is Final Fantasy.  Ah, what the heck.  It's a nice way to spend 30 minutes or your day.  ^_^ If you paid attention to all of the minute details in the game, you can get a decent idea of who Zack exactly is and what his role is.

I knew that it covered the Nibelheim Incident and it's aftermath, but still.  They didn't even cover anything before Sephiroth goes crazy and burns down/slaughters Nibelheim.  I was really looking forward to that....(pouts)  Decent rehash of things already covered in the game, for the most part.  As for the Zack/Cloud escape... for the most part, it's gratuitous action scenes, peppered with Zack conversing with a comatose Cloud.  The only part I really liked about that part of the plot was the last five minutes, and anything to do with the Turks.  Tseng was mostly used as a plot device in that he prefaced all the flashbacks with a mini-monologue about it.  That was about the best transitioning that they did; for the most part, the transitions are abrupt, and disorienting.Art Style: Studio Madhouse did the animation for Last Order; I'm not sure what other series they've done.  EDIT: Madhouse's credits include Paranoia Agent and, as of late, Death Note.  All in all, I'm happy with the art style for this.  Beautiful 2D animation, and decent CG.  The CG seems awkward when it's in the same scene as 2D, though; it has to be either one or the other.Music: Your typical rock soundtrack, with some techno and strings thrown in the background.  Not all that impressed.Voice Seiyuu:  I was too lazy to check the credits, but, from what I heard, I'm pretty sure that any voices that S-E's used in previous VII titles (Advent Children, Dirge of Cerberus, possibly Before Crisis) were used in this title as well.Voice Actors: N/ADub: N/ALength: Last Order clocks in at just under a half-hour, including credits; about the length of your typical anime episode.  I'm not all that satisfied with it; I was expecting something a little... I don't know, longer than this.  Fourty-five minutes at the least, maybe closer to an hour.Overall: Beautiful animation, excellent seiyuu.  They still need work on the story, music, and run time though.  It's worth a watch on YouTube; I wouldn't go and buy the Japanese special edition of AC just to get this, though.Story: 6/10Art Style: 8/10Music: 6/10Voice Seiyuu: 7/10Length: 6/10Overall: 33/50; 66% (F) (pouts)  Decent rehash of things already covered in the game, for the most part.

I'll explain what I mean by this and review it in full:First off I have given this anime a 5 due to it being (for the most part) a recap of a portion of the FFVII storyline. Just to reiterate: if you have played FFVII and remember all information relating to the whole 5 years ago incidents at Nibelheim then I think you will agree with...me when I say this anime is (to an extent) Square Enix's attempt at milking FFVII.Now I am huge fan of the Final Fantasy games having played them all through numerous times, VII included, but in all honesty all the new content you get from this anime is a couple of new scenes of Zack slicing through some members of Shinra, then get injured himself, you will also see Cloud get stabbed once more than I remember in the game, otherwise you will have already have got all of this anime has to offer by playing FFVII on the Playstation.Story: Yes the story originally was excellent in FFVII, but I'll say again, this is more or less just a recap, hardly anything new other than some action scenes, it's not worth more than the 5 average rating I have given it.Art: This anime looked nice enough, but in all honesty I have seen better and have come to expect something a little more from Square Enix. Just take a look at FFVII - AC, it came out the same year and the art and animation are MUCH better.Sound: There's a few of Uematsu Nobuo's classics thrown in which, if you're a fan of the original game like me you'll find leave you with a slight feeling of nostalgia, prompting you to remember the awesome game. Other than the Uematsu stuff, the music isn't anything special but it's good enough.Character: The anime's heavily focused on Zack, who yeah, if you like him could be an entertaining enough character, but we don't really get enough time to really develop any connection to the characters here. The appearance of Tifa and Cloud along with Tifa's mentor/ master will again leave you with that nostaligic feeling, but - here I go again - have you played FFVII you'll have seen this all before, so you know what to expect, the characters themselves are great but with so little time nothing has any real chance to develop.Enjoyment: Average because I'd seen it all before.In short: This is one for the fans, and even then it's not anything to scream and shout about. If you like action, want something quick to watch (20 mins without the credits) then go for, but don't expect too much. me when I say this anime is (to an extent) Square Enix's attempt at milking FFVII.Now I am huge fan of the Final Fantasy games having played them all through numerous times, VII included, but in all honesty all the new content you get from this anime is a couple of new scenes of Zack slicing through some members of Shinra, then get injured himself, you will also see Cloud get stabbed once more than I remember in the game, otherwise you will have already have got all of this anime has to offer by playing FFVII on the Playstation.Story: Yes the story originally was excellent in FFVII, but I'll say again, this is more or less just a recap, hardly anything new other than some action scenes, it's not worth more than the 5 average rating I have given it.Art: This anime looked nice enough, but in all honesty I have seen better and have come to expect something a little more from Square Enix.

This anime is basically most of the scenes we saw during the game, like when Sephiroth went to Jenova, and why Cloud lost his memory, etc. Plus extra scenes that were also shown in the game, but I think you had to do some stuff to unlock the extra scenes.. If I wanted to revisit those scenes I would just play the whole game. (But for those who don\\'t have the game, well I guess this would be a good thing)I bought the DVD cause I thought it was like FF7:...Advent Children, thinking it was a new story or a continuation of FF7.

If you\'ve played the game, you\'ll...be familiar with the this segment of the story where Zak and a barely conscious cloud escape like labrats from the Shinra laboratory where scientists conduct experiments to create super soldiers. The story and characters are true to the game, and production values are sky high as you can tell from the blisteringly good animation and explosive action sequences.

Despite that you won't miss out on much if you don't see it, it's essentially a short re-telling of the events of the Nibelheim incident found in the Final Fantasy VII video game.Story - 5/10Last Order tells the story of what happened in the town of Nibelheim a few years before the events of Final Fantasy VII took place, in the game itself it was shown as a flashback sequence.  It also touches upon Shin-Ra's and The...Turks pursuit of Zack and Cloud leading up to that, and ends with a brief conversation on the back of a truck presumably a few months or years later after the aftermath of the Nibelheim incident; it's not explained in the OAV and it's been a while since I played the video game so my memory is a little hazy.Overall I was disappointed with the story of Last Order, you're simply thrown into a key event of the Final Fantasy VII story arc and just as quickly as it starts it... ends.  It's an above average recalling of the event itself but I was hoping for more, and at under 25 minutes in total there simply isn't enough time to explain everything and the transition from one part of the story to the next is confusing.  Final Fantasy VII: Last Order should have been at least 45 minutes long or perhaps even an hour, it's a major plot point that deserved more effort devoted to it.Art - 7/10Good but nothing outstanding, in a nutshell.  The brief battle scene between Zack and Sephiroth looks nice, but the OAV seemed to be a little too dark in places.  The characters themselves looked suitably detailed so there are no complaints there.Sound - 6/10Again, good but not outstanding pretty much sums up my opinion here.  I liked the soundtrack as a rock fan and the sound effects were decent, but I didn't particularly enjoy the voice acting from the Japanese cast members.  The guy who voices Sephiroth probably put in the best performance, but Tifa in particular was underwhelming.I'm not sure if the voice cast are the same as those found in Advent Children, although that wasn't an aspect of that film I found to be all that good either.Character - 6/10Due to the length of the OAV very little time was devoted to any character development, although if you're a fan of the Final Fantasy VII franchise you should be all too familiar with most of the cast.Enjoyment - 6/10As I previously mentioned you shouldn't watch Final Fantasy VII: Last Order before completing the video game, otherwise you'll likely get absolutely no enjoyment out of this whatsoever.  With that said as an avid fan with a slightly hazy memory I didn't enjoy this as much as I'd hoped, it was far too short and only really rehashed a plot point I'm all too familiar with.Overall - 6.0/10 Turks pursuit of Zack and Cloud leading up to that, and ends with a brief conversation on the back of a truck presumably a few months or years later after the aftermath of the Nibelheim incident; it's not explained in the OAV and it's been a while since I played the video game so my memory is a little hazy.Overall I was disappointed with the story of Last Order, you're simply thrown into a key event of the Final Fantasy VII story arc and just as quickly as it starts it... ends.

If you wonder about confusing story part with Cloud/Zack amnesia thing, this Special can bring a little understanding into all the confusion.The animation is really good and smooth, it is not computer graphic (like Advent Children), just old school anime style. I really like how all the characters were drawned, especially...members of Turks.The music is fair, well composed, but it would be perfect if Square would used the original music from the game.

Can I (or we) call this the SOTY (Short of the Year) for 2018? Because this short-form 10 minute series, as simple as its premise goes, drives home perfectly about more than just being a fun and educational series. Heck, anime like this really are once-in-a-blue-moon novelty! And...this is brought to you by director (not Shouto) Todoroki Owl (his very first directorial work). (Aw, Shouto almost had his own anime...)Originally a Pixiv web comic, Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san is an accurate depiction of Japan\'s culture of bookstore...staff handling day-to-day bookstore work measures. For the sake of adaptation, the writer himself Honda-san phased himself as a (not so Ainz-sama like) skeleton which is voiced by the ever popular Soma Saito, and honestly, he fits the role of the skeletonized human Honda-san very well. So now, imagine with me on this. If you decide to journey to Japan one day, enter into a random bookstore to see how and the behind-the-scenes look alike, and of course, after watching this series, more often than not, I\'d bet that you will have a more appreciative sense of both the bookstore as well as the staff themselves, which is the selling point of the series.Not to mention, while MC (Momonga) Honda-san constantly wrestles with his own thoughts and opinions against the people in the bookstore, ranging from young to old people with perfectly normal to obscenely random choices of purchase (e.g. erotic, BL etc.) , he does not just go alone. Together with his other staff like Okitsune, Kamibukuro, Gas Mask, Section Chiefs Pestmask and Armour whom deals different sections and catalogues of books of which are handled by the ever-so-flctuating involvement of media companies like Shueisha and even Kadokawa themselves (since Kadokawa censors out popular and obscure titles for research, and is always laughing puns), and even these companies themselves, negotiating for usual stuff like shipping, packaging and receiving stock. Even more so, being a SoL comedic series, I find myself sympathizing with Honda-san and his colleagues for the insane random situations they face, and of course, the laughs, there is always the endless randomizing customer-staff expressional bickering that is worth many damn chockful of laughs. So if you want to upgrade your list of anime memes and endless references, this is the go-to source.Being a primarily kids-centric studio, DLE\'s simple art aesthetics are really just for show, and do deliver on the depictions of how Honda-san\'s actions and expressions are laid out, and that is transferred onto Azarashi-san, which is Honda-san\'s writer for this series.

This is a series about a skellington dude who is working at a manga store. The entire things centers around his job and interactions with coworkers and customers. To say that this series is a meme would be an understatement.The comedy is totally badass. We have colorful bunch of all sort of weirdos from mom person who comes to buy manga for her son whom she proceeds to call a nerd for reading manga out of all things, to a an adult man who is looking for homoerotic Gintama tentacle porn doujinshis asking like waddup hope...these haven't been sold out yet.Honda-san is quite hotshit in terms of accuracy when it comes to physical manga releases, popular new series and the more obscure and demanding readers who would never even look at the mainstream shit-tier stuff (just to quote the series). It doesn't save anyone from its jokes be it the more casual newcomer readers or hardcore yaoi fangirls -- and especially the bookstore staff -- everyone will get their fair share of mocking. As a person who doesn't get offended over harmless humor, I have been having a blast with this one.Honda-san himself is a great character because the downsides of his work really match with his thoughts. Be it some over-weighted NEET wanting to buy ALL the manga or some crazy tourist bringing 50 copies of boylove manga to the cashier, he always finds his way of complaining these things without them really sounding like complain at all, rather witty remarks regarding the customers and how it will affect his work day.In terms of art, this isn't exactly Inferno Cop tier stuff, but we are close. The animation is purposely oversimplified for comedic reasons, the character design is also done similarly to create stereotype customers and make the staff in the store seem absurd as possible. Sounds-wise, Honda's seiyuu delivers and that's the most important part.This series is truly doing its job. It is fun to watch, accurate, educational and almost made me want to buy some manga, which I guess is one of the reasons why this was made.

Seriously.It revolves around our main character, a skeleton called Honda, as we watch him work through his job as a bookstore employee; within the bookstore, we meet his fellow co-workers, who each have very expressive personalities, and the daily shoppers who visit the store. This whole entire show is comedy gold - especially if you get the references - filled with BL jokes and western tourists along with the relatable struggles at work that Honda and his co-workers go through that...just make you laugh; this all makes for an absolute one of a kind experience. It's astonishing how they humanised these characters with the expressive voice acting and dialogue despite the fact that all the bookstore employee's don't even have faces; in Honda-san's short run time of 2 hours, I've come to love these characters and care for them. The art style is minimalistic, there's not a lot of animation most of the time but it doesn't really matter at all (in fact the lack of animation and minimalistic style is perfect for this show) - it's the story and characters that really keep you watching.This show puts you at ease: I'll never forget the amazing cast and how the episode's used to just fade into the ending song, and me just sitting there in awe after each episode. If you ever have time to spare, I seriously recommend you to binge-watch this show, sit back and just have an absolute blast watching it.9/10 just make you laugh; this all makes for an absolute one of a kind experience.

From keeping book shelves tidy and organized to talking to foreign customers, otaku...culture and how it affects sales and popularity of books themselves and how booksellers work with exporting and importing goods.Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san\'s cast is fairly decent with our titular Honda-san  having most of the focus but we also get to see his co-workers who like Honda are also caricatures of the real life Honda\'s co-workers but given stuff put on their heads to disclosure for obvious reasons. Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san\'s interactions and their own hang ups and comforts of working in a book shop also plays a hand in the anime short and is probably used for the best comedic effect especially with the character reactions as a result. LA\'s favourite character would have to be Okitsune voiced by Shizuka Ito and Houtai voiced by Eri Kitamura because of their personalities and their comedy bouncing well off Honda, especially from Okitsune as how much of a clashing of personalities Honda and Okitsune have yet works well anyways.Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san\'s other interesting thing about it is well actually two things, one is the Engrish used and how it\'s used with it;s comedy but not in a way that it doesn\'t disrespects the foreign customers but to have fun with the situation Honda-san goes through (being in charge of foreign comics and all) and the situations Honda has with them are pretty funny especially with his reactions and how he handles each of those situations but the other interesting thing about Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san is how many references Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san does have and because they have the entire ""change the name of that popular franchise name"" or censor popular well known characters from both anime and Western media, it\'s nice when LA gets the reference and how that reference impacts the book shop as a result of it.Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san\'s animation done by DLE was ok, this being an anime short and all but the animation is intentionally stiff with the characters actions at times but this being mostly a talking anime but nonetheless as stiff as the animation is it has this paper puppet-ting effect to it that gives it it\'s own charm as minimal of animation it gives itself of, though Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san dabbles in the over the top reactions from the characters faces as stiff as it was and the reactions are priceless but nonetheless the character designs are simplistic yet strikingly bizarre and the backgrounding is minimal but expected. DLE\'s animation is sparse but fair in this regard.Voice work, well there is a decent large cast but again LA will bring up Shizuka Ito and Eri Kitamura again but also Souma Saitou as Honda was pretty well done giving him some inflection and giving Honda some great reaction as much of a character with skull for a head he has, still works!. Nonetheless from Yoko Hiakasa, Akemi Okamura, Ayumu Murase and Yuuko Sanpei, the voice cast was great and made the character reactions all the more better.Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san was probably LA\'s favorite anime short for Fall 2018, for such a simple premise of the daily life of owning and managing a bookstore, it shown off all the intrinsic, trials and tribulations and heck STRESS it takes to own and manage one all the while making it comedic all throughout it\'s run time.

I\'m glad I stuck it out, and really when the episodes are as short as these it wasn\'t any real struggle.The strongest point, for me, was how visually interesting this anime ended up being, despite how few setting changes there are. I really enjoyed the styling of the various booksellers and employees. I also tend to like episodic structure, and that was no different for this anime.The main sticking point for me...ends up being the content itself. I just wasn\'t particularly entertained, overall. I didn\'t find the stories that interesting, and I didn\'t find the jokes that funny. As the story and comedy are the backbone of this anime, the art can\'t really make up for the fact that I found this anime to be a pretty bland experience. I don\'t think this anime is bad, there\'s really no harm in giving this show a shot, watching an episode or two to see if the jokes land with you. If they do, you will certainly find enjoyment in it. If they don\'t, you\'ve only invested 10-20 minutes into finding out.One further note on an aspect of the lens of this anime, which I genuinely appreciated: there is a refusal to outright make fun of the customer characters, regardless of what they were in the bookstore shopping for. Too often, I see jokes made at others\' expense when the only thing the butt of the joke ever did was genuinely appreciate and be passionate about something. I was nervous when I realized the setting that I was headed for tasteless jokes about fujoshi/fudanshi or mocking of foreign manga readers or any other combination of a joke that consisted of ""Hey, that person likes something ... let\'s make fun of them for it!"". I am truly glad to report that, while there are good-natured jokes related to both the various genres of books for sale and to their varied readership, none of them, in my opinion, even approach the line of mean-spirited. I suspect this is due in large part to the actual lived experience the author drew on in order to write the original manga. I just wanted to highlight that. While the humor didn\'t exactly land with me, the respectful attitude behind telling these day-in-the-life vignettes did. ends up being the content itself.

Too often, I see jokes made at others\' expense when the only thing the butt of the joke ever did was genuinely appreciate and be passionate about something. I was nervous when I realized the setting that I was headed for tasteless jokes about fujoshi/fudanshi or mocking of foreign manga readers or any other combination of a joke that consisted of ""Hey, that person likes something ... let\'s make fun of them for it!"". I am truly glad to report that, while there are good-natured jokes related to both the various genres of books for sale and to their varied readership, none of them, in my opinion, even approach the line of mean-spirited. I suspect this is due in large part to the actual lived experience the author drew on in order to write the original manga. I just wanted to highlight that. While the humor didn\'t exactly land with me, the respectful attitude behind telling these day-in-the-life vignettes did.', ""If you don't know yet, I love reading books especially when I went home from working or anything with train and thus developing a skill of reading books while standing up in a moving train. And I am not talking about e-books, I am talking about real physical books which you acquire from a bookstore. Bookstore is probably a place I love so much that I could spent my day off there if I don't have anything else to do. Being surrounded by books feels like a heaven for me. But how about people who works there? People who have their everyday life surrounded by...books? Skullface Bookseller Honsa-san gave us an insight of how the bookstore works and how is it like to work on such place. Not just that, this anime gave us a working place jokes those are funny because of how relatable the jokes to our working life and so many reference jokes here and there.What I really like about this anime is how they present some mechanism within the bookstore that might applied to the nearest bookstore. I love to get new knowledge of something I never know before and this anime presented the information with funny presentations of author's own depiction inside his head. And because this anime revolved around bookstore that specializes in manga and comic, there ought to be many reference jokes. I love this anime's reference jokes as they all well placed and played as a huge punch line for what happening in a certain scene. From censoring book publisher names to a very must be there JoJo reference, if you love reference jokes as I do, you will love this anime so much. Not just that, Honda-san everyday life as a bookstore employee is a relatable one for anyone who works as a regular employee in some retail shop. It is shown very deeply that the author must have been working there for real to manage to express those feelings to us.While the animation is really limited, the atmosphere of this anime gave out that the animation is intentionally doing that to further make this anime interesting. I really love the character designs for this anime though. Since the author seemed want to make everyone anonymous, he depicted them by stuff that really out of my head. I think the move is very creative as it makes diversity among the characters while make the characters anonymous at the same time. Section Chief Armor's character design might be the one I love most. Since, it originates from the manga, I think it is a huge kudos for Honda-san.Overall, this anime is a very interesting anime to watch as a quickie because one episode of this anime only span for ten minutes. And because of the short span, I think that's why Skullface Bookseller Honda-san could live up its humor as it is not overstaying its humor and comedy.

When you first look at it, there is the cover art, then the synopsis, and the genre, three of the arbitrary deciding factors that might give you a primary opinion on a said show, and for me, it was one boney boy and no idea on the plot whatsoever, and probably that's what appealing about the Slice of Life genre, you know it's following someone's daily life, you know it's going to be either hilariously on point or sadly relatable, probably both.After watching Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san, I might just add an exception...to that factor.Story (7/10):When it comes to its fundamental core, it's just another Slice of Life show, the kind of shows that are worth the watch after a long tire-y day of work, and probably that's what justifies its relatively short episodes (about 10 minutes each). Not only does it blend well with the relaxation after a hard day scenario, but the show itself also dives into the idea of hard working and doing the best in your job, for your job.The setup is pretty simple and familiar, one busy bookstore, specialized in selling Manga and Light novels, I guess similar merchandise as well?Honda-san is one skull-faced ambitious clerk that strives to genuinely provide the most ideal customer service with the help of his equally enthusiastic co-workers. No literally, the part about the skull face couldn't be more literal. Filled with other famous Manga and Anime references and with a tremendous amount of fourth-wall breaking jokes, it really made for the perfect parody of the Otaku community, something that think is semi-important to get most of the jokes.Art (7/10):Not too shabby, and not with the rest of average works either.As serious as the show is, the animation, in my opinion, couldn't be any more complimentary. There is something about it, very clean and abstract that makes it stand out for the other shows, it really does have that special charm of its own that makes it distinguishable in a great way.And don't mix it up, when I talk animation, I talk art style, because you know, for a series that doesn't rely on action and fast-paced scenes, smooth animation wouldn't do it any favor.The character designs are truly remarkable, for instance, the main cast is put in such a noticeable perspective you'd almost see a spotlight on top of them all the time. Obviously, the show makes references to the real world, it presents the character as normal everyday life people; with no superpowers or out of the world capabilities but a blessing that gives you a genuine smile, which is more of a naturable rare ability,n especially in this day and age.A skeleton as a clerk and his gang of weirdly masked people, at first they give you the impression of goofiness, but they, those are the manifestation of their personalities, also that outlining look only helps to highlight them from the rest of the crowd on the screen. Most of the shows could settle by giving the main character an explicit hairstyle or a special hair color, but Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san goes all out and parodies even those who fall short on delivery.Sound (7.5/10):A big part of this was the voice acting, and you know, in a comedy show, a special kind of voice acting is needed, something that's really hard to nail.I wouldn't have recommended a better mashup of good voice actors that can blend this well in a show of this production value.I feel as though I should talk in a more general way when it comes to this part, but I can't help but direct all my focus on Honda-san (Saitou Souma).He's presented with such tone of voice that alone screams of comedy, all of the nervous cuts and Engrish overdosing was worth it on the run.I can't really speak much of the opening and ending theme songs, I know I enjoyed the opening theme song to some degree, however, I never got the single from the latter. As for the soundtracks, I don't think I've been able to notice them all that much, probably because of how involving the content was to me, you just keep on focusing on the context you almost get drawn onto to screen and blend with the rest of the characters for how painfully relatable it was.Characters (8/10):I've been eager to talk about the characters ever since the first episode.I've said a lot in the ‚ÄúArt‚Äù section already, but I feel that was only what concerned the character design. And now, let's hit their terminology.Honda-san, an individual that's been presented to us as the typical bookstore clerk we all know, the dead in the face stereotype that really seems all that boring on the surface, probably that's what they were aiming for with his skeletal design. But once we get put in the clerks' perspective, we get to see more on how ‚Äúthey‚Äù view the business, what goes in their minds when they are serving a customer, are they genuinely doing it for the good, or just as a means of survival?It turns out some people are just born that nice, but can't express it correctly, probably that's what stops a lot of relationships. You never have to judge people by appearances, one thug looking fella might become your closest friend open the expense of a ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù, you might never know. And that doesn't concern only Honda-san, it seems all of his co-workers relate to the same treats one way or another, they all have to deal with different costumes every day, and we know, people come in all different types.‚Äústicks and stones may break my bones but a difficult costumer might draw me into depression, and a cheerful might even cure my cancer‚Äù, that's what it was like for the cast all along.Enjoyment (8/10):And even beyond. 8 out of 10 sounds like a disappointment for a show of this status, I forgot how long was it since I last enjoyed a comedy slice of life before deciding it's one shallow try-hard series. For me, Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san was a bit too fast-paced, you have characters talking way too fast I found myself replaying some bits more occasionally so that I could get the meaning behind the references they were making, one could say it's part of the experience, however, I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't had to tone down to that. I'm willing to give it another rewatch and pick up on the jokes I've missed out on, and would even consider rewatching it dubbed if we ever got a decent one soon.Overall (7.5/10):Everything must come to an end, at least, I can say I've watched a great series from the bottom of my heart, as much as unbiased I tried to make this review, I was hesitant to submit to this somewhat low score for such a charming series, I know for a fact this is going on the top of my list of comedy slice if life recommendations. Not only that but as strong as it stands out as a rewatch heavy material, this should become more familiar as I'm willing to rewatch the heck out of it with friends and family, all of the BL jokes can never get old.I do think however that most of the enjoyment comes at the expense of being familiar with the Otaku community, or else, most of the jokes would only get passed the typical viewer without a sent. to that factor.Story (7/10):When it comes to its fundamental core, it's just another Slice of Life show, the kind of shows that are worth the watch after a long tire-y day of work, and probably that's what justifies its relatively short episodes (about 10 minutes each).

The short-and-sweet beauty of the show makes it an easy watch that holds your attention, since it doesn't even really need that much of your attention to begin with. As somebody who has trouble with staying interested in a show, Honda-san's mini plots really helped me breeze by without losing the want to keep watching.The characters, especially Honda, are so beyond lovable and all play their own little role to keep the silly, colorful nature the show strives for and...does so well. Not to mention the art style, which tends to stay on the more basic side with a SPLENDID color scheme.Honda-san is great for binge watching, watching in between other shows, or just when you have a spare 15 minutes, and I would recommend for those who enjoy silly slice of life.Also, guaranteed will make you wish you worked at a Japanese book store. does so well.

It achieves this by having every episode be based around some aspect of being a part of bookstore staff, whether it be dealing with certain kinds of customers or ordering and organizing books, then having the poor cast of fun characters try to handle them. It\'s always played for laughs and never feels like actual complaining, yet you still understand that it\'s not easy work.The ""lazy"" animation style didn\'t bother me too much because it doesn\'t take away from...anything.

I'm glad he did because over 12 10 minute, 30 second shows, I got about as many laughs out of it as I did from The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.

It follows the real life of a bookseller and manga artist, Honda-san. As with most great relaxed slice-of-life series, it aims to capture the comedy and magic in everyday experiences. We meet Honda-san's quirky co-workers working in the same bookstore as well the rest of the supply chain: wholesalers, publishers, and customers.As mentioned by other reviewers, Honda-san is a very likeable character #husbando2018. He's awkward, but he's also earnest about his job. He tries his hardest to give the best experience to customers, and often helps out his co-workers. That's why the struggles the...series tackles are never frustrating to watch (because the audience trusts Honda-san is competent and a good person). So, even when a lot of us have no idea about publishing and bookstores, we immediately want to understand Honda-san's situation. It's charming and funny to watch Honda-san try to deal with eccentric customers despite not being very slick, or having to attend compulsory service training workshops. The detail in the situations and realism of Honda-san's reactions makes this show #relatable.I also really enjoy the art style. All the main and supporting characters are given non-human features. Honda-san has a skull for a head, his co-workers wear a variety of masks and helmets to cover their faces, and other characters have slips of paper stuck to their foreheads. It's a clever inversion of an anime trope where artists don't bother drawing human faces for background characters and only give main character distinguishable features. This choice also really helps highlight the subtle strangeness of Honda-san's day-to-day interactions, and the colourful personalities of the characters.One aspect that I don't think has been mentioned that I really enjoy is how the show depicts a globalised world. Hear me out: I think a lot of anime is very weird about foreigners. People who come from other races or other countries have their differences exaggerated, and sometimes, fetishised. This series is unique in the way that it doesn't ignore those differences, but it realistically depicts them in a positive light. The tourists who come to Honda-san's bookstore are just like any other. They just want to buy manga (and maybe come from countries where it isn't as popular). Honda-san never gets stuck on the simple fact that they are foreigners. Instead, the show focuses on the processes of understanding and helping them. It shows Honda-san trying to speak English, trying to recommend books that he thinks they'll enjoy, and there's a scene where he explains why Japanese manga is in black and white, and not coloured. In other words, the protagonist is never put off by the fact that his customers are all different, and he tries his best to meet them where they are at. It also does a good job at showing the wide diversity of the non-Japanese people that come to Honda-san's store. I think that really shows how far anime has come when, in the past, the introduction of a single non-Japanese person was made a huge spectacle in most mainstream series. series tackles are never frustrating to watch (because the audience trusts Honda-san is competent and a good person).

Honda-san never gets stuck on the simple fact that they are foreigners. Instead, the show focuses on the processes of understanding and helping them. It shows Honda-san trying to speak English, trying to recommend books that he thinks they'll enjoy, and there's a scene where he explains why Japanese manga is in black and white, and not coloured. In other words, the protagonist is never put off by the fact that his customers are all different, and he tries his best to meet them where they are at. It also does a good job at showing the wide diversity of the non-Japanese people that come to Honda-san's store. I think that really shows how far anime has come when, in the past, the introduction of a single non-Japanese person was made a huge spectacle in most mainstream series."", 'Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san is an episodic comedy with some autobiographic tones where the author presents a satire of himself at the time he was working in a bookstore while writing this manga.In the story he depicts himself as Honda-san, A timid Skeleton bookseller who is in charge of the American comics and Foreign comic book section of the bookstore.The Nucleus of the show is based on Honda san, and his equaly colorfulf co-workers trying to manage all the stressful and inconvenient aspects of working in a bookstore as best as they can and keep the store afloat, while trying to mantain a good morale.Why would...you watch this? because its fun,its funny, its surprisingly light and easy to digest and the short episodes makes it hard for you to get tired of it, the art can seem a bit weird , maybe foreign at first, but it grew quickly on me to a point where it felt natural and the characters feel likeable and work well with each other.it is not the kind of anime that has been done a million times, on the contrary, I would say this is quite original and yet, it feels like they knew very well what they were doing and managed to deliver a heck of series, Great watch,and I recomend it to any pair eyes that may happen to stroll around this humble review.Score: 8/10 ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ you watch this? because its fun,its funny, its surprisingly light and easy to digest and the short episodes makes it hard for you to get tired of it, the art can seem a bit weird , maybe foreign at first, but it grew quickly on me to a point where it felt natural and the characters feel likeable and work well with each other.it is not the kind of anime that has been done a million times, on the contrary, I would say this is quite original and yet, it feels like they knew very well what they were doing and managed to deliver a heck of series, Great watch,and I recomend it to any pair eyes that may happen to stroll around this humble review.Score: 8/10 ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ', '""You there, who wanted to work at a bookstore after seeing episode 1...Thanks, but reconsider!""In the twelve 11 minute episodes that Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san has to get its point across, it does so with comedy and style that I haven\'t seen rivaled by any other anime I\'ve watched.

If this is the kind of low-stakes enjoyment the best of short-form anime can offer, then...I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to see what else it‚Äôs capable of.The premise is simple: based on an autobiographical manga of the same name, the titular Honda-san is the author and narrator detailing his day-to-day life working in a popular Japanese bookstore.

Helping customers, stocking shelves, making book recommendations, and more are all here. Every task is given a comedic spin for the show, really displaying the chaos of the retail environment and how coworkers can support you through the long days. If you currently work in retail, fast food, or other customer service jobs you'll feel represented and if you no longer work those jobs you'll feel almost...nostalgic for those times. Honda-san is great at highlighting the good in these jobs and how fulfilling they can be for the right people.Honda-san and his coworkers provide a light, fun hearted vibe to the show. Since there are so many people and only 12 half length episodes it's hard to keep track of everybody's names and personalities. However, every character brings their own fun, unique dynamic to the group. The straight man Honda, energetic supervisor Armor, assistant manager Majutsushi, and everyone in between are all people you would actually see working in retail. The characters are aided by Honda-san basing them off of his real life coworkers. While they're entertaining, nobody is particularly memorable beyond their character design.The art style is cute, almost chibi like, but the animation is obviously cheap being more like a slide show.

The opening is a metal song completely different from the rest of the show. It's good but I don't think it fits the vibe. The ending is much better in that respect. It's soft and chill without loud or heavy vocals. The soundtrack isn't memorable but it doesn't need to be so long as it fits the scene at hand. I liked the voice actors since they really brought the chaotic energy the show was trying to portray especially with the broken english.

GJ-bu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14811/GJ-bu,"[""Being as frank as possible, I found the Winter 2013 season to be quite weak, despite having a lot of bright and colourful ideas. The majority of them only proved to be average, slightly above even, and they definitely won't be memorable for long. Now, this talk may portray to be a little irrelevant and bias (and apologies if it is), but the point I want to get across is that I was hoping that 'at least' one show in the season would be in a state without having to be stalled, being both enjoyable and interesting every episode and with no actual problems dragging...it down. In other words, a hidden gem.Thankfully there was one, and funny enough it's about a school club with absolutely no purpose or theme whatsoever. Wait, what?The anime is about... as stated earlier, nothing. Kyouya is in a club called the 'Good-Job Club', and their activities involve having various discussions, eating food, laying around the room being struck by lasers of heat, biting each other, lewdly brushing hair, bringing little sisters in and many more things. The other members of the club are four girls; the childish club president Mao who has a short-temper, the refined angel-like Megumi, the genius Shion lacking common sense and the mysterious cat-like Kirara.You'd probably be thinking that... it sounds like a pretty generic slice of life without actually anything going on, which would naturally sound really boring to watch. To top it all of though, it sounds like a harem! There's no doubt it's harem-like with the boy:girl ratio of 1:4, and you'll probably agree that nearly all harem shows fail to be remotely good. And guess what? I found this much more interesting than all the other shows, and I'm not close to devoted with slice of life shows in a school setting. So... how, and why, did I find this more entertaining than the rest of the season?Because GJ-bu does something a lot of normal slice of life shows fail to do - restraining from pushing itself to far.Or in other words, it didn't try to hard to be what it is. GJ-bu acknowledges fairly well that it's a full slice of life series with the given setting; there's no unnecessarily technical writing involved and it doesn't forces the contents or intentions of the show onto the audience in a demanding way - it just does what a slice of life is supposed to be. It really does take a slice of one's life, and converts those everyday actions into animated form. Because of this, everything feels natural, both pacing and scenery, and without having to feel boring too. None of the jokes feel dragged, and neither does the dialogue, so the conversations and spacelessness you'd feel in real life are portrayed rather nicely here.But who wants to watch some guy's life in a club in the first place? Who'd find that interesting? Which brings me to my second point. The natural flow in the entire show gives of a really, really lovely relaxing pace. The pacing does feel rather slow at times, but because nothing is so dragged along or forced, it makes the audience quite relaxed whilst watching each episode, and so the slowness isn't something to be weary of (well, depending on your preferences but I'll mention that later). Although the speed of the pace is noticeable when you start the series, it starts getting less obvious and time starts to fly by so swiftly you'd be completely used it over the course of the series.That said, looking at a specialist's point of view, GJ-bu really isn't that unique at all. It just stands out because it does what most slice of life anime doesn't do, and that is to keep the viewers actually engaged without a plot in mind instead of building up their bore meters. The show is just about five members in a non-specified club, enjoying their time there whilst they can, so if anyone is expecting some actual plot, romance, drama, tragedy, deaths, epicness, inspiring moments and so forth, then I'm afraid your expectations are at risk (though, there is a sweet semi-closure which was done really well). But if you thought that it'd be a bore-pumper and something immensely non-memorable whilst choosing your seasonal shows (and, admittedly, that was me), then you should pretty much give this a go for a change of pace, and especially if you're a big fan of the slice of life genre.The animation isn't so remarkable as from the outside, but during the course of the show the art department actually does get handled as greater than what you'd expect. On one hand, the budget doesn't seem so noticeable and it's understandable since it's a slice of life. The outlines of the characters can be inconsistent in terms of thickness, which is a rather rare problem in anime in general. On the other hand though, there's certain scenes where the budget goes remarkably high, in both backgrounds, atmosphere and animation (which applies to 95%+ of the last episode). Regards to the budget, there's no rubbish or quality moments in which effects the series in any way. Talking about animation, the area which it's taken in full consideration is the EDs, which used the budget pretty wildly.Well actually, scratch that. GJ-bu wins for the best ending sequence in 2013 so far. And second place. And third place......and fourth place too. The anime consists of four ending sequences, one playing every two episodes and the fourth one playing throughout the second half of the show. Each ED is based around a certain character or two, provided with a theme; the first ED being based around the Amatsuka sisters (Mao and Megumi), the second being based on Shion, the third being Kirara's ED and the last one centered towards the entire club. The collection of EDs varies in the type of songs and mood, being from extremely high-spirited with a fast-paced rock style, to a more contemplative mood in J-Pop form. All four songs are outstandingly well-composed, being catchy and vibrant in their own ways, and the studio probably blew 90% of their budget in the EDs to make them as visually attractive and fluent as possible, even coming with a unique summer atmosphere and funky dancing. They're extremely fun to watch and I doubt you'd regret having downloaded the full songs of all four endings, because I know I didn't regret it.So... in conclusion, the four EDs are the best parts in the animation and sound department, in both the entire show and the Winter season. Woops, it seems like I dedicated a whole paragraph to the GJ-bu endings, so I should start on the actual sound department now. Uh... anyway, the opening sequence plays throughout the entire show, sung by the main VA cast. It's a really catchy up-beat song, and probably not so unexpecting in a slice of life. A lot of the time the OST doesn't play, mainly for the cause of the relaxing pacing and atmosphere. The soundtrack isn't at all incredible in stand-alone, but they're very cutely composed with simple and/or retro instruments, fitting the very light mood for the show. The voice actors do a good job (haha pun) with the characters, generally fitting well in their roles. Not to mention that several of the voice actors are actually teenagers, the youngest being Kirara's VA, at the age of thirteen.Now, despite the relaxing mood and atmosphere to the plotless show, it couldn't be as interesting as it is with just the aspects I described several paragraphs ago. Of course, we can't have a club without its members!Nearly the entire cast consists of female (the male being Kyolo, the main character), and they're divided into two groups; the members of the GJ-bu, and the little sisters of those members. Let's introduce the main members the second (or third?) time, since I think it's a little necessary too; there's presisdent Mao Amatsuka, the orange one, who acts rather childish despite her rich background, and bites Kyolo when she's angry. But her younger sister is quite the opposite - Megumi Amatsuka, the pink one, is both refined and well-mannered, described almost as an angel, although it's not the case when it comes to weight. Shion Sumeragi, the purple one, is somewhat clever in lots of ways, but it seems common sense isn't her strong point. And then there's Kirara, my personal favourite member. She acts less human and more cat, structuring her sentences uniquely, and does lots of things the other members don't usually do, like eating meat all the time. And of course, we can't forget to mention Kyolo, our main man. He's presented in the series as a kind, caring and laid-back guy, though usually questioning whatever actions the other members perform (and usually on him too).Oh and there's the green one. She doesn't appear in the beginning though.All of the members are, firstly to say, stand-alone in their own way. You get a variety of personalities (and hair colours), and each have their own qualities for themselves in which both benefits and non-benefits them. However, it's the way they're presented that fleshes out the personalities further - The features of each individual becomes clearer and fresher with certain tropes and actions happening on-screen. Basically, the characters are in a club room, talking and in different ways interacting with each other. Whether it's conversations or actions, each individual would perform any kind of action which adds up as the evidence of one of the features in the characters, and it fleshes out into the characterization of the members (some of those actions may reveal one of the tropes at first shot though, depending on how obvious the feature is). In other words, characterization happens in the course of events, rather than having them explained, which feels both natural and less lazy.The more fun thing about this though is that each of the characters has quite distinct personalities and different features, fears, knowledge, preferences and so on compared to each other, so it's pretty fun seeing them hang round together as a group. You get a lot of times when they all agree to tease Kyolo in the most entertaining way for them to watch, and then scenes where they all take their turns to do a certain activity, from having their hair brushed, to arm-wrestling, to guessing whatever picture Kyolo drew and so on. There's no real hatred, drama and problems going around in the GJ-bu, so it's hard to start hating a character in the series, though of course it's not the case for everyone. Also, need to mention development. Well, there isn't much development since the anime starts during the middle course of Kyolo's time being in the club, but he does get a well-hidden development in the entire series, to both towards the other members and personality. It's just not so easy to notice and stretched out.Did I enjoy GJ-bu? Considering that the entire show felt really natural and relaxing, and seeing each characters with different kinds of features interact with each other and Kyolo, of course I did. I had a really hard time debating whether or not to rate GJ-bu a solid 7 or a low 8, but it seemed like it was the latter (though honestly, I still can't decide). For anyone who just regarded this as some moe anime with really bland episodes might want to give this a second thought; this was the only show I started in the season which I didn't decide upon my full plan for the season, and it turned out it was the only show I actually thoroughly enjoyed in the entire show. If it wasn't for my brother I would've never encountered this gem, so it was lucky I didn't pass on this. GJ-bu was a enjoyable and relaxing ride for me, and it seems like I've grown fond to the series more than I expected to be.I just wish that more school slice of life anime was like GJ-bu. it down. In other words, a hidden gem.Thankfully there was one, and funny enough it's about a school club with absolutely no purpose or theme whatsoever. Wait, what?The anime is about... as stated earlier, nothing. Kyouya is in a club called the 'Good-Job Club', and their activities involve having various discussions, eating food, laying around the room being struck by lasers of heat, biting each other, lewdly brushing hair, bringing little sisters in and many more things. The other members of the club are four girls; the childish club president Mao who has a short-temper, the refined angel-like Megumi, the genius Shion lacking common sense and the mysterious cat-like Kirara.You'd probably be thinking that... it sounds like a pretty generic slice of life without actually anything going on, which would naturally sound really boring to watch. To top it all of though, it sounds like a harem! There's no doubt it's harem-like with the boy:girl ratio of 1:4, and you'll probably agree that nearly all harem shows fail to be remotely good. And guess what? I found this much more interesting than all the other shows, and I'm not close to devoted with slice of life shows in a school setting. So... how, and why, did I find this more entertaining than the rest of the season?Because GJ-bu does something a lot of normal slice of life shows fail to do - restraining from pushing itself to far.Or in other words, it didn't try to hard to be what it is. GJ-bu acknowledges fairly well that it's a full slice of life series with the given setting; there's no unnecessarily technical writing involved and it doesn't forces the contents or intentions of the show onto the audience in a demanding way - it just does what a slice of life is supposed to be. It really does take a slice of one's life, and converts those everyday actions into animated form. Because of this, everything feels natural, both pacing and scenery, and without having to feel boring too. None of the jokes feel dragged, and neither does the dialogue, so the conversations and spacelessness you'd feel in real life are portrayed rather nicely here.But who wants to watch some guy's life in a club in the first place? Who'd find that interesting? Which brings me to my second point. The natural flow in the entire show gives of a really, really lovely relaxing pace. The pacing does feel rather slow at times, but because nothing is so dragged along or forced, it makes the audience quite relaxed whilst watching each episode, and so the slowness isn't something to be weary of (well, depending on your preferences but I'll mention that later). Although the speed of the pace is noticeable when you start the series, it starts getting less obvious and time starts to fly by so swiftly you'd be completely used it over the course of the series.That said, looking at a specialist's point of view, GJ-bu really isn't that unique at all. It just stands out because it does what most slice of life anime doesn't do, and that is to keep the viewers actually engaged without a plot in mind instead of building up their bore meters. The show is just about five members in a non-specified club, enjoying their time there whilst they can, so if anyone is expecting some actual plot, romance, drama, tragedy, deaths, epicness, inspiring moments and so forth, then I'm afraid your expectations are at risk (though, there is a sweet semi-closure which was done really well). But if you thought that it'd be a bore-pumper and something immensely non-memorable whilst choosing your seasonal shows (and, admittedly, that was me), then you should pretty much give this a go for a change of pace, and especially if you're a big fan of the slice of life genre.The animation isn't so remarkable as from the outside, but during the course of the show the art department actually does get handled as greater than what you'd expect. On one hand, the budget doesn't seem so noticeable and it's understandable since it's a slice of life. The outlines of the characters can be inconsistent in terms of thickness, which is a rather rare problem in anime in general. On the other hand though, there's certain scenes where the budget goes remarkably high, in both backgrounds, atmosphere and animation (which applies to 95%+ of the last episode). Regards to the budget, there's no rubbish or quality moments in which effects the series in any way. Talking about animation, the area which it's taken in full consideration is the EDs, which used the budget pretty wildly.Well actually, scratch that. GJ-bu wins for the best ending sequence in 2013 so far. And second place. And third place......and fourth place too. The anime consists of four ending sequences, one playing every two episodes and the fourth one playing throughout the second half of the show. Each ED is based around a certain character or two, provided with a theme; the first ED being based around the Amatsuka sisters (Mao and Megumi), the second being based on Shion, the third being Kirara's ED and the last one centered towards the entire club. The collection of EDs varies in the type of songs and mood, being from extremely high-spirited with a fast-paced rock style, to a more contemplative mood in J-Pop form. All four songs are outstandingly well-composed, being catchy and vibrant in their own ways, and the studio probably blew 90% of their budget in the EDs to make them as visually attractive and fluent as possible, even coming with a unique summer atmosphere and funky dancing.

These shows spend most of their times showing characters on a club usually doing absolutely nothing, whether because they skip club activities or because the club activities have no real purpose. They are usually hard to review due to few complexity in plot and characters, but it\'s not like it\'s non-existent. GJ-bu, however, takes this to extreme measures.Now, before you argue that the quality of the story is irrelevant, consider the following. If GJ-bu wants to show cute girls (and a boy, though on the verge of being...considered a girl as well) doing nothing but random stuff, then first it must get the viewer to actually care about the girls, otherwise it\'s just irritating rather than endearing. That\'s what good storytelling does, by offering a bridge between the world, including its characters, and the viewer. The problem is... this show doesn\'t have good storytelling.While most shows at least try to construct a basic conceptual setting for the story to take place, this one decides it doesn\'t need to. Instead, we are thrown into the middle of an unknown place, with anonymous faces doing strange things we don\'t understand. Who are they? What are they trying to achieve? How do they relate with each other? There are many other questions, but these are the least you have to answer to convince the viewer that your characters are humans and not moeblobs walking around. GJ-bu\'s characterization is done through a few dialogues there and here and a few, very few, scenes outside the club. That\'s all you get.Maybe the story just wasn\'t well executed, but the characters could still be good, right? Indeed, conceptually it\'s possible to elaborate interesting characters, but fail to fulfill their potential in practice. That\'s not the case of GJ-bu, which defines its characters in terms of clich√©d stereotypes and refuses to give them any further depth. It\'s not that they lack back-story or psychological investigation, they just weren\'t meant to have any complexity to start with.One-dimensional characters can be done well as long as they remain entertaining and/or charismatic, but to do so they must have interesting features and interactions with other characters. Characters from GJ-bu just do the same things over and over again, taking for granted the viewer\'s interest because of the cute and silly things going on. There\'s pretty much nothing fresh about the scenes, since they revolve around stereotypes doing their things.As one would expect, if the storytelling is bad and the characters are poor, the jokes aren\'t exactly a masterpiece of humor, specially because they rely heavily on the characters. Shion, for instance, is very knowledgeable about many topics, but lacks common sense, as the stereotyped genius she is. That\'s it, there goes about 90% of all jokes about her, and not particularly creative ones. Oh, eventually she reveals that she would like to have a younger sister and has Tama fulfill that role because it\'s cute.Yes, ""because it\'s cute"" and ""because the public\'s desires must be satisfied"" seem to be the main driving factors for GJ-bu. You\'ve got tsunderes, maids, all kinds of hair colors, cat ears, little sisters, foreigners, heck, there\'s even cross-dressing for the girls and Kyoro. Everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer through a specific stimulation. If the show had used at least half of the time spent on this planning towards making the characters and their context actually interesting, a great deal of its problems would have simply disappeared.Now that we\'ve got the bad things out of the way, let\'s focus on the bright side. Since visual appeal is relevant to GJ-bu\'s purposes, it tries to build its own style, as colorful, cute and comfortable as possible. These efforts are mostly successful, but the character designs are easily forgettable, nothing you haven\'t seen in other moe shows, and the animation is only average. As for the soundtrack, it\'s pretty catchy, and a lot of effort is put into the ending\'s themes... still, they end up sounding quite generic as well. As a whole, though, the production values are all right.Now, after all of this, it could be concluded that this show is lame and boring, incapable of doing anything remarkable on its own. Well, there\'s nothing remarkable for sure, but surprisingly, it\'s still enjoyable. That\'s the ultimate secret of GJ-bu: it knows what it\'s doing. It was previously said that everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer, and this becomes evident as the show goes on.GJ-bu\'s focus on quantity rather than quality may lose points in artistic and creative value, but it\'s an important trade-off. You don\'t like this girl? Oh, then have another, and another, and another, all with distinct specifications, until you have one that you like. The stereotyped personalities are very helpful because otherwise it would be difficult to do this. Real people have common mindsets and physical attributes due to sharing the same environment, many have similar goals and ideologies, are constantly changing or trying to change, show different sides of themselves depending on the context... Stereotypes, on the other hand, are static, simple, and make sure that two characters will be as different as possible.But surely there must be at least one grumpy old man who isn\'t charmed by any of the show\'s attempts, right? No problem. It may sound crazy, but GJ-bu doesn\'t deliver enjoyment solely from the viewer\'s love; hate is also effective. The series tries so hard to be cute and funny with its endless list of clich√©s, shallow characters and situations, fetishes and repetitive jokes that it turns into a laughable parody of itself for those who are not amused and become increasingly cynical. For example, the fact that the maid spins around every time she appears may either be seen as endearing or a pathetic attempt at being endearing. Both are acceptable, because GJ-bu doesn\'t care if it\'s being loved or hated, as long as it\'s not being ignored.GJ-bu is, quite literally, an anime for everyone. It has generic written all over it, but you end up either loving or hating it because it goes so overboard in applying all sorts of tested formulas. Truth be told, if you are a fan of this kind of series, has no problems with underdeveloped characters and poor storytelling, and want something with a sort of relaxed atmosphere and all types of cuteness, then try GJ-bu, as it probably won\'t disappoint. Otherwise, it\'s not advised to take the risk, but the show could be good for a few laughs; if not genuine, then mocking. considered a girl as well) doing nothing but random stuff, then first it must get the viewer to actually care about the girls, otherwise it\'s just irritating rather than endearing.

It reminds me a lot of several other slice-of-life anime like Lucky Star, Working!! or Acchi Kocchi. Why? Well it\'s mostly because GJ-Bu doesn\'t seem to have a real plot of its own.But despite that, I find it entertaining. Sure, there\'s no story behind it. But seeing Kyoya and the stuff that happens with the girls in the club room? I can\'t help but smile while watching it.The art is bright and colorful. The anime screams a rainbow of colors, which is a good thing. It\'s also clear and the animation flows rather...smoothly.I personally like the characters. Though, Mao reminds me (in a way) of Aisaka Taiga from Toradora. But all the characters can easily be described as ""Kawaii."" Maybe that\'s a personal opinion, but I\'m sure a lot think that way.I don\'t really see anything to dislike this anime for. Maybe I missed a few things, but small things won\'t stop me from watching good anime.This series is still airing, so there\'s more to be expected. I don\'t know where this anime will lead to-- but for now I\'ll give it an 8/10 smoothly.I personally like the characters. Though, Mao reminds me (in a way) of Aisaka Taiga from Toradora.

times too but there are other happy moments as well.After all,life is not completely about joy and pleasure.We have to bear sadness aswell""....So,before u get bored by my life lecture(which u are sure being,T.T),I better start my review which is about an hidden gem i.e. Gj-bu or in other words ""Good Job""Gj-bu huh,...where...to begin..When I first started watching,I didn\'t pay much attention to it.I didn\'t expect it to become THIS awesome as I was like""Yeah,it is good..but there are other awesome anime too..""But I was wrong.As i watched more,I got engrossed in it to a point that I began to wait for it every week unknowingly.After watching the last episode,I just couldn\'t take it as I realized that ""Man,I am in love with it.""So I decided to write a review for this so that other people who are looking for some fun anime may give it a try.Story:-(8/10)First of all..about story..there is none...Well it is a slice of life anime,not much to expect in this department.After all,slice of anime are not about story,they are more about characters,fun,comedy and about creating an carefree environment in which a person can relax.They give us a hint of our everyday life in which this anime surely succeeds.I can this say this confidently that this will make you laugh a lot and you will grin in front of your computer(or laptop:P) screen countless times.The story is about a NORMAL high-school boy who gets recruited in a random club in which there are no prominent club activities..They just relax,play around,get warmed up in kotatsu(when it is winter of-course),drink tea(a lot...),eat cakes etc etc.In other words,a dream-like club(I want a club like that,T.T).Story wise,it reminds me of Seitokai no Ichizon and Sket Dance which,just like it,are anime about everyday life of their respective characters.Above all,it is very natural.It is not artificial.There are some shows which try too hard to make their audience laugh but that is not the case here.There is a flow in dialogues of the characters and a person laughs even when he don\'t want to.So,I give it a solid 8 score out of 10:)The only reason I cut marks is that this is aslice-of-life anime and marks are bound to cut in such a kind of anime.Art:-(9/10)The art is just simply great.It is elegant,vibrant and colorful just the way I like.You can see the detail in everything.The backgrounds are also beautifully done.The best thing is that,art\'s quality remains constantly goodt.It is not like one episode has great art but in the next episode,the quality drops,no...It remains same throughout the series which is one of those lovable points of this series.The character designs may bug some people on their first try at this anime(it bugged me for sure) but as u get used to it,it gets better until you start to love those.It is quite unique but once you get a hang of it,it becomes pleasant to look at.So....I give it a mega-solid 9 points for its beautiful and colorful art:PSound:-(9/10)Now,Even,in sound department,this anime shines as much as in others.When I first heard the opening song,I was like is it really a song?I mean it begins very randomly but as I listened it more as new episodes aired,I totally fell in love with it.It is so catchy and upbeat,totally the genre I like.The ending song changes  after 2-3 episodes so as to give each female lead,her own song.I love each and all of them but due to them being not used more than 2-3 times(except the last one,in which all the famale leads sing together),they are sadly not as memorable as they CAN be which is a slightly weak point of this series.Now,voice-acting...is SUPERB as well.I just love Shion,Kirara,Mao\'s,Megumi\'s(and lol everyone\'s) voice..(Seriously speaking)Ilove megu\'s voice the most.They have done a fantastic job so kudos to them.About the bgm...is it important in a slice-of-life?I don\'t think so..but it is still good.So that\'s why,I give it,a mega-solid 9 points here as well for  lovable voice-acting by seiyuus and for OP and ED songs.Characters:-(10/10)Now finally the department where it shines truly...the character are lovable..I love all the characters.The only complaint I have that the imoutos don\'t get as much screen-time as they should get as they are so lovable.Mao-chan..is the bubbly and mischievious club buuchou or in other words,club president(uhum,my translating abilities:P).She is short,has curly hair and is conscious of her short height.Well,she sure has it rough as she is called to be in elementary school by some people.She acts bossy but in truth likes the main lead very much so she gets shy easily but hate to show her shyness so that\'s why she acts bossy(there is a whole cycle man,T.T)Megumi is Mao\'s younger sister(but looks older..ahem).She is a sweet and kind-hearted girl who loves to make cakes and....make others drink a lot of tea especially our main male lead Kyoya or Kyoro(as called by club members)I don\'t like anime characters who are like her usually but she has a special magnet that attracts me to her I.She is super-conscious about her weight(both sisters have some thing to be conscious about,T.T), a pretty cute point of hers.Shion,is a GENIUS!!... but lacks common-sense which is her MOE-KYUN point(:P)She has a lot of brothers who are as intelligent as her,each excelling in at least one field.She gets pampered a lot as one of her brother makes her lunch,dinner etc while other makes special kind of coffee for her etc,so she wants to eat things like hamburger etc.and drink things like canned coffee etc.She is pretty and lovable.Kirara is the tigress of group(well she behaves like a cat and sometimes tigress) who loves to eat meat so she is sometimes forced to eat veggies by her younger sister which she eats...raw!(really)The meat which she eats..is a special kind of meat which only Kyoro has eaten.She speaks in very short sentences but can,surprisingly speak like a normal girl through cell-phones which is her super-cute point.Kyoro,is our main lead who is super lucky to be in part of this harem..I mean who wouldn\'t wants to be there with all those amazing girls.He is very surprisingly beautiful as when he cosplays,he becomes a bishoujo,club members fear his this ability.Thats not all,he can transform into ORE-MAN.During this transformation,he gets Extra-Masculine,a fact due to which he is loved by fellow club members.His last skill is that he is super-good at hair-brushing which canmake any girl MOE-KYUN.So all in all,he is a nice lead as he develops nicely throughout the series by acquiring his...fearsome skills...There are other nice characters too.Tamaki is a newly recruited or more like...abducted girl who eats a lot and amazingly does not become..fatter.The imoutos(or in other words,sisters.Again my translating abilities,huhu) group which consist of Kyoro,Megu and Mao\'s and Kirara\'s sisters.The have a Gj-bu at their school as well.Who can forget the strongest women of the entire world i.e. Mori who is a maid at Megu & Mao\'s house.When she does that maid twirl as requested by Kyoro,I bet your heat will skip a beat.She does not age..and has a daughter just like her,a mystery that has not be solved ever.In a nutshell.I totally love the characters which you may have guessed by now(:P)This department is done splendidly sooo a giga-solid 10/10 from me:DEnjoyment/Overall(9/10):-I loveee it!This is an amazing series as it gets you on a ride full of fun and enjoyment.I laughed a lot and at end I got  teary(sob sob)After completing it,I just want to say""Good Job"" to the studio which has done it(dogakobo is its name,i think..)Now for recommendation..I don\'t recommend it to those people who watch series based on its story as there is not much here.Contrary to it,I totally recommend it to people who,just like me,love to see those cute,slice-of-life sort of anime.If u are one of these,then go man(or woman,:P),watch it as u are missing a hidden gem which u may want to add in your anime list.So,what u are waiting for,watch it now.I promise that you won\'t bedisappointed(:D) to begin..When I first started watching,I didn\'t pay much attention to it.I didn\'t expect it to become THIS awesome as I was like""Yeah,it is good..but there are other awesome anime too..""But I was wrong.As i watched more,I got engrossed in it to a point that I began to wait for it every week unknowingly.After watching the last episode,I just couldn\'t take it as I realized that ""Man,I am in love with it.""So I decided to write a review for this so that other people who are looking for some fun anime may give it a try.Story:-(8/10)First of all..about story..there is none...Well it is a slice of life anime,not much to expect in this department.After all,slice of anime are not about story,they are more about characters,fun,comedy and about creating an carefree environment in which a person can relax.They give us a hint of our everyday life in which this anime surely succeeds.I can this say this confidently that this will make you laugh a lot and you will grin in front of your computer(or laptop:P) screen countless times.The story is about a NORMAL high-school boy who gets recruited in a random club in which there are no prominent club activities..They just relax,play around,get warmed up in kotatsu(when it is winter of-course),drink tea(a lot...),eat cakes etc etc.In other words,a dream-like club(I want a club like that,T.T).Story wise,it reminds me of Seitokai no Ichizon and Sket Dance which,just like it,are anime about everyday life of their respective characters.Above all,it is very natural.It is not artificial.There are some shows which try too hard to make their audience laugh but that is not the case here.There is a flow in dialogues of the characters and a person laughs even when he don\'t want to.So,I give it a solid 8 score out of 10:)The only reason I cut marks is that this is aslice-of-life anime and marks are bound to cut in such a kind of anime.Art:-(9/10)The art is just simply great.It is elegant,vibrant and colorful just the way I like.You can see the detail in everything.The backgrounds are also beautifully done.The best thing is that,art\'s quality remains constantly goodt.It is not like one episode has great art but in the next episode,the quality drops,no...It remains same throughout the series which is one of those lovable points of this series.The character designs may bug some people on their first try at this anime(it bugged me for sure)

describe stuff, and that is boring. I mean, that's such a generic word. When something is boring, that just means that you couldn't get into it, as even bad shows aren't boring, they're just, well, bad. All bad shows aren't boring, but all shows that someone says are boring, they typically see that as a bad show. And no matter how much I hate to use that word, I cannot deny the word boring is a perfect word that sums up GJ-bu.GJ-bu is based off of a ‚Äú4-panel light novel‚Äù (aka, a collection of short...4 page stories) written by Araki Shin, who has done nothing else of note. It tells the story of a certain boy (Kyoya) who was apparently forced to join the Good Job Club, or the GJ-bu. This is a club who's purpose they never tell us, as most of the times they just sit around and do nothing.And I mean nothing. Literally the whole show,one short scene at Kyoro's house, oh, and a small part at the cafe, happens inside that damn room .In a way it's like K-On, where all they do is eat and talk, but at least K-On pretended to have a story. GJ-bu just goes from skit to skit to skit. One skit they're combing hair, the next skit they're dressing up in swimsuits (yes, the beach episode doesn't even take place at a beach),  then they play doctor, then they look at Kyoya's sketchbook, and then they comb hair some more (every girl seems to get their hair combed in this show somewhere by the way). Sure they are a few connections and running gags, but most of those are not very entertaining and original (oh, the maid likes to spin! Mao is short and gets pissed a lot! The rich person doesn't know how to eat cup noodles! HAHAHA!). And everything about this show is not entertaining. It just abuses the characters' main traits over and over and over again.Let's take a look at them, shall we? They tried to make Kyoro the only sane man, which might have been nice, but his voice has no emotion at all in it and sounds so bored, and being the only sane man, his goal is mainly to comment on how absurd each situation is. He's the only boy in this show, making it a harem by definition, and it's true he does seem to go from girl to girl to talk, most obvious in the last episode. Then there's Mao, the tsundere, who is of course short. There's also Shion, the calm smart girl, Megumi, the calm reliable girl, and there's Kirara. She eats a lot, and due to the fact she's originally from Canada she speaks in fragmented Japanese, and not very often in the first place. There's also a green-haired girl thrown in about halfway through, but they barely show her anyway. She's just basically another tsundere though, so yeah. Two tsunderes and two calm girls. How entertaining.  There's also a maid, and three sisters that belong to random members of the cast. Those don't appear much though, and the only one that is okay is Kirara's sister, who can only speak in (bad) English but can write perfect Japanese on a white board. Which does make a little sense considering she could've just picked up kanji or something, but still.The voices were rather annoying and tried to hard to just be the clich√© the character was and nothing more. On the music, I don't recall any from the show itself, but on the opening and ending themes... The opening starts out really neat with this cool rap... But then they start singing in these emotionless off-tune voices, and yeah, it sounds really bad. They are four ending themes for some reason, with varying degrees of how good those are (ending 1and 3 are bad, ending 2 is actually really neat sounding and 4 is decent enough I suppose).The animation however was rather bad. The character designs weren't best to begin with, but at random times you could see thick black lines around them, which never looks pretty. And it seems the amount they move gets worse and worse every episode. They must of wasted too much money early on or something.I think GJ-bu might of worked as one of those 3 minute episode anime, but with full length episodes, it just gets boring so fast. I have seen a good amount of slice-of-life anime, and GJ-bu might be the worst one I've seen, with Kill Me Baby as its only true rival. If you enjoy the characters more than I do, then it's worth a watch, but I can't recommend this to anyone else. 4 page stories) written by Araki Shin, who has done nothing else of note.

We have the wonderful Anohana that depicts a more serious and tragic story on one hand, and we have Lucky Star one of the most well known slice of life\'s to date, featuring the daily live of 4 girls.  And, we have Gj-bu, an anime, that is, what I refer to as, a little ball of fun.Story (7/10): Speaking of Lucky Star, this anime Gj-bu, has an immense similarity to it....The story of Gj-bu is nothing special or new in the anime world.  To put it simply, it\'s about the daily ""club activities"" of the Gj club, a club that apparently, everyone in the school avoids for some odd reason.  The characters generally spend most of their time in their little club room world, and rarely leave the godforsaken place.  Not that that\'s wrong, but personally, I would like for them to leave the clubroom for at least a few minutes more, considering the fact that the total amount of screen time that was outside of the clubroom, doesn\'t even equate to the length of a single episode.While the amount of screen time outside the clubroom does show a little bit of lost potential, what goes on in the club room makes it up for it, tenfold.  Because the show is heavily relying on the character interactions, and it excels at it at that, there\'s no need for them to really leave in the first place.  The comedy that this show is probably known for, is created and harvested from their activities and random acts of wackiness, and therefore, we have this formula of (characters + activity = comedy) which turns out to work out VERY well for this anime.  While I won\'t say that this anime deserves any plot originality by any means, Gj-bu is pretty damn enjoyable.Characters (9/10): Characters are where slice of life\'s really shine in.  This particular anime shines extremely brightly on the slice of life spectrum in the character category.  While the troupes of characters aren\'t necessarily original, (weight complex, very smart with low common sense, short tsundere) the anime does well in trying to set them apart from their normal roots.First, Kyoya, or Kyoro as he\'s more known for.  As literally the only guy to exist in this anime, (there\'s seriously no one else), I find him as a rather amusing character.  He plays off at first as one of those, ""what am I doing here?"" characters, but slowly becomes accustomed to his situation, and having fun with what he\'s doing in his spare time.  Now, I should mention that this guy is the butt of all jokes.  All of the characters tease him, he\'s the one getting abused the most, and you gotta hand it to him for enduring 2 years of pain from 4-5 girls.As for the rest of the Gj club, we have a bramble of girls (not a harem...I think.)  Megumi, Shion, Kirara, and the ever so wonderful and terrifying, Mao.  And later, Tamaki.  While usually I dislike anime troupes due to their overuse and unoriginality, I really do like these characters.  Though they are based on something we\'ve all seen before, they all have a very unique twist that adds in to the whole atmosphere to the show.  While no, I cannot explain what those twists are, I found all of these characters quite funny and extremely likable.The side characters also get a round of applause for this anime, specifically because of how good they are, in supporting character standards.  While yes, I did have a problem with them appearing in so late in the series, I didn\'t really mind them that much considering how much they all added to the show.  They were just as entertaining, and I found myself laughing a lot.  Overall, these characters are extremely likable, and VERY funny.  (There\'s 4 little sisters total.  5 if you want to include Tamaki.)Art and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art in this anime is a very interesting mix.  On one hand, we have the normal animation, which is this really strange half-chibi mix where the characters sort of look chibi, but they\'re not.  The other one is a straight up chibi art style that makes everyone a chibi.  Kind of weird considering that there are scenes where the tallest person in the room, and the shortest person in the room are the same height due to chibi logic.  Regardless, the animation does work really well for this anime, adding more to its comedic aspect, making it more joyful and overall, really fun to watch.  It has very light colors and a decent looking background, as well as distinct hair colors for every character so you know exactly who is who.The sound is your typical fast-paced music.  The OP is very catchy and fast, with a skippy beat that makes it easy to sort of dance along to.  The ED\'s vary from episode to episode, and all have their own distinct feel on every one of them.  There\'s also some pretty good piano tracks and some good sad music as well.  While the soundtrack is pretty decent, it\'s still your usual slice of life upbeat soundtrack.Personal Enjoyment (9/10): Whenever I watch anime of a repeated/overdone genre, I always try to find something that\'s different than the rest of the anime in that category.  If not, I dump it.  Gj-bu surprised me greatly because of just how addicting and cute the characters were as I was watching it.  It has this really unique touch to the typical slice of life that I cannot explain, which probably makes it why I enjoy this anime so much.  I laughed a great deal while watching it, and enjoyed every last ridiculous moment.  I wouldn\'t say this isn\'t the best slice of life\'s out there, (Clannad Afterstory takes that position in my opinion), but it is very fun to watch, and a fun way to kill time.  While sadly, this anime does not get a season 2, I still enjoyed it to the fullest, and promised to rewatch it any time I want to.  The characters were great, the art was pretty good, the soundtrack and story were done before, but I would highly suggest it to anyone who loves a good and fun little series.Overall score: 8.05 The story of Gj-bu is nothing special or new in the anime world.  To put it simply, it\'s about the daily ""club activities"" of the Gj club, a club that apparently, everyone in the school avoids for some odd reason.

While the soundtrack is pretty decent, it\'s still your usual slice of life upbeat soundtrack.Personal Enjoyment (9/10): Whenever I watch anime of a repeated/overdone genre, I always try to find something that\'s different than the rest of the anime in that category.  If not, I dump it.  Gj-bu surprised me greatly because of just how addicting and cute the characters were as I was watching it.  It has this really unique touch to the typical slice of life that I cannot explain, which probably makes it why I enjoy this anime so much.  I laughed a great deal while watching it, and enjoyed every last ridiculous moment.  I wouldn\'t say this isn\'t the best slice of life\'s out there, (Clannad Afterstory takes that position in my opinion), but it is very fun to watch, and a fun way to kill time.  While sadly, this anime does not get a season 2, I still enjoyed it to the fullest, and promised to rewatch it any time I want to.  The characters were great, the art was pretty good, the soundtrack and story were done before, but I would highly suggest it to anyone who loves a good and fun little series.Overall score: 8.05', 'This will probably be the shortest review I‚Äôll have ever written.GJ-bu, or Good Job Club, is a plotless no-aim slice of life comedy about a guy and his harem in a highschool club where they don‚Äôt really do anything.

However, in spite of myself, I enjoyed the anime quite a bit. It proved to be entertaining and had some good laughs in it. All in all, if you aren\'t obsessed with any other anime right now, and don\'t have any you REAAALLY want to start, this is a great anime to kill some time with.Story:I gave it a 5, because, well, there was none really.

I found myself loving the characters without realizing it, so much so that when it ending i was crying not because of a really sad ending or anything, just because it was ending. If you watch this expect nothing but comedy really, and not even great jokes but something that could put a smile on your face. ', 'GJ Club is a show that if you come in uninitiated you will likely be bewildered by the concept and left confused after the pilot.The best way to think about this show is that of a Saturday morning cartoon show rather than a plot driven anime series as episodes act more like a series of events only related by chronology often not having larger impact on the characters outside of running gags or callbacks.The plot is simple Kyouya ""Kyolo"" Shinomiya is forced to join the GJ Club after an unfortunate run in with the clubs members. While this isn\'t shown it is how it is...described. The show then centers on Kyolo being teased and entertained on a day to day basis by a colorful cast of likable female characters.Mao Amatsuka: President of the GJ Club and oldest of the Amatsuka family (despite being the shortest), due to her short stature she has a  napoleon complex of sorts which causes her to be a massive tsundere who handles her emotions in often violent ways (such as biting Kyolo when he mentions her height or angers her)Shion Sumeragi: A genius in her own right who lacks common sense and has a general chill attitude towards others. She comes off the most aloof in her attitude, often the hardest to read out of the group. She is the vice president of the club and a chess prodigy who will rarely be seen away from her computer where she plays virtual chess.Kirara Bernstein: A tall girl with cat-like tendencies. Kirara is where the show REALLY shows it\'s wacky side with Kirara possessing strange traits that make her similar to a cat such as the distinctive cat ear like hair and extreme acrobatics. She is a foreigner from Canada and thus doesn\'t speak Japanese at a fluent level often speaking in simple words. While she understands Japanese perfectly she just has trouble speaking it.Megumi Amatsuka: Mao\'s younger sister and Kyolo\'s closest friend in the club (seemingly). She is the most normal of the group with her kind nature and motherly attitude. She is the one who cooks for the group and can be found making tea for Kyolo in almost every episode.Outside of these characters we have the little sister characters Seira Amatsuka, Kasumi Shinomiya and Geraldine (Jill) Bernstein, a late joiner in the club Tamaki Kannazuki who is a sweet obsessed brat with a laid back abrasive attitude and finally the Amatsuka sister\'s maid Mori who is a houseworker for the 3.These characters aren\'t really main characters as they either aren\'t members of the GJ Club thus not in every episode or a member who joined late thus being in only about the latter half of the season.The show is formulated in segments lasting about 5 or 6 minutes each in which the characters tackle a new situation such as creating Kyouya\'s nickname or Mao attempting to fix a light bulb while being too short to do so and too stubborn to accept help. The charm of the show comes in how lighthearted it is, you really don\'t need to worry about much other than to enjoy what is being presented.If there is anything exceptionally notable about this show when it comes to the episodes is they feel surprisingly short despite being 23 minutes each which can be a plus if you want a show to just throw on in the background while doing something.The comedy hits in most scenes being at least humoring and at best laugh worthy, and the sentimental scenes don\'t drag on too long but last just long enough that it doesn\'t take away from the overall vibe of the show.Without spoiling anything I do think episode 12 of this show is a genuine masterpiece that ties all the fragmented segments of the show together in a neat and tidy way and truly gives a good send off for the show. I do believe this is the best part of the show and I encourage giving it a try for that alone as I often find it hard to find a slice of life like this that leaves off on a truly satisfying ending.Outside of plot and character the opening for the show is amazing and really grows on you after a 2nd or 3rd viewing, the mixing on the opening isn\'t the best but in my opinion it works in it\'s benefit and really sells the charm of the show in it\'s lack of complete professionalism while still being high quality. The show has 4 separate outros all extremely good and all significant to certain characters or just the show as a whole, the outros changing every 2 episodes until episode 6 in which the outro remains the same until the end.The quality will be low in most places you watch it however this does not take away from the utterly adorable animation and character designs that just please the eye, while it may be a bit low res at times it\'s still undeniable that the characters are adorable.Overall and in conclusion I think GJ Club is a must watch for anybody who can take off their elitist hat for a minute and just watch something good and fun to remind them what life is really about, having fun with people and making stories that will last a lifetime even once those friendships fade. And to any slice of life fan this will be a treat as you are likely already used to shows with lacking plot sold by their well designed and likable characters.Give GJ Bu a try as I\'m sure if you know what you\'re getting into after reading this you\'ll enjoy it for what it is, just plain old fun and something that can make even the cold dead heart of a redditor warm up with glee. described.

Also, lots of spoilers here, so read a different review if you just want a general thesis on the nature of the anime. This review is more along the lines of something you read after you have seen it and just want to read someone else\'s opinion.Oh, and I will bring this up right now just to get it out of the way. How the hell did Doga...Kobo, being as little of a production company as it is, manage to acquire the rights to show the characters eating legitimate McDonalds onscreen, right down to the logo and bag being exactly the same? It is introduced right off the bat when you watch it and I found it to be quite hilarious. They even bring up Burger King and KFC, too.Basically, well the characters are distinct from each other, they resort to some pretty high extremes to torture Kyolo at times and none of these situations ever have him win. I know this is a common trope in anime, but the fact that Kyolo has no perverted traits about him whatsoever makes this pretty sad, to say the least.Oh, and before I go on further about the anime itself, I also want to bring up the very cruel running gag where Kyolo asked one of Mao\'s maids, Mori, to twirl once for him. I thought this was just going to be a one-off joke where Mao teased Kyolo for asking a maid to twirl, but it got progressively worse overtime.First and foremost, the maid decides to twirl whenever she sees Kyolo. He enjoys it, and was not asking her to do it. So, does this mean that he just gets teased every time he enjoys it? No, he gets tortured every time he enjoys it. I am talking sadistic smiles on everybody as they all kick him to the ground, effectively shattering the character development of a few of them; most notably, Megu, whom should come off as the innocent one of the club, but is willing to torture Kyolo the same as everyone else whenever her maid twirls for Kyolo on her own accord. This alone dropped my overall rating of the anime halfway through as I planned on giving it a higher one otherwise. I am not a big fan of torture porn that is unjustifiable. I will point it out again in case you forgot why I was upset over this:1) Kyolo only asked Mori one time to twirl for her and everyone simply teased him for it. Mori, again by her own accord, always twirled whenever she saw Kyolo and everyone always disrespected Kyolo for this.2) More importantly, well Kyolo had a positive reaction to this every time she twirled, this was by no means a perverted one where he was drooling or anything. If you watched this, you know Kyolo is pretty innocent.And speaking of, most of the KTP is heavily unjustified in this anime. He gets bagged on at random points for virtually no reason and it is almost always due to a spontaneous decision by Mao. On top of that, everyone agrees to do it and they take the sadistic torture part a bit too far on most, if not all of them. It gets rather tedious and, due to how stoic Kyolo is, you feel more sympathy for him than you do for the girls. In most harems, this is a common trope, but I have never seen it pushed so far like this. And in every other harem I have seen, the main male lead normally has an advantage in at least a few of the torture situations.Speaking of Kyolo, I suppose I can finally dive into the positives now.Well, that is, after I bring up one more of the KTP bits. This one, in particular, convinced me that this anime was not worthy of a higher rating. Basically, in the episode, we find out that Kyolo drew honest descriptions of everybody in the room. The first one to be angered, Mao, is understandable because she was drawn pretty hilariously in is drawing and the usual brief, Mao exclusive KTP takes place.Shion is next and her description is fitting, yet complementary of her main attributes. Despite this, she (somehow) gets enraged by this and steals Mao\'s shtick as she, too, gnaws at him. This was basically hinting that, even if his drawings were mildly offensive, he is doomed to at least some degree of punishment. Speaking of which, the same thing happens to Megu, though this is a little justifiable due to hers also being pretty offensive. And once again, they throw a character out of, well, character, and she leaps at Kyolo as well. Humorously enough, though, her gnawing has no effect at all and Kyolo just stands there confused.And, probably the only time Kyolo is actually shown a little sympathy, is when Kirara begins to attack. Knowing how strong Kirara is, seeing her bite Kyolo would be quite frightening and she aims for his head, effectively, yet slowly, shattering his skull; prompting Mao and Shion to actually step in and save him. Hey, at least they are not completely sadistic. They only aim to torture him to the point of death, not actual death.But, anyway, back to Kyolo and, now, the positives. He is one of the most respectful male protagonists I have ever seen in a harem. He is not perverted in any way whatsoever (honestly, I doubt he was aroused by the maid twirling, so do not bring that up) and simply aims to help anyone in need. As I said before, he is stoic, but he takes it to the extremes; and even mentions in one episode that he chooses not to be angry with anyone.He admits that he can get annoyed, but he would rather not upset the people around him. Now, if we had a Mao torture porn, I am all game for that. Little bitch does not deserve Kyolo\'s friendship and, until now, I have never gone so far as to call a female character in an anime a bitch, but this character rightfully deserves the title due to her actions being fully unnecessary almost all of the time. She is honestly worse than Yuna and that is a BIG statement coming from me since she is from my most hated anime.As for the other characters, well, as I said earlier, the KTP segments ruin what development they would have, but I will go more on that later. I will only bring up a few since most of them are pretty generic. Out of all the girls, I admire Shion the most as she is probably the most sympathetic towards Kyolo out of everyone else and she has the least creepiest smile during the torture porn scenes; hinting that, perhaps, she does feel bad for Kyolo whenever the KTP segments take place. Also, her intelligence was quite the funny running gag, as it referenced how little common sense she had.Another positive were a few of the comedy bits. My favorite running gag is probably Yo-Man. I heavily admire how Kyolo is just able to transform into the generic bad-ass male protagonist whenever he wants, right down to sporting a bigger line (nose) on his face, the narrower eyes and even attitude adjustment. On top of that, with only one exception, he barely breaks out of character. I honestly wanted at least one of the episodes to show him be Yo-Man the entire time to see how disastrous it would be for the females. For instance, him successfully escaping the KTP segments or, after enjoying Mori twirl again, successfully blocks all of the kicks that approach him. If that episode was a real thing, I would rate this two whole points higher for that alone.Besides that, I loved it whenever Geraldine entered the room as her English was pretty enjoyable and that is a trait I do not often see in anime where a character speaks entirely in English. I have seen one where one of the characters can speak English, and that is still one of my favorite comedies. But, having one character exclusively speak it was interesting.Um, let\'s see, I also liked the segments where Shion would bring up one of her brothers and it showed all of them in silhouette form until she revealed what one of them did. All this really does is show the silhouette with tools for whatever task he does. For instance, if Shion brings up how one of her brothers usually cooked her breakfast for her, one of the silhouettes in the background would go to the front part of the segment screen and show his cooking tools. It was pretty enjoyable to me.Now, onto the neutrals. Being an anime centered on a club, I was not surprised to see the characters not leave the room whatsoever. That being said, I believe I have only seen a few of these, but the other ones at least had them occasionally leave the room occasionally whenever they decided to play a sport or something. I was a little disappointed that they were solely in the club room the whole time, besides one episode where Mao invited Kyolo out to eat so that she could have a kid\'s meal.Yeah, I forgot to mention, but Mao falls under the ""younger than I look"" trope and is actually the oldest out of all the protagonists. Besides that, the last episode actually has Kyolo and Shion walk outside the school so that she could acquire a beverage. That is probably the last time they ever exit the school. Hell even the infamous ""beach episode"" that most anime have was not followed with this one. They just wore their swimsuits in the club room and that was it.My final thoughts on GJ-bu are that it breathed a lot of potential, delivered some really unique comedy at some points, but suffers due to the heavy amount of KTP which nearly prompted me to write a review after only four episodes to recommend not watching this. However, I stuck it out to the end and I do not regret it as it gave me a more balanced opinion, as opposed to just giving up on it and not seeing what else it had to offer.I will also bring up one more thing that, well, still does not justify Mao\'s actions. Megu always whispered to Kyolo how Mao usually did the things she did to him because she was ""shy"" or something like that. I suppose you could call Mao somewhat ""tsundere"" then with this logic, but barely. Her actions still do not make much sense.Oh, one major thing I forgot to bring up was that nearly every new character introduced (all female, basically) always had some form of grudge towards Kyolo. The worst was probably Seira, whom had some of the most sadistic statements in the entire anime. Well the girls simply engaged in regular KTP most of the time, Seira was hellbent on killing Kyolo if he ""had his way"" with any of the girls. It was a bit dark for a comedy whenever she talked, too. A bit of a mix of cringe and fear.Fear not, though, for this was also a part of one of its many unique traits. Seira apparently has a disembodied soul in her hair accessory that mutters dark thoughts for what we find out to be no reason whatsoever. Kyolo apparently just has to ""put up with it"" and Mao is the one that brings it up when she asks if she was hearing the voices as well. This probably could have been a lot more sadistic if Mao knew that Kyolo could hear the voice, but instead teased him about it.I could go on a bit longer, but I think I will stop here cause this is just a SoL after all and only twelve episodes on top of that. I can simply say it is an adequate comedy and if you want new offerings, but can tolerate an innocent character suffering a lot throughout the whole ordeal, then give it a go. I enjoyed it for the good bits it did offer, but they did not outweigh the bad bits enough to give it a high rating. Kobo, being as little of a production company as it is, manage to acquire the rights to show the characters eating legitimate McDonalds onscreen, right down to the logo and bag being exactly the same? It is introduced right off the bat when you watch it and I found it to be quite hilarious.

They just wore their swimsuits in the club room and that was it.My final thoughts on GJ-bu are that it breathed a lot of potential, delivered some really unique comedy at some points, but suffers due to the heavy amount of KTP which nearly prompted me to write a review after only four episodes to recommend not watching this. However, I stuck it out to the end and I do not regret it as it gave me a more balanced opinion, as opposed to just giving up on it and not seeing what else it had to offer.I will also bring up one more thing that, well, still does not justify Mao\'s actions. Megu always whispered to Kyolo how Mao usually did the things she did to him because she was ""shy"" or something like that. I suppose you could call Mao somewhat ""tsundere"" then with this logic, but barely. Her actions still do not make much sense.Oh, one major thing I forgot to bring up was that nearly every new character introduced (all female, basically) always had some form of grudge towards Kyolo. The worst was probably Seira, whom had some of the most sadistic statements in the entire anime. Well the girls simply engaged in regular KTP most of the time, Seira was hellbent on killing Kyolo if he ""had his way"" with any of the girls. It was a bit dark for a comedy whenever she talked, too. A bit of a mix of cringe and fear.Fear not, though, for this was also a part of one of its many unique traits. Seira apparently has a disembodied soul in her hair accessory that mutters dark thoughts for what we find out to be no reason whatsoever. Kyolo apparently just has to ""put up with it"" and Mao is the one that brings it up when she asks if she was hearing the voices as well. This probably could have been a lot more sadistic if Mao knew that Kyolo could hear the voice, but instead teased him about it.I could go on a bit longer, but I think I will stop here cause this is just a SoL after all and only twelve episodes on top of that. I can simply say it is an adequate comedy and if you want new offerings, but can tolerate an innocent character suffering a lot throughout the whole ordeal, then give it a go. I enjoyed it for the good bits it did offer, but they did not outweigh the bad bits enough to give it a high rating.', 'GJ-bu is a very cute and funny anime about friends who hang out in a club room.Genres: Comedy, Harem, School Life, Slice of LifeStory: 9It takes place in a club room in a high school. Mostly what they do is hang out there and for a few minutes and then the fun starts. They mostly do random things every episode and try to mess with the only male character in the club. Each one has a little crush for the male character who is know as Kyouya.Characters: 10There you will meet 6 characters, Mao Amatsuka (the short and egotistical president),  Megumi Amatsuka (Mao\'s sister...who\'s as generous as an angel), Kirara Bernstein (who is perpetually hungry),  Shion Sumeragi  ( a genius lacking in common sense), Kyouya Shinomiya (the only male character who is very nice and shy), Tamaki Kannadzuki (she comes later in the show). There\'s also 3 supporting characters, Shinrabanshou (a maid), Kasumi Shinomiya (Kyoro\'s little sister), Geraldine Bernstein (Kirara little sister).Sounds: 9the opening theme song is called"" Mousou Koukan Nikki"" by Otome ShintoEnjoyment: 10there\'s no reason not to watch this show its very funny and its fun to watch for those who hadn\'t i recommend this one.

In short, the only...thing this show is missing is true story development (Well, and more Kasumi), which is kind of what this type of show does, so I forgive that. Even the characters you don\'t particularly like you can\'t help but not hate. They all have good qualities and give something to the show, whether it\'s mostly comedy, or mostly cute moments, not of them are just there as glue to keep the show together.Sound&Art: The art and sound are nothing special in particular, but they are nice, and the style of art suits the genre of show, so there won\'t be any of that ""This is a good show, but the art isn\'t quite right..."" feeling you can get from some anime. (In short, Kasumi Kawaii!!!)Setting: The show takes place almost exclusively in one room, but unlike many shows that do this, it\'s not EXCLUSIVELY in one room. The characters are occasionally seen in different places (For example, Kasumi is seen out on the street, and reading in her brother\'s room). This helps you to get the feeling of the club atmosphere because you\'re there so often, but not to feel like the show is trapped or that it is being ""acted out"" by the characters. It feels natural to be in that room because it\'s not constant, but you still always get carried back (I want to carry Kasumi back...).Personal Feelings (Rant): This show was very good, but I can\'t help but feel like I missed out on a masterpiece. GJ-Bu had so much potential that it hurts to see it stand where it is. If there was more development in the story, and it focused more on the protagonist and his relationships with the heroines, then this show could have easily been rated a ten. In particular if the protagonist, Kyoro, and the apparent main heroine, Mao, had developed some sort of serious relationship during the show, and if Kasumi was more than a short appearance every once and a while, this show would be through the roof. Mao is where I feel really disappointed in the show because she is such a great character and had so much potential, but was seemingly given the ""Never growing, never changing"" curse by the writer. Mao could have easily been the best heroine of the year, but the type of show didn\'t allow for it. All I can hope is that some fan of the show or novels creates a doujin to give the characters the story they deserve, and that I can find it...quickly.Thank you for reading through my rant... thing this show is missing is true story development (Well, and more Kasumi), which is kind of what this type of show does, so I forgive that.

But that's the best way to sum up this anime, completely random.It's very hard to write this review, as there isn't much really to comment on. It's a 12 episode comedy/slice of life with 1 OVA and has few flaws, but in my opinion is worth the watch. In this review, I will tell you why I believe this.I'd also like to start by saying that this anime has little romance, and no harem...in it. So if you wanted that kind of thing, I don't suggest this anime.*This review will contain no major spoilers (There isn't much to spoil, as there is no plot line)*Story: 6To put it plain and simply, there isn't one. It's about a group of friends having fun and doing crazy things in their clubroom, it's hard to comment over this because it has not plot line, and I recon you could watch the anime out of order and it would still make some sense. It shows high-school kids doing the unthinkable. The Slice of Life genre seems to be popular, so for those liking this genre along with comedy and you enjoyed animes like Lucky Star, this is a must watch.Art: 9The art really was one of the animes strong points. In my opinion, the art was great. They used Chibi characters along with normal ones to emphasise a characters anger and frustration in that given moment. I loved the use of bright colors, and believed it gave the anime a much lighter look as it should have when dealing with this genre.Sound: 8I personally liked the soundtrack, nothing more to it.Charecter: 8All the characters where different in many ways. Trying not to spoil it here but for instance, Shion. She is a genius, and your typical know it all. But when it comes to common sense, she lacks in some areas. Kind of relating to animes such as The Pet Girl Of Sakurasou, this makes for a funny and entertaining character. Every character is relatable to, (Except Kirara. If you can relate to Kirara, go see a doctor) and they all make the series more enjoyable.Enjoyment: 10This anime was made to enjoy. I believe that this was a well executed anime, using the slice of life genre and comedy made it all the better.Overall: 8I can understand why this anime gets hate. This anime is not for everyone and anyone, it's one of those animes that you either love or hate.

It is THE generic harem anime.  If you have ever watched a harem slice-of-life and thought, ""Wow, I want more of that show,"" then you\'re in luck because this show is basically just a single serving of \'more...of that.\'Do you want to know the plot of GJ-bu? There is no plot to GJ-bu. A boy is in a club that does nothing with a bunch of cute girls, and together, they have wacky shenanigans. That is all the plot there is. The very first scene is a silly skit, before you even know the character\'s names. This show does not waste time. If I had to summarize the experience of GJ-bu in one sentence, I would tell you that, in GJ-bu, there is a beach episode in which they never leave the changing room. It knows what you\'re here for, and it delivers it, streamlined.Being nothing you haven\'t seen before doesn\'t a good show make on its own - in fact, that\'s almost entirely a negative more often than not - and GJ-bu knows that as well. The one thing this show excels in above all else is the little touches. This show is basically a love letter to every harem anime that came before it, and as such, all of its aping and classic gags come with that added degree of heart. It\'s sincere, more than anything, which is what bumps this up from a 7 to and 8 in my book.The characters themselves are able to tread the fine line between being wacky caricatures and relatable people like its nothing. The designs can be a little off-putting at first, with the technicolor hairstyles and sharp outlines, but it grows on you really quickly once it\'s all in motion, thanks to the talents of the animators at Doga Kobo. They\'re silly and cliche\'d when they need to be for a joke, but there are plenty of slow, character-driven moments that exist only to give them just that tiniest little bit of necessary depth rather than aim for pure comedy all the time. The time spent giving them actual tangible personality really pays off by the time you finish the final episode, which is a marvelous send-off to everything the series had built up so far. The intention of these characters is not just to make you laugh - it\'s to make sure you miss them once it\'s all over.Outside of the actual plot itself (or lack thereof), perhaps the single greatest part of the entire show is the animation and music for the ending credits themes. There are four total ending credits themes over the course of the twelve episodes - two episodes each for the first three and six for the final - and they are all nice in their own ways, with some of them even being spectacular. The first one is cute, the second one is astounding (featuring the always impressive vocals of Suzuko Mimori), the third is feverish and dance-inducing as all get-out, and the fourth is an endearing reminder of the way these characters get along together and only serves to underline the show\'s entire purpose. They\'re catchy, memorable, and they\'ll do a great job of keeping you watching to see the after-credits scenes (which are also a really nice touch and important to some of the impact of the finale, so don\'t skip them). Even if you don\'t end up watching the show, at least look up the ending themes; you owe yourself that much.In summation... It\'s just fine. Go watch it. of that.\'Do you want to know the plot of GJ-bu? There is no plot to GJ-bu. A boy is in a club that does nothing with a bunch of cute girls, and together, they have wacky shenanigans.

Even if you don\'t end up watching the show, at least look up the ending themes; you owe yourself that much.In summation... It\'s just fine. Go watch it.', ""Long time since I wrote a review but I felt that this series justified a review...Cos this is one of the better slice-of-life series that I've watched. Well honestly, I've watched Acchi Kocchi too and I felt that the premise and setting was also quite similar in a way... but somehow GJ-Bu exudes a different feel, which explains why I completed GJ-Bu but stopped Acchi Kocchi at ep 4 or 5.Anyways, about this show, it is basically a club activity, and its interesting main and side characters. It's about slacking around, but what makes this so interesting? To me, the story only got a...bit boring in a few moments of this series, since it treads on quite a narrow storyline (about a club activity and some relations). To be honest, I've never read the manga but I suspect it is a 4-koma since it seems to be quite episodic. This series isn't really comedy, but has quite a lot of funny parts. More importantly, it has some warm and fuzzy moments, kinda reminded me of Hobbes when I watch Mao or Kirara lol.Anyways, in short, this is a show for people who like slice-of-life anime. bit boring in a few moments of this series, since it treads on quite a narrow storyline (about a club activity and some relations).

He\'s one of the only guys I know who is interested in shojo type manga/anime, and when he found out that was my favorite genre, he recommended me this. My other friends and I actually watched a few episodes together, and while they were watching Fate, I was in my room finishing this. There\'s not much story to this. It\'s basically about four girls and a guy in some made up club at their high school, and they do random shit. It\'s one of those. Normally, I wouldn\'t be up to something...like this unless it\'s super funny. This show is very funny, but there are some moments where I\'m just, ""What the fuck is this shit?"" Something kept me from stop watching this whole in general, but I can\'t put my finger on what it is. It\'s not the best slice of life I\'ve seen, but it\'s not bad either. I rate this portion an 8 out of 10.Art: The art is very cutesy because it\'s meant for girls, but guys can watch it, too (i.e. Neeraj). I don\'t see anything that distastes me in this department. I mean the evil looks on the girls\' faces and the shocked expressions on Kyoya\'s are always enjoyable to see. I\'d rate this 10/10.Sound: This anime has one opening and four endings songs. Two of the four ending songs and the opening are annoying as hell. They are so annoying that they aren\'t even enjoyable. The only songs I like in this anime are the second ending and the last ending that\'s played the rest of the episodes, starting episode I forgot. Out of those two, the last ending song is my favorite. For those reasons, I\'d rate this a 6 out of 10.Character: There are five main characters: Kyoya, Mao, Megumi, Kirara, and Shion. Kyoya is the only boy in the GJ Club, and he\'s clearly the character who has to suffer through the girls\' antics in every episode. It\'s slice of life, so you should expect crazy shit to happen. Mao is the president of the GJ Club, and she is the shortest girl, which you will clearly see that it\'s a shortcoming. Outside of school, she is seen as an elementary school student, which really pisses her off. Megumi is Mao\'s little sister, and she prepares tea for every club meeting. She is very cute, but she gets pissed off about her weight. I\'m assuming Kirara is one of those American students that decided to live in Japan for her high school years. Her last name gives it away; plus, she has a little sister, Geraldine, who can really speak Japanese, but she writes in it very well. Then, we have Shion, who has a clan full of big brothers who are very good at the jobs they have. She\'s also a genius, but she hates to show it off. Out of all the girls, I would say that Mao is the most annoying. I know you\'re probably going to yell at me about why I\'m picking on the leader of the club, but she says she hates being older and shorter than her sister, but she acts like a complete child. The other girls are enjoyable though. I rate this section 9 out of 10.Enjoyment: Not only is this anime a slice of life, it\'s also a comedy. Some of the activities Kyoya has to go through are very funny, but there are times when you feel bad for him because he didn\'t deserve to get beaten up or having to be the center of attention. Sometimes, they are hiliarous. Other times, you hate the girls for it. There are some moments when they make some female sex jokes, but I don\'t find them funny half of the time. Still, I\'d go for 9/10 on the scale.Overall: Adding the numbers up, the main score is a rounded up 8/10. like this unless it\'s super funny.

In this room the characters share many hilarious times with one another and I simply could not stop watching once I started. This show is definitely something to be admired for; from the amazing characters that are the sole focus of the show to the setting which is used to even further develop the occasion of the episode. Never before has a SoL so strongly grabbed and held my attention and excitement throughout the entire show,...even though it is placed in such a simple setting. This show is, in my opinion of course, most excellent for anyone who loves to watch anime for its characters and the simplicity of their lives together. Now for the little bit more organized and little bit less fanboy-opinion part of the review.Story: 8Being a Slice of Life, albeit unique, the story is faint and not all too important in the series. Some things are left unexplained, as curious as they may be, but I feel it is for the sake of the show and it might not have needed such explained. I give it an 8 out of 10 because this one is carefully developed throughout the show and still better than some that I've seen which are nothing but story.Art: 8GJ-bu has a fairly generic art style but it is still done well and you can see that it is not just a piece of rushed work, it actually had time put into it. Also there are little bits in the work's setting that I really enjoyed seeing that made me happy and sad (not a disappointed sadness but emotional).Sound: 9There were moments where I couldn't help notice how perfectly the music and sounds fit the scene and furthered the overall quality of said scenes. I am not any analyst on particular noises and effects to use however I can personally appreciate when something fits into its place well.Character: 10These characters are phenomenal. Although there are slight hints of tropes within them it is not so overplayed that they become boring and predictable. Rather it aids their personalities and really makes them seem like they deserve to have a show based entirely around them. The characters are by far the best part of the show and I couldn't stop myself from clinging on to some of them.Enjoyment: 10No show that I've watched before has had me so utterly amused (granted I don't watch many comedies) to the point in which every episode seemed like happiness was flowing out from the show and straight into my soul. The comedy is hilarious and refreshing, and a highlight of the show to say the least.Overall: 9I cannot say this show is one of The Greats that is to be admired for centuries to come, but it is definitely a show worth experiencing for one's self.

For me, watching GJ-bu feels like falling in love. The characters are all acted extraordinarily, and their interactions and scripting is top-notch. They have become part of me.When I watch this show, I clear a little place in my heart for all the characters, and it's like everything they do is orchestrated just for me, to give me what I crave: sweet, kind, funny interaction between people who really care about each other. This was a show that was made with love. The restaurant scene shows this perhaps the best,...but there are dozens, and maybe hundreds of little moments that are acted out and drawn with such care and attention. Not so much attention to detail, but attention to emotional impact. I have never been so emotionally satisfied by an anime as I have been by GJ-bu. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of others that satisfy me in other ways, but as for that feeling of contentedness after the show is over, none have beat GJ-bu. Angel Beats could have done it, but that ending... ouch.Anyway, I'm not making a career out of writing reviews, so I'll just leave it at this, the core of what I had to say about this fantastic, endearing, heartwarming, and hilarious show. If you enjoyed Nichijou, Lucky Star, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, you will certainly enjoy this one.I'll add this one little detail: if at all possible, watch it with headphones on.

However this is a cutesy slice of life nothing happens anime. At least this thing looks pretty, but I have to say for a slice of life if you don\'t have an interesting plot, I want to see interesting characters. The characters were all ""cute"" static boring things. Though to be fair you cant do much with a short series except i feel like you can but I\'m sure someone will make that excuse for it. The show gives you...a few characters with traits and shows you what would happen if the characters did this or that, nothing truly exceptional... a few characters with traits and shows you what would happen if the characters did this or that, nothing truly exceptional...', ""This is my first time writing a review. English is not my native language. please forgive me if I make any beginners mistakes.GJ-bu, a slice of life comedy. I began this series because I was bored, expecting it to be 'another' crappy harem series. Turns out it doesn't have allot of romance in it, but is really, an amusing comedy.Many slice of life series try so hard to be more funny than they actually are.. GJ-bu stands out, by not trying to stand out. in a good way.Story: 6This series is mostly, just the main characters doing amusing things in their club room....They play chess, drink tea, eat unhealthy food.There actually isn't much more to this. Still, it was really fun to watch and I was never bored throughout the series. Each character has its own set of jokes and puns that go with it. Most series based around this concept tend to get old after about 6 episodes. GJ-bu managed to keep the same level of amusement the entire series. They didn't try to go over the top with their jokes and punsSince there is no real story line, but really well planned episodes. a 6 seems fairArt: 8The art was surprisingly good. On close-ups the characters were double vectored and at a distance you are still able to make out what is happening. I really love the colors they used. The light warm colors give off a cozy atmosphere which absolutely fits the series.The amount of angles from which the room was drawn is amazing. I didn't count them or anything, but I noticed I never really saw much of the same backgrounds.There were no real unacceptable mistakes in the animation, characters nicely drawn, allot of variation for just one room. But no real extraordinary things. it's worthy of an 8.Sound: 7The Japanese characters were voiced well, they had voices fitting them.The ones who supposedly spoke English had such a terrible accent. I wasn't sure whether they didn't have enough money to hire English VA's, they were making fun of the Japanese accent or if the characters were lingually-handicapped.There aren't a lot of BGMs, but the ones they did have added something to the situation. Making it more funny or serious.I liked the beginning of the OP. It's not often that you find such a cheeky little rap. But the rest of the OP was completely average for a SoL highschool comedy.There were 4 EDs which were rather catchy but nothing special.Nice voice cast, OK OST, OP and EDs a 7 seems about right.Characters: 8The main cast consists of 6 characters. 5 girls and a boy.Mao, The club president: A cheeky little girl. kind of bossy. She seems rude, but that is mostly because she likes the main character, Kyouya (kyoro). Again, this is not a harem series. they don't take her liking him to, too much of an issue. She spends most of her time keeping the rest of the club from being bored to death by annoying them.Megumi, Mao's younger sister: She may be the younger one, but is more mature for her age. in body and mind. I could still sense the Mao was the older sister. Mao is way more bossy and experienced in life (not in a sexual way). She spends her time making tea and baking cakes and cookies.Kirara, the mysterious one: Most of the time, when there's a mysterious character in anime that character gets ditched or becomes annoying after he or she's not mysterious anymore. Kirara stays mysterious and interesting as the girl who eats meat and sits in the room. She spends her time eating meat.Shion, the elegant one: She doesn't know much of the outside world and lacks common knowledge on food and other activities for ordinary people. luckily kyoro is there to support her on this issue. She spends her time playing chess.Kyouya (kyoro), aka ORE-MAN: The protagonist of this story. He's the only boy in the good job club. all of the little stories per episode involve him.Tamaki: Halfway the series, she was suddenly introduced as one of the main characters. It turns out her role isn't all that big. She's like mao in a lot of ways. the moment she was introduced was the moment I thought this series was going to suck. it didn't as her role isn't all that significant.The characters are well balanced and don't get boring. Because of the insignificant role of tamaki I'm only giving it an 8.Enjoyment: 9I enjoyed this series so much more than I thought I would.

It's like a pie with no filling satisfying your appetite, an achievement without challenge leaving you fulfilled. I'd say it's is not for those who cannot forgo a deep plot, but I can't say I'm normally a fan of slice of life either, so why not give it a shot.This anime, in my opinion, was nearly flawless with it's delivery. I give it an 8 because it did feel a little too slow at times, but the beauty of it is that the show never stopped moving forward. It...never crow barred in needless romance or drama, stopping what little pacing these type of shows normally have. It put several people in a room together and let the them collide. For twelve episodes you see the GJ club live out there high school days together. Just living, the humor coming off of where these characters come together. They act, react, and grow, and every new episode leaves you wanting to see what they might do next, what new collision will occur. And by far my favorite part was it's ending. A conclusion came, and it came because it was not a farce I watched, a fantasy played out. It was people's lives, viewed through the eyes of this club.It was a pie that left me more than satisfied, grinning the whole way through, excited for their victories, and deeply saddened when it ended. I couldn't have asked for more, and recommend it wholeheartedly. never crow barred in needless romance or drama, stopping what little pacing these type of shows normally have.

But i came to realize that the art was JUST SOOOO good and the voice and the characters overall are soo ""lively"" i felt the URGE to actually watch a few more then i told myself ""know what i mind as well watch this"". So i ended up watching it and actually finishing it. And based on the anime my personal opinions are different from other but...first off the Story itself really doesn\'t have a ""plot"" the scenes are always from a different time of the day and one scene doesn\'t last as long too. I FELL in love with the art it\'s SOOo good and beautiful it\'s innocent which matches along with the story and characters. The sound is also really good it just FITS in place with everything else. CHARACTERS on the other hand have flaws First off the story never really explains the characters In FULL detail but you basically understand them already. Also the way some characters are introduced are random and kind of bad but it doesn\'t stop the anime from being enjoyable.

The track that places where it represents the midway point of the show, I somehow found that track to be.....really catchy and is something i would hear in an action anime, It does not really fit this anime but somehow i am glad that it is there because every time it reaches the midway point i get all excited to hear that track because of how action-y it sounds. The other one was the ending song, the one that they used near the latter half of the show. I like that song. That is all....Character:Kyolo- He\'s your average nice guy. There is not much to say other than he is a really calm and fun character to watch.Mao-  And She\'s your typical Tsundere like chick that always likes to mess around with the main character. She also has a special attack, the turn to Chibi Mao and bite Kyolo. I always find myself giggling at that.Shion- Once more, this character is pretty typical but even though typical, this is the type of character that i usually like in an anime filled with cute chicks. She is the smartest of the bunch and has this Ojou-sama-ness to her character. Everything she does seems sophisticated and well mannered. There are a lot of those kind of characters but Shion here lacks a lot of common sense which makes her a little bit different from the typical Ojou-sama character so it makes her just a little bit more interesting.Megumi- Her character reminds me of a really nice maid. lol. She is never seen mad until Tama says how Tama doesn\'t get fat no matter how much she eats. Megumi gets jealous and you can see her pissed off face. It\'s quite funny.Tama- To me she seems like a tomboy for some reason, probably because due to her aggressive nature. She refers to her self as Tama instead of ""Watashi"" or ""Atashi"" and i find that kind of quirky.Kirara- Ohhh yeaa the most interesting character of them all. She is from England and she is super mutha F**king strong. The way she speaks is so interesting. All her sentences are just one word. An example, if she wanted to say, ""Hey guys i am hungry let\'s go eat"", she would say ""Kirara. Hungry. Eat!"" Oh and she also does what Tama does, refers to herself as her name, Kirara. When the three seniors who graduated at the last episode, Mao and Shion did a twirl for Kyolo, but what about kirara? Nope.... she does a back flip....... A F**KING BACK FLIP!!!! Man she is so interesting.. We need more characters like her in the future animes.Jill- Kirara\'s sister. She speaks only in english. Short words. Mainly, ""My samurai master"" or ""master"" or ""sister"". She always carries a board and marker with her so she can write down Japanese for people to read since it doesn\'t seem like she can speak it well.Kasumi- Kyolo\'s Imouto. She totally has a Brother complex, doesn\'t want kyolo to be manly.Seira- The youngest of the three sisters of the Amatsuka family. Her character is of a nice young lady but she has this demon mask thing that ...i guess speaks her inner thoughts or something.. Kind of creepy but yet cute..Mori- YES THE EFFING MAID. She likes to tease Kyolo a lot and rides a motorcycle, A MAID ON A MOTORCYCLE. WOW.Enough of characters.Enjoyment and Overall: 8.5I wish this site gave the option of point fives. It would alter alot of my anime scoring on my list. ANYHOW... I am really glad i decided to re-pick this up. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys really calming slice of life shows.~Til next timeTomislol Sound:The music that plays when Kyolo and the bunch are doing random shenanigans really fits the mood of peacefulness and nothingness.

Just searched and found out there will be a second season. It won't be the same without Kirara, Shion, and Mao. We will definitely have to wait and see how everything turns out, I'm so excited!What a great mixture of different personalities. Stick them in a room together and they meld so perfectly! This was such a wonderful example of friendship.

The anime can be relaxing, soothing.', 'This is a review of the entire GJ-bu franchise. This includes: GJ-bu, GJ-bu@.1) STORY (6/10)GJ-bu is an adaptation of a 4-panel comic strip. These gag strips rarely have a self-contained story, given that it simply does not need a plotline to begin with. The way the anime portrays the 4-koma is wholly faithful, and therefore lacks substance as a result. It isn\'t that the story is poor enough that it is only given a ""fair"" rating, it is simply that there isn\'t a story because it was not necessary. Nevertheless, the show attempts to guide us through the lifespan of this GJ-bu, and does so...amicably.2) ART (6/10)Given the thematic direction of the anime, it may come across as slightly unsettling when viewers lay eyes on the first episode of GJ-bu. The beautifully striking palate of colours greet us in a manner that overshadows the characters themselves, to an extent. It is as if they put a tad bit too much makeup on the characters that may put some viewers off.It is not to say that the vibrant art style obfuscates our perception of the characters, but when trying to animate comedic scenes, it may be wiser to draw attention to the mannerisms of the characters through animation, rather than their individual illustrations.Over time, viewers are accustomed to the settings and begin to truly immerse themselves in the characters themselves instead. The art in this anime can be very pretty and illustrious at various points, showcasing the effort the production team has put into drawing the sets, but the creative directions may have strayed slightly.The art is good, but mildly inappropriate.3) SOUND (7/10)The OP and ED songs were catchy and really got viewers fired up about the episode, which is a big plus as the consistent cheerfulness of the scenes as well as the upbeat musicality make for a dreamy joyride pre- and post- episode.During the show, there were no boisterous music choices, as producers opted for very light, perky music choices instead. As a result, the scenes felt atmospherically relaxing, and does a fair job of setting the mood for any upcoming silliness.4) CHARACTER (7/10)The characters feel like stoic regurgitators of gag after gag. Yet, the jokes are funny and as a result, there is no real need to rat on the rather unmoving characteristics of the protagonists. For they are there to do their job of delivering punchlines and they do an appreciable job at that.Personally, I felt that the straight man could have done a better job with stronger lines and a tad bit more exaggeration, but nevertheless, the characters were made well enough to enjoyable and not too stereotypical so as to be off-putting.5) ENJOYMENT  (7/10)GJ-bu certainly is an enjoyable anime. The anime is a series of jokes and running jokes, and should all be taken at face-value. Whether you are watching the show after a long day or just want to kick back and relax, this show does not fail to deliver in most cases. Sure, there may be repeated jokes based on the stereotypical behaviour of the characters, but that does not mean a viewer cannot enjoy them repeatedly, as they barely get old before the series comes to a quick end after 12 episodes and 1 OVA.6) OVERALL (7/10)GJ-bu is yet another anime that seeks to charm and entertain, and it is very clear that the producers had every intention to stick to their guns till the very end.The show isn\'t a must-watch, but it certainly is a should-watch. amicably.2) ART (6/10)Given the thematic direction of the anime, it may come across as slightly unsettling when viewers lay eyes on the first episode of GJ-bu.

Lots of internet clips, and always wanting to watch it even before that. What did i expect? Club/student council/normal school slice of life, hopefully with a lot of moe and possibly some story and/or humor to go with it, like Azumanga, seitokai yakuindomo, school rumble... Or at least yuyushiki, Boku wa Tomodachi, even the somehow lower ranked Seitokai no Ichizon or Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!, which where at least entertaining to watch. What did i get? A bit of moe, absolutely no story, nearly no humor. Need i explain further why i found this to be a...disappointment?Let's go over stuff one by one. Story. There is NOTHING here beyond the mc getting to know the other girls, which he already somewhat knows at the start. And then they goof off (mostly either do boring day to day stuff, or bully the MC, or have him slightly tease the girls) and graduate, trying to make it a bit emotional, but ultimately fail... The end. They managed things a bit better in the ova/movie, which is why i rated it higher, but not by much, also it doesn't affect this review.Art. Good, nothing amazing. Sound. Good, nothing amazing either.Characters... Medeocre-decent. First you have the tiny, loud, full of herself, annoying tsundere that bites mc every time she's annoyed. Also is club president. Rather plain, rather boring aside a couple select moments. Next her sister. A polite girl, who works hard on deserts for the clubroom and making tea, and is concerned about her weight, with literally nothing else to her personality. Next is the more decent ones - a genius chess player 'cool beauty' type, who lacks common sense, and a Canadian catgirl... THING... That sadly spends most of the show in the background eating meat, barely gets to talk, but at least the scenes she does get are decently amusing.There's a couple more side characters that might as well be main because they show up more and more later, but they're not worth any mention because they're extremely plain and even more one dimensional, including the MC who's your dense 'average anime protagonist', except his beta factor is off the charts, being one of the most pitiful excuses for a man you'll see in most anime.The joy? Mediocre, as i said, i was expecting moe, some story, possibly light romance, maybe some comedy. And while there is some moe, the story goes nowhere, there's barely even any hints of romance, the best comedy bits you'll come across are 2-3 instances that might make you smile at most.Is it a good show? No, it doesn't have anything remotely interesting about it, and i really can't recommend watching it unless you're really a hardcore slice of life and school fanatic. Can i say its bad? Well, not really, though with how uneventful, average and forgettable it is, you could say it is bad from its sheer averageness.Not recommended, 5.8/10. The ova/movie is better because something actually happens and there's some emotion involved, at about 7.1/10, but i still don't recommend watching it because you'd need to watch this first. disappointment?Let's go over stuff one by one.

It's exactly what it advertises.  The characters and comedy are both great.  Not recommended if you're bored by slice of life or shows with no plot.There's not much to really say about GJ Club overall, it takes a familiar formula (high school students in a club that does nothing but goof off all day long) and just executes it to perfection.  The main cast is full of interesting and lively characters, the different situations they get into are creative and fun, and there are some funny ongoing bits like...Ore Man and Shinomiya being incredible at hair brushing.  Side characters like the maid and Shinomiya's little sister are fun when they pop up and add something new into the formula.  Shion is best girl, but there are a lot of good options to pick from.  The one character I didn't particularly care for was Tamako but she has a lighter presence than the rest of the main cast so she never gets annoying.If I had to complain about one thing, it's that Shinomiya can be sort of whiny and annoying at times.  Part of the gimmick is that he's weak and constantly gets swept along by whatever the girls want to do, so it's intentional, but he occasionally crosses the line into just being pathetic and I don't care for the cringe comedy as much.Overall though, it's difficult to find anything to complain about.  The artwork looks great, the characters are good and it's a fun watch.  One of the better examples of this sort of slice of life show. Ore Man and Shinomiya being incredible at hair brushing.

"Himesama ""Goumon"" no Jikan desu",https://myanimelist.net/anime/55774/Himesama_Goumon_no_Jikan_desu,"['""Tis Time for Torture, Princess"" is one of the most fun shows we have this season of Winter 2024.First off, I will have to share one 50/50 thought: the comedy is subjective as always.  If you enjoy the over the top commentary and dramatic animation to describe what the princess is saying (simmilar to Bocchi The Rock), then this will be right up your ally.  Otherwise, you might find the humor cringe.The show has amazing animation, and just like Bocchi The Rock, followed the original source (the manga) but made it even better and took it to a whole...another level.  The simple plot is what makes it easy to follow along, with a tag line to let you know shit\'s about to go down.  The characters are lovable, from the Princess, to Tortura, and even the Demon King, with their own personal charms that are just enjoyable to watch.  AND WE CAN\'T FORGET ABOUT THE MUSIC!  THAT OPENING AND ENDING IS A BOP! (subjective of course)  This show is one of those things you\'re not suppose to take seriously, and that\'s got to be due to its fluffy, wholesome fun.  It also parodies horrible takes people argue about commonly.  (like what part of ramen do you eat first (in the show) and what part of the chicken is more taster: wing, drum or thigh, cereal and milk (in the manga))Anyway, this show gets my recomendation for a fun, wholesome show to watch and deserves more praises than downplay. (freakin tryhard otakus)(if you\'re actually judging the show because it\'s not serious enough, you need to go outside, touch grass, and make some friends, i\'m kidding)EDIT: JUST FINISHED IT, MY OPINION AND REVIEWS STILL STANDS!

THIS SHOWS ROCKS!!!', ""Tis Time for Torture Princess is an unexpectedly delightful anime that turns the traditional concept of torture on its head. The Princess, Commander of the Imperial Third Legion, finds herself subjected to the most unconventional forms of torture by the demon lord's army.

But instead of your typical grim and dark story, they flip it on its head. Instead of the usual torture, they treat her to all sorts of crazy stuff like gourmet meals, spa days, and even playdates with cute animals. I mean, how hilarious is that?But it\'s not just the premise that\'s great. The characters are so lovable and quirky, from the princess herself to her witty sword companion, Excalibur. And let...me tell you, the voice acting and soundtrack are spot-on. They really nail the comedic tone of the show.Visually, it\'s stunning too.

It won\'t be everyone\'s cup of tea, but if given a chance, it\'s rather enjoyable with plenty of wholesome moments. When I watched the first episode, the princess\'s exaggerated reactions certainly irked me, but I felt that the show\'s overall approach seemed okay, so I continued to watch with an open mind. It took several episodes to get into it (more characters get introduced), but I did end up growing to like the show.Viewers will need to watch while keeping in mind that the tone is one of...playful satire bordering slightly on the absurd. It is not meant to be taken seriously or overanalyzed. The show also occasionally sneaks in some commentary and adorably wholesome moments that feel somewhat targeted to working adults, and those moments can really strike home. But if the viewer can\'t relate to some of these sneaky tidbits, then the show may feel a little shallow to them. (It\'s not.) I consider the show light, exaggerated, and straightforward, but not shallow.Although it\'s presented as a food anime, the show doesn\'t particularly sate my foodie cravings. There is attractive-looking food, but I feel like the focus of the show is not on the food itself. It\'s more about the cute interactions between characters and the wholesome comments scattered throughout the show. I would personally watch it as a cute pick-me-up that happens to sometimes have food in it rather than as a ""food show"". playful satire bordering slightly on the absurd.

This has a lot of the same aspects I liked about DIY, the fun, memorable characters, the clean vibrant animation (there's not as much sakuga in this one as in DIY but it's still gorgeous), and the genuinely soothing atmosphere. The show rides an incredibly fine line between sticking to a forumula and keeping things fresh. There's just enough structure and repetition to create the rhythms that allow running gags and character development to work, but every segment feels like a creative...spin on the basiuc concept, and it's always fun to see what the activity will be or how they goad the Princess into giving up a secret (not that she needs much encouragement after a certain point). While the princess is the lead, it's really a good ensemble series and every character gets at least a little arc of their own, and sometimes the show takes a detour to show us a day in one of the demon's life and the kind of things they deal with. There's a great finesse to how the show doles out background information about the characters and world without really stopping for exposition. They just kind of let you infer things, like how the Demon World is on the tech level of modern Japan, but the Human World is medieval. Stuff like that is fun and rewards paying attention.This is a great series and anyone who enjoys Slice of Life should make this one a priority, the fact that it got confirmed so quickly for a second season by the end of its first should be pretty telling that they've hit on gold and it's definitely one of my most anticipated shows now. spin on the basiuc concept, and it's always fun to see what the activity will be or how they goad the Princess into giving up a secret (not that she needs much encouragement after a certain point).

I\'m glad to say that the food bits (which I still think are the weakest parts of each episode) aren\'t a major focus despite what the poster may lead you to think, and that Goumon is the most wholesome show across this whole season.If anything, the main theme of the show is on appreciating the mundane luxuries in life. Things like walking at night to the convenience store with a friend, an...amusement park date, popping bubbles on a bubble wrap, or even ordering the same food from the same place every day, are all incredibly mundane, but the show excels in making them super comfy and highlights the importance on appreciating your regular day to day life.It also helps that the show is really funny. Surprisingly despite its main joke of ""Princess giving in too easily to \'torture\'"", it does twist it in enough ways to make each occurrence of this joke feel fresh.

And it\'s even MORE rare from a series that comes straight from the juggernauts of the Shonen genre: Shueisha themselves. Introducing to you, from said publisher\'s Shonen Jump+ (FYI, where the currently most popular series of Masaoki Shindo\'s Ruri Dragon is seralizing in): mangaka Robinson Haruhara\'s...Hime-sama ""Goumon"" no Jikan desu a.k.a \'Tis Time for ""Torture,"" Princess.The story foretells of the old-age treachery between good and evil, and that involves humans and demons. From the human side, it\'s represented by the commander, the Third Order of the Imperial Army of the Human World\'s kingdom,the Princess a.k.a Hime-sama herself. She has a trusty companion of her legendary holy sword named Excalibur (or even nicknamed Ex) that together, gained widespread recognition for her duties of dealing with their enemy, the Hell-horde demons. But one day, she, along with Ex, got captured by the demons and have been taken prisoners of war by them, and with it, comes torture...but not in the way that you expect. Since there\'s a treaty between both humans and demons regarding torturing POWs, her main captor, the Hell-horde\'s Grand Inquisitor Torture Tortura, has to ""torture"" her in unusual ways, usually in terms of food and snacks that pique her interest into fighting against her temptations, only to give in and leak secrets about their kingdom, in the hopes that their leader, the Hell-Lord, would use that information against the humans...which he does not take that opportunity to do so.First of all, let us remind ourselves that while this is pure fantasy, it\'s also a comedy show first and foremost. The relationship between Hime and Ex is quite the nonchalant comedy of back-and-forth antics, and if you\'ve got the keen eye in you, look no further than the VAs behind their characters. Both Haruka Shiraishi and Chikahiro Kobayashi have actually performed their roles together in another very notable series, and if knowledge serves you best, they are also MCs in Golden Kamuy as both the Ainu girl Asirpa and the Immortal Commander Saichi Sugimoto. So for those of you who\'ve watched the series, you\'d already know that comedy is part-and-parcel of Golden Kamuy with the never-ending insanity of its comedic shticks. While both VAs have their comedic roles exchanged for the anime, they embraced it with all of the source material\'s many ways of enduring ""torture"", and it\'s one of the reasons why this show works so wonderfully as a comedy, hook, line and sinker.As for the demons:- Torture Tortura is Hime\'s main interrogator, the highest-ranking chief Inquisitor. She who looks stoic to assert her position, specializes in food-type torture, and will boast on her abilities to keep Hime invested and tempted in revealing all of the human kingdom\'s secrets through her careless word-of-mouth confessions through appetizing and irresistable aspects of food and snacks. She has her assistant Datama to help out with her dealings to Hime.- The Oni sisters of Youki and Inki, holding the rank of Lieutorments, the intermediate-level torturers. They specialize in friendship-bonding ""torture"" and build bonds while ""pretending"" (but genuinely) wanting to be friends with Hime.- The Beast Tamer Krall, a top combatant and senior torturer, she specializes in zoo-type ""torture"", employing many ferocious beasts and cute type animals in her possessions.- Vanilla Peschutz, holding the rank of Harm-Marshal, the advanced-level torturers. A prideful, yet immature young noble vampire of her family, she boasts a lot in her ego, though like Youki and Inki, is touched by Hime in the friendship-bonding aspects as well.But none can be as fearsome as the main group of Hell-hordes: the Hell-Lord himself, who prides in being an evil, devilish character who wishes to subjugate and conquer the human world with Hime\'s endless interrogations to prep his army for possible invasions. And as the saying goes: ""Don\'t judge a book by its cover"", the Hell-horde leader...is a very respectable villain (just like Kyuujitsu no Warumono-san\'s Warumono) who also prides himself in being a demon of culture in all things Japanese, as well as a family man, alongside his lovable, mature and beautiful wife Lulune (who also serves as the queen of Hell-holm) and their only daughter Mao-Mao, the cute and pure young daughter who subjugates Hime with her innocent and childish ""torture"" that it sends her flying into her arms each and every time thanks to her adorableness. I love families like the Hell-Lord, which adds to the already comfortable feeling of warmth, especially from a character who\'s supposed to be the image of evil.The only person useless in the help for Hime\'s escape is Louch Brittan (a play on the Code Geass MC\'s name of Lelouch). Him being a holy white knight to save her from the Hellhorde\'s captivity, as capable as he is a powerful combatant, his unattractive looks as a fatso and an otaku only makes the save worse each and every time, so much that Hime feels right at home in the Hell-horde\'s 4 walls of her prison room, ready for whatever ""tortures"" she will be facing next.For a comedy series, studio Pine Jam really hit it out of the park, both in execution and ""intention"". The reason for the air quotes is that they don\'t necessarily need to produce that greatly, but thanks to debut director Youko Kanamori, whose works claim from storyboarding to episode directorial duties for major high-profile series such asn Mob Psycho 100 and Mahoutsukai no Yome a.k.a The Ancient Magus Bride, the manga is given the extra length to be adapted further from his vision down to his staff team, perfectly executing what it means to be a comedy as the main objective. From unnecessary bombastic to the cutest and charming moments ever, this is one show where love and care is given the priority, and I feel that the staff team went above and beyond to deliver the tingles on the heartstrings.The music is great and complements the show as a whole. Also, this too is also the areas of the J-Pop Anisong debuts: While shallm\'s catchy and sanguine OP song just speaks and fits the series to a T that I find myself just bopping and dancing to its tunes in joy, LEEVELLES\'s ED song...is just alright, being the stereotype of usual band-like rock songs that only sounds good, and nothing more.If there\'s a torture session I would like to be in, it\'s this show and its approach to the ""torture"" content, even if the same gags are repetitive by large.

I have often seen the new chapters on the site where I read my manga (there are 228 chapters by now, wow) and so when I saw that the series was going to be released on Crunchyroll I thought why not give it a try.After the first few episodes I was enticed to give this anime a...rating of 5, maybe 6. This is because after you have seen the first few minutes, you have basically seen the whole series, at least regarding the core structure.To start off, the series takes place in a world where humans fight against demons. The demons managed to take a princess of humanity as a hostage and are ""torturing"" her to get important information that will help them win the war. Every episode covers around 3 manga chapters, the structure of these short-stories is always the same:- Princess is about to be tortured, says she won\'t give in- Torture starts, princess begins to give in, Ex (her magical legendary sword) reminds her to stay strong- Princess gives in and tells them a secret for ending the torture- Demon King isn\'t impressed by the secret / can\'t use it well enough so the torture must continue tomorrowAs you can already see in the title, ""torture"" is not meant seriously, the tortures mostly involve delicious food or not being allowed to play with the demon kings daughter, something along those lines...While the basic structure is always the same, over time many new characters enter the story (mostly on the demon side) and help torturing the princess with their own methods.Over the course of watching this series the rating in my mind went up from 6 to 7 and then even from 7 to 8. Because while the series isn\'t that amazing or suspenseful compared to other animes, it does its job, being a feel-good-anime, really well.All the characters are cool and their interactions are always quite fun. The anime also just looks quite good, and to be honest the ED is fire.So while this kind of anime normally isn\'t really my speed, I had a fun time with it and can recommend it. Just be aware, don\'t expect too much, it is just a cute and funny show. rating of 5, maybe 6.

It should lead you on a wrong path while shifting to the punchline that is not obvious for the viewer to make a good joke.But then the thing is, they kind of try to...do so, but it\'s very immature and doesn\'t leave much room for imagination anyway, you ARE expecting the things to happen and they do.A great alternative show if one haven\'t watched before would be Sleepy Princess or Maoujou de Oyasumi.

That is about the only negative of this show that I can think of.The story here is that the Human Princess is kidnapped by the Demon army to be tortured for information and secrets that could help them out, however what ends up happening is...that the Princess develops friendships with the various Demons, revealing that she never really had the opportunity for this sort of relationship due to her upbringing.There is no actual torture here, just wholesome interactions, completely destroying any notion that the Demon Lord and his army must inherently be evil. In fact, if anything, the Human nation is shown to be more ""evil"" than anything the Demon Lord and his minions do.It\'s also quite amusing that the Human nation is shown to still be quite medieval, while the Demon nation is basically modern-day Japan.In addition to the genuine comedy that is present in every episode with the interactions, there\'s also (minor spoiler) a hilarious rip-off of an Isekai story in the final episode, that mocks the genre to the extreme and gave me the most laughs out of the entire series.The animation and art-style is also incredible for such a series, between the over-the-top facial expressions and then the insane quality of the food and especially the eating of said food.

Hisone to Maso-tan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36884/Hisone_to_Maso-tan,"[""It isn't too often that an anime can promise so much with its presentation only to vomit out a big nothing. This anime is a big, bland pile of nothing. However, this doesn't mean the anime necessarily goes the way of many other shows, staying the course and playing it safe as it fades into obscurity forever. And it isn't as if the writing is conceited enough that it makes it out to be more important than anyone would care. The problem lies in that while the anime does (at times) try to be original, relatable and emotionally engaging, it does so in the most...unfocused and impersonal way possible. (Meaning: it doesn't really do any of those things).Yes, I think it's pretty obvious that this anime tries to be a character driven show. The military setting is a personal favorite of mine because the setup allows for a cast of characters of various importance and personality  to interact in a way that might not seem natural in any other story. Maybe it's the way the military is almost like a workplace, with its rigidness countered by the personalities of the cast that makes it so endearing to me. Bonding over alcohol, hard work, silly antics, and drama these are all things I can expect from a good military/unit/team-based anime. And, let me be clear, we do get some downtime. However, it is only included as part of the bigger picture, and never seems to exist for its own sake.This lack of organic interaction mixes poorly with characters who feel inadequate. We never get to know these people, and it's weird because it isn't as if the cast is so huge that they ran out of run-time to try and expose us to them. Amakasu's personality gimmick can barely sustain itself throughout the series, and we end up with another character having to remind us that it was something that defined her. And maybe it is the reliance on these gimmicks, which masquerade as depth, that makes the characters so hollow. I will give credit to the staff in that they clearly engineered each female character to be immediately 'relatable' in an obvious way. They're not written in the way most anime fans are used to seeing female gimmick characters, so it makes sense that it would trick people. But these ladies are still pretty boring, it's only that a female audience might actually like them (and as far as I can tell they do). But, gimmick personalities can be incredibly endearing if written well, and it is very possible for characters like these to have a strong, static personality that can be rewarding to witness. Sadly, the interactions and their personalities don't really make for anything interesting aside from the faux realism that they emphasize.In this way, truly great characters are often written with simple personalities, but alongside this there is always an underlying capacity for them to reveal real human emotion, which should be apparent even when they express themselves in the most pedestrian way. A 2D caricature with a soul, now that is what a good anime character should feel like, especially when they're drawn so expressively and cartoonish, as in this anime. However the characters we get are written only to mimic humans in both personality and emotion, in the most basic and superficial way, which is why the expression always seems hollow. For, how can anyone expect to be moved by the words of a character who has no soul? They are caricatures who make caricature of emotion and expression.And, it isn't as if the ritual/mythological element to the story was focused on in any great detail that a character focus would need to be sacrificed. If anything, the anime did a pretty good job of not expositing too much about the mysterious and existentially important ritual, keeping it understandably mysterious. However, it never feels mystical. Perhaps because the anime treats it as more of a natural disaster, like an earthquake or typhoon, which makes sense for the story.So, what does the anime actually focus on then if not some semi-serious story element or the characters? I couldn't tell you. Having watched this weekly, I'm drawing a blank. However, the general movement of the story is a military slice of life to contrived romance drama that all of a sudden becomes super important to the plot (because we all really want to see Aquarion EVOL again, right?) to the ritual that unravels the previous point.Despite all of my complaining I wouldn't say the anime is egregiously or offensively bad, it's just tasteless. This makes the designs; characters and art style (which I do like) to feel like such a waste. A waste of setting and design. I should also be up front about my bias as well though. I didn't like the dragons. Now, I knew there was going to be dragons going into this, but this ended up being deviantart:the animation, with dragon vore being the method of piloting, with vomit as the icing on the cake. Maybe this is why I liked Hoshino so much in the beginning, if she got her way this anime might have been about fighter pilots instead. And speaking of Hoshino and her romance, it was quite funny seeing the weekly reaction from the peanut galley: people clearly would rather get angry than use their heads. All in all I couldn't recommend this. However, it is clear that at the surface level a lot of anime fans seem to be happy. For me, this is just a very bland anime that doesn't really leave too many lasting impressions or say anything interesting. And even with the great art and visual design, it was still aesthetically uninspired. unfocused and impersonal way possible. (Meaning: it doesn't really do any of those things).Yes, I think it's pretty obvious that this anime tries to be a character driven show. The military setting is a personal favorite of mine because the setup allows for a cast of characters of various importance and personality  to interact in a way that might not seem natural in any other story. Maybe it's the way the military is almost like a workplace, with its rigidness countered by the personalities of the cast that makes it so endearing to me. Bonding over alcohol, hard work, silly antics, and drama these are all things I can expect from a good military/unit/team-based anime. And, let me be clear, we do get some downtime. However, it is only included as part of the bigger picture, and never seems to exist for its own sake.This lack of organic interaction mixes poorly with characters who feel inadequate. We never get to know these people, and it's weird because it isn't as if the cast is so huge that they ran out of run-time to try and expose us to them. Amakasu's personality gimmick can barely sustain itself throughout the series, and we end up with another character having to remind us that it was something that defined her. And maybe it is the reliance on these gimmicks, which masquerade as depth, that makes the characters so hollow.

Despite being done by Studio Bones who are well known for My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist and Eureka Seven this beautifully crafted series unfortunately fell below under people radars as they all interested of watching My Hero Academia Season 3 as well some other hits like Megalo Box, Steins Gate 0 etc. Also this was the anime I was looking forward the most from the Spring 18 season because this show in my eyes had the potential to be truly great. Thankfully this series...didn‚Äôt disappoint me one bit because not only this show is a beautifully done character drama that puts Darling in the Franxx to shame but it also manages to be a wonderful fun series that I really liked.Now with that said Hello Everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan.Story.The story follows a rookie named Hisone Amakasu who is part of the\xa0Japan Air Self-Defense Force, where she is situated at the\xa0Gifu\xa0air base. She decided to join the force to distance herself from people as, her whole life, she had found it difficult to interact with others due to her candid style of speaking and oftentimes hurtful words, despite that not being her intention. Hisone\'s decision leads to her life being changed when the concealed ""OTF"" ‚Äì Organic Transformed Flyer, or dragon ‚Äì inside the base chooses her to be his pilot, leading her to discover her destined role as a dragon pilot during their ascension in the skies together. According to legend, dragons are thought to possess a key to unlocking the future of the world.Despite this being the anime version of one of my favourite animated movies How To Train A Aragon I thought the story to be pretty good for the most partRight on the bat Dragon Pilot Hisone and Masotan does something that not a lot of anime like to do and that is actually start with a bang. \xa0Most series including anime originals feel comfortable taking it slow because they either want adapt the source material carefully as possible to avoid filler or slowly introducing its characters and setting. Dragon Pilot Hisone and Masotan doesn‚Äôt go any of this as it‚Äôs immediacy gets straight to the point by introducing its characters and setting in a way that is magical and interesting. By the end of the third episode, I got hooked.The character drama in this show is brilliant and well executed. Unlike Darling in the Franxx where the character drama was nothing but contrived bullshit the drama actually matters to the overall narrative where we see characters going thought mini character arcs and development.The show is well paced for the most part that keeps the audience interested with the shows events. Not only that the show does a great job of tacking themes and topics such as trust, loneliness, friendship, commutation, love etc. Plus the way the character developed with theses themes are great.The only issues that I have with this show is that it show is quite predictable as having too much foreshadowing and at times meh writing but don‚Äôt you worry they are not as that the other character drama show Darling in the Franxx.Besides thoeses minor issues I thought the story was pretty good for the most part.8/10Characters.The characters in Dragon Pilot Hisone and Masotan are all fantastic they own ways.Every single character in the show is likeable, relatable well written for the most part and they are all fun to watch from start to finish. Like with A place Future than the universe the show does a great job with character interactions where the anime how different and unique the characters just based from they character expressions from the aggressive Nao, the soft and subdued Liliko to the straightforward and innocent Hisone. Some people may find some of theses chararater annoying in the beginning but least they redeem themselves as they all go through chararter which is more than about any character from the Thireenth Planation from Darling in the Franxx where they don‚Äôt even any character development for shit.Overall the characters in Dragon Pilot Hisone and Masotan are all great and well thought out.9/10Visuals.Gorgeous is honestly the best way to describe the visuals Dragon Pilot Hisone and Mastoan.Studio Bones really did a wonderful job with the overall presentation from its great use contrasting heavy strokes on the character designs, the warm soft colour palette to the overall great shot composition and camerawork.The animation is fantastic. While it may not be in the same level as some other Studio Bones works My Hero Academia or Blood Blockade Battlefront the actually is still great enough to be one of the best looking of 2018 with it‚Äôs smooth movement, and well animated fights.9.5/10Sound.The soundtrack is amazing.Instead of having a generic music score that you have seen before from many anime this year the show‚Äôs mostly uses classical orchestral song pieces to give the show more life and atmosphere. There are however a couple of moe light-hearted tracks in this show but I thought it fitted well the show tone.The opening theme Soujo wa Ano Sora wo Wataru\xa0by Riko Fukumoto is fantastic opening theme that perfectly captures to tone and setting of the show. Plus the visuals for the opening was fantastic and well animated.The ending theme Le temps de la rentreÃÅe by D Pai is by far the most catchiest and ending theme of the year. I really adore that song with a passion.The voice acting is top notice. Every single Seiyuu did a fantastic job with the roles that they were given and it really made the anime more alive.Sadly this show hasn‚Äôt got an English Dub but I hope Netflix will dub it sometime soon.10/10Final Thoughts.Dragon Pilot Hisone and Mastoan is a wonderful anime that I really adored.

I consume anime like candy. It‚Äôs not so much for the sport of it, or for the sake of investing time in my hobby, or for a...primal need for self-flagellation. To me, watching anime has become my niche, obviously not to an unhealthy degree, although you could potentially say that subjecting yourself to 30+ seasonal anime in an average season with a strict no-drop policy is anything but healthy. It‚Äôs...a fascination really, when something special comes out, no other entertainment medium can give you that high of a truly great anime. That‚Äôs what I got out of Hisomaso, a series that checked nearly every mark on my rubric for what could potentially be one of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in years.Bones has been batting 500 since its inception as an animation studio. Paired with Shinji Higuchi and Hiroshi Kobayashi‚Äôs very unique visual direction, and Bones may have just struck what could be one of their most visually interesting and ambitious projects to date. Obviously since the average viewer has been tempered by standard character models, washed-out color-palettes, and layers upon layers of polish, the cartoony nature of this series may alienate some. However, I found almost every visual and technical aspect of this series to be incredibly refreshing when paired up against some of its peers.Not to suggest that Hisomaso has an average score, but it‚Äôs perhaps the most unassuming component of this series‚Äô technical aspects. The soundtrack has a few standouts, namely the more emotional pieces, but overall I‚Äôd say that it did a fine job of conveying the absolute serenity of piloting a dragon and the loopy militaristic percussiveness of the daily JSDF grind. The opening sequence is serene and muted, but nothing that I‚Äôd go out of my way to listen to on its own. The cover of France Gall‚Äôs ‚ÄúLe Temps de la Rentree‚Äù was groovy as hell and paired nicely with hilariously dorky dancing from the main cast, this ending theme has become a fast personal favorite of mine. As far as voice performance goes, I think Misaki Kuno is the star (in a literal sense as well) and provides a sheepish yet infinitely personable portrayal as Hisone. No English dub as of yet, for you dub purists.Technicals aside, this show has no shortage of personable and deceptively interesting characters. When Hisone Amakasu is first introduced, my expectations were for the most part subverted when at first glance she appeared to be yet another milquetoast protagonist dealing with your run of the mill young-adult ennui. But quickly, that switch flipped when she proved to be an exceptionally cheeky and likable dork who was not afraid to run her mouth in situations that would typically leave her in hot water. The emotional centerpiece of this series is derived from Hisone‚Äôs relationship with the titular Masotan, which indeed paid off in the end. However, I was shocked at the thematic scope that this series experimented with, namely the concept of militaristic dedication. On the whole, Hisomaso is actually prone to surprising tonal shifts which might throw some viewers off-guard with just how cartoony of an impression it might seem at first glance. But it pays off with some pretty effective and earned character drama. This wouldn‚Äôt nearly be as possible if the cast wasn‚Äôt so damn great.Obviously I can go into the personal journeys of the rest of the pilots however in my opinion that should simply be left to experience with a viewing rather than some bum on the internet spoiling great character development. All of the cast members, even the seemingly innocuous ones who mostly inhabit more understated roles shared such excellent comedic chemistry with each other. On top of this, there is no shortage of hilariously cartoony visual gags to break tension.One of the only real grievances I‚Äôve seen directed at this series is that it derives too many concepts and ideas from other sources. Shinji Higuchi for instance, who has previously worked on friggin Eva of all things and was clearly inspired by certain aesthetics and storylines. Does Hisomaso borrow concepts and ideas from other sources? Sure, and I could sit here and divulge those sources, but none of that really has any bearing on this show‚Äôs quality. Hisomaso is incredibly comfortable in it‚Äôs own skin and is stellar in its execution, which is what I look for most in shows that borrow things from other sources. Look at My Hero Academia for crying out loud, it‚Äôs incredibly derivative but fresh in its execution on top of being one of the most popular anime to come out in years.To me, Hisomaso was a beautiful balance of visuals, comedy, drama, and unfiltered vibrance. It is a series that for years to come I will defend with my life as both a personal favorite and one of the best anime to come out of the 2010‚Äôs. It‚Äôs shows like these that remind me why I come back to this site nearly every day to check those little marks on my watchlist.

I loved this series, plain and simple, no fancy words required, and I recommend it to everyone.', 'Flash back to your childhood: a time where planes were sick, robots were epic, and dragons were the coolest thing in the fucking universe! The paper and the costumes were what let the imagination soar! Games were your blood, pop-culture was your life! Candy was a delicacy rivaled only by pizza! Saturday morning was your weekly holiday! Wasn\'t all that fun? Wasn\'t that cool?! Don\'t you wanna relive some of that childhood wonder?!In the cold hard world where nostalgia is ruled by cashgrabs and rewatches, finding an experience that earnestly harkens back to your glory days is in somewhat short supply. Thankfully, Hisone to Maso-tan...seeks a new path to fulfill your childlike desires: combining planes, dragons, and giant robots to create a charming experience unparalleled in the industry!...at least at first.Let\'s start with our protagonist, Hisone Amakasu. She is one of the most adorkable, relatable, and endearing protagonists I‚Äôve seen to date. Seeing this beleaguered dolt in a constant edge of having everything thrust upon her so fast as she tries to wriggle her way out of overbearing situations as no one listens to her is an absolute joy. Watching her try not to let her blunt brain do the talking for her, only for that to fail, is some of the most fun I have with the show. Seeing her and Nao snap is a riot given the chemistry they and other characters have -all this regardless of the crass humor that bad LN shows often tend to pull-. Their parallels with certain characters early on are also wonderous to display, due to this show‚Äôs marvelous presentation that is akin to an adult recapturing the whimsey and magic of an astounded child. This presentation also makes it easier to overlook the plethora of sci-fi jargon and how absurd the premise truly is, with dragons requiring airplane parts in order to somehow transform and blend in, and whatnot. However, it doesn‚Äôt let me dismiss inconsistencies, occasionally clumsy dialogue, or any aggravating twists and set-ups. Having a bunch of characters with hit and miss traits and quirks won‚Äôt change that, no matter how funny the good ones can be.It does lose that sense of wonder, much like children do. Soon after the rest of the main cast is introduced, Hisone to Maso-tan focuses more on its growing cast of characters and their problems. It does a decent job with that, but not one substantial enough to truly make up for that loss, especially with a few admittedly small errors in the script. Unfortunately, the concept is still too silly to work perfectly, and the humor‚Äôs highlights aren‚Äôt as high as they were before. The show also transforms into a calculated love map with some out-there twists, so take that as you will.Studio Bones is famous for their slick visuals, only adding this to their monumental catalog. Frequent bad plane & pilot CGI aside, the flying sequences are an absolute joy to witness, feeling extremely lifelike and kinetic with all sorts of turns, loops, and fast movements done by the OTFs. Speaking of which, the OTF designs are wonderful, most especially Masotan‚Äôs. The rest of the character designs are well-done and immensely varied, with a wonderful, almost child drawing-esque aesthetic that is tailor-made for bouncy character animation and uproarious facial expressions. It all culminates into a unique visual style that makes this show even more of a joy to watch, even when it transitions past its initial phase.While the music is less commendable, it holds up well enough. The background music is rather nice, fitting with the scenes and sometimes being an emotional listen in their own right. Nothing absurdly memorable stands out but it works well on the whole. The opening, ""Soujo wa Ano Sora wo Wataru"" by Riko Fukumoto, has multiple versions, with only the final one being one I enjoy. The ending, ""Le temps de la rentr√©e"", has multiple versions, sung by different people as well as an instrumental version. The song has grown more on me overall, to the point where not only is nearly every version enjoyable, but that it\'s preferable to the opening.Such a shame the show lost what made is so captivating. However, while it never rose to the heights of its early episodes, it does still offer a worthwhile viewing experience, even if that one is more awkward. It even loses some of the bad humor presented early on, even though it lost the better humor on top of that. Spring-boarding off such a wonderful start into something grander is difficult, even with a likable main cast and superb main lead. The show grew to what felt like a teenage -perhaps even adult phase, for better or worse. It grows more contemporary, less spectacular, and while it that\'s a pity, it didn‚Äôt lose heart or soul. It simply lost its whimsey, much like we all do. Alas, it‚Äôs time to return. seeks a new path to fulfill your childlike desires: combining planes, dragons, and giant robots to create a charming experience unparalleled in the industry!...at least at first.Let\'s start with our protagonist, Hisone Amakasu.

Having a bunch of characters with hit and miss traits and quirks won‚Äôt change that, no matter how funny the good ones can be.It does lose that sense of wonder, much like children do. Soon after the rest of the main cast is introduced, Hisone to Maso-tan focuses more on its growing cast of characters and their problems. It does a decent job with that, but not one substantial enough to truly make up for that loss, especially with a few admittedly small errors in the script. Unfortunately, the concept is still too silly to work perfectly, and the humor‚Äôs highlights aren‚Äôt as high as they were before. The show also transforms into a calculated love map with some out-there twists, so take that as you will.Studio Bones is famous for their slick visuals, only adding this to their monumental catalog. Frequent bad plane & pilot CGI aside, the flying sequences are an absolute joy to witness, feeling extremely lifelike and kinetic with all sorts of turns, loops, and fast movements done by the OTFs. Speaking of which, the OTF designs are wonderful, most especially Masotan‚Äôs. The rest of the character designs are well-done and immensely varied, with a wonderful, almost child drawing-esque aesthetic that is tailor-made for bouncy character animation and uproarious facial expressions. It all culminates into a unique visual style that makes this show even more of a joy to watch, even when it transitions past its initial phase.While the music is less commendable, it holds up well enough. The background music is rather nice, fitting with the scenes and sometimes being an emotional listen in their own right. Nothing absurdly memorable stands out but it works well on the whole. The opening, ""Soujo wa Ano Sora wo Wataru"" by Riko Fukumoto, has multiple versions, with only the final one being one I enjoy. The ending, ""Le temps de la rentr√©e"", has multiple versions, sung by different people as well as an instrumental version. The song has grown more on me overall, to the point where not only is nearly every version enjoyable, but that it\'s preferable to the opening.Such a shame the show lost what made is so captivating. However, while it never rose to the heights of its early episodes, it does still offer a worthwhile viewing experience, even if that one is more awkward. It even loses some of the bad humor presented early on, even though it lost the better humor on top of that. Spring-boarding off such a wonderful start into something grander is difficult, even with a likable main cast and superb main lead. The show grew to what felt like a teenage -perhaps even adult phase, for better or worse. It grows more contemporary, less spectacular, and while it that\'s a pity, it didn‚Äôt lose heart or soul. It simply lost its whimsey, much like we all do. Alas, it‚Äôs time to return.', 'How to Train Your Dragon Plane starts off with a scene just about anyone can relate to. High schoolers ponder what to do with their lives. The amount of option is wide, maybe even too wide. There are so many different lines of studies and future careers to choose from, yet it all feels so limited and predetermined at the same time. It\'s saddening and shackling. Timeskip rolls and we find our main character, Hisone, working in a military facility where she seems to be no less and no more than just one more barely visible worker who is being dealt with the exact formality...and manner where she is exactly what she was hired to do. Small, replaceable fraction in the working class, a nobody to everybody. At this point, the series felt uncomfortable and almost depressing, but then, suddenly, Dragons.The core idea behind Dragon Pilot is well-known. Practically every mecha anime, but now with new approach. The mecha itself is an animal who interacts with humans like a dragon would instead of being some mysterious living entity who the author can freely control occasionally whenever they feel like it needs to have ""its own will"". And like the unofficial name states, the dragon needs some training and taming. This time, humanity is not in mortal peril nor will intergalactic nazis fight against each others in space war, no. The driving motion and Hisone\'s reasons to control Maso are not very simple. To understand any of them is to understand that this work is a) rather experimental b) clash of several different genres c) heavily character-centric d) flawed and nowhere near perfect.There are few problems with Dragon Caretakers writing that stand out. First one being how obviously everything in the series exists because Hisone exists. The series is clearly hers, and the very world seems to revolve around her as well. The second factor is our relatively weak plot which make the series seem rather slice of life with its lack of any clear objective or purpose. On top of that, the writing uses foreshadowing bit too much, making the series predictable when it comes to romantic subplots, for example. The third thing is tied to the slice of life factor as the series never makes it clear just how it should be viewed as. Is the series sol fraction, biography, comedy or less actionful version of Girls und Panzer, I cannot put it directly under any of these. We could go as far as calling Dragon Pilot so original that it can\'t be classified. Regardless how we label and honor it, the outcome is somewhat messy, confusing, and surely its creativity does not go hand in hand with its originality. Yet, these problems are not enough to make me think any less of the series because of several reasons.One of these is our main lead. Hisone\'s character is rather interesting choice. She is practically semi-autistic, and the funniest type for that matter: an internet autist. She tries to limit and censor herself around others, but it proves to be hard due to her being so honest and direct that she always ends up saying what she is thinking. Personality wise, she is real wife material (not to be confused with waifu material). She is the type of person who will casually call you a pedophile if you happen to watch an anime starred by little girls. The problem is that her humor and genuine openness was not appreciated by her insecure school buddies who were sensitive and offended by harmless words, and this somewhat scarred her. After this becomes clear, we are left with 11 episodes where she learns to cope with the world and herself, make friends and experience the adventure that this anime is. This is what typically gets called ""development"".The directorship is not very beginner-friendly. For starters, the pacing is ridiculous. Many viewers will drop out when the series does not give much time for world building and introductions. Instead, rushes from scene to another. Pros exist among this fast pace nevertheless. Especially during the beginning, there is not a single fraction of filler put in the series. Thanks to the art style (which we shall talk more later on), the atmosphere of the series does not need any extra work or time. Much is told with very little and simple tricks and manners. The first 15 minutes have given us a gasp of the series universe and its main plot line, as well as offered past story to Hisone and shown us what type of a person she is. Not only that, it also introduced 3 other important characters, 2 pop culture references and 3 jokes.The execution is rather impressive considering how much content is shown and how they were able to execute several jokes in between scenes. Much like the widely loved and hated comedy show from last season, Pop Team Epic, Dragon Pilot also relies on pop cultural references and internet memes with its relieving comedy narrative. The comedic resolve is the type of creative-stupidity were the word stupid equals brilliant -- mainly looking like the series is written and directed by Shane Black (The Nice Guys) or Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Three Billboars Outside Ebbing Missouri, Seven Psychopaths) or even Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, The World\'s End, Baby Driver). Most likely inspired by these gems from the western industry. Good example of this is 30 frames (around 1 second) long scene where character is on the phone and says ""we are fucked."" and nothing more. The way this comes out makes it seems like being fucked in this situation is self-explanatory and no futher detail is needed. This is really my type of comedy right here.Despite most of our characters existing solely for Hisone, one amazing side character is present in the series. Boss-bro (Ikushima), who has the skill of telling the hip, bust and waist size of any girl by simply hugging them from the butt (without being even 1 centimeters off) is a real man. Moreover, sick skills and talent. ""But wait a minute, isn\'t this the usual fanservice trash I am supposed to hate or otherwise I have a bad taste?"" No! The amazing thing about this is that boss-bro\'s job is to make suits, so knowing the dimensions of any pilot is part of his job. This is what I call well-thought. If only my school had given me this option for future career.The art and animation are worth a great deal. The first thing that needs to be said is the original style the series has. Practically, the cult manga series, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, would ideally have these production values if it was animated today. Those who have seen recent shows by Bones will be able to tell instantly that this is their art. Visually, Dragon Pilot is the simple type of beauty where less is more. Only those things that are relevant are there, and this way, viewers are directed to look only those things that matter. This is what we call aesthetics. For example, in one episode, several, old, manly army officers play in the background with toy planes. You don\'t see this type of greatness just any day. The animation detail --especially for comedy content-- in these simplistic scenes, is outstanding.In the history of anime, there has only ever been very few series that are so clearly valued and loved by the production team as Hisone to Misotan is (such as Koi wa Ameagari (from Wit Studios) and Concrete Revolutio (from the same Bones team that made this very anime)). Practically, every animated moment screams that it was made for a reason, but not just for you, the viewer, but for the reason that the team behind the series truly beliefs in it. From that part, How to Lick Your Dragon is a genuine work, created not by creed but passion. Those who can appreciate magic like this, will be able to forgive just about any flaw its weaker sides suffer from.From the sounds department, our OST is not very visible at first listen. The BGM varies from Legend of the Galactic Heroes tier more classical orchestra music to more generic wobs. Because of the fast scene transitions and pace, there can be 5 completely different music styles present during just about any one minute long fraction of the series. The more I started paying attention to this, the more this style started to fascinate me. This picked my interest so bad that I had to rewatch several episodes just in the purpose of listening how the series deals with its music. At the very least, it made me think how important role music plays in the series and how different it would be with different musical choices. To those who are interested in this subject, I highly recommend searching the following: The Marvel Symphonic Universe.Big names were hired for the seiyuu work. From Kotomine Kirei to every loli tsundere ever, Rie Kugumiya, we have several common and recognizable voices here. Unfortunately, also the guy who did Guilty Crown\'s mc is also here which gives me nightmares, but other than that, it\'s all acceptable, but sometimes can kill off the immersion and remind the viewer that this is indeed an anime, a product of this industry. The best part is that these biggest names were not granted main roles which automatically makes Dragon Pilot sound original and fresh.The main cast is voiced by less popular seiyuus who have the habit of changing their own voice and giving unique sounds to all new characters they cast - which makes the person behind the character less noticeable.Final verdict. Hisone\'s pros lie within the directing, art, comedy and Hisone\'s character. The weird pacing can ruin the fun for many. Same thing with the somewhat lacking, messy writing and problematic characterization for supporting characters that may or may not be factors that annoy some viewers to a point that this show won\'t seem very good -- bad even.

It has a charming style but the story, setting and characters are all pretty poor.It's about adults, but so much about the characters, the way they look, sound and behave, is childlike that the fan service, which there is a bit of throughout the show, is a bit unsettling.On the whole, Hisone to Maso-tan is enjoyable enough, it's a nice change of pace with a few laughs here and there, but I wouldn't recommend it because of the poor writing and the creepy fan service. "", 'I believe that HisoMaso represents a coming-of-age story of the same flavor as ""March Comes Like a Lion"", and with an excellent team backing it up. It speaks to me of identity and self-worth. The OTFs (dragons) are great and cool, and their transformations are epic, but at this point, they are a creative vehicle (get it? vehicles?) for their pilots to learn about themselves.The best part of HisoMaso is, without a doubt, the colorful cast. I can\'t express how easy it is to enter the story alongside the characters, empathizing with their relational struggles and cheering for their successes. Each seiyuu is obviously...deeply invested into her character, and it\'s a pleasure to listen to their banter.At the time of this posting, HisoMaso is *criminally* underrated here on MAL. It\'s sitting halfway down the popularity list for this season, and is resting at 7.5*, which is a misrepresentation of the quality of this production.I\'d like to take a moment to mention that yes, I understand why many users aren\'t as drawn to this show. The art style is simple, and lacks the sharpness of the current shounen meta, cutesy flairs of a typical slice-of-life, and the artsy vibe of some seinen shows.

Hisone is freaking obnoxious and most of the other characters are utterly useless. Plot gets going close to the final three episodes and does not make any sense whatsoever. The very little character development we get is predictable and bare bones. Tries to have so many tearjerker moments and each one falls flat on its face due to the persistent tonal dissonance between sudden wacky comedic scenes and super serial super sad scenes.So much for the objective assessment. What follows is a long, personal rant, my...main problem with Hisone to Masotan comes down to this aspect.Sexism is rampant.""Love is a lady\'s primary objective"" is an actual line form the show... A sentence that vile is something a villain would say. All the male staff act like humongous jerks to the pilot girls and exclusively on the premise that they are females and must therefor be inferior pilots by nature. The old ""women are governed by their emotions"" BS gets brought up constantly. And the show never reprimands anyone who expresses this thought, it seems in fact to support that notion as the girls\' inability to properly pilot their dragons is based on their emotional turmoil. One of the pilots main conflict is her struggles with being treated as a second class soldier due to her gender, and that plot point gets hardly explored and not brought to any conclusion whatsoever. There was a hint of an interesting sub plot with that premise, the male soldiers finally see the girls\' skills and realize they\'ve been wrong this whole time... But it just fizzles out, no lessons learned, nothing accomplished. I know it\' pointless to complain about sexism in anime, might as well complain the sky is blue. But this is so egregiously ""no girls allowed lol"" that it gets my blood boiling.Speaking of sexism. There\'s plenty of out of place and outright uncomfortable fanservice. The pilot suits being skin tight and making Hisone highly embarrassed by the pervy suit designer was a lengthy plot point. One of those cases where the show tries to have it both ways, making the audience empathize with the girls while unapologetically objectifying them. It\'s especially Hisone who gets shown off by the camera, panning over her buttocks in intrusive angles many a times. This does not work. You can\'t tell me to feel sorry for poor abused little Hisone while also telling me to lewdly ogle her like a stripper. Mixed signals much? Do you want to be a real story or do you want to be vore porn? Make up your mind you stupid anime.And lastly, those fucking Yakult yogurt ad inserts. Seriously? Yakult? Who greenlit this.Rant over.If you wanna see a show that does ""girl bonds with monster/vehicle"" done right, watch Rideback instead. Not a single panty shot to be found in that show, Rideback respects both its characters and its audience. Or try Naru Taru if you like your stories with an extra slice of nightmare fuel.

Looking at Amakasu agonizing over finding her own answer, I think that there might not be even a single thing in this world that can be taken for granted.""  -- Haruto Okonogi, episode 10""I was complacent.  But when others look at those very same things ..."" -- Haruto Okonogi, episode 12Repetition is one key to memory.  Advertisers use it to make you remember their product.  My teachers in school would frequently repeat themselves when...saying something important that was likely to appear on the exam.  So when a character in a show like this, which smacks of very deliberate construction in every area, repeats himself nearly verbatim in a span of three episodes, it must be important.  Surely it must speak to something with thematic weight.What had I taken for granted as the viewer?  Looking back on it now, there were clearly some things.  I\'d like to think that now I have the benefit of the full picture for context, but I can think of a few things in particular that I actually took for granted.  Firstly, Hisone Amakasu is a woman.  This is a pretty minor thing to overlook, because it usually isn\'t very relevant.  It does turn out to be so in this case, though.In fact, all the D-pilots are female.  This is something anime has trained us to take for granted.  All-female casts are present in hundreds of anime, and usually this doesn\'t have any meaning in the context of the story.  This isn\'t an all-female cast, though.  There are many male supporting characters, and one I\'d even consider a lead even though he doesn\'t appear so at first.  In fact, the interactions between man and woman is a major thematic element in this story.Romance appears in many anime and this is no exception.  It\'s familiar and thus we can take its presence for granted.  However, the interplay of the sexes does a lot more here.  It wasn\'t until I was writing this review that I realized the general level of power disparity between the men and the women in the show.  Very few of the men are subordinate to any of the women, and this is pretty clear to see because of the military setting and its clear delineation of hierarchy.  I don\'t remember the show doing anything specific to highlight this aspect.  It could be this is one thing we are meant to take for granted.One thing we\'ll never entirely overlook, hopefully, is sexual harassment.  The level of it in this show is pretty tame, relatively.  Surely there\'s nothing here that would be considered a firing offense in the real world, but its presence was strange and slightly off-putting.  The scenes with the tailor, if you can call him that, followed the usual beats for this kind of thing in anime.  It\'s played for laughs, and he comes across as pretty harmless in the end.  This isn\'t the only place where this kind of thing appears, though.  In another instance, it gets called out as sexual harassment on the spot, and it doesn\'t come across as funny at all.  Given the context in which it occurs, it can simply be read as yet another thing making Hisone uncomfortable about her new position as D-pilot, and that\'s all it seemed for the moment.However, these kinds of things continue to pile up to where they can\'t be ignored anymore.  In retrospect, I have to respect Mari Okada for weaving this subject in so well.  It\'s a slippery topic and she slips it in right under our noses.  For me, the breaking point was when they explicitly stated that the D-pilots aren\'t allowed to fall in love.  I knew this was wrong.  This was not a thing that made sense, however justified the person saying it believed himself to be.  In retrospect, I can see that this was done just right.  If it had come any later, the Shinto elements would have been known and we could have easily written this off.  It\'s normal in mythology for the gods to make unreasonable demands of men.  But since these things hadn\'t been introduced yet, this comes across as a man making unreasonable demands of a woman.  It has just enough time to settle in and make us a little uncomfortable.Thankfully, this is far from my first anime rodeo, and I have a little outside-context knowledge of the topic being addressed here.  Otherwise, I\'d be unlikely to know the very specific ""thing which was taken for granted"" that the plot eventually addresses.  (I\'ve reached my threshold for how much of the plot I\'m willing to directly reveal.)  That is, married women don\'t work, at least not in Japan.  I can remember instances in anime where women explained why they were quitting their job simply as, ""I\'m getting married.""  Not, ""I\'m getting married, my fiance already has a high-paying job, and I want to have children,"" but merely ""I\'m getting married.""  It doesn\'t require explanation, because it\'s taken for granted that married women don\'t have careers.  They may have part-time jobs or do volunteer work or what have you, but having a career and supporting a family is for the man.That\'s what ""Hisone and Maso-tan"" is about, to me.  It\'s about the plight of the working woman.  (I\'m a true believer in the ""death of the author"" approach to literary interpretation, so if it meant something else to you, then that\'s fine.)  It has elements that speak to Japanese culture specifically, but this isn\'t an anime made entirely for Japan.  Continuing a recent trend of such shows, it will also be airing on Netflix.Taking the theme of defying what was taken for granted into the metafictional realm, much of this show is designed from first principles, disregarding the anime status quo.  The first you\'ll probably notice is the character design.  Stock anime character designs simply don\'t lend themselves well to animation, so this production team abandoned them.  What we get is something memorable and unique, and the animation team takes full advantage of the streamlined designs to make them much more expressive in practice.  (See also: every Yuasa anime ever.)This extends to the background art as well.  We get something rather unique here, too.  It looks something like watercolor.  There\'s been a trend toward very digital, shiny, saturated backgrounds lately, and some of these are even quite good in their own right.  This has something hazier, with more of a hand-drawn look.  It fits very well with the character art and it just feels very good.  To me, background art is a strong contributor to the feel of an anime.  Many of my favorites have particularly good art design and it makes them a joy to watch.Another element that tends to appeal directly on an emotional level is music.  This has what\'s probably the best soundtrack of the season.  Again, there\'s no regard for what\'s considered typical of anime.  There is no J-Pop to be seen here.  Even when they have the cast sing in character for the ED, it\'s an old French song that they sing.  I wasn\'t expecting it to be relevant, but it is a song about taking a holiday in France.  There is a moment where something like that comes up in context, so keep your eyes open for it.All in all, this really seems like it could be an enduring classic.  There have been numerous contenders lately.  Megalo Box plays it too safe, never escaping its status as a tribute to a classic when it could have been one in its own right.  Devilman: Crybaby had production quality issues which this lacks.  (Though the dub hasn\'t been made yet, so that could still become an issue like it was for Devilman.)  Koe no Katachi pulled its punches a little, and waters down its message by dragging on too long and including some unnecessary elements.  This may fly a little under the radar, but it delivers its strike with laser-guided precision.  I need to seriously reconsider my previous stance on Mari Okada if this is what she\'s really capable of when she takes the gloves off.P.S.: When I say this anime made me uncomfortable, know that I don\'t consider that to be a bad thing.  In fact, I consider it to be a rare and valuable thing.  Youtuber MrBtongue made a video on this you should see if you haven\'t already. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg_Lp5bO1U8 saying something important that was likely to appear on the exam.  So when a character in a show like this, which smacks of very deliberate construction in every area, repeats himself nearly verbatim in a span of three episodes, it must be important.  Surely it must speak to something with thematic weight.What had I taken for granted as the viewer?  Looking back on it now, there were clearly some things.  I\'d like to think that now I have the benefit of the full picture for context, but I can think of a few things in particular that I actually took for granted.  Firstly, Hisone Amakasu is a woman.  This is a pretty minor thing to overlook, because it usually isn\'t very relevant.  It does turn out to be so in this case, though.In fact, all the D-pilots are female.  This is something anime has trained us to take for granted.  All-female casts are present in hundreds of anime, and usually this doesn\'t have any meaning in the context of the story.  This isn\'t an all-female cast, though.  There are many male supporting characters, and one I\'d even consider a lead even though he doesn\'t appear so at first.  In fact, the interactions between man and woman is a major thematic element in this story.Romance appears in many anime and this is no exception.  It\'s familiar and thus we can take its presence for granted.  However, the interplay of the sexes does a lot more here.  It wasn\'t until I was writing this review that I realized the general level of power disparity between the men and the women in the show.  Very few of the men are subordinate to any of the women, and this is pretty clear to see because of the military setting and its clear delineation of hierarchy.

You aren\'t going for anything great, but its fun enough to keep some minutes of your attention, but dragging itself into a huge moe fest in the end.

After the initial completion of the final episode however, it reveals a lackluster story overall, peppered with meaningless subplots and...characters alike. The show is a fun ride, but completing the anime means coming to terms with an overall shallow plot and even shallower characters.Hisomaso begins with slightly unique character; a character who\'s outward demeanor clashes with conventional behavior. That being said, if the only unique thing I can say about the main character is that ""she acts weird"" then this show isn\'t exactly getting off to a running start. With shows like Watamote, the main character\'s intense social anxiety is a main point of the story and is heightened by it. This show\'s main character\'s struggle with a pseudo-autistic personality is nothing more than a meaningless red herring placed at an attempt to spice the story up. Not saying that this character is simply irredeemable, but the overall value of this dynamic takes a drastic nosedive towards the end of the show where her personality is never truly resolved nor ever truly discussed in any meaningful fashion.Main character aside, the dragons in the show are cute and worth watching if only because they are simply there to basically be cute, cool, and fun to watch. That being said, if you came only to see the dragons there are merely four of them anyway, and the dragons beside the main one lack any real time on screen divulging anything interesting.Truly this anime\'s saving grace is its visual appeal and its lighthearted main point: that dragons exist in a modern day world and are hiding in plain sight by transforming by the help of the military, into fighter, carrier, or surveillance planes. However, when this anime wanted to take things into a more serious setting, the anime becomes boring at best.Overall Hisone to Masotan was a somewhat fun experience, as the starting concept of the show was rather unique and fun, but as the series moved along I feel that perhaps only a handful of the 12 episodes were even remotely necessary. I binged this show in a day so I can\'t truly say it was a miserable day wasted, however I would caution any viewer who hasn\'t seen this show as to the miserable feeling of trying to decipher any meaning out of a show that inherently lacks any depth whatsoever. characters alike.

Story: While unique, it isn't very creative at all, the main character is rather generic with her only defining characteristic being she is to honest in an unrealistic way. Art: It's special. Sound: The ED is really nice sung to a french song and while not visually stimulating, it is rather good. Music played during the show is rather ordinary. Character: This is for my fellow vets and people who have some interest in the military, the way people are shown make sense...for an anime but make the very least sense in a remote understanding how military information works. Enjoyment: Its alright. which is rather low for this kind of show. The art may be unique and the the story might not have been told several times over but it isn't the god send of this season. for an anime but make the very least sense in a remote understanding how military information works.

Well, I've already said it: it's one of my favorite anime of my life. It's inventive where it can be, has a unique personality and a BEAUTIFUL production by Bones that elevates each episode and scene to the maximum, complemented by the incredible character design by Toshinao AOKI and Yoshiyuki Ito.After the anime finished, a short five-chapter manga adaptation was released. However, this time, the story is told from Nao's point of view in some of the series' key scenes. This gives us a more in-depth insight into her thoughts on everything and also allows us...to get to know the character a little more. On the whole, however, it's just a treat for those who have enjoyed the series, with no major revelations or significant information.Hisone to Masotan, for me, is a complete work. You could even argue that they didn't explain some things, but honestly, I didn't see much of a problem with that. The story is mystical rather than scientific, involving dragons, gods, monks and priestesses. At the end of the day, what matters are these five girls, each with their own unique personalities, but who talk to each other. They have something in common: the search for a purpose, the understanding of themselves and the search for their place in the world. This is what unites them with their dragons.The anime is full of metaphors and references, but, in the end, what matters is how it hits you, how it questions you and, finally, how it answers those questions.Hisone to Masotan tried to be something different, something more, and for me it worked so well. It's one of those anime that, even if I look at it or listen to it from miles away, I'll recognize it immediately.

Send me feedback on how I can improve.I‚Äôll refer to the anime in question as HisoMaso, Hisone to Masotan, Dragon Pilot, D-PilotStory (8):At first I thought this was going to be one of those ""Cute Girls doing Cute things"" shows, but it quickly turned into something much more interesting. Granted, I should have noticed that since the people involved with this work is one of the most renowned in the industry.  The story of Dragon Pilot is relatively simple. It is about a young woman named Hisone who joins the...JASDF and from there, pilots her very own dragon. Despite it\'s fantastical premise and absurdity, HisoMaso truly is a mature character study (At least for the first half) on the reliance on others to better yourself and the struggles women face in a male dominated environments. This anime does an excellent job is developing it\'s characters in the first half of the anime. Putting their goals and apprehensions in the forefront to make them highly relatable. I feel like the biggest payoff to this development was in episode 5 and 6. This is coupled with an excellent balance of witty and smart comedy, and purpose built Drama that fits in with the main characters struggles without being contrived or out of place. The second half of the anime is less of a character study and more of a plot driven show. It fortunately does not turn into an action show and continues to be the drama it intended to be from the get go. It changes messages into a work balance that akin to the tough choices women make (Particularly in Japan) with balancing work and Love. The inclusion of the romance plot made me wary at first, but my worries quickly went away because of how much it fit in with the message the show and how much it put more depth into the characters involved in the romance plot without changing who the characters were. One problem I have with the story is its rather spotty world building when it comes with the dragons. It can be a bit of a mess sometimes when it comes to Hisomaso‚Äôs world. Another problem is the foreshadowing. Although I appreciated that all the twists that it pulled made sense and was not an ass pull, it was kinda easy to predict what that twist was going to be. It also needs to be stated that the pacing of this anime is lightning fast. Although it didn‚Äôt bother me because I appreciated how straight to the point it was, I don‚Äôt think this anime would be beginner friendly. Despite this, HisoMaso story is very purpose built and focuses on its core values which I find more important.Characters (9.5):The characters in HisoMaso are all broken or carry complexes similar to Kiznaiver. Unlike Kiznaiver though, the characters feel like they go through real change gradually throughout the show instead of rushing that in the end. On top of this the characters are actually likable and are not aggravating to watch like Kiznaiver. What makes HisoMaso have great characters is the characters having very real complexes and goals and them butting heads in a thoughtful, non offensive and non aggravating way. Despite this, the characters support one another and go through real development and build confidence in their profession despite outside snares and difficult situations. One small nitpick I have thought is that some of the background and supporting cast can be very sexist to our main female cast. I can understand why they did this because of the setting, but it can be very hard to watch at times.Art and Animation (10):The animation for D-Pilot is very excellent. It features very expressive facial animation akin to many BONES works and uses very effective use of 3DCG. The flight scenes in this show are breathtaking and very entertaining to watch. This can also be credited to the hand drawn backgrounds which gives the show a very distinctive look compared to most anime coming out today. Seriously most of the backgrounds in this show should be framed. The character designs are also very unique. They are less detailed compared to most anime, but are very pleasing to look at and instantly recognizable. Despite not having more reputable BONES animators on staff like Yutaka Nakamura, this is still one of the best looking anime of this year.Sound (10):The OST was composed by Tasei Iwasaki, who previously did the soundtrack of Kekkai Sensen. Like Kekkai Sensen, the soundtrack for this show is excellent and very noticeable while watching the show. Unlike Kekkai Sensen, the OST for this show is a lot less jazzy and has less international influences. If I could describe the OST in one word, it would be ‚Äúatmospheric‚Äù. The OST for this show balances Military-esque trumpets and drum marches, traditional eastern world instruments, and whimsical tracks using pianos and violins. Considering the fast pace of the story, A soundtrack that mixed multiple elements was needed and I think it not only did a good job at that, but it also did a good job of sounding good. I love how the OST has multiple renditions of the opening depending on what the atmosphere was on screen. Speaking of the opening, both of the openings are excellent and feature fully orchestrated background music and beautiful singing from Riko Fukumoto .The intro changes at around episode 8 when the tonal shift of the show starts to change. The lyrics match up to the shows current situation in both openings. Also the ED is addicting. It‚Äôs a damn drug.Enjoyment (10)Consensus: Hisone to masotan is the antithesis of other similar anime like Kiznaiver and Darling in the Franxx in the way it handles its Drama and characters. Due to this, HisoMaso is not only one of the best original anime developed by BONES in quite a while, but also is in the running for the best original anime of the year. It achieves this with its strong cast of characters, striking art and animation, and writing and directing which has a purpose and focus throughout the majority of its run. I rarely give out ten‚Äôs, but this anime had such a big impact on me, I believe that it would be unfair to give anything less than that. I hope this anime gets more traction once it releases on Netflix because it completely deserves it.Similar Anime:Kiznaiver (A beta version of this anime)Most Mecha anime like Eureka Seven, NGE, Franxx etc. JASDF and from there, pilots her very own dragon. Despite it\'s fantastical premise and absurdity, HisoMaso truly is a mature character study (At least for the first half) on the reliance on others to better yourself and the struggles women face in a male dominated environments. This anime does an excellent job is developing it\'s characters in the first half of the anime. Putting their goals and apprehensions in the forefront to make them highly relatable. I feel like the biggest payoff to this development was in episode 5 and 6. This is coupled with an excellent balance of witty and smart comedy, and purpose built Drama that fits in with the main characters struggles without being contrived or out of place. The second half of the anime is less of a character study and more of a plot driven show. It fortunately does not turn into an action show and continues to be the drama it intended to be from the get go. It changes messages into a work balance that akin to the tough choices women make (Particularly in Japan) with balancing work and Love. The inclusion of the romance plot made me wary at first, but my worries quickly went away because of how much it fit in with the message the show and how much it put more depth into the characters involved in the romance plot without changing who the characters were. One problem I have with the story is its rather spotty world building when it comes with the dragons. It can be a bit of a mess sometimes when it comes to Hisomaso‚Äôs world. Another problem is the foreshadowing. Although I appreciated that all the twists that it pulled made sense and was not an ass pull, it was kinda easy to predict what that twist was going to be. It also needs to be stated that the pacing of this anime is lightning fast. Although it didn‚Äôt bother me because I appreciated how straight to the point it was, I don‚Äôt think this anime would be beginner friendly. Despite this, HisoMaso story is very purpose built and focuses on its core values which I find more important.Characters (9.5):The characters in HisoMaso are all broken or carry complexes similar to Kiznaiver. Unlike Kiznaiver though, the characters feel like they go through real change gradually throughout the show instead of rushing that in the end. On top of this the characters are actually likable and are not aggravating to watch like Kiznaiver. What makes HisoMaso have great characters is the characters having very real complexes and goals and them butting heads in a thoughtful, non offensive and non aggravating way. Despite this, the characters support one another and go through real development and build confidence in their profession despite outside snares and difficult situations. One small nitpick I have thought is that some of the background and supporting cast can be very sexist to our main female cast. I can understand why they did this because of the setting, but it can be very hard to watch at times.Art and Animation (10):The animation for D-Pilot is very excellent. It features very expressive facial animation akin to many BONES works and uses very effective use of 3DCG. The flight scenes in this show are breathtaking and very entertaining to watch. This can also be credited to the hand drawn backgrounds which gives the show a very distinctive look compared to most anime coming out today. Seriously most of the backgrounds in this show should be framed. The character designs are also very unique. They are less detailed compared to most anime, but are very pleasing to look at and instantly recognizable. Despite not having more reputable BONES animators on staff like Yutaka Nakamura, this is still one of the best looking anime of this year.Sound (10):The OST was composed by Tasei Iwasaki, who previously did the soundtrack of Kekkai Sensen. Like Kekkai Sensen, the soundtrack for this show is excellent and very noticeable while watching the show. Unlike Kekkai Sensen, the OST for this show is a lot less jazzy and has less international influences. If I could describe the OST in one word, it would be ‚Äúatmospheric‚Äù. The OST for this show balances Military-esque trumpets and drum marches, traditional eastern world instruments, and whimsical tracks using pianos and violins. Considering the fast pace of the story, A soundtrack that mixed multiple elements was needed and I think it not only did a good job at that, but it also did a good job of sounding good. I love how the OST has multiple renditions of the opening depending on what the atmosphere was on screen.

I had paid no attention to it until one youtube video made a heavy recommendation to watch it and the art style immediately jumped out to me for being different. I decided to give it a chance.It went from a show I almost missed to the one I was looking most forward to in a season with other interesting shows like Boku no Hero, Steins Gate and a continuing Darling In the Franxx. It grew on me and I have to say was my Anime of that season. Brought me to tears and heartfelt laughter...all in the same scenes. The art style fits it so well and complements the characters fully.My biggest shock is still how this show is still relatively unknown. I'd highly recommend watching it. I loved it so much that I decided I had to write  a review on it having never done anything of the sort for all the other shows that i love. I really love this show BUELELELELELE!! all in the same scenes. The art style fits it so well and complements the characters fully.My biggest shock is still how this show is still relatively unknown. I'd highly recommend watching it. I loved it so much that I decided I had to write  a review on it having never done anything of the sort for all the other shows that i love. I really love this show BUELELELELELE!!"", 'In the beginning, I loved this show. It has a chill and relaxed air to it and the military setting is something I really love and I think can make for really unique shows when paired with slice of life styling. I guess it was naive to ask for normality from a show based on women piloting dragons from their insides, disguised as planes because when the big final arc comes around the show becomes entirely nonsensical and rather demonic to be honest.But I‚Äôll start with the good. As I said before, the military setting often creates some of the best animes, and analysis of...the starting few episodes would reveal that this show was the perfect recipe for success. A great introduction about a high schooler wondering what to do with her life, seeing jets fly by and then joining the JASDF (only to find herself working an office job). Then a change occurs and someone who is woefully unfit for the job is placed in a new position. Really, I thought this was going to be one of my all time favourites in the very beginning.Let‚Äôs talk about characters. Lots of people believe that they‚Äôre flat and boring. Each one is essentially reduced to a single trait or personality quirk, and then made to interact with one another. I honestly think this works just fine. Hisones unfiltered speech makes for some funny moments, however later in the show it just falls apart as she develops which I think that is what angered a bunch of people at the personalities, they just didn‚Äôt realize why. Hisone became much more ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù like towards the end, dropping her quirk and becoming a boring invincible main character. But the quirk is what we loved about her, going on unhinged rants at authority because she‚Äôs tired of the absurdities of life. As for the other dragon pilots, I think they work great together. None of them other than Hisone are actually supposed to be main characters, so then having only 1 possible dialogue option in each situation works well. I really don‚Äôt understand the complaint about the personalities. You want in a in-depth emotional being, undergoing pain and drastic change over the course of an‚Ä¶.. 10 episode anime about‚Ä¶‚Ä¶flying dragons from their insides‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.yeah, okay.In terms of the art, the skies look magnificent although anime artists have become quite adept at drawing beautiful skies over the years. A lot of the side characters look horrendous, with disproportionate parts which is a trend I really dislike but see over and over again in shows. It‚Äôs a little angering, but it‚Äôs not a unique issue so there‚Äôs no reason to criticize this show specifically for it. The planes look nice, the pannel gaps are quite noticeable but I guess that‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre armour and not the real plane? Either way, pretty close to real life. Not quite the tanks from Girls und Panzer, but definitely good enough.Okay, now for the negatives. I want you to imagine this. ‚ÄúA show about a girl who is indecisive about her future and decides to join the JASDF. She gets a sudden position change, and the show focuses on her interaction with characters as she goes through life in the Air Force, made interesting by her unique personality traits, in a realism focused slice of life anime.‚Äù That‚Äôs this show at its very very very maximum potential. Never in your mind, even after the introduction of dragons into the mix, would you EVER guess the show would include an arc of performing a demonic ritual inside a massive flying creature, which must be put to sleep in an exact area or all of Japan will just explode, and this is the entire purpose of like 20 people. All of it is so insane that I‚Äôm guessing the whole thing must be a play and modernization on an East Asian legend or something, because I just cannot believe a group of writers actually came up with it. This isn‚Äôt the reason we‚Äôre watching the show. We don‚Äôt want these incredibly weird sacrificial and ritualistic themes in a fun happy show about the Air Force, or even one about a flying dragon. I don‚Äôt understand the hypothesis. Why? Why would you do this? Who came up with it? To be quite honest, it ruined the entire show. I want to rate it in half‚Äôs, because the first half was great and I loved it, the second was complete garbage and made me ask so many questions. Hence why my number review is so high, but my written one so critical.That‚Äôs really my main complaint about it. Otherwise; it‚Äôs a great show and God does it anger all the right people. Even with the annoying dialogue of El Hoshino, and the unspoken lesbian relationship between two ladies in imperial Japan (ouf, good luck trying not to be hung), I still see the funniest things in peoples‚Äô review. Take this for example: (I‚Äôm paraphrasing) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs riddled with sexism. All the characters make sexist and sexualized remarks about the characters. And get this ‚Äòthe primary objective of a woman is love‚Äô that‚Äôs an actual line in the show. It sounds like something an evil villain would say.‚Äù Truly amazing. We‚Äôve brainwashed our youth so badly; that yearning for the same thing that all women (AND MEN) for all of time have wanted is sexist. It‚Äôs mindblowing. LOVE. THESE PEOPLE HATE LOVE. LIKE WHAT. I do apologize; this wasn‚Äôt mean to be political but man what a sad world we live in.In conclusion, this show is exactly like it‚Äôs ending. The first bit, focused on the resolution of the dragon pilots love affairs is happy and upbeat and makes you feel good. Let‚Äôs be real, we were all celebrating when El Hoshino found love. But the second half, where Hisone somehow comes back from sacrificing herself in resolving maybe the most absurd storyline in all of history, to be met by her lover (who just abandoned the girl he spent is entire life with??). Nonsensical and angering. I‚Äôll always think of the feelings the first bit of this show for comfort though, because I truly believe this could‚Äôve been something great. I can only pray someone makes what would‚Äôve made this show great. the starting few episodes would reveal that this show was the perfect recipe for success.

LA just loved Hisone as a character and what developments she goes through especially when the anime itself was shifting from a training arc to an intentionally forced romance arc that not only includes Hisone herself but her peers in the process.With that Hisone to Maso-tan does a stellar job in terms of character interaction and development as a whole for the majority of the cast, from backstory to subtle yet great interactions from the majority of the cast and all their weird quirks here and there. From Nao Kaizaki voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa, the once rival to Hisone to getting her own development opening up to almost everyone in the cast and small crush on Hiroki Ikushima with some comedic results, Ririko Kinutsugai voiced by Satomi Arai, probably the least involved in the major character plotlines but like Nao has many comedic potential and was LA\'s second favourite character, Mayumi Hitomi voiced by Kaori Nazuka though doesn\'t have much involving the major character plotlines, but though she\'s the most static character in the anime along with Ririko her personality was definitely ""quirky"" and finally Eri Hoshino voiced by Maki Kawase the stern and no nonsense character who is entirely focused on her job as an OTF pilot, she like Nao opens up to the cast and is a great contrast to Hisone. Though the characters LA talked about, only half were static to say the least, but with the great amount of character interactions throughout the anime even from some of the minor turn major characters like Sada Hinomoto voiced by Romi Park the Joie lady to Remi Kakiyasu voiced by Rie Kugimiya, the OTF Pilot\'s Sergeant and direct superior, Hisone to Maso-tan manages to make for great character interactions to the point the majority of the main cast to be both likable as hell and memorable.In terms of character development, Hisone and Eri gets the majority of character development especially when it it goes into what LA deems the ""Romance subplot"" and we get to see much more from both of these characters and how it GREATLY affects them as OTF pilots and heck even the OTF\'s themselves as much as they don\'t talk not to mention they only use at best motions and emotions to show how they feel, just seriously Hisone to Maso-tan does great on character interactions, even to the pint of the human to OTF interactions makes these dragons part of the cast indefinitely. Sorry if LA is gushing but getting back on track but the character development of Hisone especially (due to her being the narrative focus of the anime) both misguided and great development to Hisone due to how she looks at herself and how she feels about love herself and those around her, almost like a ""work over love"" or vice versa scenario though done for some level of melodrama, was done well in making LA like Hisone even more and became even more relatable in some sense of her wanting to love everyone but that damaging some of her relationship as a result, very much like you can\'t help everyone and smearing that in saying that you can!.Now LA hasn\'t talked the major story plotline of this anime as LA had been focused on it\'s wonderful cast of characters, but the major plotline along with it\'s many interesting character plotline and romance subplotlines DOES interweave itself to the major story plotline quite well. The major plotline doesn\'t show itself and keeps itself a mystery for the first half of the anime but keeps subtle hints to the one really mysterious superior of Iiboshi voiced by Yoshimitsu Shimoyama and the major story plotline is quite the intense one at that. LA doesn\'t want to spoil but let\'s just say it took many plot twists and lots of intense moments for such a lighthearted yet great character focused anime and LA will leave it at that.Hisone to Maso-tan\'s animation done by Bones was what got LA interested in seeing this anime from the simple yet expressive character designs to the great background work and the great Henshi OTF\'s animation was great. Bones outdid themselves with it\'s character designs especially with how expressive yet simplistic it\'s made out to be, it\'s mostly chibi expressions especially from Hisone but Bones managed to make a simple expression show so much from a character (and OTF\'s), almost like a different spectrum of Kyoto Animation where the simple animation that doesn\'t need to be detailed and show so much (and this isn\'t a hit at Kyoto Ani, LA is merely showing an example of how the simple expressions the characters do are similar in a ways to Kyoto Ani just using different techniques). Bones\'s animation is great as ever form character designs and beautiful background work especially with it\'s skies and ""action moments"". The animation was great all across the board.With such great characters and interactions, the voice acting by Hisone to Maso-tan is AMAZING, as voice actors from Misaki Kuno, Tomoyo Kurosawa, Satomi Arai, Maki Kawase, Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya doing amazing in this anime, due to how expressive these characters are it matched with the brilliant voice acting and this is where most of the voice cast are doing lot of ""playing against the type"" characters like Misaki Kuno though doing a shy meek character she DOES have a quirky backbone to her which Misaki strides all the way through the anime to Tomoyo Kurosawa doing her rare delinquent-esque vocals in Nao and Rie Kugimiya doing an almost drill sergeant nasty but almost motherly figure to the OTF pilots, amazingly well. Joji Nakata and Yuki Kaji did great as well with Yuki Kaji has some semblance of a stake in the plot (both romance and story-wise) as well as ""bro""-almost douchey Yutaka Zaito voiced by Yukitoshi Tokumoto doing a great job balancing douchey and likable all the better. The voice cast, seriously is amazing to the point LA will give MVP to Misaki Kuno as Hisone and Rie Kugimiya as Remi Kakiyasu (LA\'s bias LA knows).Hisone to Maso-tan is a great dark horse contender for the best anime of Spring 2018 (you know excluding spinoffs and sequels) and this being a Bones ORIGINAL anime, just man Hisone to Maso-tan was one of LA\'s most invested animes as well as most relatable protagonist anime characters, great character development, interactions and interweaving major plotlines that greatly involves it\'s characters to great effect that LA hasn\'t seen this kind of anime in quite a while and no LA doesn\'t mean it\'s weird premise. Hisone to Maso-tan was quite the surprise of an anime that LA could get this invested in these characters and plot that LA couldn\'t wait for the next episode or the plot twists that comes along that shakes things up even more. LA is just gushing about Hisone to Maso-tan soo much that is because LA really couldn\'t find many faults about Hisone to Maso-tan as a whole, sure Hisone herself made lots of dumb mistakes but that only improved her as a character later on and many of the mysteries given is built up and executed to spectacular effect and finished the anime tying up loose ends (this being an original anime, LA thinks that needed to be said) and well because of everything LA said up til now, LA will easily give Hisone to Maso-tan, the best ORIGINAL anime of Spring 2018 and a good contender of anime of 2018. the support she truly has once she becomes an OTF pilot (Dragon Pilot) and refreshingly enough, NOT trying to say that Hisone should change from her meek, shy self but that everyone can be meek yet strong at the same time.

I had dropped it previously after the first few minutes a few years ago, and I am so glad I gave it a chance. I binged the entire show in 2 days lol.The story is much more emotional than I thought it would be. All of the characters have their own quirks and charms, which is enjoyable to watch. Although there is an element of surprise with the vore thing, please give it a chance! The story and characters are amazing in my opinion.Also the voice acting is so good, especially Amakasu‚Äôs va....She perfectly captured Amakasu‚Äôs personality! She perfectly captured Amakasu‚Äôs personality!', 'LIGHT SPOILERS (MARKED) AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW, DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING DIRECTLY ABOUT PLOT OR STORY.I never saw myself saying this in a million years prior to watching Dragon Pilot, but this anime truly is the most tasteful vore in the industry.What many see as an average or even below average anime, I see something fantastic. I\'ve rated all categories a perfect 10 deliberately. Dragon Pilot is high up on my list of favorite anime, and has only been even more enjoyable watching it a second time. So many things are done right in this show, and my review certainly can\'t do it...all justice.The hook of the story is simple; a girl with no aspirations in life finds a meaning in life through becoming a dragon pilot. Dragon Pilot turns this relatively simple yet versatile prompt into 12 substantial episodes, without a single episode being considerably less enjoyable than the others. It\'s hard to say much about the story without spoiling anything, as most of it is developed in the second half of the anime, so I\'ll just leave it at saying it\'s definitely worth getting invested in.The art is great. I\'m no artist, so I really don\'t know what exactly makes good art good, but Dragon Pilot has a unique and memorable art style that doesn\'t feel like the creators sacrificed clarity simple for the sake of being different. One thing that particularly stood out to me in Dragon Pilot is the animation. Body animations and facial expressions are noticeably more expressive and realistic than many other anime, and it adds so much substance to the overall final product. And if you care about it, the aircraft look accurate, unless you\'re some kind of aeromorph lover who never got into trains as a kid instead. I\'m sure someone like that could find flaws there.The sound, more specifically, the sound track, is great. There are some repeat songs, but they still fit perfectly into the scenes they\'re used in, so I won\'t deduct any points from this category of the review. The music is memorable, adds so much emotion to scenes, and is good music even if you listened to it outside of the anime.And finally, the characters. This is a character-centric show, and the creators pulled this off perfectly. Even characters only shown in a handful of scenes feel like they have a deeply developed character that fits well into the story and can have good synergy with other, more prominent characters. I think what makes the characters so perfectly in Dragon Pilot is ironically their imperfections. The characters aren\'t some invincible stereotypical anime protagonists who defeat all evil without ever breaking a sweat and can overcome any hurdle within the span of half an episode, rather everyone is unique and realistic, with believable strengths, clear goals, and unique yet realistic weaknesses. Altogether, these personalities create a diverse and interesting ecosystem of JASDF members on an airbase.Overall, Dragon Pilot was a surprise gem for me, and I couldn\'t be happier that I chose to watch it. I\'ve just finished my first rewatch, and I can see myself rewatching many more times in the future. It fulfills my need for an anime with a perfect blend of seriousness and lighthearted comedy. Media of any kind rarely captures somewhat realistic military slice-of-life well, so seeing it done well in an anime is quite satisfying.--------------------LIGHT SPOILERS--------------------Dragon Pilot carries a prominent message. It\'s not the forefront of the show, but it definitely feels like the creators wanted to say something through the medium of anime. Dragon Pilot encourages one not to blindly follow tradition or authority figures, especially if something or someone is at risk of being lost or harmed, particularly for an unknown ""greater good"". I don\'t wish to directly spoil anything from this absolute masterpiece of a show, so I\'ll just leave it at that.

It\'s just something I found particularly interesting while watching that was made more clear when I rewatched.', ""Dragon Pilot is surprisingly very good anime. I started watching it mainly because I like weird stuff and things that other people say are weird, are interesting to me. But instead I've watched simple, yet really enjoyable story of a girl who just wanted to find her dreams and protect those, who she cherishes.Story is very simple, yet unique at some parts. It's usual classic main character saving the day or doing something special, nobody else could, but at this time I felt like many of the elements were unique to Dragon Pilot. Main character is a girl that says too much and can't lie,...often hurting others. She is self loathing from time to time, because of that trait. But she find someone who let her be herself. That someone loves to swallow her to his stomach. Literally. But apart from that, the anime isn't at all gross. It has few vomiting scenes, but it's rather lightly animated, so nothing that You wouldn't want to see.What I enjoyed the most is the bond between Hisone, the main girl character and Hisotan, a dragon, that is kind of... symbiotic organism, called Organic Transformed Flyiers, called OTF for short. OTFs swallow dragon pilots and let them control them from inside. As much as it sound weird, it's really enjoyable story. Hisone tries her best to not only pursue her dreams, but also not let anyone down, but she has a long way to do that. Long way, though it's just 12 episodes.What else can I say? Give it a try. Don't let weird setting make You reject this anime. It may sound like something for vore fetishist, but really it's far more than that and actually people who love vore wouldn't have much to enjoy there anyway, because despite having this swallowing thing, it isn't vore oriented.Also, my rating is probably a bit high, but I still think the anime doesn't deserve anything below 7. I gave overall rate of 8, because I believe it's really special. often hurting others. She is self loathing from time to time, because of that trait. But she find someone who let her be herself.

However, after just watching the first episode I found myself swept into this seemingly simple but charismatic world.Story and Characters 7/10I group these two together because the anime is a very character driven. Much of the episodes are spent exploring character problems. Though some characters are definitely underdeveloped and the story can trail off path overall they were good.Art 9/10While simple, the art is what I believe was so important. The rounded shapes and cute images of everything really represented the innocents of this anime. Besides being cute this anime also...has many beautiful scenes.Sound 10/10Okay ""there is always room for improvement"" but the opening track of this anime is one of my favorites. The innocent voice of the female singer combined with the orchestral music really comes together to represent Hisone to Maso-tan so well.

Not set in high school, no teleporting to a fantasy world, It doesn\'t use the generic anime style, but instead is drawn in a very welcoming almost cartoon aesthetic, and no unnecessary sexualization of it\'s characters... Well, kind of. I\'ll get back to that one. Dragon Pilot is a military fantasy anime where our main lead Amakatsu is stationed at the Air Self-Defense Forces\'s Gifu Base. This is where she becomes the pilot of an OTF. AKA, A dragon that can transform into a military grade fighter jet. This is completely played straight by...the military. With all the weird concepts that anime gets recognized for, surprisingly, I haven\'t seen to many anime fans talk about this one. It\'s unfortunate because this really is a good show. The characters are delightful with Amakasu and Hoshino getting most emotional character arcs, not to say the other Dragon pilots or the supporting cast don\'t get their fair share of moments. Thematically there\'s also an importance of love that I felt could\'ve been executed better, but it was still cute none the less. The only real issue that I have with Dragon Pilot are the random remarks of sexism. ""A woman\'s first priority is to fall in love."" Is an actual quote in this show that never has any repercussions from the character saying it. If this was a one time thing, I wouldn\'t even mention it, but it happens quite often that it\'s impossible to ignore. Dragon Pilot also tends to have a few moments of unnecessary sexualization of it\'s female characters. I\'ve seen other anime be way worse then this, but when your show has a very welcoming almost child like drawing style, it becomes really jarring to see it get sexual. If you can ignore those few gripes then Dragon Pilot is an absolute joy and you should give it a shot. the military.

Then it\'s all about learning to pilot and get to know the dragon from ""dragon pilot"" and for a while...i was wondering if our MC was the only pilot to actually have a dragon considering how late the other pilots come in, and ultimately every pilot but the MC and the ""your not a plane your a dragon"" girl are unimportant and the substitute pilot gets more airtime than them but MOVING ON. The show introduced and bullshit plot element of ""you can\'t fall in love"" or ""you have to fall in love then have your heart broken"" thing in order to fly their dragons, but the shows pulls out the cheese from a show with similar animation ""Little Witch Academia"" and says ""well you can love you just gotta equally love your dragon"", which makes me feel like one of the girls in charge who bitched out one of the pilots for wanting to quit honestly but again, MOVING ON! Towards the end we figure out something ""nobody could have saw coming"" (sarcasm at its finest), there\'s a ancient ritual that has a honestly not so heavy cost per say, and the cost is A-ok with paying the cost because it was BORN TO DO THIS, literally... But the more annoying part of it all is, its completely UNNECESSARY... I didn\'t expect much of a story or show from this but the story was epic levels of bad overall. (oh, btw love is ok once this thing that happens once every melina is done... This is the same issue i had with Yuno is a Hero, WHAT\'S THE POINT OF THE EXTREMES IF THEY WON""T MATTER LATER!)Characters: Nothing to special to report here and like i said above the only pilots that matter are the Sub-pilot, the MC and ""its not like i like my dragon or anything... Baka"" pilots, the others are just whatever. I wasn\'t a fan of the girl in charge of the pilots for most of it, but she bitched out someone once in the show and it was AWESOME lol. The old lady was better as a random kind lady as opposed to what she apparently is later. The guys are all fine in the show i suppose but the military hardhead was kinda annoying.

The top section is devoid and is intended for new viewers but the bottom sectioned is labelled to contain spoilers which may impact your enjoyment of the show.I had a lot of fun watching Hisone to Maso-tan. The animation and character design is simply stunning and the art style is really charming and I felt really connected to the characters by the end of my watch-through. It\'s a shame that, while there was all this glamour put into the visual side of things, I didn\'t really feel that much had been done with its story and character development by the end.Amakasu...is our titular protagonist who is unwillingly thrust into the position of an OTF pilot, OTF being Organic Transformed Flyer -  essentially, dragons which are disguised as military fighter planes - after one such dragon chooses her by, um ... swallowing her. We will get to that later, though. She\'s awkward, dorky, and has a habit of speaking her thoughts out loud and she\'s a great source of comedy - genuinely made me laugh a couple times, especially with Nao-san, a heart-wrenching moment truly on par with Wilson from Castaway. But through all these personality traits, we really don\'t get to known her all that much throughout the twelve episode run. You get brief reasons for her motivations in joining military but it really isn\'t anything beyond that. There\'s little to no development, except romantic, and I wish I would\'ve at least been given a deeper dive into her past to get to know her better than we do.The same goes for a lot of the rest of the OTF cast, with the exception of perhaps El. They each have their own personality, and that\'s great - their personalities really do shine - but there is a distinct lack of development or backstory. El is the one who goes through the most change during one particular arc, but this is an outlier. She is also the one we get the most backstory for, and it really isn\'t a lot, but it\'s there and it does gives reason for her to join the military. It works similar to Amakasu. Elle and Lillico get no such treatment and feel thrown to the wayside, even though I would have loved to learn more about them. In fact Joa lady, who is ostensibly a side character, probably gets the most told about her past when compared to literally the entire cast and that\'s just odd.The opening and ending were really good and I have to applaud them for introducing me to France Gall who is just an amazing musician with that bop of an ending. The dance loop was really cute.Onto the topic of the military and dragon pilots, though. The pilots get into their OTF, as you could\'ve guessed earlier, by swallowing them. It\'s weird and gross, no jab if you\'re into that sort of thing, but something about the imagery of these girls being surrounded by the fleshy stomachs of these dragons and having to wear suits to prevent themselves from being literally actively digested before being vomited back up once their done is ... disconcerting. Someone has to have thought up a better way to do this at some point in history. This is a relatively minor gripe in the scope of everything, I guess it adds to the shows charm, but ... c\'mon.The overall story wasn\'t bad but I feel it starts to show some wear in the seams when it comes to the pacing of the story it\'s trying to convey. The majority of it is slice of life dominant but it really hits hard with action elements towards the end and it just feels out of place compared to what was happening beforehand. It\'s hard to get into this without spoiling major events so if you would like to know more, continue through the section ahead. If not feel free to skip to the very end for a final summary.[SPOILERS AHEAD]First of all, the love destruction subplot was weird. I get the anastomosis part, but if the dragon pilots\' only purpose was to move Mitatsu, and that was happening in only a couple of week if not less, then why did they have to go out of their way to do this whole love destruction plot now? Wouldn\'t a better idea just to have been to say ""Hey, guys, we\'re going to have to section you off from the men for now for reasons."" Or to tell the guy who was most likely to pair with them to lay off for a while until the mission was over? As it stands now they just kinda let it happen only days before the Mitatsu mission and then immediately disbanded the dragon pilots afterward so, really, what was the point?The first four episodes are really just setup for how the flying works and how she got her OTF suit but it really just drags on for too long when it feels like we should be better getting to know the rest of the OTF pilot cast, which get a whole *two episodes* of bonding time on an island before plunging straight into four episodes of building up romance with El and Amakasu that military higher-ups really should actively be trying to root out of the pilots. The pacing just feels off, especially when we consider the Mitatsu ending arc which thrusts us out of the guise of a laid-back slice of life and straight to a huge dragon who solely could sink Japan and demands literal human sacrifice. I still like the Mitatsu arc, but I liked the island much better and they probably should\'ve just chosen between which feeling they wanted to go for - action or slice of life.[END SPOILERS]Overall, the anime was enjoyable, if not deep piece of media. The characters were charming in personality and the art style was right there to back it up, but neither the character development nor the backstory was there to back that up. The story seemed like it stumbled more than meshed from slice of life into action at the end. You can manage to do both but the pacing needs to back it up, and in this case I really don\'t think it managed to do so. I came into this prepared to give the anime a much higher rating but critically I think this anime was just above average in its execution. But don\'t let that stop you from giving it a watch! By no means am I saying that its not worth spending your time on so go give it a whirl and formulate your own opinion on the matter.Peace y\'all, Shanranran is our titular protagonist who is unwillingly thrust into the position of an OTF pilot, OTF being Organic Transformed Flyer -  essentially, dragons which are disguised as military fighter planes - after one such dragon chooses her by, um ... swallowing her. We will get to that later, though. She\'s awkward, dorky, and has a habit of speaking her thoughts out loud and she\'s a great source of comedy - genuinely made me laugh a couple times, especially with Nao-san, a heart-wrenching moment truly on par with Wilson from Castaway. But through all these personality traits, we really don\'t get to known her all that much throughout the twelve episode run. You get brief reasons for her motivations in joining military but it really isn\'t anything beyond that. There\'s little to no development, except romantic, and I wish I would\'ve at least been given a deeper dive into her past to get to know her better than we do.The same goes for a lot of the rest of the OTF cast, with the exception of perhaps El. They each have their own personality, and that\'s great - their personalities really do shine - but there is a distinct lack of development or backstory. El is the one who goes through the most change during one particular arc, but this is an outlier. She is also the one we get the most backstory for, and it really isn\'t a lot, but it\'s there and it does gives reason for her to join the military. It works similar to Amakasu. Elle and Lillico get no such treatment and feel thrown to the wayside, even though I would have loved to learn more about them. In fact Joa lady, who is ostensibly a side character, probably gets the most told about her past when compared to literally the entire cast and that\'s just odd.The opening and ending were really good and I have to applaud them for introducing me to France Gall who is just an amazing musician with that bop of an ending. The dance loop was really cute.Onto the topic of the military and dragon pilots, though. The pilots get into their OTF, as you could\'ve guessed earlier, by swallowing them. It\'s weird and gross, no jab if you\'re into that sort of thing, but something about the imagery of these girls being surrounded by the fleshy stomachs of these dragons and having to wear suits to prevent themselves from being literally actively digested before being vomited back up once their done is ... disconcerting. Someone has to have thought up a better way to do this at some point in history. This is a relatively minor gripe in the scope of everything, I guess it adds to the shows charm, but ... c\'mon.The overall story wasn\'t bad but I feel it starts to show some wear in the seams when it comes to the pacing of the story it\'s trying to convey. The majority of it is slice of life dominant but it really hits hard with action elements towards the end and it just feels out of place compared to what was happening beforehand. It\'s hard to get into this without spoiling major events so if you would like to know more, continue through the section ahead. If not feel free to skip to the very end for a final summary.[SPOILERS AHEAD]First of all, the love destruction subplot was weird. I get the anastomosis part, but if the dragon pilots\' only purpose was to move Mitatsu, and that was happening in only a couple of week if not less, then why did they have to go out of their way to do this whole love destruction plot now? Wouldn\'t a better idea just to have been to say ""Hey, guys, we\'re going to have to section you off from the men for now for reasons."" Or to tell the guy who was most likely to pair with them to lay off for a while until the mission was over? As it stands now they just kinda let it happen only days before the Mitatsu mission and then immediately disbanded the dragon pilots afterward so, really, what was the point?The first four episodes are really just setup for how the flying works and how she got her OTF suit but it really just drags on for too long when it feels like we should be better getting to know the rest of the OTF pilot cast, which get a whole *two episodes* of bonding time on an island before plunging straight into four episodes of building up romance with El and Amakasu that military higher-ups really should actively be trying to root out of the pilots. The pacing just feels off, especially when we consider the Mitatsu ending arc which thrusts us out of the guise of a laid-back slice of life and straight to a huge dragon who solely could sink Japan and demands literal human sacrifice. I still like the Mitatsu arc, but I liked the island much better and they probably should\'ve just chosen between which feeling they wanted to go for - action or slice of life.[END SPOILERS]Overall, the anime was enjoyable, if not deep piece of media.

Released by Studio Bones - most known for popularized works like My Hero Academia - Hisone to Mason-tan slipped under the radar for the Spring 2018 seasonal animes.The story, in my opinion, was followable and easy to understand. It gave the appropriate amount of time to become acquainted with the cast, establish intercharacter relationships, and give a briefing of the plot. That being said, the final conflict revolving around Mitatsu-sama, a Giant...Organic Transformed Flyer, seemed somewhat unsolved or paced too quickly. The last few episodes leading up to the twelfth episode thoroughly described the situation but became lost in the jumble of character disagreements. Characters that had just been introduced were suddenly top-priority or being flushed out in a span of a few episodes. For example, Sada Hinomoto, whom until Episode 8 (‚ÄúLimited Time Offer! Spicy Granny Flavor‚Äù)  was only known as the ‚ÄúJoie Lady‚Äù, was given four episodes to reveal her backstory and justify her character. During this four-episode span, other relationships were being dealt with and the plot just left a convoluted feeling. Despite the plot being very character-heavy (as the intention) and having noticeable timing inconsistencies, the plot was overall enjoyable.The art was pleasing to look at and just carried the feeling of wondrousness and fun. Personally, I found the unique art style to be a sight for sore eyes and I had little issue with the preferred style of representation.The accompanying sound was average - with a few highlights here and there, but the ending was perhaps the most praiseworthy portion of the original soundtrack. The accompanying animation is focused around pastels and pale tones, which highlights the energetic beat of the song. Though no matter how you look at it, the song, in itself, is a short, enjoyable listen.Amakasu Hisone, the main character, is a woman who opted to join the Japan Air Self-Defense Force after a life of awkward social interactions and the inability to ‚Äúsugar coat‚Äù her words. Plotwise, her personality is a major staple of her interactions with fellow characters and even serves - in multiple instances - as the comedic cornerstone of the series. This was charming, as it kept the many aspects of the show in harmony, but also gave viewers an understanding of how she might develop as a character. And as one can expect, she developed to a stage in her life where responsibility was important to take on and her innocence was more or less lost. Though Amakasu‚Äôs personality and quirkiness were enjoyable, the remainder of the cast also had their own oddity and, generally, likable personalities, which ultimately toned down Amakasu‚Äôs standout personality. Overall, though, the cast of characters is easily identifiable in comparison to each other and are pretty good at attracting the viewers to the plot.As far as the enjoyment factor goes, I did delight in watching the show, despite its misgivings and minor discrepancies. Dragon Pilot: Hisone to Masotan carries the amicable presence of a feelgood cast of characters and a straightforward romance drama. I normally dislike love triangles that are stuck into a story for the sole purpose of existing, but the romance felt natural enough to not be a major annoyance and it did appear to be coordinated to fit like a puzzle with the already established relationships and plot.Overall, Dragon Pilot: Hisone to Masotan is a likable story following the comedic, but sometimes serious and earnest, antics of Amakasu and her relationship with Masotan and her colleagues. If you can look past some of the weird pacing and unanswered questions the conclusion festers, I recommend it to anyone who wants to relive times of childhood imagination and innocence.

If you can look past some of the weird pacing and unanswered questions the conclusion festers, I recommend it to anyone who wants to relive times of childhood imagination and innocence.', 'Hisone to Masotan is an easy show to get attached to, thanks to its unique and lovable visual climate.  Its plush and cartoony animation style, with its smooth, round shapes, thin lines, and pleasant colors, suits the semi-fantastical, semi-grounded nature of the show.  The character designs, typically simplistic and soft, achieve a similar effect, mostly possessing a chibi-like quality well-suited to the show\'s playful side, but also adaptable to numerous expressions and situations.  That pliability proves to be a boon, for the characters are the show\'s greatest strength, especially the titular Hisone Amakasu.Hisone: wide-eyed and noseless, not fully free...of youthful aimlessness, balancing confusion and a lack of confidence with a compulsion to say whatever comes to mind, no matter how impolitic.  She makes for an interesting protagonist not only because of her uncommon personality type, but because of her uncommon position: she is an adult in the workforce, and a woman in the military at that.  From the first episode, Hisone demonstrates an endearing sense of being overwhelmed by her responsibilities and a tendency towards brutal honesty that makes her easy to identify with and to love as a main character.  Even if the rest of the show suffered much more severe setbacks than it does, Hisone\'s presence would make it impossible to stop watching.On the path to divining and accepting her own feelings, Hisone hits some very familiar beats (most of which involve denying that she has any feelings), but she pulls off an expert reversal thanks to her perpetual frankness.  Once she grasps the nature of her attitudes towards her peers, Hisone expresses herself casually, forcefully, bluntly - in whatever way the situation calls for - and, during the show\'s climax, she engages in a strange confessional tirade that is as satisfying as it is unconventional.  The show ends too early to develop a proper romance (despite multiple perfect opportunities to do so, which does leave me rather frustrated), but its willingness to discuss the possibility and show some of the steps along the way still sets it apart from the norm.Standing by Hisone through her experiences are the combative Nao Kaizaki; the serious, professional El Hoshino; the dry, reclusive Lilikos Kinutsugai; and the elder sister-like Mayumi Hitomi.  At first glance, each of these pilots seems to embody some familiar archetype, but given the uniqueness of the setting, that deceit can last only so long; as the show progresses, each pilot reveals a different side not so easily summed up in a handful of glib, cliched adjectives.  Lines of dialogue here and there, accompanied by brief scenes interspersed throughout the show, round out the pilots\' personalities and establish them as thinking, feeling beings who, much like Hisone, face their own internal conflicts and have their own troubling circumstances to deal with.  El most of all defies typical anime pigeonholing, as a character who could exist only in a show like this: she is a tireless worker driven to overcome the barriers in front of her and become the first female fighter pilot, but finds herself derailed by circumstances outside her control.  Faced with multiple options that lead only to personal failure and criticism from her male superiors and peers, El suffers mental and emotional anguish over her placement with the dragon pilots, allowing the show many opportunities to comment on the treatment of women, especially career-driven women, in the workplace and how they are perceived by society.Strong performances all around, and in particular excellent turns from Misaki Kuno (Hisone) and Satomi Arai (Lilikos), liven up an already endearing cast, and Romi Park really gets going in the tail end of the series, to amusing effect.  In the midst of a fantasy-based story, these characters and their situations give Hisone to Masotan some real substance.  The show is half-ridiculous, but also half-serious; the last episodes take a dark turn that seems to be rather sudden - until a step back reveals that this show had always had a cruel side.  All throughout this series, characters manipulate each other, deceive each other, and subject each other to crude, inhumane trials that can sometimes be explained or laughed away by the bubbly animation but resonate a little too deeply with real-world circumstances to be dragon-level fantasy.  The crushing animosity of careerism towards personal relationships is frustrating and unjust, as it should be - perhaps blown out to strange proportions and approached in a weirdly literal way here, but no less real and no less dire.  It takes a plucky protagonist like Hisone to reject such a system and pursue both of her dreams, if such a thing can be achieved.For all this talk of character, however, the lack of it in the OTFs themselves runs contrary to the show\'s intentions.  By the end of the show, Masotan is no more of a character than he was in the beginning - a voiceless, amorphous figure more akin to a pet than a sentient being - and yet Hisone\'s attitude towards him has changed significantly, indicative of a deep understanding between the two that never fully comes to light and is presented as something the audience should take for granted after a certain point.  Although the show\'s themes and figurative readings depend on Hisone\'s position as a dragon pilot rather than on Masotan himself, the narrative relies on Masotan as the true object of Hisone\'s affections; a lot of the conflicts and resolutions fall on his shoulders.  Absent any clear basis for the relationship between dragon and pilot, aside from a vague sense of Masotan having ""chosen"" Hisone and Hisone having ""accepted"" her role, it\'s hard to believe that Hisone‚Äôs and Masotan‚Äôs companionship is as important as she claims it is and as important as the show needs it to be.Dragon Pilot\'s ""all-pilot, no-dragon"" approach works for me.  As a nonhuman entity with neither a literal voice nor a figurative one, Masotan can only be so expressive and so nuanced a character; the subtextual (and textual) conflicts endemic to human relationships will always be more interesting to me than How to Train Your Anime Dragon.  The show recognizes this truth as well, for the most part, spending most of its time with Hisone as she interacts with colleagues and navigates adulthood.  Where this strategy falters, however, is in leaving the premise underdeveloped.  After 12 episodes, the mechanics of piloting OTFs remain as cryptic as ever, and while the shock of the OTFs\' true mission isn\'t insurmountable, their actual role comes out piecemeal.  Certain details are withheld for dramatic effect, it\'s true, but there could have been at least a little more exposition to prepare.  Nothing concrete seems to come of Iboshi\'s role and his poetic language; several of the conflicts in this show wind up looking like bumps in the road that could have been avoided, and though the wilder twists of the plot don\'t feel too jarring in the moment, looking back, I can\'t say that everything came together as cleanly as it could have.  Perhaps events on such a grand scale were necessary to underscore the absurdity inherent to some of the themes, but from a purely narrative perspective, I think the show could have been better as an open-ended, slice-of-life-type show with no need for an ""endgame"" in this manner.  The characters themselves could provide enough drama and intrigue to sustain a full series.Hisone to Masotan bids farewell on an uncertain note.  On the one hand, its endearing cast survived multiple unexpected diversions untarnished; the show has several important things to say about sexism and personal responsibility while also reserving space for examining love and duty from a more adult perspective than what anime audiences are likely used to.  On the other hand, the show never quite followed through on the potential to be daring and different that it announced on its arrival, becoming mired in an array of seemingly unnecessary twists and succumbing to unfortunate conventions in leaving things open-ended or unexplained.  As confusing as some of the specifics are, however, the show\'s style, sense of humor, and lovable characters all make Hisone to Masotan worthy of recommendation and of revisiting. of youthful aimlessness, balancing confusion and a lack of confidence with a compulsion to say whatever comes to mind, no matter how impolitic.

Yes, Dragon Pilot has more than it's fair share of issues, but overall I had a pretty good time watching it.The characters are a bit archetypey, (and before you ask of course I looked up whether that was a word or not before I typed it) but I like all of them just the same. There were a bunch of characters that were made into unnecessary villains, which immediately after their villain phases were turned into friends throughout the show. These characters were only villains to add conflict, and I don't love that because it felt unnecessary,...but it's whatever.I think that overall this show just had too much stuff in it. It was very ambitious, and I can respect that, but it definitely bit off a little more than it could chew. I know this doesn't really happen, but if this show were 8 or 9 episodes and they cut a lot of the filler stuff they had, it would feel a lot more like a complete and thought-out product. There were just some things that I thought that were completely unneeded.Another thing this show tries, and fails, to do, is to add drama. The drama isn't the worst I've ever seen, but I really feel like it clashes a little with the tone of the show. There is some serious stuff in starting maybe a little before the second half of Dragon Pilot, which I just found to not fit in with what they had established the show to be like. It had mostly been a funny, coming of age type story until they added in the drama, and it stuck out. Yes, every story needs at least a little drama here and there to be really excellent, but it did feel a little forced into this show.One thing I don't have too many complaints about is the ending. I'm sure that other people do have a lot of complaints, but *spoiler* I'm a sucker for a happy ending. Honestly you don't really get more of an anime-esque ending than this one. It does clash a little bit with the more original and unique vibe that the show is going for, but I didn't really find it too disarming.One thing that this show is not lacking is originality. Anime can be weird, and this is far from the weirdest anime I've seen, but dragons that turn into fighter jets sounds like a pretty cool concept to me. I also absolutely love the art, I think it works extremely well. Art is not the first thing I look for when watching an anime, but when it is unique I really appreciate it. If it just looks like any other anime I don't hate it, but it's just a lot better when it has its own look. Some good examples of this that I have seen are flip flappers, AOT, Mob psycho, Kobayashi's dragon maid, kill la kill, March comes in like a lion, and others. It just makes the show more memorable in a good way when the art is different. I don't even mind if it looks worse than a typical anime, as long as it's different, and this is something this anime does well. I have no complaints with the music, either.I know I took some jabs at Dragon Pilot, but overall I liked it and thought bit was worth watching, and I think you should give it a try too.

It\'s pretty fun, a bit childish but it has a charming art style and is well enough acted to be enjoyable. The plot, though is pants. It isn\'t terrible, but like so many other creative original anime, it feels poorly realized and nonsensical. I won\'t spoil, but things go off the rails the most after the second OP gets introduced and things get ""serious"".A lot of the male characters in this show are really sexist, but I\'m kind of fine with that given the military setting. A loooooot of people in the military are even more misogynistic than...this, at least in the US, so it strikes me as realist. But then again, realism might be completely out of place here.I can\'t say anything about a 3+ year old anime that hasn\'t been said better in other reviews, but I will say that there\'s a lot of fun to be had here if, and only if, you switch your brain off. Not a bad show, a visual treat, but nothing spectacular. this, at least in the US, so it strikes me as realist.

Of course I am not talking about the obvious fantasy elements of the dragons.Although I enjoyed this anime and it's original setting, I couldn't help but be very dissapointed by the huge potential that was wasted.I have writen what I think is a concise overview of all the points where I thought this anime came up short. My main issues with the anime is mainly with the characters and their actions, but I will try to elaborate further by describing different points:1. For an anime set on the...JSDF and myself being a huge fan of military jets, it was a huge let down the ridiculous little amount of flying that happened in the series. If it was a live action film/series where filming this kind of scenes are hard and costly, I would understand, but the fact that it is an anime centered on flying jets and dragons, it was really a dissapointment.2. Following from this, the fact that the mc girl goes up flying without any serious training or some actual fligth experience on a normal jet beforehand is uter ridicoulous. Adding to this, half of the flying scenes shown were huge let downs too as it contained the characters doing useless stuff and acting like ridicoulous people while performing dangerous things that should really happen before actually going flying, but hey it's anime right?3. Something that vexed me to no end, is if I got it right, they are in the JSDF right? Although it is an anime, apart from the slight humor and awkard situations, I still thought it would be kind of serious actions But I was really surprised at the kind of utter bullshit the JSDF having such useless people without any kind of order, respect or such blatant disregard for proper procedure or actions? Again I remind myself it is anime, (plus I get the JSDF couldn't do much with how the OTF selected their pilots). But common, for such a serious setting and serious animation of JSDF jets, facilities and commanding officer characters being surprisingly serious, I would have thought that the main characters wouldn't be a bunch of teenagers that have no business being in the JSDF and falling in love like it was their first time when they were 14 years old. Specially since most of the main characters should be around 18-25 and were stablished in the JSDF long before being thrust into the OTF business. Although again, it is an anime, I don't get how this series has main characters being teenagers and acting like rebellious teens in love as if this was Date A Live or some other parody were 11 year old girls are commanders of a flying battleship and whatnot. The anime started so serious and all but only a few characters like officer Remi Kakiyasu being one of the few that portrayed they were in the JSDF and not what seemed to be a kindergarten.4. The story plot was really a huge let down as well, although well portrayed and it was thought provoking with the whole process of someone needing to stay behind quite emotional. Again, with such a huge original story, the fact the writers creativity ended with the story idea of dragons in modern age disguised as fighters, and the rest was so unsatisfying that I wonder what they were thinking.Overall, this was a 6-7 out of 10, if you are into anime and seeing something different I recommend this anime wholeheartedly despite the low score. I really liked the premise and the anime in general, but the whole main characters and the small amount of flying made this dissapointing for me, specially considering there are not many animes with military jets or scenes but oh well *sigh*I understand everyone has a different opinion and if you have reached this point I appreciate for reading so far, let me know if it was helpful or not!

The obscure anime that I watched back in 2018 and loved to death, and one that got me into the mecha genre. I recently got the chance to rewatch it, and uhh...Dragon Pilot is...a weird show. It\'s Gundam, or Transformers if you prefer, with vore and dragons, but without the amazingly-choreographed robot fights or deep lore. There\'s no villain, and the overarching plot with the ancient fish god thing is a mess and isn\'t very fleshed out. So what does that leave us with?Well, some of the best inter-character subplots ever written. Hisone Amakasu is a great and quirky protagonist and her...growth as a character is some of the best and most wholesome writing I\'ve ever seen. The other main characters start of as archetypes, and they do have names, but I have affectionally labeled them as ""Fat Mom,"" ""Angry Bitch,"" ""Master Chief,"" ""The Only Relevant Male Character in the Entire Show,"" and ""Depressed Edgy the Edgehog,"" and if you\'re wondering if by that I mean the archetypes or the characters themselves, the answer is yes. However the growth they do get later on is amazing as well, and their interactions with each other and Hisone is very sweet and heartfelt.Now the story...dear God where do I begin with the main plot. The first half is filler, then in episodes 5 and 6 the main cast gets sent to survival training for character arc stuff, then in episode 8 they introduce a character who is unnecessarily menacing considering he never turns into an antagonist. And then the two-part finale rips off the last ten minutes of Char\'s Counterattack and stretches it out to 46 minutes. I\'m exaggerating of course, and the finale is full of good emotional moments, mainly between Hisone and her dragon, Masotan, but the general premise is pretty similar.The story is a mosh pit of messy and undercooked ideas. I love the individual character arcs, but the main overarching plot is kind of confused about what it wants to do, and at one point introduces a former dragon pilot that the show makes you think will turn into Hisone\'s mentor, and then she just...leaves the show. The plot also has some of the most godawful pacing I\'ve ever seen. It constantly speeds up and slows down and gets almost nauseating to watch.But to prove that I don\'t completely hate this show, like I said the individual subplots are great (and has my favorite anime ship ever), the artstyle is very unique, and the animation is super fluid, some of the best I\'ve seen in a while. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. And it\'s very obvious that this show was made to harken back to simpler times, when giant shapeshifting robots, charming characters, and dragons were the coolest fucking things in the entire goddamn universe.But is it really that kind of return to form for the mecha genre? Nah man, it ain\'t. It\'s about as much a return to form as binging on Taco Bell for an entire evening and then your poor anus imploding in the morning is a good experience (spoilers, it ain\'t.)However, it\'s a decent enough show that\'ll keep your attention, and it\'s only twelve episodes, so I\'d say it\'s a very enjoyable experience overall. I\'d say check this out if you\'re into mecha and you\'re looking for something short and sweet that takes a break from the epic space operas the genre is famous for. And since this is the show that got me into the mecha genre overall, and eventually led me to Mobile Suit Gundam and the masterpieces that are Zeta Gundam and Char\'s Counterattack, I\'d say there\'s worse ways to be introduced to, or to relive, the genre\'s glory days. growth as a character is some of the best and most wholesome writing I\'ve ever seen.

""Comedy"" as one of the genres? The only funny thing I found while watching the show was how pathetic I am as I was reflecting upon myself during the boring parts of the show. If this was a sitcom, then even the laugh_track.sfx would respectfully disagree to work. Usually when you experience something, especially for the first time, you have a burning desire to take something from it. A lesson, a quote, characteristic or at least a beautiful song. There is nothing to take away from Hisone to Maso-tan. Don\'t be fooled by the high rating...of this show, ashen one. Achieve the post-nut clarity and rightfully skip it.

Kao Ni La Zhanshen Xitong,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52178/Kao_Ni_La_Zhanshen_Xitong,"[""As of the time of writing this there are only 8 episodes out. Still, I'm giving the series a 9/10. The art is more amateurish than high-quality studios, yet the animation is still very fluid and the art style and colors are actually very refreshing. Sound quality isn't bad, voice acting is on point, and, unlike many donghuas, the translations subtitles are easy to read and make sense (or at least the version I watched was). My favorite part of this show is that even though its about cultivation, its still light-hearted and every character isn't secretly (or not so secretly) an arrogant asshole. Certainly...gives me a new appreciation for futuristic-cultivation media and I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this series and the studios future works gives me a new appreciation for futuristic-cultivation media and I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this series and the studios future works"", ""I have to say in advance that I generally see not many Chinese anime, this because I gotten too used to the Japanese anime and I don't seem to find many Chinese ones. I will take that part on my shoulders. I however needed to read the subtitles a lot more then usually.As there are not many people that seen this show, I will try to keep out the spoilers.Story:The story is quite well done, although I do have to say it gets confusing at times due to the 'need to focus on reading subs' thing. I did notice there were parts of the story...that were attempts on being funny or helpful, but were failed attempts. This could be because a failure in translations, but it could also be that the story was written this way. It just gets annoying regardless.There is slapstick humor that when added are hit and miss things. There is a scene where a boob gets touched when a male character trips. Of course with the woman freaking out and it turning into a break between the two for a bit that can be noticed in multiple episodes. There are more things like this that seemingly attempt a flowing storyline that includes humor. It just doesn't seem to flow nicely as both the intro as outro cause issues in this. The intro takes too long and the outro is just missing. The story suddenly stops suddenly which might be a bad thing.The combat lacks severely, often also over in just a few attacks which is a bit odd, but there are Japanese anime that suffer as well from this flaw. If the studio would shorten the intro a bit and fit in a little more fighting scenes or additional info where needed it would be awesome.In the last episode, or rather after the outro, there is a summary of what happened in this anime and you get a announcement for season 2 mentioned by one of the characters. The flashback/summary thing I couldn't care less for personally, but others might actually like it. The season 2 announcement is done right.Characters:The characters did have some of the Japanese anime characters ideas, but do act a bit differently which gives them a more own personality feeling. So that would be a positive thing in my book.There is some form of skill and level progression for Lin An, but it isn't done in a smooth way and there for causes a disconnect to some extend. There is more to this, but then I will have to go into explaining while using spoilers. There is some sort of reasoning, but I feel this could have been explained better.Graphics & Animations:The graphics look rather basic, as if the studio left it with basic drawings and colorations. This could work in one point, but completely fail in another. So I do have mixed feelings regarding this. I do think it could have used more attention.The animations are often flowing very nicely, running around or simple walking looks very good. Also other animations like clothing works amazingly well.Sounds:This is actually quite well done for a anime like this. You often hear background noises from other characters or environmental. I'd say this is good. Also the music is done nicely, although the intro song needs to grow on you if you don't watch Chinese anime often.Final conclusion:While it does have some flaws I can say it's well worth the effort watching this anime. It sure isn't the best out there, but not the worst either. Far from it even. I do hope the studio will take in my review and apply a little to season 2 where possible. If this anime had better graphics and the humor would have hit better, this might have been a 9 or 9.5 worth.

It played out somewhat how I was expecting in the beginning.It starts out very fast, almost too fast, specific to character development, the MC becoming used to his new circumstance and acquaintances.  Although eventually everything settles down to where it needs to, and the story continues on. The subtitles, perhaps irrelevant to the anime and production team is quite fast at times, due to the limitations of the English language as someone who speaks Chinese would perhaps say. Regardless words and sentences are crammed in tight sometimes, reading must...be very good from the viewer.Production wise this anime requires a lot of attention, good and bad. The animation style is brilliant most of the time. Reactions of characters, fighting scenes, effects and so on. The design style within production can differ as a result of different methods used for animation, CGI as a primary and most obvious example. It can make things look out of place.BUT, particular to animation style, design, quick sequences; I have not seen fighting scenes this good in a long time. You can really tell that the team really put in the effort to making and thinking about certain aspects of this anime, and others seemingly not, which is strange. A prominent example of this would be the lengths of each episodes, the introductions and ending sequences. They are not particularly the best and can seem out of context or feeling with the movement of the anime itself, almost as if the production team for these things were different or had no or little say so.The lengths of each episode are not uniform or is there a set standard duration. Perhaps this anime is supposed to be watch in a movie like manner? As introduced again after the 1st episode we are brought abruptly into the show again as if we were never supposed to stop watching, which can be a little strange.Transitions  during and sometimes between scenes have surprised me as they are unlike anything in most other animes today. Not that they are bad but they are insanely specific to happening of events, and are not leading the viewer to know or think to know what obviously is going to happen next. Which is greatComedic timing and even the comedy itself is some of which I have not seen before played out like it has here. Perhaps I am used to the clich√© Japanese style of anime in its now seemingly solidified form as a result of not wanting to change too much and disappoint audiences I suppose. I would argue as much to say that this anime is novel in a sense. As it does not play by the commonalities of present day animes and does for the most part, its own thing. However it does not of course have in every respect a novel aspect of being completely new, as with something such as anime that already exists, hard it is to create something completely original. But this show certainly does something of the sorts, and I hope to watch more of it!Episode 13 I need to mention was the only episode of the anime I felt to be out of place.

I would suggest against reading this review or watching this before watching the previous parts.After an assassination attempt on Marc\'s life and surgury with a spinal centipede in an effort to save his life, Marc has mutated into a monster, somewhere between human and the mutants infesting the world. While he still seems to retain some measure of his human memories, he is now ostricized by the people, despite all his previous contributions to the Lighthouse. The political rival, now ""winner"" in an effort to kill him using popular sentiment, makes a mistake that causes massive destruction to...the Lighthouse once Marc gets enraged.All the political manuveuring and schemes come to a head in this finale. There\'s not much more to say. It is a beautifully animated finale, filled with action and emotion. Everything that has been foreshadowed in the previous parts comes to a head, ending this season with a bang. the Lighthouse once Marc gets enraged.All the political manuveuring and schemes come to a head in this finale.

Mahoraba: Heartful Days,https://myanimelist.net/anime/519/Mahoraba__Heartful_Days,"[""When I was younger, people often treated mental illnesses as if they were a joke or an excuse. People suffering from depression were often called lazy, schizophreniacs were shunned, more serious cases of mental illnesses were put away - out of sight, out of mind. Because of these beliefs, and because of some atrocious acts which were sensationalised through national media, all mental illnesses became tarred with the same brush. It's only in the last few years that society has become more accepting and understanding of the suffering caused by mental illnesses on the part of those suffering from them, and those who care for,...and about, the sufferers.You may think this is a bit of a serious note to begin a review of a comedy anime, but it has a point to it. See most forms of visual entertainment still protray certain forms of mental illnesses to be something dark or evil. Granted they may be caused by some traumatic event(s), but that doesn't mean being crazy is necessarily a bad thing (take it from one who knows).With this in mind, I'll begin the review.Mahoraba is a rare anime, and an absolute gem. The story is about Shiratori Ryushi, an aspiring children's book author, and his encounters with the people who live in Narutakisou, the apartment block where he has moved to while he attends art school. Most especially the story is about the relationship between him and his cousin, Aoba Kozue, and this is the key part of the story (I'll explain why in a second).At first glance the story looks to be the same as shows like Love Hina, but looks can be deceiving. This show is so much more than that, and the dimensions that are added to the story are rooted in the fact that Aoba Kozue suffers from a serious mental illness - she has Multiple Personality Disorder, brought on by a traunatic event in her childhood. Aoba Kozue is, in effect, five main characters at once.What I liked most about the story was the fact that it approached the subject of mental illness in a far more sensitive manner than most other shows - anime or otherwise. The story allows the characters to develop their relationships with each other, and shows how they cope with the fact that someone they care about suffers from such a serious disorder.The art style is very clean and colourful, but what I especially liked was the way they inserted 4 koma manga into an anime (you'll find one in almost every episode and they're highly amusing). I also liked the way the childrens story (which becomes a main theme of the show at the end), is depicted.The sound is of a very good standard. The music is very complementary to the show,and the sound effects are used very well. The characters voices don't grate on the ears (unlike a certain Oribe Aoi from Myself;Yourself).The main reason why this show is so likeable, other than the story, is the characters themselves. Once you're familiar with the characters you'll realise that this is no Love Hina by any measure - this is better. The two (or six) main characters are likable enough. Ryushi isn't as much of a loser as Keitaro, and Kozue is way nicer than Narusegawa. The other characters in the show are just as likeable, and have their own personalities, likes, dislikes, etc. Not one of the characters is boring in this show ( I have to admit that my two favourite characters are Konno Natsume - one of Kozue's personalities who sprouts flowers out of the top of her head when she's happy, and Erika Vermillion - the masochistic head of the Occult club of which both Kozue and Tamami are members).This anime won't appeal to everyone. I found this to be a funny, sweet, and above all sensitive comedy about caring for a person with a mental illness, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It may not be realistic in certain ways, but I don't think it was ever meant to be. I found many of the scenes to be extremely funny, and the scripting is very well done for a show like this. The dialogue between the characters is often highly amusing, and this, coupled with some of the &quot;insane&quot; antics the residents of Narutakisou get up to meant this show was never boring.It's nice to finally see a show where mental illness is treated with sensitivity and humour instead of the typical &quot;he/she is crazy and trying to take over/destroy the world&quot;, or &quot;must kill Makoto and/or Sekai&quot;, etc. and about, the sufferers.You may think this is a bit of a serious note to begin a review of a comedy anime, but it has a point to it.

What makes Mahoraba absolutely a joy to watch is the cast of dynamic characters who we learn to love throughout the series.  The characters in Mahoraba are very unique but genuine.  They each have their own quirks and faults and as the story progresses, we learn a little more about each of them.  It's funny how in the first few episodes, everyone tends to pick their favorites.  I did the same thing, and there were even...a few that I didn't particularly like at first.  However, as I learned more about all the characters, I found towards the end that I loved all of them for their silly faults.Mahoraba can be arguably a romantic comedy (less romance, more comedy), but I would rather say it's along the lines of a &quot;slice of life.&quot;  Interestingly enough, the anime didn't follow a story, but rather the characters in the story.  Afterall, it's the characters in Mahoraba that make it Heartful Days.  Each episode is filled with laughter and wisdom.  We learn more of each character, and, in a way, learn more about ourselves.  Although the anime has a loose storyline, it still feels amazingly coherent, so overall, it doesn't take anything away from the anime at all.The majority of the story is focused around Aoba Kozue, the cute young landlady of Narutaki-Sou.  Although she is not the main character of the story, she is very unique and important to all the members of Narutaki-Sou including Shiratori, the main character and new tenant of the apartments.  As the story progresses, we learn more of Kozue especially of her personality disorder.  However, the way it is presented, Kozue's disorder doesn't seem like a burden, but rather a joy.  Perhaps in some ways she may seem very naive at times, but her ability to make the best of everything and smile makes us smile as well.The art and sound is nothing out of the ordinary.  Generally, most will find that all of the characters are very cute (especially when eating umeboshi).  The artwork it self is very pleasing to the eyes, and the silly 4-panel manga portion typically in the middle of an episode are often hilarious.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime.  If you like unique virtuous characters that make you laugh, I'd definitely recommend this anime.  In any case, I would say, give it a shot.

After watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by it actually.Story, 7/10: There really isn't a main plot to the show, instead they supplement it with some small stories that may or may not come back in later episodes. The show focuses more on characters backgrounds, which adds to the stories as well. That being said, the pacing can be a bit off some times, certain things that occur do so very suddenly, sometimes with little...to no resolution.Art, 8/10: Everything in this category fit the show pretty well as it really elevates the overall tone. They also use what I believe is called 4 koma, which I feel is used perfectly.Sound, 7/10: I don't really have much to say about the music, I think if fit the cuteness of the show well.Characters, 8/10: Probably the strongest part of Mahoraba is its characters, they all developed, and have some very complicated backgrounds.

As for me, I\'m a sucker for intriguing, well-developed characters that stick around in your head long after you\'ve finished the show, and Mahoraba just happens to offer such characters.On the surface, Mahoraba is a story of the main character Shiratori Ryushi\'s stay at the Naritakisou apartment, the real focus of the show is on its dynamic gang of side characters. While it is easy to present a bunch of easily likable characters that offer some additional...dimensions to a show, Mahoraba takes those characters and use them as the foundation upon which the show is built. In that sense, Mahoraba can be considered a true ""people\'s story"". Each character is developed, episode by episode, and the story naturally with it. Rather than being the device through which the plot is progressed, the characters themselves are the plot, the story, the show. Therefore, while the show\'s story itself may not be as groundbreaking as those found in other genres, it is the ride itself, not the destination, that is the most enjoyable about the show.The pitfall of such a series, of course, is that it could be easily dismissed as ""boring"" and being a ""show about nothing"" (see also: Aria, Sketchbook). At first, I myself found Mahoraba\'s 26 episodes to be an intimidating lot to tackle. So many slice of life shows of such length end up losing its momentum too quickly and becoming redundant after the 13 episode mark, and finishing the rest of the show becomes an arduous task. Mahoraba takes the opposite approach, starting somewhat slowly, with a narrow focus on the two main characters Shiratori and the landlady Kozue, with the side characters acting more as comedic relief and background scenery. However, as the show progresses, the side characters are revealed in greater depth to the viewer, and more and more entwined unto the story, and that\'s where the show really reaches its high point. Kozue becomes the key character who brings forth and ties together the characters\' tales, and entwines them into a coherent knot. At the end of Mahoraba, you don\'t feel like you\'ve watched anything life-changing, or even memorable for that matter. However, upon looking back at the series, you do realize that Mahoraba takes you through each resident of Naritakisou as if you were living there yourself, and the twenty six episodes feel as though they\'ve passed by seamlessly, even though you can\'t seem to recall anything happening at all.Mahoraba is a slice of life story in the most literal sense. The show chronicles the lives of its characters, past and present, utilizing the two main characters and something of a storyline to do so. And just like in real life, though the details of your encounter with someone may be quickly lost, the memories of them, what they represent and the emotions they evoked, linger in your mind long after, and that\'s why Mahoraba still stands out in my mind, even long after I\'ve watched it, and will continue to do so. dimensions to a show, Mahoraba takes those characters and use them as the foundation upon which the show is built.

Not to say that I think Love Hina was terrible, but it was a struggle to get through.  Most people that have watched it probably feel the same way.  But this show is really much much better than Love Hina in every way.Mahoraba, like many romance series\', including Love Hina, centers around the main character coming to live in an apartment surrounded by a bunch of strange characters.  Yes, many of them are girls, but this...isn\'t a harem thing, since there\'s really only one romantic interest from the start and all the way through.  The thing that separates this from most other romance stories is the characters and to some extent the story.The main character, Shiratori Ryushi is starting art school to write children\'s books.  He is shown almost right away to be a talented artist, as well as being very kind to everyone.  He is a bit of a doormat sometimes, and is pushed around by people often.  But most of the time, he offers his help anyway and is obviously trying to be kind.  Unlike many characters like this often found in romance series\', Shiratori does show some backbone, and doesn\'t always back down when it\'s something important.The heroine here is Aoba Kazue.  Even though the show is about Shiratori\'s days at the apartment, Kazue is the star of the show and the character that everyone is centered around.  An exceedingly kind and thoughtful high school girl, Kazue is Shiratori\'s cousin and landlady of the apartments.  But she has a secret.  When certain things happen, she transforms into one of several different girls, each complete with unique and very fun personalities.  Really the only thing they all have in common is their love for umeboshi.  Everyone at the apartments loves Kazue and has fun together while sometimes covering up when she transforms, since she doesn\'t know about it.The other characters are all fun and unique, like Tamami, the strange girl that is Kazue\'s best friend and a member of the Occult Club in school.  She gets jealous of Shiratori often and blackmails him into doing things, and just generally tries to keep them from getting to close.  Johnny and Haibara make quite a pair as a dog puppet and his ""extra,"" the guy whose hand he\'s on.  Asumi, a middle schooler, and her mother, a job-hopping lazy woman who sleeps all day long instead of doing her job, which she is quite terrible at provide fun as well.  And of course Momono, the college student that drinks with Haibara and Johnny in Shiratori\'s room every night.  She\'s very often the start of troubles that Shiratori has, and is always having fun doing it.This show is a very character driven show, and it exceeds expectations on every front.  The characters are all fun and unique and they all are well developed and great to watch.  They all seem to be insane, save for the main character Shiratori, who gets tossed around like a chew toy at times.  Kazue really brings everyone together, and every day at the apartments is full of warm memories.  For most of the series there isn\'t a whole lot of story.  It\'s really a string of episodes that just develop each of the characters, while slowly building the relationship between Kazue and Shiratori.  Near the end there is a more clearly defined plot and you learn the tragic circumstances behind Kazue\'s problems.  It does develop a little slowly, but the characters are so great, I really didn\'t mind at all.The artwork is great as well.  The drawing style is interesting, a bit different than most anime you see, and it does seem kind of childish in a way, but it really fits the series well.  It was great the way they put in manga blocks to show/augment certain scenes.  The ongoing children\'s story also fits very well.  I also like the sound in the series.  The voice actors all do a good job with their characters and the music is very nice.  The opening an endings are all good and add to the cuteness of the show.  The music and sound effects in the show are all well done and really help convey emotions well.This was a very enjoyable show that is nearly perfect.  The characters are all wonderfully developed and provide a lit of fun in each episode.  The only problem I really had with the show was that there was a question or two at the end that I would\'ve like answered, but I can also see why they\'s want to leave it up to imagination.  For that I\'ll have to give Mahoraba a strong 9.

The girl,  Aoba Kozue, has everything going for her except..... Yes, she suffers from MPD, and everybody around her knows about it, except for boy (Shiratori, Ryushi ).What follows is a romp of enjoyment.

In fact the only real failing as far as I was concerned was the ending, this one was just too good to stop at 26 episodes.The MPD issue is a difficult one though, but it doesnt detract from the story on its own, and the alter egos are hilarious themselves, providing that extra bit of strangeness that works so well in the series.Artwork is perfect, fitting into the mood of a particular episode. This is a 2005 series so the artwork does fit into the style from that period. Do not expect slick and shiney though, it would not work here. This is a playful series, at times you would think it is a storybook you are watching, but that just makes it that little bit more unique.I would say that this was one of those unique finds that very few people every watch, but those who discover the series are very lucky, because this is probably one of the better anime of this genre around. sight of the ""boy wants girl"" goal.It is really funny at times, and tragic at the same time because Kozue is really a very likeable and amiable character, and everybody around her does their level best to protect her from falling into one of her alter egos.I loved the ED (""Boku no SPEED de"" by Chihiro Yonekura) and I loved the storybook like titles and the 4-koma strips in some of the episodes.

This is a 2005 series so the artwork does fit into the style from that period. Do not expect slick and shiney though, it would not work here.

I would recommend this anime to someone who is just starting to really watch anime. It\'s not like most other animes that I\'ve seen personally where everyone falls ""in love"" with the main guy lead. It\'s just one person and there second cousins which most people wouldn\'t think about doing but they still would if they really like the person. So like I said earlier, if your just starting out watching anime,...this one is for you. this one is for you.', 'This show is just the copycat of [Maison Ikkou].

The story is framed in some ways around the romance between Kozue and Ryushi, an art student that moves into the dormitory at the start of the story, but in truth it\'s more of a slice of life ensemble show about all the people that live there, sometimes to its detriment.There\'s nothing that\'s really ""bad"" about this series, but it lacks impact for a few reasons. One is in the dated character...designs, which are the kind of mid 00\'s moe where every character looks, talks and acts like a middle schooler even if they\'re an adult. That flattens what should be a refreshing, adult setting with mostly older characters into the same sort of high school romcom anime loaded with all the cliches that you would expect. It also doesn\'t help matters that the main heroine, Kozue, is the least interesting member of the cast, a sort of vacuous but angelic and pure character with little definition. Having multiple personalities is a kind of gimmick for her, which is unique I suppose, but I don\'t think it\'s treated especially realistically and it\'s not interesting or thematically relevant enough to be more than a quirk. That being said, it works as a platform for Arai Satomi to show off some impressive range as Kozue\'s VA, as she\'s called upon to voice 5 completely different characters with different voices and mannerisms, so it isn\'t really a negative as a whole. The series as a whole is also too gentle for its own good sometimes, the dramatic parts often lack bite because it feels like there\'s a hard limit on how dark it\'s willing to be.The key reason why the series lacks impact though is that the central romance itself lacks impact. As mentioned above, this is really more of an ensemble series than a series about Kozue and Ryushi, and as a result, it sometimes feels like Kozue is relegated to being a side character in her own story, as they go deep into side stories about Megumi\'s overseas romance or Sayoko and Asami\'s mother-daughter relationship. There\'s little noticeable progress between the two leads until the 3 episode arc that concludes the series, and at that point I just wasn\'t invested in it because it felt like there hadn\'t been any prior romantic moments between the two that made me want to see them get together. Ryushi is the sort of vaguely cringey nice guy beta male that you often see in shows of this type and it feels uninspired and like a poor fit here. You can get away with this to an extent when the characters are 16 year olds, but when a college-aged adult is turning red and passing out from embarrassment over holding hands or calling someone by their given name, it becomes unspeakably lame. This is especially a problem with Ryushi, whose character design and female voice actor already make him look and sound like he hasn\'t even hit puberty yet even though he\'s supposedly old enough to drink, which only emphasizes the unfortunate sense of immaturity that seems imposed on every adult character in the series.There are some positive aspects to the series worth mentioning as well. Framing it and occasionally animating it like a picture book, which Ryushi is writing for his college course throughout the series, is a nice touch and gives it a unique look as opposed to the normal look of the show, which is much less interesting. Some of the side characters (Sayoko and Asami in particular) are also very good and end up being funnier and more interesting than Ryushi and Kozue. Overall though, this is an inoffensive romantic dramedy that is not particularly memorable because of a weak central romance and a pervasive mildness that rounds the sharp edges off of storylines or characters that might stray a little too far from the comforting and gentle formula that this and many other shows before it have established. designs, which are the kind of mid 00\'s moe where every character looks, talks and acts like a middle schooler even if they\'re an adult.

Maria-sama ga Miteru Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3468/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru_Specials,"[""&quot;Don't Tell Maria-sama!&quot;These are seven shorts done as &quot;outtakes&quot; from the first season.  Each is about a minute and a half long and done in a chibi art style.They're cute, funny, and quick, playing on the extreme characteristics of each girl as they mess up their lines, etc.  Make sure you've seen season 1 first so they make sense! "", ""These are 90-second short special episodes that are animated in chibi-style. Sounds pretty standard as far as DVD omakes go, right? Wrong. These are unique because they're made like a gag/blooper reel of the main anime series. They feaure the characters as if they were actors who acted out the anime, so there's some really funny gags and jokes thrown in, and overall it makes for a really hilarious and cute watching experience. I thought it weird at first that the specials had a slightly higher MAL rating than the main anime, but it kinda makes sense after watching these. It will only take like...10 minutes to watch the entire thing, so I definitely recommend watching these if you've watched the main series! 10 minutes to watch the entire thing, so I definitely recommend watching these if you've watched the main series!""]"
Isekai Yakkyoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49438/Isekai_Yakkyoku,"['AniManga fans: ""I\'m sick and tired of seeing the same Isekai tropes over and over again. It\'s time for a new property to stand out.""Liz Takayama: ""I hear you back there, so why not give my only work a try? Hope it might surprise and please you.""In all essence of the novelty, novelist Liz Takayama with her only work that is Isekai Yakkyoku a.k.a Parallel World Pharmacy has been a delight to read in both the LN and manga, now translated into Diomed√©a\'s anime adaptation that has come this season. For better or worse, this Isekai really stands out in its own clever way, even...if its themes are borrowed from one similar premise that still doesn\'t hamper the writing abilities to make it one\'s very own work, that truly excels in its own pathology as (probably) the first Isekai in Syosetu\'s lineup to focus on medicine entirely. Yeah yeah, there is that drugstore Isekai that came out earlier, but it\'s not like an actual medicine premise in both theory and practice.Rightaway, you could already see a Parallel to another World with the only difference that Pharmacy is involved, and not a Bookworm. By the way, there\'s no pun intended on this, but it\'s also no mere coincidence as both Isekai Yakkyoku\'s Farma de M√©dicis and Honzuki\'s Myne have a similar backstory, where their real-life selves passed away due to a life-threatening incident, to the point of reincarnation as a younger self with all of their real-life ""knowledge is power"" memories fully intact. In Isekai Yakkyoku\'s case, it\'s about a medical researcher who succumbed to his overwork while finding a treatment on his deceased sister\'s behalf with tumor being the root cause, only to find himself reincarnated as 10-year-old Farma de M√©dicis, who said family thought that he died being struck by lightning and suffering a coma that he could not awake from. However, Farma discovers that he has been granted a divine blessing (also called a Divine Art): Panactheos, the God of Medicine, which is common with the medieval culture of the parallel world\'s nobility in the San Flevue Empire. And this steels Farma\'s resolve, as with his divine blessing and his retained knowledge of modern medicine, to revolutionize the Parallel world\'s medical advancements and make proper treatments affordable for the everyday citizen. So, in every sense of the word, while Myne focuses on bringing books to the masses, Farma is doing the same for medicine, which in the Isekai world, is only present to the nobility. And this will really set him and his Parallel World Pharmacy apart from the Empire\'s many pharmacies that are stuck to the old colonial rule.Farma\'s de M√©dicis family of nobility is most certainly one to be liked, with parents Bruno and Beatrice, the former of which is not just his father, but a patriarch, an archduke, and the president of the Saint Fleuve\'s Imperial School of Pharmacy. That\'s how Bruno is deeply respected within the confines of the nobles as one of the forerunners, spearheading the Isekai world in the world of medicine and its medieval, yet calculated advancement that\'s all too similar to people like Friedrich Sert√ºrner and William Procter Jr. And like every traditional family, especially when it comes to a business, the children must be expected to follow in the footsteps of their parents, as is the case with the father and son Bruno and Farma here. But with the reincarnation, Farma has clearly surpassed whoever he was before the lightning strike that sent him into a coma, and infused with the riches of knowledge on medicine, that even with adversity, is not willing to back down if it means the safety of everyone either nobility or citizen. Of course, how could Farma work all of this by himself, and there\'re 2 people to help him out: El√©onore ""Ellen"" Bonnefoi and Charlotte ""Lotte"" Soller. The former is his personal tutor who was surprised that Panactheos was within him and subsequently aided him in his endeavours, while the latter is a maid servant of the de M√©dicis family and simultaneously his childhood friend. On that note, I should really thank the heavens that the ""childhood friend"" trope here is nothing more than just wholesomeness of ""being aware but not intentionally a need"" to shape their relationship just on a master-servant level.That blissful feeling also trickles down to the visuals and animation, which Diomed√©a did a really good job upon. ICYMI, the same studio also did Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou Desu a.k.a The Saint\'s Magic Power is Omnipotent, which is another ""Saint""-like show that also features medicine that aired in Spring last year (which is coming back for a Season 2 next year), so it\'s definitely in the right mind and sense that this is Diomed√©a\'s current groove and work productivity to boot. Despite this and said show with practically the same in-house staff team but a different director (DomeKano\'s Shouta Ibata for Seijo Bannou Desu, Happy Sugar Life\'s Keizo Kusakawa for Yakkyoku) and I hope that whatever is to come of this work ethic of incorporating similar shows into the studio\'s work biography, the trust is that it\'ll work out well.What\'s more to say that the music really fits the show\'s DNA like genetic links forming its unique 23 pairs of chromosomes. Like Kinsou no Vermeil\'s OP, Kaori Ishikawa has made another OP that\'s a graceful compliment to the anime\'s experience, as did Little Black Dress\'s ED. But, even if the OST isn\'t really the highlight of the show as a whole (I would say it\'s one of the weaker aspects of the show), it still manages to deliver in its own medicinal way possible, and that is more than enough for what the show requires.Overall, I just really love Isekai Yakkyoku\'s overall vibes that it presents to the table, knowing that itself is a stock Isekai with the same tropes that everyone has seen about a billion times now, but knowing where to exude with its signature ingredient (medicine) that\'s just makes it all the more different and definitely not your standard Isekai. Props should be given to Liz Takayama for her inept writing abilities to invoke that special feeling while not over-whipping the known Isekai tropes to make for a compelling watch. Furthermore, it\'s endorsed by the Japan Pharmaceutical Association, which the anime was a part of its campaign to bring awareness to the professions and practices of the pharmaceutical field, so this easily creates a win-win solution for all parties involved.If not for Isekai Ojisan (which sadly its remainder has been delayed to Fall), Isekai Yakkyoku really shone above and beyond as both the 2nd best Isekai of the season and definitely one of the better Isekai I\'ve seen in 2022 alone, and you can testify about it yourself as you let the show soak in its unique medicinal traits that\'s deeper and more technical, but without sounding too complex and looking a lot more on infotainment. It\'s a damn good watch, I\'ll give it that. if its themes are borrowed from one similar premise that still doesn\'t hamper the writing abilities to make it one\'s very own work, that truly excels in its own pathology as (probably) the first Isekai in Syosetu\'s lineup to focus on medicine entirely.

If you like the concept of isekai, but don‚Äôt like how it focuses on the same tropes every time, you‚Äôll enjoy this quite a bit.Getting isekai‚Äôd creates many opportunities for protagonists. Obviously, it‚Äôs an opportunity to start anew and fix the mistakes you made in your past life, but it also is an opportunity to bring knowledge from your world to a new one. Usually we see that in the form of video game mechanics or MCs making comments about anime/manga from back in Japan, but we don‚Äôt...get enough shows that show MC‚Äôs bringing real practical skills to new worlds. In Honzuki it was book-making and in this it‚Äôs pharmaceutical knowledge. We‚Äôve seen several attempts at this story in the past year or so and all were pretty cartoon-y silly gag shows that didn‚Äôt really go deep into the science of medicine, distribution, licensing, etc. Bringing meds and science to a new world is a tough job that will inherently be met with skepticism and I am very glad this show addresses that in a mature and somewhat realistic manner.I really enjoyed the economic and scientific intrigue of the show. The pharmaceutical guild, nobility, church, etc. all behaved about as realistically as you‚Äôd expect if someone came out of nowhere with miracle drugs. While the show lacks physical action, it makes up for it with political and medical chess. Additionally, the MC and supporting characters are really likeable which always makes for a pleasant viewing experience.Art is really solid and the show feels well paced. I thought the final plague arc was a little predictable and somewhat boring, but overall the show is very entertaining and you might even mess around and learn some pathology and medicinal things. It certainly felt like an appetiser for a more complete story in the LN, as most seasonal shows are these days, but based on what we‚Äôve got, I am very much inclined to continue reading for more of this interesting world and characters.I recommend Isekai Yakkyou for anyone looking for an educational and unique isekai and for fans of economic development in fantasy worlds.Isekai Yakkyou gets 8 vials out of 10. get enough shows that show MC‚Äôs bringing real practical skills to new worlds.

For me, it is a yes since Falma's story, in some ways, reminds me of Myne's story. This show definitely does not have the generic isekai vibe. Instead, it has the Honzuki vibe, with the reincarnation of an existing character in another world and the central theme of the story revolving around knowledge being power. Three episodes in, and this show has already captivated me.I like the show's vibe, which is chill and not overly dramatic, but manages to portray each of the characters, their traits and personalities, as the story progresses.

The OP and ED accompanying the show are also pretty good and give you a general vibe of the show while also hinting at what is to come.If you enjoy shows about knowledge and compassion, such as how a man was reincarnated as a 10-year-old pharmacologist apprentice and strives to help those in need, then this is the show for you.

This show definitely has potential."", 'Another isekai entry for summer 2022 and so far Im watching 4 isekai anime excluding this one and i gotta say 3 of them is a solid and have their own charm.So does Isekai Yakkoku has its own charm?The fact that the theme their using is ""medic"" already has it\'s own charm, I mean cmon,how many medical-themed isekai have been adapted to anime,as i far as I remember,isekai drugstore is the only isekai with medical theme that has been adapted to anime since 2017.However, in term of the story, the music, and some other aspect,isekai yakkoku exceed isekai drugstore,the only superior thing that isekai...drugstore is the character that is indeed designed to be more cute and moe than Isekai Yakkoku but even Isekai Yakkoku has it\'s own share of fine ladies.Isekai Yakkoku even has more chemistry between character and the actual use of chemistry.Isekai drugstore is fully fledged cute anime, hence the cuter and moe design of the chara,it\'s sole purpose of existence is to make us say ""awww"" but isekai yakkoku is a story-driven anime, both of them can\'t be compared cause both of em is already good at its own class.The story starts with such a tragic way, our main MC lost his sister due to an incurable disease,that scene where the sister meekly crying while asking if she can be cured fucked me up so bad that my eyes feels heavy, it\'s not more than a few second but the voice acting and the way it\'s animated leaving such impact is amazing.Due to the tragic death of his sister our MC choose to be a doctor,everyday he pushed himself too hard,feeling guilty for his sister\'s death,he worked hard everyday with a such little time to sleep and in the end this way to redeemed himself proved to be too much even for him thus leading our MC to what seemingly tame but actually very painful way to die...death by overwork.From here on,he reincarnated to another world,adapting to it\'s fantasy and magic while trying to ""redeem"" himself.I also wanna stated that i love our MC just as much as i love the heroine,he has a strong motives,an ambition and a clear goals where most of the isekai\'s MCs this season lacks off,one just want to fuck some slaves,one is too busy playing sega console,one is trynna summons a goddess and one is...i don\'t even know what the fkcs he wants.The animation is enjoyable,not the best but it\'s far far away from being bad.The OP,ED are very fitting to the anime and it\'s obviously a feast to our ears.Overall a very recommended isekai,one of my favorites anime in this season and one the best isekai,second only to isekai ojisan.and also thanks to muse,i can watch this for free :D drugstore is the character that is indeed designed to be more cute and moe than Isekai Yakkoku but even Isekai Yakkoku has it\'s own share of fine ladies.Isekai Yakkoku even has more chemistry between character and the actual use of chemistry.Isekai drugstore is fully fledged cute anime, hence the cuter and moe design of the chara,it\'s sole purpose of existence is to make us say ""awww"" but isekai yakkoku is a story-driven anime, both of them can\'t be compared cause both of em is already good at its own class.The story starts with such a tragic way, our main MC lost his sister due to an incurable disease,that scene where the sister meekly crying while asking if she can be cured fucked me up so bad that my eyes feels heavy, it\'s not more than a few second but the voice acting and the way it\'s animated leaving such impact is amazing.Due to the tragic death of his sister our MC choose to be a doctor,everyday he pushed himself too hard,feeling guilty for his sister\'s death,he worked hard everyday with a such little time to sleep and in the end this way to redeemed himself proved to be too much even for him thus leading our MC to what seemingly tame but actually very painful way to die...death by overwork.From here on,he reincarnated to another world,adapting to it\'s fantasy and magic while trying to ""redeem"" himself.I also wanna stated that i love our MC just as much as i love the heroine,he has a strong motives,an ambition and a clear goals where most of the isekai\'s MCs this season lacks off,one just want to fuck some slaves,one is too busy playing sega console,one is trynna summons a goddess and one is...i don\'t even know what the fkcs he wants.The animation is enjoyable,not the best but it\'s far far away from being bad.The OP,ED are very fitting to the anime and it\'s obviously a feast to our ears.Overall a very recommended isekai,one of my favorites anime in this season and one the best isekai,second only to isekai ojisan.and also thanks to muse,i can watch this for free :D', ""Do you ever start and Isekai, and honestly get really hooked, to the point that you hope nothing bad happens, nothing dark happens.

Really giving a clear indication of his motives, and such. Which I'm sure will be covered more, as the show goes along.

That is it, and you will have a good time with this anime. Those episodes, I can say they worth to watch. Characters connect to each other, and the story is very touching... only until the 8th episode.The reason is the 12th episode, which represents the result of the final arc, is totally horrible. Characters being fed to the OP characters, and there is nothing good from episode 9 to episode 12 to remember. The story goes downfall from there, and I regretted watching those episodes. ', ""Pathology expert dies from overwork and gets isekaied into a magical world, where he becomes basically the god of medicine, creates drugs from thin air and identifies any illness just by looking at people and throwing random illness names, until he finds the correct one. Isn't a comedy, nor a deep complex or intriguing show, just weak, generic and superficial, to the point it doest even bother with exploring its own themes.I dont think you can even say that this explores the topic of medicine, from how dumbed down and shallow it depicts and approaches it, being summed into basically using some medical and pathology...related names, and once and then mentioning a very basic summary of some illness story. But if you remove the doctor background, you get a generic isekai with an OP MC that solves anything and everything by its own, without any major real threat to him or anyone else around him.The characters are shallow generic stereotypes, with no real personality or purpose out of just being an excuse to fill the world and give a reason for the MC progression, that its also non existent. The story is poorly written and not that well developed, nothing being done by the MC pays off or feel deserved, the reasons motivations for other character's deeds werent clear, and were just poorly elaborated, the antagonists didnt go far from just being the generic greed stereotype. Everyone just do the binding of the MC, despite he just being a literal child, that some people know its a god, and there is no high stakes when god is solving every problem for you.I was expecting something at least akin of the Ascendance of a Bookworm, or maybe in the same level as Thermae Romae Novae, or any other show that at least really tried to depict and describes the raw process of doing things in the past, but not even a somewhat engaging story i got. Its just a boring inexpressive and uninspired piece that don't even bother into engaging its own proposed themes. related names, and once and then mentioning a very basic summary of some illness story.

I would expect the isekai'ed protagonist to understand at least some economic principles. Since we're talking about opening a store, there is a complete lack of any development around how economics works in this world. Focus is entirely on the OP protagonist and his abilities, but that doesn't fit well with the idea of opening a store.Seems to be undercurrents of a guild system in the commoners, and some politics is implied,...but it is glossed over.

It had that perfect balance of fantasy-medical-OP MC characteristics, that made me binge it in a single sitting.All the characters are likable and the story is intriguing ,yet not hard to digest and provides a soothing sensation after watching.I especially liked the fact that MC didn't go on a harem building overdrive as seen in other isekai works.

I am also someone who's just begun his journey into isekai animes so I won't be comparing isekais in this review.When I first came across Isekai Yakkyoku, I was a little apprehensive at first. With an isekai anime that deals with pharmacy and science I was hoping that the anime wouldn't just feature a laid-back protagonist who makes friends along the way and has a cute little drugstore to sell herbs and things.By the time I got through the...first four episodes, I'm glad that this anime wasn't the case! Right from the get go the protagonist is a professor of biochemistry who's looking into cancer treatments as his bread and butter (even the DMEM buffer and other reagents he uses is correctly used if you read his methods section in Episode 1). The professor suffers from chronic fatigue from spending far too much in his research and paperwork at the expense of everything else in his life (his health included).His life after death brings him into a 17th century-like world unfamiliar with modern medicine as a young boy within an aristocratic family specializing in medicine. And this is where the fun begins for the science geek in me. Right from the get go he's already making use of his vast scientific knowledge (and ability to memorize chemical structures which is NOT easy) to help others with their ailments based on the god powers he's given in the new world he's living in. Tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and the like. He's figured it out!While I didn't think the character development in itself was special (ie. it made sense, was cute and heartwarming, there's conflict, etc.) what kept me going with this anime is his use of pharmacology and biochemistry to solve problems. For anyone who's in medicine or biochemistry, or is a science lover who loves anime, this is a must watch. Otherwise, I think people will see this as an average anime at most. first four episodes, I'm glad that this anime wasn't the case!

Yes. As an isekai junkie, I am set to watch all isekai. This is one of those that explore the trope. I would say, it is one of the better one on the list, but the plot is relatively generic, there\'s no ""wow"" moment. Just a lot of things that are rather cliche.Bonus point as it reminds me of COVID. and are immersive in that aspect.Short conclusion: 7.5/10Driving deeperArt: pretty good, it is probably on the higher end of the anime production. The effect are beautiful to some degree, however, not breathtaking. 8.5/10Character: Honestly,...I do think that the characters are pretty solid, they just need to take some more time to develop. Well, we have very little bit of that through. I only see bits of reasoning here and there, but there are still some parts that are unexplained. 7/10Plot: Pretty standard for an isekai, you got this guy who is super OP in some standard. The twist this time is that he is a doctor. that\'s it really, there\'s little to no character development, nothing to be learned from. really is standard box default isekai in my opinion. 7/10Conclusion: Pretty good for an isekai enjoyer.

Regardless, the anime as others have mentioned actually does well in being something entertaining and interesting where the first few episodes you get a vibe resembling Myne from Ascendance of a Bookworm. In it there is a grand aspect of comparing ones life before reincarnation going into a magic fantasy world where everything is new with problems that you have to solve using previous knowledge. It should be noted that the show does have a pretty big difference where it will start to feel different in which specifically,...Farma is born to be the son of an Archduke with both wealth and prestige. Which if you know Myne is not and so the vibe of the show hits a bit different, but still delivers in having an interesting story with actually smart characters working towards a goal too. Another reason why the anime may feel it has a resemblance is how the characters interact with the MC it feels more real in tune of them being actually human.For this anime it surprisingly goes in-depth of the chemical compounds needed to make the medicines along with the diagnoses of certain ailments showing that the author either has a good deal of knowledge on the subject or that they at least have done their research. It is done in a more anime fantasy style, so don't worry about it being too boringly dialogue scientific if that's not what you're looking for.Some would say this anime is very much a fantasy in the characters because they're more smarter and willing to take action in comparison to other shows where everyone besides the MC is braindead. But I would say because of that we get to experience more instead of being stuck in mindless melodrama between characters as that is not the focus of this show.It is the willingness this anime goes about focusing on exploring aspects of medicine and ailments that make this anime fun to watch. Covering multiple subjects and topic that fit the animes premise very well while still showing that it is a fantasy world that has its own differences though you could say it resembles a classical medieval era like most fantasy do.The characters are great and interesting to see as they are actually competent in a crisis it helps make the world more fun to explore. Farma's reason to push forward from his pretty sad background story helps make it feel more alive where it does not stray from that premise as other animes might do. There is some character development in a few of the characters mainly the ones closest to the Farma, but since most are pretty capable already they don't have as much to grow rather the world is changing instead.Art wise it is pretty colorful and good overall. The few times there was action it was done well and a lot of scenery is detailed pretty well too. Characters have unique designs so you can tell them apart pretty easily. Both the OP and EP were good. OP doesn't spoil much and visually is interesting to see with a nice tune. The ED fits pretty well with the vibe of the animes endings giving it a nice contrast.Overall, if you want an anime that is more true fantasy with a focus on medicine that has interesting characters rather than having harems or romance or the MC goes to school and the strongest bully fights the MC, but surprise the MC is actually strong which this anime has none of those. This anime is definitely something to watch then. It's easy enough to follow keeping it entertaining while I would say the best parts of this anime are the characters being capable to change as the MC does world altering things. A bit on the more lighthearted side considering everything, but it does have an entertaining story as it goes on with some tension. Decent world building with large number of characters, a bit of politics, few twists that keep you guessing, and a goal you hope to see achieved.

I assume that this show has a decent\\good Manga\\LN probably, but this adaptation? It's not good at all. It has moments, but by the end of this season my score dropped from low 7, high 6 down to 5. It's just boring.I'll try to be brief in general, because there really is not much to talk about.1. I got interested because the premise sounded like it could be cool. An Isekai about a doctor and not another meathead. Let's just say it didn't improve it by much, because it's toothless.2. I will...say it with a straight face (fight me) Monster Musume no Oishasan (or Monster Girl Doctor) is a MILES better show about an MC who is a doctor, it's way more interesting even if we throw out all the erotic stuff out. That show had an idea of exploring physics and nuances of well-known mythical monsters with erotics added to the mix, while this show has no idea what it tries to pursue.3. The most important criticism for this show: It has no confrontation whatsoever. MC is never challenged by anything.It's a very infantile way of writing a story, where everything is conveniently happening the way it's convenient to MC.God-like powers out of the box? Sure. Highest possible ranking in society besides the Queen herself at the start? Why not. Conveniently saving the Queen herself basically as a part of prologue? But of course. Everyone around was born to serve MC or solve his problems? Yes, please. All humans are kind and nice, caring and understanding? Give me 10 of those.4. MC is another generic-kun. He has no personality, his voice is the same-ish voice I had heard a number of times and he is so one dimensional it's just sad to look at.5. The way it treats super powers makes it not fun to watch. MC sees all, knows all, can create stuff out of air, is given a super-magic wand, can fly in the air and can do whatever else. It's the most boring thing ever.And the sad part, this show treats itself seriously.I can tolerate many things, when there are redeeming qualities: nice character cast and chemistry, cool world building, exploration of various topics, well done conflict, over the top action, comedy.But here we have nothing to work with and it's one of those I forget literally tomorrow until I once again in the future see my own score about this show. say it with a straight face (fight me) Monster Musume no Oishasan (or Monster Girl Doctor) is a MILES better show about an MC who is a doctor, it's way more interesting even if we throw out all the erotic stuff out.

He has no personality, his voice is the same-ish voice I had heard a number of times and he is so one dimensional it's just sad to look at.5. The way it treats super powers makes it not fun to watch. MC sees all, knows all, can create stuff out of air, is given a super-magic wand, can fly in the air and can do whatever else. It's the most boring thing ever.And the sad part, this show treats itself seriously.I can tolerate many things, when there are redeeming qualities: nice character cast and chemistry, cool world building, exploration of various topics, well done conflict, over the top action, comedy.But here we have nothing to work with and it's one of those I forget literally tomorrow until I once again in the future see my own score about this show."", 'This anime is close to greatness, it however falls short because it doesn\'t fully commit and decided to play it safe by adding more traditional isekai elements, but those elements end up detracting from, rather than enhancing the series.You\'ve heard the refrain ""All isekai is the same"" we know it\'s not, but people say it anyway, usually to justify review-bombing.Isekai Yakkyoku is able to stand out because of how differently it handles the genreMan dies of overwork and is reincarnated into a new world - we\'ve been here beforeMC is part of a rich aristocrat family - we\'ve been here beforeMC is given OP magic...powers - we\'ve been here beforeMC quickly realises that he can use his medical and pharmaceutical knowledge to benefit the world and save lives - ah, this is new.The latter becomes the main focus of the anime, as the synopsis and title suggest, he makes a point of using his old world knowledge to help others, and to open a pharmacy.What I like here is that it\'s not just some vague mixing of herbs like you would get in some of the other anime types, instead we get proper medicinal products getting created, proper procedures being followed, actual illnesses being diagnosed and treated. Having worked in that industry myself, it was great to see that they got the details right, and it really makes the difference.This is where Isekai Yakkyoku shines, when it is grounded in real world medicinal science, when it is focused on treating illnesses, and when it is focused on being a pharmacy, the running of a pharmacy, and the various goods and services that it would provide for all, even cosmetics.However it is not all sunshine and rainbows, because as I said at the start, it falls short of greatness,I will avoid getting into spoilers, but being Isekai\'d was integral to the story, being from a rich powerful family was integral to the story and the story benefitted from it.Making the MC OP in magic powers was not integral to the story, and entire magical \'divine blessing\' side of the story was a distraction.If you needed to give the OP magic to get around the manufacturing process, then fine, but he didn\'t need to be OP, and it didn\'t need all the rest of it either, and to be blunt, the final episode detracted from what had been a very good story arc and was the weakest part of the entire series.In short this series did not need magic or OP powers to make it good or exciting - those things actually detracted from the series powers - we\'ve been here beforeMC quickly realises that he can use his medical and pharmaceutical knowledge to benefit the world and save lives - ah, this is new.The latter becomes the main focus of the anime, as the synopsis and title suggest, he makes a point of using his old world knowledge to help others, and to open a pharmacy.What I like here is that it\'s not just some vague mixing of herbs like you would get in some of the other anime types, instead we get proper medicinal products getting created, proper procedures being followed, actual illnesses being diagnosed and treated.

Well, sign me up nerds.Fully capable adult (rare for an isekai mc) and world-famous medical researcher Kanji works himself to an early grave trying to find the cure to a disease that claimed his little sister. Now reincarnated into the body of a post struck by lightning, the ten-year-old medieval noble boy called Falma, his goal now is...to use his vast medical knowledge and his new family's medical dynasty connections to revolutionise this new world's healthcare and make it available plus affordable to the masses. This is a very based premise.That‚Äôs not the only based thing about this show. Falma is also a prodigy in the divine art of water or water magic. This power is now amplified thanks to the ‚Äúgod of medicine‚Äù that has taken up residence inside of him as well as granting him extra powers such as instantly diagnosing any illness he sees in another person through his magic eyes and the power to create/destroy any chemical composition he can imagine. Obviously, as a former 31-year-old 21st medical and chemistry doctor he can think of a lot of those and this makes him incredibly overpowered, but that‚Äôs only in magic and medicine. The society he's now in doesn‚Äôt have issues like demon lords (that we know of) that can just be solved by one-sidedly fighting a bad guy and asking questions later. Politics, religion and societal class gaps will be the main courses of strife and the way the show handles Falma‚Äôs navigation through those problems are well thought-out, clever and sometimes (dare I say it) educational.That said, when the anime has a battle it throws the fuck down. There are some seriously well-animated, tense wizard duels in this show. I‚Äôm really happy that studio Diomed√©a put in the effort to make these moments feel as special as possible. The anime already looks good and feels great to watch, but that little bit extra for moments that don‚Äôt happen all too often is very appreciated.The show also has a strong cast of defined, core characters. Falma‚Äôs pink-haired mo√© blob maid Charlotte plus his magic teacher El√©onore are delightful and the relationship development between him and his new family -especially his little sister and father- is touching.Unbeknownst to Falma, he‚Äôs not the only reincarnated soul in this new world as Rule Britannia‚Äôs real-world Queen Elizabeth II who recently passed away from being old, has reincarnated into the body of Empress √âlisabeth II in an era of human history in which she's probably more comfortable with mentally.‚ÄúParallel World Pharmacy‚Äù is just a great show. It can get a bit cheesy at times and the season's late-game villain turned out to be a disappointment with his anarchic motivations, but the rest of the show is solid. If you‚Äôre looking for a good isekai which doesn‚Äôt involve the usual trashy isekai elements then I can‚Äôt recommend this anime enough.8/10 Great. to use his vast medical knowledge and his new family's medical dynasty connections to revolutionise this new world's healthcare and make it available plus affordable to the masses.

A show about a pharmacist?  How do you make that interesting?  Turns out, you insert magic, make the storyline about enemies of the state, and there you go!Story: Parallel World Pharmacy starts us out with Kanji Yakutani, a medical scientist who lost his sister to disease previously.  He fully commits himself to the research and development of new medicines.  And when I say fully, I mean it.  He clearly doesn't eat or sleep properly, and when he finally finds time to catch a break, he...passes away in his sleep, likely due to exhaustion.  When Kanji awakens, he finds himself in a completely different time line, way before his old timeline, in a noble family.  Now, in a young boy named Falma de M√©dicis, he decides to use his wealth of knowledge, and the magical powers granted to him, to grant ordinary citizens access to affordable healthcare, during a time when not everyone has it.It's hard to describe more upon what this series is about because I basically said it, but it flows really nicely among the twelve-episode season.  Falma is obviously not taken seriously on multiple occasions because of his age, but because of his knowledge for when he was Kanji, he's able to solve many of the world's medical problems.  Much of this series is of him, trying to make people into believers, including his own family.  When he proves his good intentions, it's then that the storyline expands, right up until the series finale. Sure, the series probably doesn't peak as much here as much as other fantasy series, mostly because you're not really watching this series for the action, but there are still enjoyable moments throughout.  One detail this show, along with many others these days, is that the idea of going back to Falma's old world is never explored, and I'm curious if that'll ever happen in shows like Rising of the Shield Hero, Log Horizon, upon others.One of the elements that this series takes advantage of, is the world of magic.  Inserting magic into this show feels very random and out of place at first.  But they do integrate it into the series very nicely.  Everyone seems to have the ability to cast these spells that draw from natural elements, such as water, wind and earth, but the entire explanations of them at the beginning felt a little lacking.  It's doesn't entirely matter, because, for the most part, you just need to know that it exists.  (8/10)Characters: Falma's a really easy character to cheer for because he always seeks to make a positive change in this new world.  Part of that likely stems from the fact that he regrets not making a ton of meaningful change in his old world, but he continues to play the part of one that seeks to heal and basically never harm.  Even as an adult, being that forgiving of those that doubt you isn't easy.  Proving to person after person with your gift, is amazing, and shines a light on this kid who basically gains an infinite wealth of knowledge overnight, at least seemingly to his new family.Charlotte is the young maid that helps with the de M√©dicis family with their housework, and she's about as fun loving and hard working as you can imagine.  She's fully dedicated to Falma's work and I do wish this was praised more in the series, especially considering her age.  My one problem with her is the lack of judgment she made in the finale that almost costs her and one other person, and this type of ignorance among young characters drives me nuts when it appears in anime.  Falma's father, Bruno, is the head of the family and is basically the head honcho of the queen's medical staff.  He's very sterm, but true to his word.  He means well, and I loved what they did with his character.  El√©onore oversees Falma's medical training, basically acting as his teacher.  Her role changes as the series goes on, but I liked her drive to work through whatever is asked of her, even if she doubts herself along the way.There are a bunch of side characters along the way, though some kind of feel like re-hashes of others because their story feels somewhat the same as another.  Medical need arises, they look for it, find Falma, doubt him, but then are proven wrong and are indebted to him.  This cycle 'can' feel boring, but the series keeps the pacing going that it didn't bother me as much.  Jean-Alan and Salomon were two of the better side characters, especially because they become more involved in the plot in the back end of the series.  Characters in general are strong, even at the cost of being somewhat repetitive.  (7/10)Art: Parallel World Pharmacy keeps it's animation pretty consistent, even through the short action sequences that occur during the course of the series.  This is one series where the quality didn't really waver through the season, as Diomed√©a put in a strong effort here.  Because of the story's dependency on magic, I'm glad they put in the effort to make sure it looked strong in the series.  Is everything else top of the line?  Probably not, but it didn't need to be.  (8/10)Sound: The OST was honestly a little bland, but it didn't distract enough to be a problem.  Both the OP and ED were strong though.  VO work was mostly strong, with Morgan Lea (Falma) being the best of the bunch.  Lindsay Seidel (Charlotte) continues her strong work with young characters and I actually liked Alex Hom (Pierre) and Gareth Bradley (Salomon) here too.  However, I was really not a fan of Chris Ryan (Bruno) here.  His sound articulation felt contrary to what was going on the screen far too often and, especially in the first half, the expression just wasn't there.  (7/10)Overall: Parallel World Pharmacy was a nice surprise to this season of anime, where I actually didn't plan to watch this at first, because Crunchyroll initially announced it wouldn't be dubbed.  This should appeal to the general public, as long as a young kid being gifted a rich family as a starting point doesn't bug you too much.

If I was, I probably would not be watching anime and instead find solace in knowing even though my life also sucks at least I\'m making more money than the average anime fan. However one can rejoice, as this is the rare isekai where the protagonist is actually competent. As a TL;DR, I would say this show from the bunch of isekai dumped on us every season is worth taking a look at. Contrary to what we\'ve seen in other isekais, magic is only an auxiliary to the main character\'s knowledge and skills rather than the plot mechanism that...turns an ordinary dude into an ordinary dude with cheat powers. I rate it a 7 as I\'m remaining cautiously optimistic about the direction this show will go towards (isekai are grandmasters at fumbling the storytelling). Furthermore, the premise is that an old dude turns into a kid and shows off his knowledge to the uneducated clowns that is medieval humans, impressing everyone and becoming jailbait for their bombshell babe mentor, who is awed at the size of MC\'s cranium. If I didn\'t mention pharmacy, nobody would know which series I was describing.The main character is a gigachad STEMlord who, due to anime logic, pretty much has all of PubMed and ChEMBL installed on his brain like it was your 10TB hard disk of JAVs. Oftentimes it ends up taking away some entertainment value from the show because it saves the MC from overcoming struggle. The problems (illnesses, in this case) are presented to the MC clearly and immediately like a football game streaker. Then the MC just goes ""hmmmm... okay since I diagnosed you with cringe I already know you need N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine and since I have magic boom it\'s instantly made for the patient"". The actual struggle the MC is facing is breaking out of his timid shell and catching up with the new society\'s common sense (sound familiar?)

To give the show credit, it does a good job of using technical jargon with moderation. I\'m putting this show on blast for the sake of being critical, but if you enjoy seeing an isekai character who earns their accomplishments via merit, I would still consider this an enjoyable watch if you\'re the type who can overlook some details.A disclaimer I will add is that viewers hoping for scientific accuracy on the level of something like The Martian will likely be disappointed, as I can imagine that many med viewers or sharp minded individuals will find tons of inconsistencies in the science storytelling. In fact, the general story glosses over significant plot developments such as the estate staff being given medicine or the MC\'s medical treatment of court nobles. Rather than going ""modern medicine good"", the show leans towards the end of ""old medicine bad"" and end up cutting some corners that people will catch on to. I gave this show a 7 due to a mix of recent isekai shows being awful and because there seems to have been effort to incorporate real, scientific accuracy into the world rather than just writing it all off as magic. Even though it is no Chubbyemu video, the MC not being a total deadbeat and the incorporation of scientific tones gives it a good start, unlike some of the other new isekai shows that make you feel like you\'re eating gas station sushi. turns an ordinary dude into an ordinary dude with cheat powers.

He wakes up in another world in the body of a ten year old noble boy named Falma. And not just any noble but the son of the head of the de M√©dicis, a family of medical practitioners. Using his knowledge, position, and some special abilities called Divine Arts, Falma does his best to deal with the various medical issues he comes across and to advance health in general.This is very much an isekai where the...protagonist is overpowered. Of course his scientific knowledge being significantly more advanced than anyone else is overpowered in and of itself. But he‚Äôs also overpowered in a much more traditional manner in that he has Divine Arts that seem to make him essentially invincible in combat. However, I felt that the narrative for the most part used these Divine Arts very effectively, in that they seem to take a back seat to his knowledge. Him having overpowered combat abilities means he doesn‚Äôt have to worry at all about putting himself in physical danger and thus the writing can just completely ignore anything related to that.His other Divine Arts also compliment his knowledge without superseding it. A lot of modern professions including doctors and pharmacists require the support of a large number of supporting roles. For example, medical diagnosis of many diseases would be significantly more difficult without complex tools made by bioengineers used to perform tests. And the development of drugs often requires a lot of heavy machinery designed by chemical engineers. As such, if the average modern doctor or pharmacist was transported into the past, they would be incredibly limited in what they could accomplish.Falma has the ability to magically see if others have a medical condition, and though he can‚Äôt magically figure out what the condition is, the magic does tell him if he determined the right one. Furthermore, he can magically generate any chemical he knows the composition of. This essentially replaces what he would have access to in a modern setting and allows the anime to focus on showing him dealing with diseases and such. This allows for pretty decent story telling, while also imparting a lot of actual information on drugs and medical best practices on the viewer.Unfortunately, as the anime progresses the narrative starts deviating from that. The final arc heavily involves Falma dealing with issues directly through his Divine Arts. This feels kind of cheap and contrary to what the focus of the anime was earlier. There‚Äôs also a much larger emphasis on just regular old combat between characters using their Divine Arts. But Divine Arts in general aren‚Äôt really fleshed out at all so them actually being in the focus like that also feels really random and not that interesting. The final arc also seemed to throw in a cartoon villain for some reason even though it was completely unnecessary. As a result, even though I found the topic of the final arc, epidemics, really interesting, I found the arc overall incredibly underwhelming and my final impression of the anime was pretty weak.I also found it kind of strange how the anime implemented the isekai aspect. The protagonist wakes up as ten year old Falma, but it doesn‚Äôt make clear at all how. Did the original Falma die and the protagonist essentially replaced him? Did he hijack Falma‚Äôs body and the original Falma is still somewhere in there? Is Falma his reincarnation, and he just regained the memories of his past life? Or is it something else entirely? It‚Äôs not like this aspect isn‚Äôt dealt with at all. Rather, in the beginning there are a bunch of details that it feels like are foreshadowing something or other. However, they go nowhere and no solution is provided. I feel that this resulted in Falma overall being fleshed out far less than he needed to be which resulted in him being a pretty flat character. The rest of the cast were pretty lackluster as well. There are a lot of somewhat interesting and somewhat likable characters. But no one is developed enough to get all that invested in.The art and animation are okay but not particularly great. Design wise, it was actually pretty good early on. However, it got more and more dull as it went on. I think El√©onore is a great illustration of this, in that early on she seemed to get new outfits constantly and most all were pretty good. But as things progressed she got fewer and the ones she did weren‚Äôt as nice. I suppose the designs did become more realistic and practical, but that doesn‚Äôt change that they‚Äôre more boring. The OP and ED are decent enough in terms of the song and visuals. The soundtrack is decent enough but not particularly memorable. protagonist is overpowered.

Him having overpowered combat abilities means he doesn‚Äôt have to worry at all about putting himself in physical danger and thus the writing can just completely ignore anything related to that.His other Divine Arts also compliment his knowledge without superseding it. A lot of modern professions including doctors and pharmacists require the support of a large number of supporting roles. For example, medical diagnosis of many diseases would be significantly more difficult without complex tools made by bioengineers used to perform tests. And the development of drugs often requires a lot of heavy machinery designed by chemical engineers. As such, if the average modern doctor or pharmacist was transported into the past, they would be incredibly limited in what they could accomplish.Falma has the ability to magically see if others have a medical condition, and though he can‚Äôt magically figure out what the condition is, the magic does tell him if he determined the right one. Furthermore, he can magically generate any chemical he knows the composition of. This essentially replaces what he would have access to in a modern setting and allows the anime to focus on showing him dealing with diseases and such. This allows for pretty decent story telling, while also imparting a lot of actual information on drugs and medical best practices on the viewer.Unfortunately, as the anime progresses the narrative starts deviating from that. The final arc heavily involves Falma dealing with issues directly through his Divine Arts. This feels kind of cheap and contrary to what the focus of the anime was earlier. There‚Äôs also a much larger emphasis on just regular old combat between characters using their Divine Arts. But Divine Arts in general aren‚Äôt really fleshed out at all so them actually being in the focus like that also feels really random and not that interesting. The final arc also seemed to throw in a cartoon villain for some reason even though it was completely unnecessary. As a result, even though I found the topic of the final arc, epidemics, really interesting, I found the arc overall incredibly underwhelming and my final impression of the anime was pretty weak.I also found it kind of strange how the anime implemented the isekai aspect. The protagonist wakes up as ten year old Falma, but it doesn‚Äôt make clear at all how. Did the original Falma die and the protagonist essentially replaced him? Did he hijack Falma‚Äôs body and the original Falma is still somewhere in there? Is Falma his reincarnation, and he just regained the memories of his past life? Or is it something else entirely? It‚Äôs not like this aspect isn‚Äôt dealt with at all. Rather, in the beginning there are a bunch of details that it feels like are foreshadowing something or other. However, they go nowhere and no solution is provided. I feel that this resulted in Falma overall being fleshed out far less than he needed to be which resulted in him being a pretty flat character. The rest of the cast were pretty lackluster as well. There are a lot of somewhat interesting and somewhat likable characters. But no one is developed enough to get all that invested in.The art and animation are okay but not particularly great. Design wise, it was actually pretty good early on. However, it got more and more dull as it went on. I think El√©onore is a great illustration of this, in that early on she seemed to get new outfits constantly and most all were pretty good. But as things progressed she got fewer and the ones she did weren‚Äôt as nice. I suppose the designs did become more realistic and practical, but that doesn‚Äôt change that they‚Äôre more boring. The OP and ED are decent enough in terms of the song and visuals. The soundtrack is decent enough but not particularly memorable.', 'Before we begins i totally like this anime until some random thing happened in episode 10 (place where i drop the anime)Plot itself is interesting af, when doctor try to save his sister but fail miserably and got isekai during working on new drug for her sister. He suddenly already have 10 yo boy body, i mean how? OK im fine because all isekai concept always start with this typical bullsh*t. Lets continue, story rotate around that the boy try to become good doctor or apothecary guy in another with his past knowledge. Then he found himself is powerful as God bestow his will upon...him, I mean okay mc op same typical bullsh*t again. Im fine with this until He introduces some drug that supposed to be not exist in this world. tbh if black death gone, humanity suffer great famine after that because yea population booming but this MC prevent it in another world, i mean nothing gonna bad happened in few years, but in century they will crush by reality. Also anti biotic introduce, so far i know the more u eat anti biotic the more resistant that your body to anti biotic and become less effective, but in this anime, MC introduce modern anti biotic which supposed not exist in this timeline. And again mc introduce Hazmat suit which also doesnt exist in this timeline (its require modern technology to make but somehow he makes with magic even advanced magic cant copy the real science thing) also he introduces Modern mask also, i mean come on! You basically prevent any disease that shape human history.I mean appreciate that author actually research everything about drug, but forget how he didnt research history really well, like bubonic plague, its happened because overpopulation, also the outcome would be accelerate Science, industrial and technology even more. Like i said there will be great disaster later if this one got prevent, Great Famine, there is no drug can save you from them(Also timeline its kinda around 17th and 18th based on Europe bubonic plague thing)But again this anime totally really open my science about drug thing but most of mc does is good but also totally wrongThats all about plot, now about character, Character itself, Pure generic, Falma basically overpowered mc that like angel fall from heaven to save humanity from great disaster, he is so perfect, everything he does is perfect, Also Very predictable, No challenge at all, also he has ability to create material from thin air, So like Penicilin doesnt exist, its suddenly exist in 18thTL:DR : Its good anime if you dont know about history but fascinated about drug and medical technology etc, but yea as someone who know history especially the anime set in history timeline with so many references to real world. Its done pretty well for now4/10 as someone who fascinated to history and technology, this thing should need some explanation even more, im fine with random drug create thin air, but i cant stand about hazmat suit and modern mask exist in this animeAgain this is pure my opinion, also i mark it as spoiler, i drop it in episode 10 because yea, its pain to watch and so predictable what happened next, there is no twist etc him, I mean okay mc op same typical bullsh*t again.

Though everything else that was bad remained almost untouched, or to be more accurate - it\'s the same generic isekai without anything interesting about it.--1) PremiseI honestly like the premise of the story, because it had so much potential, but oh well, we get THIS instead. The thing that i liked was not the generic death of overwork, or that main character gets to be reborn as a noble (and an archduke at that), or that he has godlike power that he gains right after his reincarnation (or to be more precise he is an incarnation of the local god of medicine, which is revealed in the FIRST episode), it was the WAY he reincarnated. I don\'t know why this single unique thing about this series was skipped in anime, which is really dissapointing, because without the fact that it is not this overworked dude who got reincarnated, but FARMA who get his memories the whole story is just another very mid-tier isekai.Average 5/10--2) StoryThe story is just as flat as I remember it from the LN. In short:step 1 - chill with your dudes at the shopstep 2 - encounter business-related problemstep 3 - solve it after 2 minutes of ""intense"" thinkingstep 4 - encounter some deadly, incurable (at this era) disease (insert any disease name from earth)step 5 - instantly make a medicine and save everyonestep 6 - be humble boy and tell everyone that you are just a human and not a god (which is clearly a lie)Step 7 - repeat steps 1-6 in different location/on larger scaleThis is basically the whole story, which is nothing but repeated first 3 volumes (or season 1 of the anime) again and agian.And the thing is, main character is doing NOTHING to achieve the desired result. There are some yet to be discovered drugs needed to cure literally every single disease he encounters? Well, who cares if he can just create them from the palm of his hand. There are patients in need of examination? Lol, just list all the familiar diseases until one of them matches. And that is all you need to know about ""hardships"" that he encounters, which are sold the moment they appear.Average 5/10--3) Main characterAnother typical isekai main character with zero background story and the only trait in personality is that he is kind and helps people out. What exactly drives him to save people? Why he choose to be pharmacologist? What does he think about being reincarnated? And about this world, his family, his coworkers and friends? Lol, who cares, he will do things because he can and because he think they are the right thing to do. And what could possibly stop him from achieving his ""goals""? He is a son of an ARCHDUKE and acquainted with the roal family, so he basically has all resources you can possibly imagine. Oh, and don\'t forget about the fact that he is basically a god and can do whatever he pleases without any penalty.Average 5/10--4) CharactersOne of the most dissapointing features of this series - it\'s characters. They are hollow. There is literaly nothing I can add more to it, they are just your average cliche background characters without story or personality, with the only differernce from other isekai\'s that they are positioned as a supporting characters, which is basicly kills the whole story. BUT there is one positive thing - no garem.Avarage 5/10--5) World-buildingNon-existent. What even is this world? Are there any monsters? What about gods (There are actually a lot of them)? Were there any incarnations beside Farma? What about magic? And the church? And what are those ""evil spirits""? Are they even real? And political situation? And so on and so on. Any question you may have will be left unanswered, because there is literally nothing that we know about this world, and Farma just doesn\'t care.Appailing 1/10--6) AnimationWell, battle scenes are good, effects are nice to see, but overall its just normal.Good 7/10--7) Music.For the most part it was very good, everything feels just in place, but nothing memorableGood 7/10--8) Sound effectsThey are good, one of the best part of this anime actually.Good 7/10--9)  EnjoymentIt was a good time killer, but i\'ll probably forget what this anime was about, or that it even existed, tomorrow. It\'s just another generic isekai that you can watch when you just want to watch ""anything"" or relax without thinking too much.5/10--10) OverallIs this anime a must-watch? Absolutely not.

So yes, this will be a ""that manga guy"" perspective.---Cons:My main issue with this adaption is a simple one. They rushed unnecessarily further than the anime could reasonably cover. And as a result, hey cut out a parts that provided necessary context to the later events for the sake of brevity or flow. Here\'s a list of notes I took, ordered from most severe...(like plot holes) to the least:- The entire existence of evil spirits and MC\'s first encounter with them were skipped, so they just came out of nowhere. Same with the purification and medicine buffing powers relevant parts being skipped. The MC just magically had that power.- The Black Death arc worked for the most part, but holy hell that got compressed. It felt like they surgically removed 3/4ths of the medical parts, especially everything that let up to it. Like say, what Camus was doing instead of introducing him in the last episode.- The cramming of events in the Black Death arc resulted in the squirrels being... not eradicated? Uhhh...- They drastically undersold the actual challenges faced and impact of his phamarcy on the local people, turning the story into a very average isekai despite having one of the greatest potential for a genuinely good story.- Relating to that, the immense unseen advancements in medical field should have come as early as the spread of the microscope, introducing a great influx of acedemic papers on reviewing old practices and research/formulation of new modern level medicine not directly made by the MC himself.- Skipping the MC\'s experimentation and discoveries of his power left some scenes like the targeted seawater elimination part mostly unexplained.- His relationship with his brother studying in the top nation medical college would have enhanced the story and made it less like a retcon added to patch up a plot hole in the Black Death arc.- There was one notable bit (the suppository bit) that they likely skipped due to subject matter, which I suppose is expected since it would be worse if they had mishandled it or had it misintepreted by the general audience.- We didn\'t see some things like the traditional practices (I\'m looking at you, chicken dance), but that\'s honestly not a major loss since they did very briefly mention stuff about lizard eye concoctions and astrology in about 1 episode.- Minor nitpick: The pacing was on the faster side which may affect enjoyability, though that isn\'t exactly a problem like the others.While it would hard to get any better than this in 12 episodes, I think I would have enjoyed this more had they taken they time a bit more for all those details that make up the whole. Rushing the latter half that much to cover up to the Black Death arc was probably too hasty. Perhaps as a result of the above, I found that the action scenes didn\'t integrate into the story quite as well as expected. Oh and of course, this ignores the base problem of it being a fantasy isekai and a template introduction. But you know the drill by now.Pros:The continuity issues aside, the anime worked and could stand its own ground. The story and subject is genuinely intrguing despite being of the isekai genre, somehow covering something like medicine and covering it fairly well without exploding spectacularly.  It\'s like what others have said: Ascendance of a Bookworm (but with an animation budget).From a manga reader\'s point of view, many scenes were made even more beautiful simply with the addition of good animation, attention to detail, and a decent music selection. The characters felt alive, even if their development and relationships were rushed. I truly thought it was an enjoyable watch. And of course, this is one of the better shows this season (RIP Devil is a Part Timer S2).Conclusion:I would say I can still recommend this anime to isekai fans, but I would also much more strongly recommend reading the LN or manga first or instead. The latter I can especially attest to being comparatively godly.

(yes,...I'm calling you out Harry Potter)There is no leveling up or progress.But, there are a clear set of rules for it's magic, like a regular person only being able to cast with a wand, people born with magic are nobility and can only use given attribute or something out of the ordinary is seen as heresy or god's blessing, like the dark ages.There is only limited healing magic so they has to rely on the advancements of meds. It's like visiting the 13 hundred's inturms of medicine while implementing the scientific miracles of modern medicine.Of course the MC is OP and blessed by the gods but it's not something that gets in the way.Also the ending is ok at best, I would've enjoyed it if it continued but it's fine.It has medicine,magic,politics,social economics.So if you like isekai but want something decent, go for it.Also the start of the ending theme reminds of House theme song.

I am definitely going to add the manga and LN to my read list. Now this is isekai! Simple, refreshing, but leaves you wanting more with anticipation! I\'m excited to know how the rest of the story pans out. I\'m mostly bothered by how OP the MCs are in isekai but Isekai Yakkyoku, despite having an OP MC, you can\'t help but root for them. Falma and the limited knowledge of the world with medicine...that\'s slowly growing... If only he can be in multiple places at once spreading knowledge and helping heal people. I think that\'s the part that balances the OP MC out. He is a literal god but sometimes gods can only do so much.

All 3 of them have the same premise in a sense... For example, Falma was a dedicated pharmacist researcher in his previous life, Myne was a bookworm, and Sei was a regular office worker of sorts. All of them had that degree of overworking themselves and trying to enjoy life as much as possible once they got isekai\'d.Isekai Yakkyoku is the same as every generic isekai out there, and I bet it wouldn\'t take me long to forget I even watched it. However, it has that same and simply refreshing premise that I have grown to love while watching isekais and that is finding the joy in living life or pursuing what you want to do in life). This isekai is mainly focused on ""Medicine"" and how the MC carries his previous knowledge as a pharmacist researcher into his new life as Falma De Medicis.The art style is pretty simple but pretty. Opening and ending songs were very fitting in my opinion. I really like the ED. I think the story has potential so far and the way the characters are portrayed are on the more reasonable, unexaggerated side of expression.

As he was already a famed chemist before he died, he has zero flaws and the series is just watching him cure people.The only thing interesting about the show are the...chemistry formulations and the usage of medicine and such.tldr very generic, don't watch unless you're a chemist or need to pass your science exam chemistry formulations and the usage of medicine and such.tldr very generic, don't watch unless you're a chemist or need to pass your science exam"", 'A wholesome and dramatic piece of irritatingly convenient anime.As you start watching it, you quickly notice that they didn\'t care about the backstory much, it felt painfully empty and rushed. It\'s like they just wanted to get to the ""Good"" Isekai parts as fast as possible. Summary of the empty start would basically be: ""My sister died to cancer, I want people to be healthy, so I\'ll invest my time and efforts into medical research, but while at it I can\'t even keep myself healthy so I die out of overwork, but it appears I happened to steal 10 year old boys body from another...world and ever so conveniently that boy was a member in a  family full of pharmacists, but wait... that\'s not all! I got some godly powers while at it..."".As you get to the Isekai parts, things can get a little exciting and fun, but when you start thinking about it, you realize it\'s all so convenient and forced, but hey it\'s fun ig, until.. you start to notice all the irritating inconsistent parts of MC and other characters. First off you start to notice that that 30+ year old reincarnated male\'s brain starts to have a mental struggle, he suddenly starts to think like a kid when it comes to hiding powers considered to be monsterous. He waits for the side character\'s reaction before he explains, but that\'s not the most irritating part, the most irritating part is his explanations, he could easily just tell how things are, but what does he do? He makes new things up that don\'t make sense to the viewers nor anyone else, he literally just makes dumb stuff up. This thing goes on and on through the anime from time to time and it nearly makes you wanna drop it.Now the ending was as rushed as it can be, the main villain lasted few minutes, he had few minutes of screen time. The Black Death disease was way more interesting, felt like the ""main villain"" was a filler for the actual villain ""Black Death"". Through the last few episodes, the dramatic realization of Black Death and preparations against it was actually something to find exciting and interesting, but all that buildup was ruined by the underwhelming end with the filler villain. Not just that, but Lotte... How did she manage to go from 1 IQ to Negative IQ in mere seconds by somehow assuming that Farma went back inside to pharmacy, to that specific room(She yells out ""Farma"" right as she opens the door, suggesting that she would know he is in that room), with already anxious expressions. LIKE WHAT?? Was she subconciously expecting something bad to happen, it felt EXTREMELY Forced. The whole idea of them being targets was so FORCED it made me wanna drop it even tho there was few minutes left to the series, it felt like they wanted to ruin the ending by half-hearted writing. Moving on... the final fight, it was very underwhelming, it felt like it actually didn\'t even happen, like it was just... a filler. So irritating.I would suggest this anime for people who wanna see something wholesome, but don\'t wanna think that much while watching it. You might find it decent that way, but if you want something that at least makes some sense and isn\'t forced, just so convenient and empty, then you should move on to something else.I would rate this 6/10, it\'s not bad, it\'s not good, it\'s ok in its own way. Animation definitely nothing unique, but it\'s decent smooth 8/10.Sorry for the rant, but this deserved more even tho it was ok. world and ever so conveniently that boy was a member in a  family full of pharmacists, but wait... that\'s not all!

That is the main exploration here. Fortunately Falma, the MC, is born into a noble family with a strong sense of noblesse oblige, so he has a much easier time trying to help society with his medical powers. His noble background also helps him overcome the problems he steps into wielding his power indiscriminately, but never has to really suffer the consequences of doing so.The best moments relate to the supporting characters, such as when Falma\'s shortcomings lead to him learning from his supporting characters or when we...see characters with lesser capability than Falma act heroically. He learns from Bruno the empathy required in personal care. He learns from Charlotte how to meet ""commoners"" where they\'re at from a marketing sense and how to welcome them in. Eleonore struggles as she feels she could have studied better to be closer in skill to Falma, but still takes on a necessary task in fighting against disease outbreak.However, Farma wields his great power clumsily and is unable to foresee how much his actions would shake up society. The Queen warns him that he can\'t just open up shop and offer products and services at a close-to-nothing cost (as he has no production or labor costs and no profit incentive) without threatening the established businesses, but when this conflict materializes it is nothing substantial. He never faces the repercussions warranted because the problems are waved away by the plot.Farma never has to make any difficult decisions or learn difficult lessons. In his pre-isekai life, he overworks himself to death. In his isekai life, he overworks himself again without consequence. He slightly learns how to delegate responsibility, but the plot dictates he has infinite time to tend to individual patients when necessary.But still, the world and premise is fleshed out well enough to make you think about it. Even if it makes you the viewer go ""that doesn\'t make sense,"" you have to respect there is at least enough of a foundation built up to even be able to say that. see characters with lesser capability than Falma act heroically.

A dozen plague squirrels are loose for an hour and all kinds of people are already infected. He can fly to the city but then has to run to the pharmacy to catch the bad guy.

You can see the character development and how much he grows, and he is literally trusted by everyone he meets. I questioned whether the anime was still about medicine, but the cause and everything they were doing was also related to medicine. Its amazing that such a large scale conflict was based on medicine and could create such a great storyline. ', ""Isekai Yakkyoku or Parallel World Pharmacy was a simply delightful anime to watch!  There is nothing new or revolutionary in the DNA of the show, but the way the elements come together is very entertaining, and never once seemed too formulaic or tired.Pharmacologist Kanji Yakutani works himself to death and is reincarnated as 10-year-old Farma de M√©dicis, the son of a noble pharmacist who was struck by lightning.  In truth, some of the most enjoyable aspects of the anime come from Farma's introduction to this new medieval/Fantasy world with backward medicine and magic.  His reactions to his situation are surprisingly...grounded and amusing - and the explanation for this boy having a brand new personality has a plausible explanation that lends itself to the narrative.As I said, there's not a lot that is brand new.  It's an isekai anime with an overpowered MC who is humble and kind - and most of us have seen shows that follow that pattern.  Likewise, there's no grand quest really for him to go on, newly reincarnated Farma just wants to open a pharmacy and serve the common folk - and manages to get his wish by episode 4 because, with his prior life knowledge, he cured the empress' white death (read:TB) which was understandably assumed to be a death sentence.  And an overpowered MC living a relatively quiet life is also not something new to us - though Farma does seek to change the world with knowledge, not with his god-like magic.Despite that, there's a lot to enjoy in Parallel World Pharmacy.  For one, the supporting cast of characters is likable, engaging, and funny.  Their interactions with Farma - and his at-times overwhelming abilities and staggering intellect - are usually a joy to watch. Lotte and El√©onore are both highlights and are his main introductions to the world - and his protectors.  For two - and in my opinion, one of the best parts of the anime overall - Farma's family provides some of the most heartwarming and heartfelt moments in the anime (and does not always subscribe to patterns). Whilst Kanji has a bit of a tragic backstory, Farma's family are warm people who note his difference, but support and care for him anyway after the reincarnation.  Farma's interactions with his initially severe father Bruno are off-type and wonderful.  Bruno notes the changes in the boy he raised, but is still able to develop a genuine and respectful relationship with his son.  The relationship between Farma and his little sister Blanch is also a joy to watch and takes on deeper significance as you get to know Farma better over the course of the show.The one criticism I make is that some of the medical and pharmaceutical jargon can be technical and difficult to understand, but the purpose of that dialogue is always made clear and it never overwhelms any other aspect of the show.  Farma's abilities are all rooted in Kanji's lifetime of knowledge, and it is a device I think works very well throughout.For more technical aspects, I thought the art and animation were well done - and strike a wholesome and warm tone for the entire anime.  The music and VA were also good - though in truth I watched the dub version.  The pacing is also well done - there are few big action sequences, and the show has a slower pace overall, so I'd give this a miss if that's what you're looking for.  But the somewhat episodic nature of Isekai Yakkyoku is firmly rooted in the overall arc of 12 episodes, and all of that was very well-paced.  However, there are times throughout that some of the story's twists and turns - such as they are - can come across as telegraphed because it's easy to guess what will happen next.Parallel World Pharmacy might be nothing new or revolutionary - but very little is in the isekai anime genre.  What this anime does well is to take the elements of that genre and make them feel grounded and refreshing.  If you like isekai animes with overpowered MCs who lead simple - though sometimes exciting - lives, then you'll also like this I believe.  If you are tired of the isekai genre overall, I'd still recommend giving this one a look - there are none of the controversies of Mushoku Tensei, and no harem tropes (personally tired of that one in isekai). There's no grand adventure or demon king.  There is no grad mystery to solve.  The narrative might not be particularly deep - though it is well-explained and fleshed out.  The MC might seem bland with all his kindness and humility - but the supporting characters and his interactions with them more than compensate for this in my opinion.Parallel World Pharmacy is mostly friends, family, and pharmacology that come together in a grounded and revitalized take on an established genre. grounded and amusing - and the explanation for this boy having a brand new personality has a plausible explanation that lends itself to the narrative.As I said, there's not a lot that is brand new.

The MC might seem bland with all his kindness and humility - but the supporting characters and his interactions with them more than compensate for this in my opinion.Parallel World Pharmacy is mostly friends, family, and pharmacology that come together in a grounded and revitalized take on an established genre."", ""I read the description and thought to myself  'ah right, another isekai, about medicine this time, probably hard to follow',but when I  gave the first episode a try I found myself just continue to watch episode after episode.It's super easy to follow, pulls you in from the start, very intriguing, and definitely doesn't have that 'another isekai' feel to it!The differences in the worlds gives off a vibe similar to watching- dr. quinn medicine woman, and the medical episodes of little house on the prairie (i know, not anim√©, but it definitely gives me the same happy feelings)The story on itself...doesn't feel forced or 'yea, right' at all, it actually gives me the feeling that everything is as a giant forethought puzzle, that, with how the story progresses, seems very plausible.there's also not a lot that i 'saw coming' aka the 'of course this happened...' so to watch this feels very fresh.Lastly, in the anime, I found lots of great small and accurate details, it feels like the author went above and beyond making this enjoyable, from head to toe (physician joke)TL:DR - easy to follow, great story and very fresh, so not the  'typical another isekai''unexpectedly great'Hope this helps others doesn't feel forced or 'yea, right' at all, it actually gives me the feeling that everything is as a giant forethought puzzle, that, with how the story progresses, seems very plausible.there's also not a lot that i 'saw coming' aka the 'of course this happened...' so to watch this feels very fresh.Lastly, in the anime, I found lots of great small and accurate details, it feels like the author went above and beyond making this enjoyable, from head to toe (physician joke)TL:DR - easy to follow, great story and very fresh, so not the  'typical another isekai''unexpectedly great'Hope this helps others"", ""typical shonen anime as usual.

I barely watch anime medical genre.good animation and visual effects. I think I love the ost.Falma is a too perfect character. well, have no complaints cause he is the main protagonist....but it seems not to balance since Kamyu has a mininum character description. we just know about his past and relation with Bruno. but it seems not to balance since Kamyu has a mininum character description. we just know about his past and relation with Bruno."", ""This had so much promise. After the first two episodes I was really hooked. It carried on in a similar manner and was not terrible but by the time it reached episode 8 or so, it really lost its spark. It was incredibly redundant.The real world representation of epidemics and the way we handle them was actually very accurate from what I'm aware of. All things like hazmat suits and masks were present, something that we became accustomed to in the covid-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, almost all growth for the show halted late in that season. I think what was most disappointing was the end. Bad...stuff shows up out of nowhere, but is neutralized and destroyed almost instantly and then the show is done.

The antagonist has very little into on him, i think he is mention is a total of 5 dialogues. the fight between him and the mc is just sad and disappointing , also the antagonist was defeated...in the first scene he was shown in.this could have been an amazing anime with its unique take but the hastiness to complete it in 12 episodes ruined it.I WANT A REBOOT. in the first scene he was shown in.this could have been an amazing anime with its unique take but the hastiness to complete it in 12 episodes ruined it.I WANT A REBOOT.', 'Finally an isekai that doesn\'t fall into the category of ""show Ill watch and instantly forget about"".For some reason now a lot of isekai just assume you already know whats goin on with the genre and what to expect and skip a lot of the groundwork that makes a good show even though its such a low bar.Half of the time you\'re thrown into an isekai where the main character doesn\'t think for a second about how they got there or why, much less expressing any emotion over it, and then the plot will start with little to no real good introduction or background....This show is a very refreshing return to normalcy with what I think isekais should be.The main character has a compelling background that makes sense and pretty quickly creates a sense of connection with the viewer, and his background leads to his reincarnation into another world via death by overwork. (Not a truck!)He actually has to process and figure out what has happened to him as well as the backstory of the person he has now taken over in the new world.

I wouldn\'t say that. However is it worth a watch? Absofuckinlutely. Only 3 episodes in and I can tell this is going to be ranking higher than most in my list of isekais I enjoy.

I\'ve gotten to know a few of the tropes just from reading them. I can see the appeal of this dumpy vomit-genre. But every genre and every trope no matter how overdone or poorly thought out can be used in a way that makes it interesting. Isekai Yakkyoku has been a balm on my growing annoyance with this genre. It\'s been interesting and fun to watch for my 12 episodes.This isn\'t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. I\'m sure some of the classics...and big shows I\'ve heard about are better but Isekai Yakkyoku is perfectly adequate at a minimum. It features a main character who is overpowered but not annoying. Whose strength doesn\'t frustrate me in it\'s simplicity [Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki] or it\'s complexity [Level 1 dakedo Unique Skill de Saikyou desu]. There is a harem-ish support cast/found family but while there\'s room for shipping there wasn\'t any overt romance elements.Isekai Yakkyoku is forced on being a medical anime and Isekai and it rather succeeds at that. Watching Farma use his pharmaceutical knowledge to adapt to a more primitive time-period was interesting. The animation felt quite excellent. It made watching the show less of a chore at every moment. At 12 episodes it doesn\'t overstay it\'s welcome, but the ending felt, not quite at the level of ""unearned"" but, perhaps slightly rushed. There are things seeded about this world that aren\'t explored. Things you\'ll notice immediately on rewatch. What are the numbers Farma woke up with when he first incarnated. He never touches a divining rode to test his power levels. There\'s a few other things that get touched on but never really go anywhere.By the time Act 3 was there, I was invested in Farma. I was invested in the Pharmacy. I was even invested in the bubonic plague. All of these things felt developed and arriving naturally. But the ""ultimate antagonist"" was not. This fight felt like a first showdown not a final one. A fight that would start a functional rivalry or something but instead the show dovetails neatly into a FIN.  I don\'t mind ending the story here but I would have been fine without the antagonist pulling the strings. It reminds me of Wonder Woman a near perfect superhero movie until the third act. It was sincere, hopeful, charming and awesome at the same time. Until in act three two things happened. 1) Rather than revealing that war is a part of mankind. The movie proved the naive Diana correct by having a here-to-unknown third party be responsible for war among people. Which felt insulting due to the reality of the war and ultimately cost Diana a moment of character growth that would have fit all four of those characteristics again. 2) Because an antagonist  was introduced direct combat had to occur and since it\'s live action that meant the light had to go away. So we had a fight in the dark with a character we didn\'t care about. All of that to say the same thing happens here.  The story was leading to a disease based ending which matches the things we\'ve enjoyed about the show so far and then basically out of nowhere a third party shows up and invites direct combat which is fine but it doesn\'t match what we\'ve been watching. and big shows I\'ve heard about are better but Isekai Yakkyoku is perfectly adequate at a minimum.

It does not revolutionize the genre, or change it in any way. What the show does have, is compelling characters and an interesting story.I have been a fan of this manga for a while. When you know that a manga you enjoy is getting an adaptation you get a little worried, especially if it is an isekai. So many stories are poorly adapted and just plain cash grabs. This anime was different. It is extremely clear from the beginning that the people behind this anime really enjoyed the original story. Because for the first time in my isekai...experience, i found a show where the anime is actually better than the manga. At least in the beginning. For the first 8 episodes the anime is perfecting the story from the manga/novel: It added scenes when necessary and took away scenes where they were unneeded. They added depth to the characters, and explained plot holes. And for the first 8 episodes, it was great.Then the issue became apparent.This show had to decide between two bad scenarios1. make a rushed story that leaves many plot holes and cuts out major characters and parts of the story. Or2. Make a great season 1, that can lead up to an even better season 2. Without knowing of the show would ever get a season 2.The writers chose option 1. And by doing that they cut out two major characters and one VERY important arc. I hindsight i wish they had chosen option 2. What we ended up with instead was a major shift in tone, a major plot hole and a character who is on screen and shown to care about the mc, without us (or the mc) ever having seen the person before.Now the question becomes weather the first half of the season makus up for the second half.On one hand we have an anime adaptation that perfected the story of the source material, and even added emotional depth to multiple characters.to use an analogy: The team was playing a perfect game for the first 45 minutes. But they dropped the ball right before the end, and tied instead of winning.This anime made me extremely happy for the first 8 episodes, and after that it was very painful. Because i had just seen how good the show could be, wich made the mediocrity of the ending that much more unbearable. If the show had just 10, heck even just 5 more episodes, this could have been one of the greatest shows this year. Instead it was just average.So in conclusion should you watch this show?Well it depends: If you like isekai or if you have already read the manga, then yes i think you will enjoy the show.

There's nothing groundbreaking about it, and it has it's issues, but for me it hits all the right notes.The protagonist, Farma, is overpowered to the extreme, but he's entertaining to watch anyway. I'll have to admit, I'm a little too fond of overpowered characters. I get an absurd amount of satisfaction from watching someone do a huge spell while a shocked acquaintance cowers on the sidelines. The show does attempt to balance him a bit - he can be a bit clumsy and doesn't know everything (although in the context of the...universe he might as well) - but for all intents and purposes he's kinda a Gary Stu. Farma is virtually a God in terms of his textbook knowledge of medicine, so his goal in the show, aside from making medicine accessible to the poor, is to learn the human aspects of medicine that you can only get from working directly with patients. It is incredibly wholesome. He is overpowered, but he gives you a warm feeling in your heart.It's fun to get little tidbits of knowledge about pharmaceuticals. It's fun to see the little animations of chemical compound structures when he produces a new substance. It's fun to imagine what will happen when his close companions find out more about his past, and how that will affect the story. Farma's father is a great character. He's just a good role model and in general a fatherly badass.As for what bothers me about the show...They take a lot of liberties with the setting. Farma is a walking modern medicine textbook living in a medieval world. His knowledge, if taken seriously, should by all means throw the entire economy into disorder. He cures tuberculosis in one day and just announces that it will cease to be a deadly disease. He creates a white face cream to replace lead-based face powder, and then gets the dangerous products banned. These cause some minor issues that get resolved pretty quickly - and that's totally unrealistic. But I get it, because realism is not what the show is about. The show is unrealistic enough that I think about it quite a bit, but in the end I put aside those thoughts because it's fun to watch anyway, and I am very invested in the characters.In addition, the cute little sister and the cute maid are kinda meh. I especially am not fond of the maid, I think she's annoying.

Kind of copies another show in more than one way, but I\'ll let you figure that one out. Let\'s skip the whole isekai ting and go straight to the core of the show, which is helping those who are unable to afford what they need. Gives a nice message about helping those who have nothing and using what you have to help them. It\'s kind of hard to write a review for this since its really just a basic show about a ""kid"" trying to help those in need. Standard isekai that doesn\'t focus too hard...on the ""other world"" part and skips the power fantasy trope in exchange for a story about helping people. If you find isekai anime to be boring and redundant, maybe try this one out, it isn\'t as bland as 90% of the other shows in this genre. on the ""other world"" part and skips the power fantasy trope in exchange for a story about helping people.

I will come to this with time.The story I enjoyed, quite a interesting perspective on medicine and how it would function if you would send someone with the actual knowledge to a fantasy world that\'s pretty much in the 1600\'s if we have to go on the actual setting and ships. The world provided in this anime looks quite good although we get to see mostly interiors and the same area\'s every time. The main character, Kanji...Yakutani, is a 30 year old man that dies after overworking himself. He wakes up in a 10 year old boy in another world. His new name is Falma, born into a rich family. He quickly finds our this world is somewhat based up on magic and also finds out that he seems to have insane powers. From this point he quickly manages to use modern medicine to heal a lot of people.The story is working pretty well but now the things that raises questions. The character \'√âlisabeth II\' being obviously derived from the English crown and the mention of \'Nederland\' (meaning Netherlands in English. Which is actually a real country. Also falsely named Holland) and the Dutch East Indies company being directly put against it as being the baddies in the story I already have somewhat of a few questions. This being from the Netherlands myself, but nothing serious just yet. However now for the questionable part, which happens to be that \'Nederland\' and the Dutch East Indies company would have spread the black plague according to this anime\'s storyline. Now is it obviously just a random story. But this could easily have been done by not using the names of actual real people, countries or companies. It causes for a huge implication that could actually cause tensions between Japan and the specific nations, in this case the Netherlands. Now I don\'t think the Netherlands will be going that far, it isn\'t North Korea, China or Russia obviously. But this could have been handled with more care with a topic that severe.I don\'t mind seeing England vs. Netherlands in some war, both did go to war quite a lot in the past. So no big issues there, but trying to tell one of either would be capable of doing something this horrible, even for a anime narrative, is actually making that specific country seem horrible for no good reason. Specially if both should be allies as the anime story clearly states.Now for the black plague for which I will add some wikipedia text to show the actual time period:""The Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague)[a] was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the deaths of 75‚Äì200 million people, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but it can also take a secondary form where it is spread by person-to-person contact via aerosols causing septicaemic or pneumonic plagues.""""The origin of the Black Death is disputed. The pandemic originated either in Central Asia or East Asia but its first definitive appearance was in Crimea in 1347.[dubious ‚Äì discuss] From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, Western Asia, and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily, and the Italian Peninsula.""This combined with the mention the black plague in this world was 200+ years ago, so that would actually indeed fit the 1600\'s time period I suggested earlier. However in our history this never happened, the actual second wave was discovered in Hong Kong in the 1800\'s as this section suggests on the same wikipedia page:""Y. pestis was discovered by Alexandre Yersin, a pupil of Louis Pasteur, during an epidemic of bubonic plague in Hong Kong in 1894""So this could suggest in this anime world it\'s used as a weapon like a biological type of weapon of todays world. Which can not happen as your ship crew will be wiped out before they even get half way their journey. A ship adrift on a sea will likely get battered by the waves then end up facing the wrong way and capsizing taking your biological weapon along with your ship and there for never arriving.Now for another topic, the ending is still having open questions that should be resolved before ending it (Fin is French for \'the end\' which might be another raised question in a way). For example the Guild that didn\'t want him to enter and wanted to destroy Falma and his business. Only 1 of them joined Falma, the rest is not seen after that episode while it\'s president (Veron) is shown shortly in the final minute of the last episode trying to toss away medication to stop the black plague. Only to pick it up and give it to his wife. Yet none of them really got a proper ending. This while being part of quite a few episodes as one of the main protagonists this seems weird.Characters:--------------Mixed bag here, some characters could be flashed out better for sure. But over all there are quite interesting characters in this anime.Graphics & Sound:-----------------------The graphics look pretty good, it\'s very pleasant to look at and it makes the anime seem alive.The sound is pretty much standard, nothing too special here.Worth it?-----------Even with the things I mentioned I still give it a 8 over all, well deserved in that. The 2 points taken is mostly for the odd treatment of countries/companies and the fact regarding a odd ending. Well worth it, I\'d say a must see show! Yakutani, is a 30 year old man that dies after overworking himself. He wakes up in a 10 year old boy in another world. His new name is Falma, born into a rich family. He quickly finds our this world is somewhat based up on magic and also finds out that he seems to have insane powers. From this point he quickly manages to use modern medicine to heal a lot of people.The story is working pretty well but now the things that raises questions. The character \'√âlisabeth II\' being obviously derived from the English crown and the mention of \'Nederland\' (meaning Netherlands in English. Which is actually a real country. Also falsely named Holland) and the Dutch East Indies company being directly put against it as being the baddies in the story I already have somewhat of a few questions. This being from the Netherlands myself, but nothing serious just yet. However now for the questionable part, which happens to be that \'Nederland\' and the Dutch East Indies company would have spread the black plague according to this anime\'s storyline. Now is it obviously just a random story. But this could easily have been done by not using the names of actual real people, countries or companies. It causes for a huge implication that could actually cause tensions between Japan and the specific nations, in this case the Netherlands. Now I don\'t think the Netherlands will be going that far, it isn\'t North Korea, China or Russia obviously. But this could have been handled with more care with a topic that severe.I don\'t mind seeing England vs. Netherlands in some war, both did go to war quite a lot in the past. So no big issues there, but trying to tell one of either would be capable of doing something this horrible, even for a anime narrative, is actually making that specific country seem horrible for no good reason. Specially if both should be allies as the anime story clearly states.Now for the black plague for which I will add some wikipedia text to show the actual time period:""The Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague)[a] was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the deaths of 75‚Äì200 million people, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but it can also take a secondary form where it is spread by person-to-person contact via aerosols causing septicaemic or pneumonic plagues.""""The origin of the Black Death is disputed. The pandemic originated either in Central Asia or East Asia but its first definitive appearance was in Crimea in 1347.[dubious ‚Äì discuss] From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, Western Asia, and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily, and the Italian Peninsula.""This combined with the mention the black plague in this world was 200+ years ago, so that would actually indeed fit the 1600\'s time period I suggested earlier. However in our history this never happened, the actual second wave was discovered in Hong Kong in the 1800\'s as this section suggests on the same wikipedia page:""Y. pestis was discovered by Alexandre Yersin, a pupil of Louis Pasteur, during an epidemic of bubonic plague in Hong Kong in 1894""So this could suggest in this anime world it\'s used as a weapon like a biological type of weapon of todays world.

Up to episode 9 I was honestly expecting this anime to be a 9/10 from me BUT the last 3 episodes ruined it. Not too much to say other than that. If you are an isekai fan then this is still very much worth the watch. Visuals are decent, the story is interesting up to episode 9. Biggest problem is that this anime lacks character development, it focuses too much on the medical side of things and it feels like the characters have...almost no backstory and they end up a bit bland.Overall still a  7/10  from me, would be higher if characters were better developed and if the last 3 episodes were erased from my memory. almost no backstory and they end up a bit bland.Overall still a  7/10  from me, would be higher if characters were better developed and if the last 3 episodes were erased from my memory.', ""Wholesome and also fantastical.Yes this is an Isekai and the main character is crazy OP. Yet, it is more than just adventuring and fighting baddies.It is the intrinsic values of the MC that shine trough and trough in all his actions to make the world a better place.Different from other Isekai, the previous life experience/knowledge is connected to all of this. It's not just  escapism where the MC had an average or shitty life. Already in his previous life, the MC had a real purpose. It does the more make the MC insanely OP (quite frankly unbelievably so), though in this fantasy world that...has its fair share of action it makes perfect sense.I like natural sciences, If you don't, I still recommend this anime. has its fair share of action it makes perfect sense.I like natural sciences, If you don't, I still recommend this anime."", 'Once more, I find an anime not necessarily underrated, but almost certainly underwatched. Especially as a perfectly watchable and even enjoyable isekai anime without the unnecessary addition - so far - of tsunderes or other unneeded drama. While far from perfect, I would certainly recommend people try this show... just for a little bit of variety. And, as a plus, though this anime has some historical inspiration it doesn\'t present itself as ""historical"", but rather ""fantasy"", therefore there are really no issues with accuracy.Now, let\'s get down to why I like or dislike the show...[ Art & Animation - 7/10 ]I would be...lying if I claimed the art in this is unique, or breath-taking. It is, however, pleasant to the eyes, as are most of the designs and consistent throughout the anime so far. The animation, while occasionally a little rough is for the most part smooth and well-done and I have no major problems with it. Character designs work, and, as a plus, historically inspired designs such as long skirts for dresses are not only reserved for the opposition, the bad guys.---[ Sound - 7/10 ]I\'m actually sort of considering rating this even lower. While the soundtrack is nomally fitting and quite nice, I find the voice acting a little stilted in the dub and something tells me it wouldn\'t be much better in the dub. Coversations are very awkward, especially in some episodes, and lacking expressiveness (which is actually a lot less common in most quality dubbed anime than sub worshippers would have you think) which means that unlike with some anime where I could understand the circumstances even just by the voice acting alone... it\'s a lot less clear here. The voice acting is okay, but it\'s lacking a certain something.---[ Plot/Story - 8/10 ]One man\'s ambition to run a pharmacy in another world which would improve the health standards of both the common and the noble folk. Unlike so many other stories set in a world filled with aristocracy, this is not in search of vengeance against the upperclasses, nor in an attempt to put them down or in their place. The MC just wants to help people, plain and simple and he has the power to do so. From creating modern treatments and cures using older technology to building pharmacies and figuring out how to run a business and attract reluctant and doubtful customers, the first few episodes of the show feel perhaps a little slower and don\'t appear particularly risky, but are nevertheless interesting and enjoyable. And now, with the church getting involved, it may be the that the risks have gone up. Either way, so far the story is fun to watch, and I\'ll be interested in what lies ahead.---[ Character - 8/10]The MC treats elements of history such as fashion or make up with dignity. He acknowledges its imperfections - for instance the addition of toxic metals into face powders - while not mocking them for it, instead chalking it up to obliviousness, not making it out to be stupid. Instead, he assists in making fashion safer, not non-existent, and while it is a shame that he didn\'t provide some much needed advice (for instance, if one\'s crush does not appreciate their skin in the perfectly healthy colour it is, perhaps that crush is not worth their time or effort, let alone their health... but, hey). I will say that perhaps it would be good to see him make the occasional mistake, it would make him more real in a way (not to mention, I study science and I sure as hell don\'t remember the chemical composition of most things, so our guy must have an amazing memory or something... might be worth mentioning), but otherwise, the MC is pleasant, with motivations, reasons for doing things, etc. Hopefully we\'ll see there is more to him as the story progresses. And as a plus he\'s not some kind of pervert and he doesn\'t seem to find not staring at a girl\'s boobs the biggest challenge.The characters surrounding the MC are not idiots. They\'re choices aren\'t always perfect, but they are still very observant, and it\'s not like they\'re completely ignorant to the flaws in the world. He doesn\'t necessarily need to be a beacon of light for them, he\'s more of a sort of catalyst that speeds up an already ongoing reaction... and I think that\'s good. Moreover, everyone chips in with ideas and knowledge... there isn\'t a single main source of exposition or ideas thus far, and that\'s nice to see. This way everyone plays a role - well, except maybe the little sister, but in fairness, she\'s like, four.I think maaaaybe they could use a little more to them iand I do think that the divine arts teacher could have been a little more calm and collected as a mentor, but otherwise, it\'s an all-round good cast of characters.---[ Enjoyment - 9/10 ]Watching this feels a bit like watching Dr Stone, except this is an isekai and it is a lot more focused on the medical and cosmetic aspects of the show and it involves magic, which is always nice. Enjoyment is of course subjective, so I will say that you may not enjoy this anime as much as I did thus far... but despite there being - thus far - no major stakes, nor big mistakes in the MC\'s path, that a) may be about to chance and b) I still nevertheless find it interesting to watch, because it decided to choose a somewhat different premise than having an adventurer or a knight, or something of the sort as MC.

There's not really any change beyond initially doubting MC Farma before he brings them to his side with his sick pharma raps.

The show is just another low effort quickly manufactured anime for the season. It's very innocuous and benign. Great for kids I guess. It's Pokemon level intelligence with some drug names thrown in as a facade. The only thing really worthwhile is the father, who is hot. Maybe you would think there would be some allusions to the current real world pandemic. Absolutely none. Keep it as risk free and bland as possible."", '(Spoilers)TLDR at the endI\'ve had enough. I really have had enough.I hate Isekai that try to be interesting but end up being an embarrassment.I hate main characters that is the same old ""Nice and caring"" personality.I hate Isekai that always make the main character reincarnate in a noble family with riches....I hate characters that are overpowered straight off the bat, rather than slowly learning more and becoming stronger.Generic anime suck, and this is no different.So, you may be thinking, ""How is Isekai Yakkyou generic?""Simple. If you take a close look, there is NOTHING good that I can say about Isekai Yakkyou besides the animation, sound effects, and music. The story is cheap and crap, the characters are Clich√©, and it\'s boring.So, what makes Isekai Yakkyou generic? To simply put, it has the qualities of the same old Isekai. I can at least say that Isekai Yakkyou tries, but fails to be interesting. It\'s like bringing up an interesting idea, but failing to make good use of it.Bringing more explanation to this, take a look at episode one. Kanji (a doctor) is researching over night. He continues to work, until suddenly, as soon as he sleeps, he dies of over work. He is suddenly brought to a new world.Suddenly, he is reincarnated into a nobles family. Sure, totally not generic. Next, he is found out to be given a special ability; to be blessed by the panactheos. Yeah, totally not generic. Next, he is op straight of the bat. Sure, I totally haven\'t seen one Isekai with an overpowered protagonist, straight off the bat. One thing that I can at least say that was unique was Kanji being reincarnated into an already living body that had just died, rather then being reincarnated into an entirely new character.Slowly after that, Kanji (which is now known as Farma) slowly gets used to the diseases and medical system, which is bland, and generic.Why? Simple. The diseases are literally the same as the world Kanji was in. It isn\'t an entirely new system, which is just generic, and is one of the main reasons the MC becomes overpowered. If it\'s the same diseases from the previous world, no wonder how overpowered Farma gets.Remember what I previously said? about the op protagonist. Well guess what. This guy can make PERFECT medicines with ease, which is shitty and generic. Farma easily gets through the path of medicine; he doesn\'t experience failure or hardships through it. It\'s just a few hours of studying, and bop! he\'s overpowered. And it isn\'t just that. Don\'t forget about Farma, as not only can he make perfect medicine, but also can create perfect face cream that makes your face white, without any health disadvantages! Wow! Oh, and you musn\'t forget about how everything conveniently goes his way. During episode seven, the people from guardian deity temple chase after Farma, with the intention of eliminating him, and guess what happens. He easily blocks all of their attacks with ease, which is lame, stupid, and most importantly, generic. With the help of the Panactheos, Farma has everything work conveniently for him. For example, on episode 12, he somehow starts using ""Remove (disease name)"" which is something that works PERFECTLY for him, especially at the last fight, when Blanche was infected with a disease, he can just do an easy ""Remove infection!""The characters? Clich√©. Farma, the same old nice and caring type. Oh and don\'t hit me with that ""determined to save people so no one has to suffer"" because that isn\'t even getting me sad or anything. A characters backstory is supposed to make you feel pity for them, but I couldn\'t give one crap about Farma or Kanji. Oh, and the villains! Clich√© goal. They all want to kill everyone in the world for one particular reason: Because people didn\'t understand him. Sadly, his characters was barely fleshed out, he only got a minute or 2 of his backstory. Haha, and it was the only reason I kept my hopes up for this. Also, we never get to learn about other characters and their motivation for medicine. All we learn from is Farma, the generic protagonist.The animation: good. Bland shaded backgrounds, decent fight choreography, and consistent animation. It pretty much has everything you need for a good adapted series. I was quite surprised that the studio that animated dumpstermic girlfriend would be animating a medical Isekai. So yeah, the animation is good. I don\'t have much issues with it.Sound effects are also good. It\'s nothing special. Same old magic effects, punching effects (except for that one in episode 12) and yeah, basically the same old sound effects. It fits really well, just like how the music during fight scenes, or any scene fits well. I had no issues with it. Despite how much I hate Isekai Yakkyou, I actually like the opening, it got me vibing to it every time I listened to it. The outro song was also nice, but I skipped it multiple times, even if I found myself humming to it while I\'m doing something. The voice actors are skilled, being great at acting, etc. Their voices also fit with the characters personalityI somehow enjoyed Isekai Yakkyou at the start and thought it was decent. Soon after, it became boring, because it\'s generic. It would be hard to enjoy a show with an OP mc that was born into a nobles family, with everything going perfectly for him. If I were to re watch this, I would be sleeping through the whole time. Not even one second of looking at the screen.Isekai Yakkyou is an anime that tricks the audience into thinking it is good, but behind all of the good voice acting and low-budget animation, lies a generic Isekai story that one would see every season.Don\'t even bother watching Isekai Yakkyou. It\'s not worth your time, even if you like medical anime. A straight up 1/10, with no hesitation whatsoever. Isekai Yakkyou had potential, it really did.TLDRIsekai Yakkyou is the same old boring Isekai that has an overpowered mc, boring characters, bland shaded backgrounds, and a lame story.

Marmalade Boy Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/520/Marmalade_Boy_Movie,"[""This movie definitely gave me a lot of closure. Marmalade Boy has entirely been about Miki's point of view, but this movie actually makes Yuu to be an actual person. I mean, for those who have seen or read the series, didn't you ever wonder how Yuu suddenly had feelings for Miki? It seemed all of a sudden. Too sudden. This movie makes a lot of sense of that thought. "", 'Marmalade boy was a drama about about two sets of parents getting a divorce, and swaping partners. When their the son (yuu) and daughter (miki) of both couple meet each other, they fall in love, however the anime countinues on with rivaley, new discoveres and so for.Marmalade Boy the movie, take you back to the start of the anime, and show how yuu fell in love with miki, which was before miki meet yuu, which was not shown in the anime. ', ""Marmalade Boy the movie really isn't what most people would think a movie would be like. It is quite short. So don't go into this movie thinking it's a full length movie, think more along the lines of it being a bonus episode.I really did like this a lot and it made me understand the character of Yuu a lot more. When watching the TV series I found myself frustrated at Yuu. I could not understand how he could love a girl when they had only just met, plus a lot of the time I would question what Yuu's true feelings for her were....This movie helped me cast away all my doubts about my Yuu and made me really fall in love with the idea of Yuu/Miki. The story is brilliant. It really makes you get how Yuu felt when his family said they were getting a divorce. The shots that were showed helped understand what it is about Miki that Yuu loves so much about her. It was also great seeing other characters and what they were like before the series begun.I definitely do think Marmalade Boy the Movie is great for those to watch who have seen Marmalade Boy. It was very sweet and funny. This movie helped me cast away all my doubts about my Yuu and made me really fall in love with the idea of Yuu/Miki. The story is brilliant.

Mei to Koneko Bus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2488/Mei_to_Koneko_Bus,"[""It's such a shame they only show this at the Studio Ghibli museum in Tokyo. I went to the museum hoping to see this but unfortunately they alternate it with 10 other movies so you would be a very lucky person indeed to see this in good quality.However somebody managed to film a bit of it on their camera phone and uploaded it to the internet so this is the version most people are probably familiar with. It's obviously very bad quality but better than nothing and I really hope that one day Studio Ghibli decide to release this for everyone.The Ghibli museum is a...wonderful place to visit and I'm sure releasing these short films would do absolutely nothing to harm them, please release them for the world to see! wonderful place to visit and I'm sure releasing these short films would do absolutely nothing to harm them, please release them for the world to see!"", 'First of all, keep in mind that this was made exclusively for the Ghibli museum in Japan. It has never been officially released outside of the museum, and the film itself has never been solidly leaked online either. Your only way to watch it is to either go to the museum or watch one of the few camrip versions. The camrips are not pretty, but it\'s not like they will prevent you from getting any enjoyment out of it. With that said, it\'s time to review the film itself.This is a short film that takes place after the events of My Neighbor Totoro. The younger...sister, Mei, meets the child of the Catbus, and they do a little bit of exploring. It\'s cute, just like My Neighbor Totoro was. However, it is still only a 15 minute short. The ""story"" is more of a series of short interactions between Mei and various magical creatures. It should go without saying, but there was no conflict whatsoever.Artwork is well done, in the same style as My Neighbor Totoro. At multiple points during this short film, they managed to include the signature Ghibli imagery of a young girl innocently interacting with something that most people would find to be off-putting. Gives you the idea that she\'s so innocent that she doesn\'t know that she\'s supposed to be bothered by it. I wont give you an example, since it would count as a spoiler, but you\'ll know what I mean if you watch it.Sound is greatly lacking. The background music was just some edited version of the intro song from My Neighbor Totoro(which was used as background music throughout Totoro as well) and I found it to be fairly boring, since it was pretty much just repeating over and over over the course of the short film. Also, and this is my opinion which may anger other Ghibli fanatics, Mei\'s voice acting is poor. It puts me on edge because it is far too loud and abrasive. I know it is meant to mimic the energy of a spunky young girl, but its just too loud for comfort. Again, that is my opinion, and you\'ll have to watch it yourself to make any final judgment on the topic.Characters are fine. Mei, Totoro, and Catbus were already established in My Neighbor Totoro, and you get about as much character depth out of Kittenbus as you could hope to get out of a magical cat that lets people ride around in its body.Enjoyment: I thought it was cute. Its main goal was to drive home the feeling of childish innocence and playfulness, and it succeeded. I enjoyed it as an extra bonus to Totoro.Overall, I think it\'s a nice extra. Could it have made a good stand-alone film? Absolutely not. You would be bored and potentially confused if you watched this before watching My Neighbor Totoro. Just watch it if you wanna feel nostalgic about Totoro.PS: You can torrent the camrip off of Bakabt. The one on Bakabt has fantastic audio and it is subbed. I have no idea whether My Anime List gets angry if you talk about torrents in your reviews, but oh well. sister, Mei, meets the child of the Catbus, and they do a little bit of exploring.

However this was a special anime aired at the studio ghibli museum for a limited amount of time and ive herd from alot of people that its hard to find but i think its worth it.i hope this review helped ^_^ and the creativeness like in my neighbour totoro just amazed me how they used the art to portray certain events.thirdly the sound did lack in some areas in my opinion in certain areas in the film i think it could have been more dramatic making a more deeper climax but i think that the art made up for this and balanced it out.In this short anime spin off the characters had lovely bonds carrying on from its parent anime and i also think this spin off helps the audience gain more understanding in this bond beetween making my neighbour totoro also seem more understood.as you can probley gather i really enjoyed this anime i would really recommend it if you love anime with nice art qualities,a fan of studio ghibli and if you liked the parent anime my neighbour totoro.

It's almost as Miyazaki is evening the odds for all kinds of fans of the movie.The story at hand could slide anywhere midst of the movie's plot of sometime afterward, as Mei goes about a story of her own in the mystical world of  Totoro and friends. As she follows the dust bunnies around, she seems more and more from what the invisible world...around her is like, meeting new friends and making more bonds.The whole thing wasn't any big on dialogue, almost stands as a musical short side movie of Tonari no Totoro. around her is like, meeting new friends and making more bonds.The whole thing wasn't any big on dialogue, almost stands as a musical short side movie of Tonari no Totoro."", 'The only LEGAL way to watch this sequel is to visit the Ghibli museum in Japan and hope that they\'re showing it while you\'re there. However, like generations before, you can find bootleg in theatre footage of this movie and watch it the cheap way. Obviously, you\'re missing out on a lot of what would make this experience special, but you can still understand what this would feel like to watch in person.Like all Ghibli movies the art and sound is very good. The characters and story are cute, but considering the length of the film there\'s not much that could be done with them...in less than 15 minutes. What this really is is for people who watched My Neighbor Totoro and said ""I want a little bit more cuteness from this story"" and that\'s exactly what you get.

Mi Yu Xingzhe,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37175/Mi_Yu_Xingzhe,"[""Overall: 6I would first like to point out the inaccuracy of Maikocchi. There is an attempted rape scene that gets stopped and never attempted up again as well as what looks like a fan service character who has the only 10 seconds of fan service in the entire show. That's two instances totaling two minutes across 240 minutes of content, this show is not perverted.The season ends on a major cliffhanger as if they planned on 16 episodes, ran out of budget, and just extended the scene they were working on to end at 12 episodes. The show also doesn't really get going until...episode five or so since they flesh out each additional member as they arrive. If they edited the first two or three episodes down into one and actually gave the season an ending, I'd have rated the show a seven or eight.Story: 7The story starts with two people in a death trap. It then turns out they're on an island and they find more and more people on said island. The story continues as these people go through the island and encounter various types of ways to be killed. It's kinda like a survival version of the Saw series in that way.Characters: 7The show gets a decently sized cast of diverse people. They look stereotypical, but I found that each one had good reactions; they had legitimate thoughts and acted for a reason, not for their character's type. For instance, they have an American blonde bombshell in a tank top. Instead of being there for fan service, she is an expert marksman and a cop. In fact, her character could have just as easily been drawn as a middle aged man.Art and Sound: 6I'm not particular about these, so I'm just going to rate them fair for unremarkable and move on. episode five or so since they flesh out each additional member as they arrive.

I am legitimately surprised at how much I enjoy this and even urge others to give it a watch. However, there is only one big trope so far that kind of irks me and has ruined my enjoyment in early episodes which is the MC having amnesia.The MC having amnesia is a lot more irksome when you realize they made the MC a likeable bad ass character and took him away before the first even ends....That first episode is the first time you see him actively being bad ass for quite some time. Even so, I actually still like him.Now onto some smaller things about this anime that people may find bothersome for whatever reason.Yeah, It's in Chinese. I see a lot of people complain about that and I personally don't get it. Not a big deal to me but whatever I guess I'll put that out there.The animation. The animation is pretty mediocre but it does not deviate from the story at all and I have no problem with it. It's basically what anime was like in the early 2000's.Now onto the enjoyable things.Unlike most survival anime the characters here are not just expandable objects for the author to kill off at will in order to try and build up some false tension or a plot device used to help the MCs out at will. In fact, they actually get some decent backstory and they even end up as lovable side characters even when they do some less than lovable things, even hateable things actually. In fact, for such a large cast of characters, I'm surprised I don't hate at least one of them. They all are actually interesting despite some of them not having much backstory to them or even little to no backstory at all (so far).I want to touch on something I've seen people mention about this anime so far that is related to the first two episodes or so, no this is not a BTOOM! rip off. The survival island cliche is an age-old premise. Ever read And Then There Were None? The anime has more in common with that than it does BTOOM! but it's still not comparable in the least.I really see no reason not to watch this anime, definitely give it a try! It's a decent mystery anime as well as a decent thriller, I know that may not sound like a great compliment or anything but I don't want to oversell it and get peoples hopes up for some sort of Detective Conan or Death Note level mystery/thriller kinda deal. Unless they manage to mess this up I expect this review to be relevant up to the last episode. With the surprises they've thrown me so far I might even have to come back just to praise it moreEDIT: So I just finished this anime. And wow. Just wow. I honestly did not expect such a great anime from this. I honestly went into this expecting the most cliched low budget anime that exists solely to advertise the webtoon and boy was I wrong.

How hard does it rock?IF YOU LOVE BTOOOM, YOU WILL LOVE UNCHARTED WALKER !!! THROW NAIVETY OUT (or be betrayed and killed) AND GET INTO THE SUSPENSE !!!!!!! (real pain and horrors of survival)People who speak Cantonese, or from Hong Kong, you will love it even more cause He Zhiyang is a gangster from Hong Kong and speaks pretty good broken Cantonese, you\'ll actually understand ‰ªÜË°ó and stuff! It‚Äôs funny and cool!Plot, character, and action are...top notch! There are Native American Savages attack in the donghua too !!!My favorite characters include Ning Yuan, Su Jin, He Zhiyang, Andrei (most favorite), Mr. Ding, Mr. Ou, Mr. Ishigaki, and the Professor.If you like to read into characters in survival, they‚Äôll be tested very well. You gonna love them.I guess I should warn there is 1 attempted rape scene in Episode 2 by He Zhiyang on Su Jing stopped by Ning Yuan, but it was not any objectionable content just shoved in. He was being a gangster at the time, but He becomes such a bro later with Ning, I quote""I don\'t have any objection to this voting result, But anyone want to harm my brother, will have to walk over my dead body!"" (flicks out knife)Throughout the donghua, the group of survivors try to survive and save each other as a group, but when it comes down to it, everything rests ultimately on who will take the fall.Ning Yuan who is a good guy himself, at a moment of peril almost wanted to kick Mr. Ding off from dragging on to his leg to save himself. The same good person could still make selfish decisions based on life or death and the instinct to survive.He Zhiyang the bad guy gangster, ironically is the exception after Ning Yuan had previously saved his life by risking his own. In his gangster bit of sworn friendship, he would really protect and give his life for Ning Yuan.Twists and turns that continue to be interesting.I love the opening, (must hear the full version) ULTRA BADASS !!!!! Episode 9 also has a Cantonese version of the opening sang by He Zhiyang XD Ending song is good too, gives a nice contrasting happy feel compared to the donghua!The rad Episode 10 special ending song that tells the whole exciting summary was like damnnnnnnnnn XDSharing my experience, MY best enjoyment was watching in this order EPISODE 1-7 (stopping point) IN 1 RUN, then EPISODE 8-12. Or else you can\'t stop thinking to marathon.If you want to watch GOOD CHINESE ANIME, watch Mi Yu Xing Zhe/Uncharted Walker. I originally saw it from Guodong Sub‚Äôs youtube channel who fansubbed it (Chinese Dub with English Subs) before they were taken down. Luckily, donghua became more mainstream now and it is on gogoanime or still around on youtube, thank you Guodong Subs !!!SEASON 2 SO THE STORY CAN CONTINUE !!!!!!!! top notch!

Though it overall just felt unrefined.To start off, a lot of scenes were unnecessary or waste of potential. They really could\'ve made it simplier for themselves by taking out scenes that won\'t be continued or talked about later on. I just ended up wanted to edit this series like a youtube video, if you know what I mean. When you start rambling about stuff that doesn\'t actually matter, but you get distracted. That\'s the type of feel I got from it.Don\'t get me wrong,...the story is cool and all. It would just be way cooler and better, if it wasn\'t so messy.There was a, let\'s say, vulgar scene and it felt all too natural between the two involved. He gets a sort of ""punishment"" later, but that gets fixed by the victim?? There\'s also this backstory of the victim that I really don\'t get it. That backstory was all too long and unnecessary for an excuse not to trust the mc, but that only got used once?The art style is an average chinese anime. Like I don\'t really know why, but all chinese animes has the same style. At least those I have watched, like King\'s Avatar has a similar style.Really nothing much to comment about, just a average anime style I guess.I really don\'t remember soundeffects and the opening song/ending song. It wasn\'t all that memoriable. I do admit that I listened a little to the ending song everytime though. It amuses me to see survivor anime characters play in a band in the ending song, yk?I could honestly go on and on about the individual characters, but I\'ll do a brief overall view. Mostly because I really don\'t remember the names of any of them, didn\'t stick with me.To say the least, the characters are flawed. I feel like some of their actions were just to prove a point in the characters backstory. Though I will say that I hate none of the characters, which is rare when it comes to survivor animes. Some characters were annoying, but let\'s say they were taken care of.Overall it\'s an anime that\'s not finished. It\'s one you binge watch and in the end wishing there was an end. One you\'ll probably won\'t remeber watching the next week. A year from watching it you could watch it again and feel as if you recognize it. That kinda anime, yk?I would say, give it a try. the story is cool and all.

Not the best art, definitely not the best sound (There are a lot of times where the sound changes in volume or sound effects just cut out/end suddenly when realistically they shouldnt), the sound is honestly pretty poor but the theme and story makes up for these shortcomings.Sadly though, it ends on a big cliffhanger and I doubt they will ever pick it up again.A quick google search found me a translated manga but even that isn't finished and the last upload was on 01/03/2021 and even then it's only enough content for...1 episode, maybe less. The website the translators had listed doesn't exist either.From my understanding after a quick google, there's about 700 chapters and no one has translated past chapter 187.

Mushibugyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17505/Mushibugyou,"[""So what do you do when insects come knock at your door? Well, normally you'd call the pest control. But here's the problem. These are not your ordinary insects. In fact, these are the type that will tear you apart and eat you alive. It takes more much than the pest control. Luckily, you can call upon a more reliant force known as the City Patrol, an elite unit of insect exterminators who are specialists in dealing with those pesky creatures.As one of the lesser known series from the 2013 Spring lineup, Mushibugyou might of slipped under some people's radar. In fact, I wasn't...aware of this show until a friend told me about it. No, it's not because I hate bugs. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people hates them in real life as well but this series fits within more of the 'underrated category. Anyways, it is adapted based off the manga known as Joujuu Senjin!! Mushibugyou. (take note that it is adapted from the alternate version of the Mushibugyou manga). Otherwise, the series stars Jinbei Tsukishima, a young man who becomes a new recruit of the City Patrol. The boy is inexperienced but joins the unit to honor his family and protect the people.The series takes place in an alternate Feudal Era Japan setting. Thus, expect some of the architectures' designs to look like some of the more traditional style of Japanese culture. The country in which the series takes place at is simple though with no complex technology. Rather, there is a system where people tries to follow to maintain order. But then of course, that order is disturbed thanks to these monsters known as the Mushi, the giant insects as well as the antagonists of the series. They disturb peace and causes destruction. Now, who you gotta call? The Ghostbust- I mean, City Patrol.I'm not a big fan of historical theme series but there's something about Mushibugyou that seems to have more interest than meets the eye. The first few episodes aren't very impressive though so patience is required in order to progress through the series. In fact, we meet the members of the Mushi Magistrate City Patrol. Its members are specialists and quite diverse in terms of their appearances, abilities, and personalities. Jinebi is the most cheerful of the group with his personality. Despite being the weakest member of the team, he makes it up with his heroic efforts to protect the people as well as determination. On a complete different scale, there's Mugai, a mysterious individual whose skill is almost unrivaled in the team. In terms of skills, they are worlds apart and it's fun to see how they balance out during battles.The other members of the City Patrol consists of the tough guy (Shungiku Koikawa), action girl (Hibachi), and and shy boy (Tenma Ichinotani). All of their skills complicates the team's efforts in some way or form despite their conflicting philosophies. These often result in hilarious belittling of each other to a point of almost absurdity. Speaking of that, there's some absurdity in this show besides the repetitive arguments. I'm talking about the insects involved as they seem to attack humans out of nowhere for little to no reason. Then, there are some of the character designs like Mugai's hair style. Some other forms of absurdity involves the deus ex machina scenarios involving our hero Jinebi when he pulls out a victory from nowhere.As for the show itself goes, it balances between seriousness and comedy. The seriousness part comes from the Mushi as they truly are bloodthirsty for destruction. In fact, there is actual deaths involved in this show and some moments are even graphic with no censorship. The fact that the Mushi wants humans as food (or more like for dead) is a reality in this series. Make no mistake as the bodies do pile up especially in later episodes when some of the stronger Mushi are introduced. Jinebi also takes his work seriously as he trains hard to honor his family. His determination is unrivaled in his team and often strives to protect those who cares around him. There's also some back-stories involving the supporting characters that shows why they are members of the City Patrol that are spawned from tragic stories. For comedy, there's the frequent actions from Jinebi that usually results in some sort of undesired result at first. This typically starts in the beginning in the show due to his lack of experience as well as some of his lack in common sense. Then, there's the fan service. There's fan service more than just the blood and gore. Thanks to a particular fan service girl (Haru), there's skin showing and cameras fixed on angles that are lascivious. In fact, Haru seems to be the kind of girl in this show that serves little to no purpose beyond the fan service as she has no skill to fight against the Mushi or brains to formulate plans for attack. Instead, she has to rely on her knight in shining armor (Jinbei) to save the day. But of course, Jinbei always gets some sort of reward from her in the form of a 'thanks' or sometimes more...The plot originally follows more of a the 'monster of the week' format but later transits into a more complex story. In the center of that story is Jinebi and another mysterious girl known as Kuroageha, the Insect Magistrate. She represents a more mysterious side to the overall series with her gifted powers behind that noticeable white silky hair. There's also dangerous foes later on (including an organization) that really takes the action and plot to the cake. If you survived the slow pace of the first few episodes, then this show might not be disappointing for you at all.As for the Mushi, their designs gives off a dangerous vibe along with their behavior. Most of them are modified after real life insects such as mantis, stag beetles, dragonfly, etc with abilities that matches their rights. Some of them do looks more silly than they should be though with their enormous heads and some of their humanoid/hybrid designs. There's also plenty of action of course! It generally involves the struggling conflict between the Mushi and the City Patrol. There's bloody spilled and heads falling off here and there. The movements and fights are generally fast paced with quick successions. Among other factors, Mushibugyou also has some potential romance development later on. The problem here is that Jinbei is way too dense to notice it. In terms of the romance, the show only gives signs and teases. Thus, don't expect some form of love story as this would be the wrong show to watch.Overall designs for the characters are fine that shows why they are part of the City Patrol. The Edo like feeling is obviously there with the architectures and village like settings. Then, there are the dangerous insects that shows why they are enemies of humanity. The fan service might be more than meets the eye but even ignoring that aspect doesn't make this series' artwork outstanding.The soundtrack of the show is noticeable but nothing earth shattering. There's the action scenarios, the comedy tones, and then some more of the emotional parts accompanied by soft paced music. Most of the VA plays their roles well. In particular, Jinbei's VA (KEEN) has that tone of determination coming from his voice whenever he wants to protect someone. There are two different OP and ED songs and both of them fits within the theme of the show with the Edo-like atmosphere.All in all, Mushibugyou is a show that is underrated but can be worth a watch if you have some patience. What I mean by that is getting through some of the introductory episodes and then later on to the main plot. I mean, the show is dominated by man eating insects as the enemies. I'm sure most of us hates insects in some way or form. There's also fan service so be prepared for some gratuitous camera angles and bloody gore. The show is more intimating than meets the eye though so once it gets to the main dish, it can be a somewhat enjoyable ride. Just don't forget to fasten the seat-belt unless you want to become insect food. aware of this show until a friend told me about it. No, it's not because I hate bugs.

Just don't forget to fasten the seat-belt unless you want to become insect food."", ""This is my first review so don't be too harsh.Edited as of 10/1 upon completion of the series.Mushibugyou is your typical shounen really, but It has a few stylish and interesting choices for subject matter, that being insects. At first it's treated quite like a monster of the week affair. Similar to the very beginning of bleach. However as things go on stuff gets more interesting. Characters develop, romance develops, and Arcs unfold. I'm gonna be honest there isn't much original here, however there isn't much original about most shounen. It's all about how well it's executed when it comes to shounen's story. In this...regard I believe Mushibugyou was executed well, but not as good as others like Hunter x Hunter or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. So, is the story good? Yes. Is it a legendary tale passed down from the shounen gods? Nope. 7.5/10 for the story.The characters overall aren't really all that special. That is at first, everything becomes alot better as time goes on characters included.  Character development is actually rather robust for mainstream shounen. When I first thought about it  the characters weren't all that original at all until later on. Most mainstream shounen (Bleach, One Piece, Naruto) nowadays have very little romance or none at all. I don't view that as a bad thing. Everything has its time and place including love stories. Although, It is nice that Mushibugyou took it back to the days of old when shounens had a nice bit of love and romance. Every character progresses in their own way and it has some love on the side which gets it an extra nod from me. Overall, 7/10 for the characters.The art and sound really are just as good as anything else that's come out recently. Nothing really to say, It meets the industry standard of good looking and good sounding anime. It is of note that both of its openings were quite enjoyable artistically and musically. 7/10 for both art and sound. Would have probably been a 6 for sound, but those openings really saved it's soundtrack.My overall enjoyment of this anime is really the saving grace to it all. There is something fun about seeing how all the bug slaying will turn out. How the Insect Magistrate's Office will handle giant bugs or a new arc of differing enemies. It seems to also stay fresh with a revolving door of characters working with Jinbei. Everything moves fast and stays fresh with it never seeming like time was wasted unnecessarily. I think its quick development at first can also be attributed to the way it works in a monster of the week fashion. I always feel like I'm having fun when watching Mushibugyou, in a way similar to the same type of feeling I get when I watch Starship Troopers or Godzilla movies. 8/10 for enjoyment. It simply put is pure hearted fun for me.In conclusion I give this anime a 7.75/10 with the score being rounded to 8 due to lack of decimals in MyAnimeList's rating system. If you are looking for fun watch this anime. I hope my anime review helped anyone who read it. regard I believe Mushibugyou was executed well, but not as good as others like Hunter x Hunter or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. So, is the story good?

I hope my anime review helped anyone who read it."", ""This anime's strength is in it's simplicity, not in it's complexity.So for everyone who is looking for a mind-boggling sophisticated psychological thriller, this anime is not for you. The anime this is for is just for children, for one, due to it's oversimplified nature, and secondly it is for those who are willing to watch the non-mainstream anime. But arguably due to all the gorey bits, it's probably suited towards the mature audiences. But nevertheless it's very simple even a child could understand.If the first episode doesn't deter you from watching the anime, then that's basically what you get. The first episode clearly sets...the scene for the anime, and how it's probably going to go.Sounds, Art, Story, Character is probably all below 5 in all honesty.For one the story seems to advance too quickly for the supposedly 26 episode anime, and the first arc of the series seemed to be the final arc of the series. In bleach terms (I know I'm using these a bit), it'll be the soulbringer arc.Art, the art is different, it seems more crude and relies heavily on thick brushes rather than fine lines that are often depicted other shounen.The only thing this anime has going for it is the action. Action is one of the central themes of the anime as the MC, though weak in comparison to his comrades, struggles anyway to protect them with all his might. However, the anime takes a strange twist on in the later episodes, where the plot development becomes unrealistic to the previous episodes. Such a development could be described as ichigo becoming a soul reaper and then 3 episodes later, learns banaki. It's quite unrealistic. But this isn't to the anime's disadvantage. It's quite entertaining to watch even with such a strange turn of events. They probably didn't want the main character to stay weak forever.But in all honesty, I really enjoyed the anime, even though it wasn't the best anime possible, out of all the other animes, it seemed nostalgic in ways that all the current animes do not have. This is probably due to the fact that the main themes of the anime is protecting others with all your heart, regardless of your situation. So thus for enjoyment I give it 10/10.And after careful consideration, and (not) taking the average. I found the anime to be a good 7/10.If you've read this far, as always, thank you for reading! the scene for the anime, and how it's probably going to go.Sounds, Art, Story, Character is probably all below 5 in all honesty.For one the story seems to advance too quickly for the supposedly 26 episode anime, and the first arc of the series seemed to be the final arc of the series.

However, the anime takes a strange twist on in the later episodes, where the plot development becomes unrealistic to the previous episodes. Such a development could be described as ichigo becoming a soul reaper and then 3 episodes later, learns banaki. It's quite unrealistic. But this isn't to the anime's disadvantage. It's quite entertaining to watch even with such a strange turn of events. They probably didn't want the main character to stay weak forever.But in all honesty, I really enjoyed the anime, even though it wasn't the best anime possible, out of all the other animes, it seemed nostalgic in ways that all the current animes do not have. This is probably due to the fact that the main themes of the anime is protecting others with all your heart, regardless of your situation. So thus for enjoyment I give it 10/10.And after careful consideration, and (not) taking the average. I found the anime to be a good 7/10.If you've read this far, as always, thank you for reading!"", 'I first saw Mushibugyou as a manga, and since i love martial arts shonen mangas, i gave it shot. I dropped it after a few chapters because the main idea was just too boring. When i saw it became an anime i decided to try it again, because i thougth the animation could draw out whatever potential it had. Yet again i was wrong.The show is basicaly all the shonen cliches brougth together. The main character who wants to protect his friends, the strong guy with the dark past,the big brest stupid girl whose only role is to get in danger so the cast can...save her. Seen it before and it\'s simply not worth it.The story is unexisted. An organisation who figths off giant insects.It could not get any duller than this.I know, it is hard to imagine and write an original idea, but please mangaka, if you do not have anyhing interesting, don\'t bother to write about the first thing that popped in your head, it is like an insult to the manga/anime community.Again, the cliches is here, the dark organisation who figths the good one, the lame backround for the characters, the bonding between them and etcThe most annoying thing are the characters. They have no personality, no originality and no interest. After 5 chapters of the manga and 8 episodes, i barely remember one, Jimbey, and that is only because that is a name we know and love FROM ONE PIECE.The only decent thing about it is the animation,but that is impossibe for me to enjoy because everything else simply annoy me too much. Nice lines(way better than in manga)and generaly a good work, that is wasted on this ""plot"" and ""characters""Seriously, i could watch only the first 2 minutes of every episode and i would stil be able to predict accurately everything.Long story short,why bother with this anime?I do not know,way too much free time?But then again, you could watch shingeki no kyojin on rerun. save her.

Well, I was somewhat right or completely correct.Story-6/10The story follows our young protagonist Tsukishima, Jinbei who has just left his home. After some events he ends up joining the Mushibugyou, a group of people who fight giant bugs. Although it doesn't seem very interesting at first, as the story unfolds a bit we get a slight idea to how the giant bugs came to be and to who the head of the Mushibugyou really is.Art- 7/10Nothing to spectacular here. The...art matches the overall atmosphere of the show and stays consistent throughout the anime from what I can see.Sound- 8/10The sound fits the anime well from what I can remember and the first OP and ED were decent. The second OP and ED were what really caught my ear, the second OP was fun and matched the show very well, while the second ED had a more serious tone to it with good visuals to boot.Character- 7/10This is where some people may be skeptical. The characters don't seem like anything special, especially the protagonist Jinbei. The other characters are; Hibachi the ninja/tsundere who uses explosives, Tenma the onmyouji with his two shikigami, Shungiku the samurai/criminal who uses swords, and Mugai the strongest member of the group. I'm only going to talk in detail about Jinbei and Princess NaaJinbei the new member in the group. Although he seems generic and boring, he is one of the reasons as to why I liked this anime. Even though he's not very strong he makes up for that with enthusiasm and his undying will to fight for what he believes is right. He is very respectful of everyone usually adding the honorific -dono to their names. His interaction with the main cast is entertaining to watch and feels natural.(Some Spoilers Ahead)Princess Naa also known as the insect Magistrate is the head of the unit. Not much is known about her at the start. She starts out practically emotionless and meets our protagonist at the start of summer, where she is seen just standing around looking up at the sky waiting for the fireworks to start. Despite her past, she starts to show more emotion as she interacts with Jinbei and later realizes she has developed feelings for Jinbei.Enjoyment- 9/10The show was always entertaining to watch even though the start was slow. It never felt like a chore and I was always exited for the next episode.Overall- 8/10I feel like Mushibugyou is a somewhat underrated anime but if you're looking for a casual/happy anime Mushibugyou is a great choice!-Note there are some gory parts. art matches the overall atmosphere of the show and stays consistent throughout the anime from what I can see.Sound- 8/10The sound fits the anime well from what I can remember and the first OP and ED were decent.

Mushibugyou is an anime that is not meant to awaken some deep and thoughtful side of the audience, instead entertaining with uncommonly plotted story, fairly well animated fighting scenes and funny, but superficial characters. The strenght of this anime is more of a simple and comical nature. One cannot expect wonders when it comes to the concept of Mushibugyou as a whole, seeing as it is most likely to be meant for the kind of...audience that seeks quickly unravelling events, a light story and a good portion of comic relief.As for the components, each and every one of them has its good and bad side. This anime, like all others, is not a flawless one, but here is an evaluation of every aspect and element that composes the basics of an anime.The whole plot is not something exceptional or too extraordinary. The concept of fighting monsterous creatures to save people is well-known and widely spread amongst the animes of the likely genres. What positive and different can be found in this particular piece is, however, the way they managed to recreate the spirit of old Japan. It cannot be stated that it is close to being accurate, naturally, due to the fact that it is all too shallow and innocent, but what can be noticed throughout the whole series is some strangely pleasant sense of being really drawn into the world that the anime is trying to present, no matter how ridiculous this may sound. The story moves forward quite fast and is not burdened with unnecessery complications and annoyingly long speeches or flashbacks. It is all reduced to the recommended for every action-packed anime minimum. The plot developement is very dynamic, which is also a good thing considering the corresponding genre. In the end, all said and done, the story has its flaws, but for a typical shounen, it can be classified as satisfying.The art is simply too rough and at some points - even uncomely. The characters are drawn in a childish manner and the hairstyles are just ridiculous. That is however one of the unique things about this anime and may be considered as a positive feature by many. It cannot be denied that a unique art, no matter what it looks like, marks the anime as something that is one of a kind and helps the audience sink into its world faster and easier. Overall, this particular art is a disputable topic that mostly depends on each and every person's own opinion.The sound effects, the songs and the acting skills of the voice actors are a great match for this type of anime and its purposes. The first opening theme may have sounded a little bit too ear-teasing, but that's to be expected from an action series. The soundtrack follows the steps of original Japanese culture sounds, which is the highlight of this section. An amazing selection of perfectly matching traditional music completes every single scene and brings out emotion and sensuality to every frame. The sound is most probably the component most sophisticatedly done in this anime.The characters are colourful and funny, but on a sad note - too chlich√© and too innocently superficial. Of course, one could say -  that's to be expected from an anime that focuses on entertainment through super-power fights and action. But really, a significant part of the audience has grown tired of simple and poorly developed characters in exchange for good action. Why not just mix them up both for a change? Who knows, maybe something good could be born. But back to the topic, the characters have their positive traits as well. They are all unique in their own way, and there is a huge conrast and variety between different personalities and appearances. They are all bright and funny, each of them is developed in a way that at some point to be able to provide some comic relief. Slightly overdone and exaggerated reactions, but let's not forget the fact that this is an animation that has, above everything else, the purpose to entertain.Overall, the enjoyment that one can squeeze out of this anime differs from person to person. As I am left with no other choice, I will simply share my thoughts on the subject. I am having a really nice time with this anime, it is so light and ought to improve your mood in an instant. That, combined with the factor of some really well directed fighting scenes and charming in a very dumb way protagonist, brings me immense joy every time I sit back and play the latest episode of Mushibugyou.This is an anime that I wouldn't recommend to everybody, since it has, let's put it this way, a selective audience. It will be liked by those who don't search for something significant and life changing, but instead seek enjoyment in the simple things. It is a great choice when you're in a need to lift your spirits and will always make you laugh, as long as you let its humor reach you.As a conclusion, you will enjoy this anime, as long as you let it make you enjoy it. audience that seeks quickly unravelling events, a light story and a good portion of comic relief.As for the components, each and every one of them has its good and bad side.

In the Insect Magistrate\'s office, their only duty is to protect the peace in Edo from the monstrous insects. When Jinbei got to be one of the members of the office, he met his new teammates namely Mugai, Hibachi, Tenma Ichinotani, and Shungiku Koikawa. But the problem is that, all of his teammates believed that he will quit in less than 3 days and he was too weak to fight the insects.Story (9/10):Mushibugyou was one of the rare...action animes that the MC was not that too powerful and too weak either. The anime\'s story lets the MC, Jinbei Tsukishima, too grow more powerful and wiser as the series progress. The comedy and the fanservice, ""the plots"", are not too excessive that may cause a downhill and a sort of a bland taste that leave in the audience\'s eyes. It also shows how beautiful human relationships are. The transition between the arcs was clean and well-thought that avoided some confusion.Characters (8/10):1. Jinbei Tsukishima: Jinbei Tsukishima acted as a human pillar of goodness and hope. Throughout the anime, his goodness towards other people, whether foe or ally, doesn\'t change a single bit but it became stronger as he met more people,with different perspectives and experiences, as a member of the Insect Magistrate\'s office.His goodness was first shown when he saved Oharu from getting eaten by an insect. Oharu told him about her parents\' horrible death in the hands of the insects and lost hope in living as being eaten was always an everyday activity in Edo; but he gave her hope by promising her that he will do his very best to protect her and Edo from the insect. Later on, with Hibachi, he encouraged and shared sentiments towards Mugai. He helped Tenma to overcome his fears. He admired and strongly believed in Shunguki. His strong determination and will touched Mugai which lead Mugai to open his heart on Jinbei. His promise of seeing the skies in Edo with the Insect Magistrate or Princess Naa. And it made his teammates to accept him and to believe in him as one of them. These things were only some of his goodness list which changed lives for the better.His iron determination, will, and persistent were also one of his good points. Because of these characteristics, he gave hope to his teammates to overcome the struggles in battle and to have strength that can kill their enemies. Although the foe was not in his league, for example Yukimura Sanada, he didn\'t lose hope and continued to battle although his body was not in fighting shape. That\'s because he didn\'t waver on his philosophy that to win every battles until he died. He also obsessed about being stronger since he didn\'t want to burden his teammates and didn\'t want to experiece the humilation that he can\'t protect anyone on his power. It was also to become an aide for his teammates.2. Mugai:In the case of Mugai, since he\'s rarely shown in the anime, he didn\'t have that much character development compared to others; but his character still plays an important role. Him, being strong and powerful, became Jinbei\'s goal towards an ideal swordman that can erase people\'s fear; that honed Jinbei\'s skills as a samurai and leave a bigger room of development for Jinbei.Although in the anime, his past was shown, it was somehow a little bit lacking in explanation in some parts; like on his reason why he left a criminal group. But he still did show a little development in the anime.3. Hibachi:Hibachi is the tsundere of the anime. She punched and kicked Jinbei for being a so-called pervert and for whatever reasons. She became Jinbei\'s first friend in the Insect Magistrate when they both shared admiration for Mugai. As a fellow member, she believed on Jinbei which gave him support. Her character development wasn\'t that impressive but still worth praising for; for when she became stronger ninja and changed her opnions of Jinbei.4. Tenma Ichinotani:Tenma Ichinotani was the character who showed a great character development throughout of the anime. From being a cry-baby to being a strong, noble, and dependable onmyoji. He\'s very likable character since it was like watching a baby to grow up as a good adult. His love for his parents stayed true and his friendship with Jinbei and the others became stronger.5. Shungiku Koikawa:Just like Hibachi, Shungiku Koikawa doesn\'t have that much character development. But Koikawa has this misleading image of him. He\'s a badass samurai who had a clean cut in everything he cuts but he\'s also a drunkard. But I never thought that he\'s also quite fair in fights, for a murder, when he didn\'t strike Mugai when Mugai threw his longsword to the ground, and a little bit a mature and responsible adult, for a drunkard, when he\'s aiding his teammates in battle.Overall (8/10):The anime let it\'s characters to grow and to have a meaningful development. It\'s quite rare, these days, to find an anime which all of its characters are growing together; not the typical anime in which the main character is only the one who\'s getting stronger. The story is not confusing and not too predicatble. But the only downside of this anime is that it doesn\'t have a second season. action animes that the MC was not that too powerful and too weak either.

In this alternate world, humans are not the beings at the top of the food chain. Instead, that position is held by giant man eating insects. Being not only uplifting but enjoyable to watch, the show manages to captivate and hold its audience in thrall. Though admittedly not at spectacular as the other 2013 Spring releases, Mushibugyou is simply too fun to simply pass by.[POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW: I have refrained from spoilers as much as possible. Read at your own risk.]Story...& SettingThe story revolves around the story of Tsukishima Jinbei and his friends as he joins the Mushibugyou, a group of shogun appointed specialists who combat and fight the insects to the best of their ability. Two major arcs are in the story, the first being in Edo and the second being in Kishuu. As expected from a Shounen Action anime, the greatest focus of the anime is the combat which in itself was done spectacularly, though the usage of Deux Ex Machina is plainly obvious at times. Though the story itself isn\'t spectacular, it certainly is not the bane of the anime, possessing a straight forward plot which is easy to follow and yet more unpredictable than expected.When I first started watching this anime, I was captivated by the first few episodes and found myself unable to stop watching. Though the most of episodes did not end in cliffhangers or anything even close to that sort, I found myself craving for more after each and every episode. To top that off, both the action as well as the absolutely hilarious parts managed to very effectively uplift my spirits and help me enjoy my day even more. Though lacking any deep meaning in both plot and actions of characters, or perhaps due to that, Mushibugyou remains a definite must watch for anyone looking for a casual and most importantly, fun anime.AnimationThe animation is done very well through the anime. In particular, the action sequences are constructed artfully. Being a Shounen Action genre anime, I was anticipating fantastic action and fight scenes through the whole show. It did not disappoint. Each sequence put together with elaborate detail, almost as if it was a carefully choreographed dance. Though the other parts were also done very well however, there was no extra ""WOW"" effect to it. Impressive, but not to the point where the animation alone can blow one away. This could also be considered to be a good point to some though, as it as not overwhelming to the point where it would make you lose focus on what the anime intends to do.SoundAs a whole, the sound effects are done very well through the anime, in particular during the action scenes. The sound effects set the scene very well while remaining only in the background and not overwhelming your senses. Aside from that though, there is no real change in the sound effects used, following a strict genre along the lines of hyping up the audience during the fights. All in all, music and sound was effectively used to a limited extent but managed to fulfill its task splendidly all the same.CharactersThe characters are the key to the anime aside from the action. Possessing some very unique characters in both character design and traits, the anime blends them together and mixes them up to create absolutely hilarious results. Putting the supporting characters aside, the main characters all have at least one recurring theme behind them which can be seen very clearly through the whole show. In particular, the running gags of certain individual characters or the interactions between several are particularly funny and enjoyable to watch.Character design wise, it could hardly be more unique. With almost every single character possessing completely different traits and looking so different. Naturally, this would apply to all of the insect characters but the anime also managed to do this successfully with the main characters too. Creating a very interesting array of characters with even more unique personalities to them. However, one issue I do have with this is that some traits are not elaborated and leave slight questions in my mind. This also stems from the ultimately incomplete relationships which seemed to be headed in one direction but ultimately are not completed. Though even so, the effort put into designing and creating the characters can hardly be considered to be sloppy, but rather, was done just a few steps short of perfection.OverallTo conclude, Mushibugyou adds a very interesting take to the Alternate History genre. Possessing a very unique, though straightforward, story and characters even more so, this anime is one which was extremely enjoyable to watch. A slightly obscure anime which for no reason what-so-ever should be ignored without trying it out. Once you taste the fun in it, you\'ll instantly find yourself craving for more![AFTERWORD: Thank you for taking time to read this review.

As expected from a Shounen Action anime, the greatest focus of the anime is the combat which in itself was done spectacularly, though the usage of Deux Ex Machina is plainly obvious at times. Though the story itself isn\'t spectacular, it certainly is not the bane of the anime, possessing a straight forward plot which is easy to follow and yet more unpredictable than expected.When I first started watching this anime, I was captivated by the first few episodes and found myself unable to stop watching. Though the most of episodes did not end in cliffhangers or anything even close to that sort, I found myself craving for more after each and every episode. To top that off, both the action as well as the absolutely hilarious parts managed to very effectively uplift my spirits and help me enjoy my day even more. Though lacking any deep meaning in both plot and actions of characters, or perhaps due to that, Mushibugyou remains a definite must watch for anyone looking for a casual and most importantly, fun anime.AnimationThe animation is done very well through the anime. In particular, the action sequences are constructed artfully. Being a Shounen Action genre anime, I was anticipating fantastic action and fight scenes through the whole show. It did not disappoint. Each sequence put together with elaborate detail, almost as if it was a carefully choreographed dance. Though the other parts were also done very well however, there was no extra ""WOW"" effect to it. Impressive, but not to the point where the animation alone can blow one away. This could also be considered to be a good point to some though, as it as not overwhelming to the point where it would make you lose focus on what the anime intends to do.SoundAs a whole, the sound effects are done very well through the anime, in particular during the action scenes. The sound effects set the scene very well while remaining only in the background and not overwhelming your senses. Aside from that though, there is no real change in the sound effects used, following a strict genre along the lines of hyping up the audience during the fights. All in all, music and sound was effectively used to a limited extent but managed to fulfill its task splendidly all the same.CharactersThe characters are the key to the anime aside from the action. Possessing some very unique characters in both character design and traits, the anime blends them together and mixes them up to create absolutely hilarious results. Putting the supporting characters aside, the main characters all have at least one recurring theme behind them which can be seen very clearly through the whole show. In particular, the running gags of certain individual characters or the interactions between several are particularly funny and enjoyable to watch.Character design wise, it could hardly be more unique. With almost every single character possessing completely different traits and looking so different. Naturally, this would apply to all of the insect characters but the anime also managed to do this successfully with the main characters too. Creating a very interesting array of characters with even more unique personalities to them. However, one issue I do have with this is that some traits are not elaborated and leave slight questions in my mind. This also stems from the ultimately incomplete relationships which seemed to be headed in one direction but ultimately are not completed. Though even so, the effort put into designing and creating the characters can hardly be considered to be sloppy, but rather, was done just a few steps short of perfection.OverallTo conclude, Mushibugyou adds a very interesting take to the Alternate History genre. Possessing a very unique, though straightforward, story and characters even more so, this anime is one which was extremely enjoyable to watch. A slightly obscure anime which for no reason what-so-ever should be ignored without trying it out. Once you taste the fun in it, you\'ll instantly find yourself craving for more![AFTERWORD: Thank you for taking time to read this review. Please do give any comments of which I could learn from and improve on for any reviews I might do in the future!]', 'When i first saw Mushibugyou it reminded of a combination of Fairy Tail and Katanagatari but the they fight against huge bugs. If you¬¥re a fan for story driven animes this might not be you¬¥re type although i really liked the characters wich hade each its unique background and fighting teqnique.None of the main characters plays plays a damsel in distress throughout the entire series and its filled with filled with enjoyable side stories and fighting sequences. Personally i enjoyod it very much although not as much as katanagatari or Fairy tale but if you¬¥re a fan of either of them or a fan of...the martial arts anime then you should give it a try. I wish you an enjoyable time and a good day! the martial arts anime then you should give it a try. I wish you an enjoyable time and a good day!', 'This anime was fun to watch and its not too serious. The characters are likable  with pretty good back stories and the story overall is a decent story it has some deep moments but it also has alot of light moments that keep the story from being too dark. I really enjoyed the light parts of the story because i had just finished a darker anime with a serious plot. I hope more people give it watch i would like to see other reviews. ', 'I find it always pleasant a story centered on the ""edo"" and samurai-like history, but the anime as it develops is losing charm in both plot and shonen\'s approach. I think it wastes the opportunity to give us a good leading group and develop it a little more since.I think that the protagonists of this series do not have a bad basis but not counting tsukishima the others stay a little behind in all aspects.In addition to the time of conflict and battles there are two great problems when it comes to watching this series:First is that there are times when the animation is not...even appreciated since in some battles with insects are pure images as if it were a manga what it was loses fluency to the anime and second is that the villains in this series are very uninteresting and are brought their appearances very quickly and fleetingly, there is really no battle to stand out.At no point did i feel that i could see a battle that the characters were actually at a crucial moment in the story (except for the death of a character). The insect hunters and the ten crucifix insects were not interesting enough to make the anime that was marked by these 2 groups of villains improved as the chapters progressed.In conclusion i think it was an anime that had a good protagonist but that did not develop with harmony like his companions and without a doubt the worst of this series were some battles and some villains that left much to be desired in desing and in the depth of their characters. It is not areally recommended anime but if you want to see the typical protagonist of shonen of good heart in his adventures by being a samurai you can see this anime although not with high expectations. even appreciated since in some battles with insects are pure images as if it were a manga what it was loses fluency to the anime and second is that the villains in this series are very uninteresting and are brought their appearances very quickly and fleetingly, there is really no battle to stand out.At no point did i feel that i could see a battle that the characters were actually at a crucial moment in the story (except for the death of a character).

To combat them an organization known as the Mushibugyo, meaning Insect Magistrate, was founded. This story particularly follows Jinbee, a samurai from far out in the country that comes to Edo in order to join the Mushibugyo. The first third or so of the anime is centered around Jinbee and the rest of the Mushibugyo simply dealing with the various insects that attack Edo. Each episode focuses on a single character, with Jinbee...and by extension the viewer learning more about them. The rest of the anime involves two extended arcs with more intricate plots focusing on fighting specific groups, though with a training arc episode and recap episode in between.Overall in this anime, there were only two character‚Äôs that felt well written and utilized. The rest of the main cast have solid introductions, but they don‚Äôt really develop much beyond that. There are moments here and there where they get their moments in the spotlight, but due to the long gaps between these moments, overall they weren‚Äôt fleshed out enough to really get invested in them. Some of them had interesting enough personalities to make them likable even without much depth to them, but in that case it felt somewhat disappointing they didn‚Äôt matter more. For example, Haru pops up quite often, especially early on, but she has no plot significance whatsoever.The first character that stood out as an exception is Jinbee, which I suppose shouldn‚Äôt be surprising considering he‚Äôs the protagonist. His personality is really fun in that he‚Äôs a complete moron that‚Äôs dense as a brick, but also really hard working and incredibly kind. The end result is that he‚Äôs just an incredibly good natured guy that sees the best in everyone to an absurd degree, and in doing so he manages to draw out other people‚Äôs best selves. He does have special powers that pop up from time to time under special conditions, but the majority of the fights he gets into, he wins simply due to the fact that he‚Äôs been training really hard and refuses to go down no matter what. It‚Äôs simple to the point of being stupid but it‚Äôs still really satisfying. Also, he‚Äôs hilarious.The other character that stood out as well written and utilized is the magistrate of the Mushibugyo. For the vast majority of the anime she‚Äôs referred to by her titles, and you don‚Äôt really learn her real name until the end and even afterwards no one calls her that. But she is by far the best written character in this anime and definitely the one with the most depth. She can pretty much single handedly carry the entire anime in this regard. She doesn‚Äôt even show up until episode seven, but after that she quickly becomes the main heroine as the plot seems to revolve almost entirely around her. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to sympathize with her and get invested in her character arc and her relationship with Jinbee, which makes it easy to get invested in the plot and anime overall. And ultimately, she and Jinbee are enough to make the anime overall pretty enjoyable. The anime ends with a lot left unresolved, but it stops at a pretty good point that I was satisfied with, though I‚Äôll definitely check out the manga eventually.The art was a mixed bag. I like the art style, but I don‚Äôt think I like the general design sense for the most part. I didn‚Äôt really love any of the character designs, but I really didn‚Äôt like a few, such as Mugai‚Äôs. I also hated the enemy designs for the most part, though with the focus on giant insects I suppose that was inevitable. Also, I know chonmage are historically accurate for samurai, but I‚Äôm still not much of a fan. The animation was pretty solid. Action wise, power ups and abilities in general weren‚Äôt fleshed out all that well, so the action felt pretty random and didn‚Äôt really have any depth, but it looked pretty cool. The first OP had a pretty cool art style so visually I found it pretty impressive, though the song was only okay. The second OP is more conventional visually but still pretty good and has a great song. The first ED was okay in terms of the visuals and song. I really liked the visuals and song on the second ED though. The soundtrack was also pretty solid and worked really well at times. and by extension the viewer learning more about them.

Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 1,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2472/Naruto__Shippuuden_Movie_1,"['Naruto Movie 4 is made specifically to cater to all the Naruto fans out there, just like what you‚Äôd expect from a naruto movie. So non-Naruto fans shouldn‚Äôt really expect to enjoy this, as much.The story this time round is about; a group of rogue ninjas who decided to revive a Demon spirit, which could destroy the world if reunited with its body. The only way to prevent this is for the shrine maiden (Shion) to go and reseal the demon, so Team 7 (Naruto, Sakura, Rock Lee & Neji) are tasked to protect her. Just like all the previous Naruto movies this one uses...the same formula; of them having to protect someone of great importance, getting to know said person and have intense battles along the way. But not only is the actual story somewhat interesting, but the underlying-plot about Shion able to predict people‚Äôs deaths helps spice things up a bit.As I‚Äôve stated earlier, the characters this time round are: Naruto, Sakura, Rock Lee & Neji. If you‚Äôve been watching Naruto Shippuuden then you‚Äôd know what to expect from them but like always Naruto is the main focus and he‚Äôs annoyingly stupid as usual until, later on. Like always it does do the whole Naruto relating himself to the main character thing but Shion proves to be a fairly in-depth character herself, so it can be forgiven. The bad guys this time are rather imaginative (drug users) but there‚Äôs no real reasoning given towards their actions.This being a movie, high production values are expected and that is exactly what is given. Fluidly animated action sequences, great lighting effects and interactive environments. However it‚Äôs easy to tell that some corners were cut in places; like the CG army and fire effects. The music is pretty awesome and matches the moods well but the soundtrack will give the feeling that you‚Äôve heard it before. But one thing no one has heard before is the hilarious ED theme.Overall this as a typical Naruto Movie that gives the initial feeling of all previous ones, however it‚Äôs able to provide a highly entertaining experience. My scoring may be somewhat biased, seeing how I am a Naruto fan, but this is truly an enjoyable movie to watch and probably the best Naruto Movie yet. But expect to see the usual cheesy ending... (this time it‚Äôs a Spirit Bomb).^_^ the same formula; of them having to protect someone of great importance, getting to know said person and have intense battles along the way.

(this time it‚Äôs a Spirit Bomb).^_^', ""Naruto fans, rejoice.  What Gekijouban Naruto Shippuuden offers is a healthy dose of your favorite Naruto recipe.  Of course, that also means it's nothing new or groundbreaking.  Simply put, if you like Naruto, then you'll probably like the movie.  If you're not particularly fond of the show, then don't expect too much.Story:  5The plot behind the movie is one that is highly unoriginal and rather rushed.  The story lacks much depth, and consists of the usual, ultimate evil threatens the world, Naruto &amp; co. get assigned to bodyguard work, they face other ninjas, almost face defeat, but then Naruto...always comes through and saves the day.  Or does he?  The very beginning of the film gives a preview (I don't consider this a SPOILER since it happens within the first two minutes of the movie) of Naruto's death, and subsequent funeral.  Ooh, suspense, suspense!  Anyway, if this isn't enough to keep Naruto fans hooked, then the high number of action scenes will.  In fact, the action scenes are the only redeeming quality to the movie, as the story suffers from almost no development at all.  It's your basic high action, little story formula that's perfect for satisfying the series' generally younger audience.The Scooby gang is switched up a little for world-saving action.  Of course, Team 7 consists of Naruto and Sakura, but this time around, Rock Lee is filling in for Sasuke, and Neji in place of Kakashi, since all of the upper level ninja are tasked with stopping the massive ghost army.  This is where the story falls apart.  The lame excuse for having just Team 7 guard the most key person to saving the world really makes no sense.  Why send all the more experienced ninja to stop this army (they end up doing no damage at all to them anyway), and furthermore, Naruto dispatches them easily enough on his own.  Also, is it just Wind Village vs. ultimate evil?  You'd think that at least a few other people would care a little.  The resolution will most likely have many people shaking their heads in disbelief at the sheer number of deus ex machina that end up saving the world - since there are no rules regarding Shion and the demon, they can just more or less make it up along the way.That aside, it's a good way to isolate Naruto, Rock Lee, Sakura, and Neji, and focus the action upon them.  Their fights with various other ninjas and a few more sentimental moments provide just enough substance to consider this a movie.  The ending will also probably have you smiling with it's tongue-in-cheek humor, and the ED song before it is rather enjoyable as well.Art:  10As usual, Naruto performs quite well in the art department.  Unique characters, flashy jutsu effects, and detailed backgrounds are pleasing to the eye.  A few corners are cut in places (most notably the ghost army, although this is understandable), but it's easily overlooked.  Action scenes are fluid and well-paced, and fit perfectly into the movie.Sound:  8Like it's art, the sound is similarly of great quality.  The upbeat music playing during action scenes will have your blood pumping and fit the fights really well.  Various sound effects, such as the sounds of kunai or the rush of running water are executed in great fashion.  The ending song is pretty catchy as well.  Sound is basically what you've come to expect from the series.Character:  7What Gekijouban Naruto Shippuuden offers character-wise is really nothing new.  Some of your old favorites, plus one or two new heroes and several baddies.  Shion possesses just enough development to keep the story going, while most of the baddies, such as the four ninja siblings have no back-story at all, and are just thrown in to give Team 7 a tough fight or two, although they do possess some rather unique abilities with their use of chakra.  The movie makes no leaps or bounds in anything new this time around, but it's enough.Enjoyment:  7Perhaps it's just me being reminiscent of my younger days of watching InuYasha movies, but Gekijouban Naruto Shippuuden reminded me of them, and it was kind of nice watching something less story-based and just purely action-driven for a change.  If you're a fan of action, you'll enjoy it, more or less.  Even if you're unfamiliar with the Naruto world, you shouldn't have too much trouble understanding this movie.Overall:  7As stated before, Gekijouban Naruto Shippuuden offers nothing new to the Naruto world, and as such, don't go in expecting too much.  If you've been watching the Naruto series up until now, then of course watch this movie.  Chances are, you'll like it.

This over-hyped movie portrays Naruto dying in the trailer, although this is nothing more than something to think about for all of 2 minutes. On top of that, the plot is about predictable as any of the other Naruto movies; Naruto meets brat, brat hates Naruto, Naruto is very similar to brat, they become friends, Naruto protects brat, Ultimate Resengan, and then the end. Other than that minor crack in the 5-story Naruto Obelisk, this movie isn&rsquo;t so bad in terms of graphics, story, and sound. No matter how conventional the plot is, I...always loose myself in these surprisingly enjoyable movies.

I was immediately thrown off by this ""twist"" or whatever they wanted to present it as. Thankfully, the story wasn\'t too bad, and it had a lot of pluses.

It is good enough to completely blow those 3 out of the water.Story: (4/10)The story of Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 1 begins with 5 mysterious people fighting their way into a shrine that contains a demon that was able to destroy the world and that demon is soon released. Now it is up to Naruto, Sakura,...Lee, and Neji to escort the shrine maiden named Shion to it because she is the only one able to seal the demon. The first thing I noticed about this story is how it was the same story as the first Naruto movie because it follows the same formula that the first movie showed. Naruto and his group go on escort mission, they fight the main antagonist's servants, the main character of the movie is captured leaving only Naruto to go save her, and Naruto is able to defeat the main antagonist. But the story in this movie was much better executed than the first movie's story. One of my main problems with the story is that a mission that could end up destroying the whole world was assigned to rookies like Naruto, Sakura, Lee, and Neji and we are not talking about the extremely OP Naruto from the recent episodes of the anime, we are talking about the Naruto from the very beginning of Shippuuden. Why couldn't this mission be assigned to all the team leaders or even Tsunade because I'm sure that they would be able to guarantee the mission ending up an success and not have a 50-50 chance of being able to succeed like Naruto and his group. The ending for this movie was bad. It was never explained how they didn't die in that last scene even though their chances of escaping that was very low.Art and Animation: (6/10)The art for the movie was pretty good. The character designs stay consistent throughout the whole thing, the backgrounds look good, and the special power visuals looked good. I also like the use of black shading that they used for one scene. The only thing I didn't like about the art is how they used CGI stone warriors and how they didn't mesh well with the backgrounds. The animation in the movie was good even though it would look clunky at times but still good.Sound: (5/10)The soundtrack didn't stand out and didn't make any scenes more intense but the ending song was good. The voice actors did a fine job with the characters and the sound effects were average.Characters: (4/10)First we have Naruto who is always his same old self with his shenanigans and telling everyone that he could defeat anybody with the power of friendship at his side. Next we have Sakura who again, like always, is never contributing anything to the plot, come on writers! Please make Sakura an actual important character that isn't just there to call Naruto a baka and to fight the enemies that come their way. Next we have Lee and Neji in which their whole role is to be allies to fight of the main antagonist's servants. Next we have a character named Taruho who is Shion's most loyal bodyguard  and that is pretty much all there is to him because he gets killed off very quickly in the movie. Finally, we have the main character of the movie and that is Shion. She pretty much is a more likable version of the main character of the first Naruto movie and she is given more backstory than the other girl. Oh and there is also Kakashi but he is not worth mentioning because he is in only one scene in the movie. The villains are also not worth mentioning because of how underdeveloped they are and how their only motivation is to destroy things because destroying things is cool.Enjoyment: (4/10)It had some interesting visuals, good animation, and had some character development in it.Overall: (4/10)Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 1 destroys the first 3 Naruto movies with its story, art and animation, and characters but there is still many things that I found wrong with it that it made it not possible for me to call it a good movie.

Of course, you could easily see other reviews from Naruto haters or people who think Naruto is OK, but I think you could take this review honestly even if I am a Naruto fan, and this is my honest opinion.The Story for the Naruto Shippuden movie seems sort of like a Naruto filler, oh wait, it sort of is since all the movies have nothing to do with the series. But yes, it is basically a...filler, so they are not going to make it crazy interesting and make you so hooked that you can\'t stop eye-bawling it, but they definitely tried to make the story at least interesting so you are able to watch it. And it definitely caught my eye, I mean, everyone who has seen Naruto before has thought to themselves, ""Hmmm, what if Naruto died?"" Well, basically the people who are in charge of the Naruto anime thought this to themselves as well, and they put it into the first Shippuden movie. The story is basically Naruto, Sakura, Neji, and Lee are going to protect a priestess who can seal the soul of the world-corrupting Moryo while Moryo has risen and is back to take over the world again. It definitely has an interesting plot to it, and I believe it a lot of people agree with me, but it wasn\'t portrayed so greatly. Not to where it comes close to the manga as of right now, but the writers certainly tried, and I do acknowledge them, but they should\'ve used some better techniques, because a lot of it seemed cliche. They have to protect a princess or the world will end. It has been used plenty before in the Naruto series. But don\'t get me wrong it definitely is a smart idea.The art was simply beautiful, and is WAY better than the series is animated. Yes though, it wasn\'t perfect because some of the things weren\'t so outstanding, like the CGI knights and the fire they use, but the movie was animated brilliantly, especially some of the fight scenes. The OST was good, but it never convinced me I would really want to download it and listen to it sometime, but what did was the ending theme by DJ Ozma, truly surprised by the fact they would choose a song with such J-pop sound, but it fit well surprisingly.I think the acting was very well done by each character, but Naruto seemed more impulsive than he usually is. I think really Naruto took out a lot of the enjoyment for me, because he was just SO ANNOYING during the first 25 minutes of the movie, but it got much better after that, and the fights were great. All I could think of was ""HELL YEAH!"" when Neji pulled out the 64-palm technique and when Drunken Lee made an appearance. I just wish they would put more of the good fighting scenes from the movies and the fillers and put it in the real plot. The Naruto Shippuden movie had it\'s pros and cons, but if you enjoy Naruto you will probably agree with me that it was well done.

There were some clever lines that made me laugh and overall it was an enjoyable distraction.  The art was at the same level as the best of the Shippuden episodes.  The fights were very well done as they seem to be in all the movies.  As far the original characters of the movie, well none of them stood out, they all felt like drab filler characters.  It was amusing, and I...didn\'t waste my time.  It was basically a very well done five episode filler arch.Parental Caution:Rated PG-13Mild swearing.Sakura screams ""You bi***!""

I\'ll admit that I laughed.', ""After the complete sleeper Naruto Move 3 proved to be, I wasn't expecting much when I slid the first Shippuuden movie into my DVD player.  I did have some expectations that I would enjoy the movie, because of what I have seen of Shippuuden, but I wasn't expecting to be blown away.  I wasn't, but I did enjoy the film non the less.Story:  The story was original to Naruto.  Never had the series, cannon or filler, dealt with a Priestess storyline.  However, that doesn't mean it wasn't prone to mistakes.  Towards the end of the movie, you were just...faced with so much plot to chew.  Things were getting thrown at you and you had no real way of digesting them.  You had no idea how things were going to go.  The movie also was a bit choppy when it came to plot twists.  They came out of nowhere.  Just when you think you had something figured out, something would come completely out of left field.  It was a bit refreshing though.   So many Naruto filler arcs were so predictable, that it was nice to see something you could not figure out right away.Art:  The art wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very good.   The flashback sequences towards the end of the film reminded you that this was still Naruto with the lazy animation.  They still cut corners and reuse footage.  The animation of the stone soldiers was also straight up weird.  It left me looking for my pair of 3D glasses.  Why did they animate them that way?Sound:  Sound was very good.  The background music always swelled up at the right moments to create a great mood.  I'm not tried of that lead Shippuuden backing track yet.  It provides great moments.  Also, no voice actors voice was annoying and Junko outdid herself this movie with all of Naruto's little speech patterns.  However, the inner monologues sounded odd, like they were using weird mics.  It sounded like they were talking into shoe boxes.Characters:  The new character was interesting.  I liked her and I really liked how she bonded with Naruto.  Out of all the past movie characters, I'd have to say she resonated the best with him and seemed to listen and take his advice the best.  Also, her and Naruto had awesome chemistry.  It wasn't forced at all.  The bad guys were a little disappointing, but I have to praise them for not going with the typical 3 man bad guy squad that they normally do.  Also, why was Temari randomly there?  Did they feel bad about leaving her out of the second movie or something?  It was really odd.Enjoyment:  I really enjoyed the movie.  I wasn't left watching the clock and I really got into the movie.  I also enjoyed the element of comedy they brought in this time around.  I found myself rewinding back a couple parts again and again.Overall:  8 out of 10.  It had it's faults, but it rose above them and produced something pretty good. faced with so much plot to chew.

But then you learn that its a foreshadow of what&rsquo;s to come. Naruto then goes on a Body guard mission with Sakura, Lee, and Neji. Their mission is...to protect a high priestess who&rsquo;s supposed to seal a newly released demon.Naruto instantly has a problem with the priestess but once he learns of her past he understands because he can relate. The priestess becomes fond of Naruto three quarters into the movie adding that &quot;Is it love&quot; feeling.The overall art quality of the movie is up to par with most animes but noting exceptional.The sound quality was nothing new either but I have no complaints.The characters had a little room for improvement. I felt like I needed a little more information on of the villains, they had little back story.I gave the enjoyment a ten, because from start to finish it was enjoyable, that and it has an great endingOverall the movie is one of the best naruto pieces I&rsquo;ve seen, plenty of enjoyment if you have at least some knowledge of the naruto universe. to protect a high priestess who&rsquo;s supposed to seal a newly released demon.Naruto instantly has a problem with the priestess but once he learns of her past he understands because he can relate.

I remember finishing this and I was in love with it. I am currently rewatching it for the 2nd time! It's cool to see Naruto change from the first anime to Shippuden. He grew badazz and cooler. In the first episode of the original Naruto, Naruto was like a little kid that was a big troublemaker in the village. When Kakashi trained Naruto, he got like more powerful. Then he learned his Rasengan while training with (forgot name cause spodermen is dumb) It was so cool to see Naruto use it! Also this movie was the first...Naruto Shippuden content related stuff.

The film is directed by Hajime Kamegaki.Story (7/10): A good story, but extremely predictable for a Naruto film. Naruto & company have to be bodyguards for a preistess and Naruto learns that he may die through a vision. However, everyone knows he keeps the preistess safe because this is Naruto, and that Naruto doesn't...die because HE IS THE MAIN CHARACTER!!

The backgrounds are very vibrant and colorful. The fighting scenes are great and look as well as you thought they would be coming from Naruto-standards. One of the best aspects of the film.Music/Sound (9/10): The soundtrack for this film is great. My only small complaint is that the music from the show is nowhere to be found in this film.

For me, the main problem is the lack of originality, maybe this would get higher than a 6 if I hadn't watched the previous Naruto films but unfortunately I can't go back in time and change that.They use the same formula every time, (a selfish/troubled [insert: priestess] becoming better person with Naruto's help) but they change the character and plot, in a kind of half-assed manner. Which is what makes me so frustrated, don't get me wrong I love the Naruto series but...I'm not blind enough to overlook the scrappy work here.I guess the only redeeming quality was the art, so while I was zoning in and out of the boring-as-hell story line at least I had pretty pictures on my tv screen. It's not enough. In fact, I'm being generous by giving this a 6, and I know that if they keep producing Naruto films like this the score shall continue to decline regardless of how much the art improves.There's not any more to say, I would only recommend this if you were willing to waste your time on a extended Naruto filler.STORY: 4ART: 7SOUND: 5CHARACTER: 5ENJOYMENT: 6OVERALL: 27/50 : 54% : (Fair - 6) I'm not blind enough to overlook the scrappy work here.I guess the only redeeming quality was the art, so while I was zoning in and out of the boring-as-hell story line at least I had pretty pictures on my tv screen.

The Kazekage arc was still in full swing, and it being the first canon material I\'d seen from the show in such a long time I was loving it. So taking a break to watch this movie wasn\'t so bad. I\'d seen a few of the Part 1 Movies and kind of knew what to expect. The plot wouldn\'t matter to the main story and it could be thought of as a one off adventure with some characters you already...know.When the movie opens on some melodramatic ""Naruto\'s gonna die"" prophecy I pretty much zoned out. A story that\'s already non-canon threatening to kill off the main character? Oh  no, the stakes are so high! I\'m so worried, will Naruto survive?I know that\'s a really cynical outlook. Stories can still be fun even if you know how it\'s going to end. But it\'s making that pathway to the ending interesting that\'s the trick. This movie really wasn\'t. Standard affair, go to a new place with new characters, use a new version of the Rasengan at the end. And, gasp, the prophesy was subverted and didn\'t come to pass the way they expected. I think prophecies and visions as a trope are super played out and you have to be really careful how you implement them, if you feel the need to use them at all.Like with the other movies it\'s inoffensive enough and can be a nice diversion if you want to see the characters do something other than the main plot for a bit, but it\'s probably safe to skip unless you really like Naruto and feel the need to do a 100% speedrun. 6/10 know.When the movie opens on some melodramatic ""Naruto\'s gonna die"" prophecy I pretty much zoned out.

In an attempt to make the old fans return as well as gaining new audience, they poured a lot of money into making both the first dozen episodes of Shippuden, as well as this movie, to look as slick as possible. And indeed, both the series and the movie feel like they are trying to convince you that the show is back on track, better than ever. The characters are older, more powerful, more mature, the stakes are up, the action is...better, and the pastures are greener hereon.They even combined the best elements of the first and second movies (disregarding the third as a complete joke) in an attempt to offer the best possible movie-based plot the setting can offer. Thus we get the team having to escort a young snotty girl with a tragic past (again) and fight their way through villains who want to get their hands on something that will help them rule the world (again). They even went as far as throwing in a vision from the future, where Naruto gets killed and they keep insisting his fate can‚Äôt be altered. So yeah, on paper this sounds to be by far the best movie so far‚Ä¶ And sadly it ain‚Äôt.Although it looks spectacular and exciting on a superficial level, the directing is bad, many things make no sense, and there are major power level inconsistencies. Just like the second part of the main series, it starts with a bang which promises to be super awesome, only to quickly disappoint you with its juvenile gimmicks and messy storyboard. And here is what I mean in detail.The first quarter of the movie is nothing but a silly build up without any actual depth. All we see is the villains slowly doing their thing and plotting to kill a priestess. All this time the heroes are not even seen or heard of. When we finally do get to see them, we get the same treatment of what the tv series did. They constantly try to impress us with silly bravado of the type ‚Äúwe are here, better than ever, but still funny and silly occasionally so don‚Äôt feel alienated because we are still the same‚Äù. And again nothing of importance has happened up until the middle of the movie.The second part of the film on the other hand is quite amazing in terms of action and dramatic tension. Priestess Shion quickly changes from an apathetic doll to a snotty girl who is feeling depressed for the task that is given to follow all her life. There are side stories like fate that can‚Äôt be avoided and obedience that must be followed to the death. And the battles are simply spectacular and even tactical as far as the setting goes. It even has a twist in the end with the demon revealing stuff about his true nature. I must say in terms of superficial entertainment the second half is exceptional and rewards you to the fullest for having to tolerate the most boring first half.Other than that though the scenario is done on the run and you easily see lots of things that could have been done much better. There is a part for example where someone disguises to look like the priestess to lure the enemy away and yet they make it appear like he used an amazingly hard and forbidden technique to do that. Big deal, they do it all the time in the main series and it isn‚Äôt hard or irreversible at all. The evil henchmen in another case lose the fight because they ran out of power and not because they were bested in battle. That makes them feel lame because they were never really strong and the good guys won because they stabbed them in the back while they were defenseless. That is just cheap and mean. Also, they keep on saying how the demon lord will be undefeatable if he ever finds his material body to merge with but they otherwise never seem to care how he was defeated a few decades ago WHILE he was in full power. And as usually, most never heard of such an important event, such as an army of tens of thousands of statues almost taking over the world, even when it happened a few decades ago. Heck, even the statues don‚Äôt make much sense since they appear indestructible in the beginning yet are trashed easily towards the end. And the whole prophecy of Naruto getting killed or duty to the death issues are dealt with in a most cheap and childish way for anyone to care. I can go on forever but the storyboard is full of holes.But in case you disregard all that, Shion is fleshed out nicely for the crummy time she was given and the battles are super cool. Lee and Neji in particular steal the show even if they are cameos in the plot. Because eventually it is still just Naruto doing all the work, being the usual idealistic immature idiot with a golden heart he always was. And yes the ending is once again throwing a Rasengan on the villain‚Äôs face and giving his motivational monologue to the emo kid that makes everything feel right.

I love their fight scene.I rate it based on how enjoyed I am, not how good it is. I don't recommend this cuz it's not cannon unless you wanna kill some time and a hardcore fan. But, the ending was worth it, it's even in a meme I've seen before. That's it, hope this review is useful.Why do we need 100 words for a review? Give me a break. "", 'I had a thought during the climax of this movie. There was a time before Naruto had learned the Rasengan. Imagine one of the movies ending without him doing some random new version of that technique. Wild.This movie shares all the issues with the other Naruto movies. It\'s vapid. They phoned in the original characters\' designs. No matter how high they theoretically raise the stakes, it doesn\'t feel like it matters because the new characters don\'t give us much of anything to latch onto thematically. The series regulars other than Naruto are pretty much wasted and don\'t get any time to shine on their own...as characters outside fight scenes. And those fight scenes are hit and miss.I don\'t regret watching these movies because ""watching the Naruto movies"" is a laugh in and of itself and I don\'t have to pay full attention because the Naruto universe isn\'t very complicated. Even so, they might have done pretty much whatever they wanted because Naruto was so popular at its height. They could have gone all out on something really creative and out there. Even years later, it\'s feels disappointing that they...just didn\'t. They stuck to the Naruto filler formula, which always kinda fell short even when compared to fillers from other shows. as characters outside fight scenes.

She wasn't completely helpless and had somewhere important to be and the shinobi were there to ensure that happened. I thought her character design was similar to Hinata.I struggled to understand her powers and relationship to the demon. Is the demon her father? Is her mother inside it? Does she even have powers or does it all come from...that bell? The film didn't do a good job explaining the priestess's powers or her lineage. Why does she have such loyal followers, what does she do for them? What was with that magical girl change?This film had much more action than the previous ones. There wasn't anything particularly flashy about the fights but it kind of reminded me of when Sasuke was being taken by Orochimaru's goons in that big basket and they fought in the forest.There was more comedy in the film than usual. I'm not a fan of Sakura's threats as comedic relief. There was no reason for the goofy bits really.Once again, a special movie-exclusive rasengan is born.The ending was pretty abrupt and didn't have a satisfying pay off. They did their job and everyone's happy, but I'd like a little more closure. It went immediately from bad guy defeated, credits.Naruto shouldn't be making empty promises to be a baby daddy. that bell?

In a way, it sort of fixed a lot of the problems I had with the previous movies. Although the conflict wasn't directly connected with the Leaf Village, there were still some tangible threats to its well-being.The one-off character in this movie was a lot better as well. Shion's conflict over allowing herself to die or putting those around her at risk set up an interesting complication for her character which was much more engaging than all of the other one-off characters.I did find part of the third act sort of confusing and...weird. I was a little distracted, but it was confusing to keep track of who actually had the bell at what points in the final act.Also, that animation in this movie is pretty spectacular. I especially loved the scenes in the beginning and end of Naruto fighting the giant monster. Overall, all of the action scenes had a great sense of energy to them.Pretty good movie. Funniest ending to a Naruto movie as well. weird.

But every Anime has characters and everything around comes with its own world, which is unique. And each character has also unique characteristics and personality.And I can\'t imagine how disappointed I was at the way my favorite characters were treated in this movie. I no longer recognize them. Of course, the humor still exists, but the content of the film is too bad, the characters are too boring and the mage princess Shion is like a fusion of Garra and Neji.The villains...also don\'t last very long in my memory, they just show up, get defeated, and then disappear. And when they were killed, sure enough, it was when Sakura, Lee, and Neji laughed and enjoyed it with no mercy.At that time I wondered ""What the f** sh*?"" why should the voice actors have to put up with this, they\'re destroying every teen\'s favorite characters and no one is protesting?And if for comparison, look at the pointless and offensive joke at the end of the movie, then the scene is cut suddenly, that\'s my feeling.

Mirai Nikki: Redial,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16762/Mirai_Nikki__Redial,"[""EDIT, 13/06/2014. This is a old review. It was also my first. I am leaving it here for nostalgia's sake. I may remaster it because the grammar here is horrific. Thanks for reading!This will be a review for Mirai Nikki Redial and WILL contain spoilers.Mirai Nikki Redial is about a few seconds over 30 minutes long. This OVA seems to focus mainly on Gasai Yuno as well as other loved characters. In this OVA, we see almost every character living a happy life, apart from Eleventh who plays the roll as a villain of comedic value and Eighth who we do not see.Redial is not...anything of great status on it's own. However, after watching Mirai Nikki, it was extremely refreshing to hear all the wonderful voices of wonderful characters.I have always asked my self a question about Mirai Nikki. Is Yuno really insane? To answer that question for myself, I think not. She is just a shy girl who wants nothing more than Yuki's love. This is proved by her strong will to remember. In the first few minutes of Redial, she turned to see Akise and thought it was Yukiteru.I see this as two halves. The first half of Redial was a beautiful part of various scenes containing small hints of fanservice, which can always be nice. It also serves as a comedic use in which we see many funny moments between characters like Mao and Twelfth.The second half focuses on a more serious subject and seems to be main point of Redial. Yuno is trying to reach of certain person. She does not know whom she is trying to reach until she regains her memories due to receiving something from Murumuru.The story ends nicely with Yuno finally finding Yuki and re-uniting beautifully. The last few moments really got me when she said she wanted to see the stars with him.After all those good points, there is one bad thing about Redial. It left me wanting to see more Mirai Nikki and left me in a sad mood.In conclusion, Mirai Nikki Redial is definitely worth the time and achieved many thing. Happiness, Sadness, Laughter. Redial made all those things happen. anything of great status on it's own.

Whatever your reason may be for watching this OVA, you will soon find that you were mistaken from the start. Mirai Nikki is not only filled with betrayals, but it is betrayal in and of itself. This OVA is its final betrayal to you, the hapless viewer.So, this OVA kicks things off with that camera girl groping the tomboy girl's breasts at the beach. Every anime needs at least one filler episode at the beach filled with fanservice, right? How foolish we were to think this could be an exception! Meanwhile,...Yuno is feeling something is missing in her life. She has flashbacks of Yukiteru and she has an inexplicable longing for him.Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it! Not the damn plot holes again!1. This is world 3. World 3 Yuno. In the story's timeline, her parents are still alive and she has thusly never met Yukiteru. This is the Yuno who was going to be murdered and replaced - the whole fucking basis of everything.2. She should not have any memories of world 2's Yukiteru. They have nothing to do with each other and they never spent any time together!3. There is a Yukiteru in world 3. Why wouldn't there be? Seriously, what the fuck? Why did they just write him off? If she feels like she's forgotten anyone, it should be him, not the Yukiteru she could not have possibly met! Yuno 1's memories are confined to Murmur's red crystal - there is no reason why they should be leaking into Yuno 3's head.Overall, this is nothing but fanservice and a convenient happy ending for world 2's Yukiteru (while disregarding um... everything else). Not just ecchi type fanservice, but simply fanservice in that it shows us all of the characters throughout the series for the sake of letting us see them. Uh... except for that punk with the pompadour, for some reason they excluded him even though he was one of the only decent characters. It seems he is also no longer in a relationship. Why? He was supposed to meet his girlfriend what, like 10 years ago? How did changing the events of 2 years ago change that at all? Seriously.This OVA adds nothing to the series - it basically only cheapens it further. Whoever said THIS OVA IS AMAZING is obviously biased. Turn back before it's too late. )-:::Mirai Nikki Redial?

As long as a plausible explanation exists, it is not a plot hole. Mirai Nikki Redial does not contain plot holes and it also does not leave the viewers short of theorycrafting opportunities.Redial also explores some interesting themes like love by using a world that mirrors the ideal dream world in which Yuki was trapped in in the prequel, with Yuno being the one trapped in the ‚Äúdream world‚Äù this time. In the prequel, Yuki was able to break free of the illusion due to his love for Yuno, and in Redial we get to see something similar happening through the eyes of Yuno.We get to see more detail of the changes caused by Yuki in the 3rd world as well, how the diary owners in the 2nd world would have behaved if they didn‚Äôt become diary owners. I especially liked how we were given closure in regards to Akise‚Äôs feelings for Yuki. Not knowing who to trust has been one of the issues for Yuki in the prequel. With Yuno proving herself to be reliable time and time again, and having been through thick and thin together, despite multiple setbacks in their level of trust, Yuki eventually chose to believe Yuno instead of Akise towards the end of the prequel, which was ironic because she was actually the one tricking him. Having feelings for Yuki as well, Akise felt somewhat betrayed and resents Yuno for what she did to Yuki. Despite that, Akise was able to come to terms that Yuki has chosen her over him.The OVA wraps up with a very nice ballad that accurately portrays the mood of the scene before it. I only wished that they showed more relevant scenes while playing the OVA instead of the random scenes we were shown.Despite having way more casual content than it should, Mirai Nikki Redial makes up for it with substance in the second half. So, if you have just finished watching the prequel, definitely do give this one a go, especially if you are a fan of the prequel!Overall: 8.5/10 no plausible explanation for the event that had its relevant information omitted.Now there is a reason why the word blatant was chosen, the reason is because a simple omission does not count as a plot hole.

Writers please give this some time!Overall I love the series and the concepts, but this was really underwhelming.

Do you feel like something is still missing? You crave some kind of epilogue or closure? In that case, watching Mirai Nikki Redial......will do nothing for you. I\'m sorry. As much I hated the plot-hole-ridden, crazy and unfinished ending of Mirai Nikki, at least it kind of ended the series on a fairly positive note.  As for Redial, it\'s pure fan-service in every way.The first half is the obligatory beach trip, the staple filler episode that was missing from the main series. Yes, sure, we get to see a random group of the main characters again, frolicking on the...beach in swimsuits, having fun or goofing off with each other, but it\'s only that. It really adds nothing to anything.The second half is where everything happens. It\'s a corny, tacked-on prologue, that forces in a half-assed ""happy ending"", continuity and plot holes be damned.  It\'s pure fan-service. It completely destroys what meaning and power left in the original ending, the impossible choices and sacrifices made by the main characters, only to magically bring them together in some sort of weird pseudo-reality and give the fans a totally out of place, saccharine HAPPY END. So, if you just couldn\'t handle Yukki and Yuno not ending up together and live happily ever after, well, there you have it. The tear-soaked pillows and sleepless nights are finally over. Good for you.Yes, it was nice to see the old gang again, some more fun, action and some extra story... But if you were looking for some real answers or closure after Mirai Nikki, well, I\'m sorry, but you won\'t find that in Redial. beach in swimsuits, having fun or goofing off with each other, but it\'s only that.

I read & re-read the Mirai Nikki manga...What a sad story. Friend, let me tell ya... If you need a good cry, read Mirai Nikki. It was thrilling, exciting, dramatic and very VERY sad.That was a year ago now and this OVA just came out today. Guess what? It wasn't just a happy ending, but it was one of the most intensely joyful moments of my life.It was SCREAM-OUT-LOUD good. Yes. Yes.If you have read the manga... PLEASE. Watch this OVA! "", 'WARNING: This review contains spoilers of Mirai Nikki: Redial, but the most important spoiler is that it\'s awful just like the anime preceeding it.Alright, to put things into context, it\'s recap time!Last time on Mirai Nikki: A lot of nonsensical time travel fuckery happened, so a third timeline now exists and and our hero Amano Yukiteru ended up becoming God of Time and Space, however his waifu Gasai Yuno commited Sudoku right in front of him, so he\'s a pretty sad time god right now. Why doesn\'t he travel a few minutes back in time and prevent his waifu from killing herself? Why doesn\'t he...just meet her in a different timeline? Can Mirai Nikki get even dumber after all the bad writing and plot holes gallore that led to the series ending with this terrible forced attempt at tragedy? Find out with Mirai Nikki: Redial, the OVA that gives the series a happy ending that somehow makes even less sense than the tragic ending it had before!So... Yeah, Mirai Nikki: Redial focuses more on this third timeline that was created after Yukiteru and Minene happened to save this Yuno from getting killed by the other Yuno... And this somehow solves everyone\'s problems and creates a timeline where all the main characters get to live happily ever after, even though there\'s really no connection between that and Yuno and Yukiteru\'s parents getting divorced, or Minene\'s hateboner for relgion, or anything else that was established in the diary users\' backgrounds in the anime. It makes no sense at all, but what DOES make sense in fucking Mirai Nikki anyway? It was clearly just an excuse to give everyone a half-assed happy ending, so I get to see all those great characters I totally got attached to living their new happy lives in this timeline, including Yuno who\'s somehow friends with Walmart Kaworu and the other guys who were Yukiteru\'s friends in the other timeline, so yeah, there\'s fanservice and shit, whatever. But things don\'t look so good, because Yuno is feeling weird due to having memories of Yukiteru... Even though this version of Yuno never actually knew Yukiteru to begin with, so I have no idea how this is even happpening. The idea is that she feels something is missing because there\'s a certain person she loves and should meet with, but she can\'t remember and it\'s obviously Yukiteru... The one who became God of Time and Space and reportedly spent 10000 years doing nothing besides moping around because of his dead waifu. Yes, ten thousand damn years! What the actual hell? Do you not know of the power over time and space that\'s in your hands, you dipshit? You could literally be in a fucking harem of Yunos from different timelines right now if you wanted!Why does Yuno from this timeline who never even knew Yukiteru from the other timeline suddenly has memories of him? Wouldn\'t it make more sense if she was feeling that she should meet the Yukiteru from her own timeline? By the way, the other Yukiteru doesn\'t even appear in this OVA for some reason.  Do you know who\'s also here? Deus! Because of course he would be here, he\'s the God of Time and Space of this timeline if that makes any sense, and he seems to be pretty okay with dying and the world just ending with that... Somehow. Like, really, why would Deus\' death cause the end of the world? I know he\'s the God of Time and Space, but as far as I know, Yukiteru also is and he\'s been doing jackshit for thousands of years, so he might as well just be dead. What? Does this god just need to exist and do nothing else, then? If that\'s so, then Deus could just pick any random Joe and give him time god powers so a God of Time and Space can still exist and the world can go on. But apparently he just doesn\'t want to do the survival game stuff and can\'t figure out who to make a new god for the life of him... This is the the stupidest fucking god I\'ve ever seen in any work of fiction ever! And yes, I did play the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, he\'s dumber than Etro!Anyway, Walmart Kaworu, who was killed by Yuno in the previous timeline, somehow has memories of that and wants to kill Yuno, which results in the two fighting and Yuno winning... How? Yuno in this timeline is just a normal girl, she doesn\'t know how to fight since she never got to take part in any survival game or anything! Fuck this stupid ass bullshit series, Jesus Christ! Eventually the story leads to Yuno finding Murmur from the first timeline, who somehow has all of the dead Yuno\'s memories stored in a crystal and wants to give them to her. Well, I\'m not sure if it was ever established that Murmur has the power to put people\'s memories into crystals or whatever, but I don\'t care enough to remind if it actually was anyway. Now with all those sweet memories of lying to Yukiteru, kidnapping Yukiteru, causing the deaths of Yukiteru\'s friends, killing Yukiteru\'s gay crush, trying to kill Yukiteru and trying to trick Yukiteru into getting killed, flowing through her head, Yuno realizes how much she loves Yukiteru and wants to meet him! This causes Deus to go ""k go ahead"" and smash the walls of time and space so she can go see Yukiteru, apparently choosing her as God of Time and Space because... Fuck if I know, but he talks about how awesome the power of love is before dying, I suppose. So this was all just a contrived happy ending for Yukiteru and Yuno to ""fix"" what was a previously contrived sad ending for them. Really makes me wonder why Yukiteru didn\'t just time travel and meet Yuno from another timeline, I thought he was too depressed because the Yuno he wanted was the dead one, but that\'s not the case since this one isn\'t the Yuno he knew and he\'s pretty happy with her.You know what?

Whatever, I don\'t even care anymore.', 'This Ova was a great addition to the series, but it would have been better if it came out sooner, because a year later I lost my emotions for mirai nikki and i didnt feel too happy when Yuno and Yukki reunited.This is defeitly good if you watch this directly after finishing the series. It will make you feel complete. Plus all those people saying the first ending is beter and all that shit.News flash the series never ended like that in the manga the Ova was supposed to happen, Only difference is that in the manga Yuno was Alot bigger then Yuki. ', ""Mirai Nikki Redial shows what happened 2 years after the end of TV Series.You can say ''True ending'' as it was in the last chapter of the manga.I think i am not the only one who left with some kind of a ''Hole'' after the series , and this OVA really filled that hole. And made me my day happy.Also it was great that other characters and some diary owners were brought back. And some humor with Mao-chan and Hinata was great !I'm happy for Yuno and Yukki :) "", 'If you finished the anime and think you can live with that ending, you\'re probably a better man than me because when I watched it and I had the worst and most depressing empty feeling in my heart.  The OVA is not the typical Mirai Nikki episode with betrayal, killing, and obsession but is rather silly and happy.  I think the light heartedness was to convey peace in accordance to the plot, and wouldn\'t really be fitting.  There is some action, but not nearly as distorted or grizzly as the action from the anime.   Overall, it gave me the minimum...expectations of the happy ending and closure I wanted.A lot of it shows Yuno\'s life as well as all the other game participants\' and characters\' without the existence of the future diary game.  All their lives are conveyed as what the participants lives would have been if they had been emotionally undisturbed as opposed to the previous timelines.To me, the happiness and comic nature doesn\'t really bother me because I didn\'t know what else to expect besides a happy ending for everyone except Yuki.  I felt satisfied knowing the ""happy endings"" of all the future diary holders, but I felt so sad as I watched Yuno live her life without Yuki or knowledge of him and at moments when she feels Yuki\'s subtle presence in her mind and I like she needs to see someone.At the end, when Yuki and Yuno meet I would\'ve liked to see something more rather than Yuno just barging in to the second world and rejoicing with Yuki being all happy etc.  Maybe something in regards to how they somehow would marry, come together, or be with each other.

This anime was a perfect example of that.Moving on to the OVA, I expected more of the gore and psychological stuff I loved from the anime. Instead, no blood was even spilled. Nothing that mind blowing. Just a little fanservice and comedic skits.Sure it was pretty entertaining. I really missed all the characters, especially Yuno and Akise. But nothing was really accomplished. They just confirmed what happened after the events of the last episode of the anime.Well, it was nice to see that everybody was normal...(well maybe except 12th, he was still weird) whereas in the past world, they were all hungry to win the game, of course, with bloodshed. But apparently it felt rushed. We didn\'t even get to see the other characters such as Marco and Ai (which I really like btw).

It's summer camp so the school is at the beach. There's playful humor and a bit of girl-girl action (which seems to happen in every anime beach scene). As the episode progresses, the truth behind the ending begins to unfold.I'm a big fan of Mirai Nikki but found the ending off-putting for some reason. The last episode of the anime just killed my feelings towards Mirai Nikki as a total. After watching this OVA, I felt a better conclusion.I feel as though...I now better understand Yuno which is something which I never grasped from the 26 episodes I watched. I don't question whether she was born a psycho or not anymore. I was happy that I was able to see more of twelfth. Eleventh was also brought in a villanous, humourous manner. So in character development, this episode did a lot for me.*Note how I'm ignoring Yuki because I still hate the crap out of him, nothing can save him*The art and sound were beautiful like the rest of the anime. I really loved the OP, I'm sad that it was only used once.In total, I give this OVA an 8/10. It was done very well for an OVA. This episode isn't a must see, though if you weren't satisfied with the original ending (like me), I really do recommend this. It explains events to a further point.

(Spoilers)(Spoilers)Story: 5(Spoilers)So Yuno after being everyone\'s favourite yandere girl turns normal she feels something empty inside her and senses something is not right. In another world we have Yuki... who has lived literally 10000 years in solitude. Now thats...the one of the things that most bothers me. I don\'t care if people say it is just an anime it not real but really 10000 years! He is a god couldn\'t he have made a new world filled with Yunos or at least a blow-up doll... Anyways Yuno is living a great life blah blah blah then decides to search for what is misssing. Plot happens and in the end.... nothing happens all you hear is ""Yuki"" in her yandere voice. So what can we conclude on this? Nothing. Did Yuki build a new world with Yuno as a Goddess? Did they go back to world #1 and have a normal life? And most importantly did Yuki ever grow a par of balls?Art: 7Nice Art, the fighting scenes were alright.Sound: 8Good sound quality. I really don\'t say much about art or sound.Character: 3Yuno she is so cool I guess but dumb as hell. Why because we have one of if not the most annoying character in Anime history Amano Yukiteru. How do you defend someone who is that weak, I have seen chickens who stand up for themselves more than he does. ""But Kamistuff-san if you where in that situation you too would be scared"" Yes I would but I would know when to hide in the corner and start to cry and when to stand up and die like a man or fight which ever it comes to.Overall: 5I liked the original series and its ending. I think that there was no need for this OVA. And yes most of my hate for the series comes from Yuki and the plot that sometimes doesn\'t make sense.

And that was satisfying to see because after all the horrors they lived trough in main story you can let out a sigh of relief. They all have happy lifes and ending of ova was best thing that creators of Mirai Nikki could do.Music and animation were outstanding. And i have to give credit for voice actors.

Yukiteru Amano is just a dick of a god, and Gasai Yuno is his crazy lover. Literally... crazy. Insane. Needs help.Story: 6/10Uhmm... There's not that much really to say. The second is dead, I guess, and... just read the description on the MAL page or some other page. I'm not explaining it, but I will say this. Second = Dead, without memories, goes to find guy that randomly appears in memories, sucks him of- no, not that part.Art: 8/10Animation, art, character design, whatever the...fuck you are to call it, is the exact same as Mirai Nikki. Now... that's about it.Sound: 7/10I can't remember the music used in this, except for the fact that they made a third opening just for this OVA. What the hell was the point in that, huh? HUH?!

It gives us a glimpse as to what happened at the very last moment, but leaves behind an emptiness, a gap that couldn't convey all the emotions the series deserved.That's where this OVA comes in. It explains to us what happened in that fleeting glimpse of an ending we saw.Story 10/10The OVA starts out at the best moment it could have, that gut wrenching, tear jerking farewell between Yuki and Yuno. It then goes on to show us how the...world is without the events from the first series taking place and gives a closure of sorts to the fates or the 10 other participants in the game. That just leaves us with 1st and 2nd.The second half of the OVA goes on to show goes on to show Yuno's struggle to find her important person whom she can't remember, to fulfill that single longing that supported her through 3 parallel worlds.Art 9/10The animation and art style is the same as in Mirai Nikki. I must really praise the animators in doing an excellent job not just in this episode but in the entire series, they managed to convey the characters thoughts with just the art. Yuno's psychopathic face is one that will forever remain etched into my mind.Music 10/10Never expected there to be a new opening and closing for just this episode. Kudos to them for that. The music is to die for, and the track from the opening scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Need I say more?Characters 10/10I'd give it an 11 if that was on the scale. Yuno is in my opinion the epitome of character creation. In this episode we tend to see her in a kinder light as it focuses more on her love for Yukiteru. No new character development here but just bringing back these guys in all their former glory for one last run is enough to earn this a 10.Enjoyment 10/10I never imagined this episode would come out. And I never enjoyed watching an ending more than this one.Overall 10/10Just one episode, in 30 minutes it brings tears streaming down your cheeks and a smile to your lips.

They could go a bit further and explaining more of what happens next (like both yuki and yuno becaming gods of the third world, which is said by Deus on the manga, and other stuff)... But for someone who truly enjoyed the 26 episodes and wanted a good ending for this, I cant ask for more! Music, animation, characters that show up an make u go nostalgic and feel good cuz u see a future for them, all off them nailed perfectly giving me one of the best OVA's I ever saw, very enjoyable, it gets a 9!...And next, I will read the manga series!! xD And next, I will read the manga series!! xD"", ""Once you put your time and effort of understanding into this anime , things start to become more clear.  Second time watching the first 26 eps, and this is my first time with the Redial:) They have simplified many aspects and left for a very pleasing wrap up !  Some of the things I had  to really look into will be listed:)   I would overall agree with others, please watch the anime fully before watching this , there may be a lot of parts you will not understand otherwise.Amazing anime  , I found nostalgia, realism, polotics, fantasy,beauty,artwork,history,romance,curiosity and...so many more things while  indulging myself in every moment ^.^ It is well worth the watch :31. Yuno Did meet Yuki, after the first incident and probably subconsciously hearing him while he was carrying her around . Everything that The Big M 1  keychain was whispering in her mind was attempting to lead Yuno's soul wavelength  straight down memory lane . She was shown the visions of him but did not see his face.At first I was confused as to why they didn't lead her to pursue world three Yuki.  With him being on a totally different path it makes sense that higher powers might help her out so that they can make a more positive difference . It was chalked up to Fate.  Apparently the crystal situation had a potential to be fatal , I believe that showed the importance of the entire situation . No one tried too hard to get in the way where that is concerned. Brilliant plot points that make up for a severe confusion in the last season .  Yuki was one of my favorite characters . I couldn't see that happen to him . They got a divine given chance to make it better.  It was lovely to see all of the characters grow and branch off differently from the first iteration .  The extreme difference in bonding here for characters brought a smile to my heart.  We get to see each and every character and all of them seem to be in a better place or in a similar less chaotic place then where they were before.I rated sound an 8 - it was either my devices I was using or anime error . When the fight scenes started it got REALLY loud. I would have to turn it down , then turn it back up for the talking scenes.

The original series was fine, though, except that the characters remained unchanged throughout the story.It was obvious that World 3 has Yukiteru, and its Yuno had not met him yet. But, let's discount that off - say, he didn't transfer to the same school after the destruction due to the timeline being altered heavily.The story still suffered a severe lack of progress on its characters, and this sequel certainly isn't an end even for that. It's short, though, and attempts to do that (It'd be more fitting if Yuno then entered the second world... (Edit...: Reading the manga ending, I see that the anime is at fault here)), so some bonus points for that (After the edit, 1 bonus point, actually, for being short).(Edit : You might prefer to read its manga and the normal manga ending, too... at least, that's what I'd recommend.) : Reading the manga ending, I see that the anime is at fault here)), so some bonus points for that (After the edit, 1 bonus point, actually, for being short).(Edit : You might prefer to read its manga and the normal manga ending, too... at least, that's what I'd recommend.)"", 'About a month ago I was at the pub with a buddy of mine. I met him last year at University but he\'s apparently been a mega weeb since middle school. Unlike him, I\'m actually kind of new to anime, only picking it up about a year ago due to boredom during quarantine. (which was a great choice as it quickly became one of my favourite forms of entertainment.) As conversations with a long-time weeb usually go we end up talking about anime, primarily anime he reminisced over. This is when he brought up Mirai Nikki.""So it was this anime about a guy who...gets a diary that can see into the future, but eleven other people also get diaries too and they have to kill each other, the last man standing becomes the next god of time"" he explains""what the fuck? sounds kinda wacky. I\'ve never heard of it."" I reply a little uninterested as I assumed it would be another shitty Shoenan he was trying to convince to watch. Despite my new love for anime, watching 80 episodes of an overpowered guy punch stuff is not my cup of tea.""Yeah man, from what I can remember it was a bit of a gory psychological thriller, kinda mind fucky too""Now I\'m interested ""oh?"" I say in response.""YEAH, and the other main character is some insane Yandere chick whose diary is literally just about him. The show is gets fucked up as shit as he slowly gives into her""Oh? a show about a descent into insanity, now that\'s up my alleyAnd with that I was sold, the next day I decided to watch it and man what can I say. I loved the Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) in fact it\'s one of the best animes I\'ve seen in a while. The series was a great slow descent into insanity with a slam dunk of an ending, a bitter ending that was fitting for the show showing that in the end, no matter what trauma you might have faced or how good your reasons are you will always have to face the consequences of your actions. Easily a 9/10 for me.WARNING I\'M GOING TO SPOIL THE ENTIRE ENDING OF THE ORIGNAL SHOW. If you haven\'t seen it please watch it first, trust me it\'s a banger. However please don\'t watch Redial Thank youI loved the ending of Mirai Nikki. Yukki and Yuno, after slaughtering everyone around them are left with just themselves in a dying world. However one of them inevitably has to die or the world simply ends. Yukki knows now that even if he were to become a god, can\'t undo his wrongs and bring everyone back from the dead, making his reckless killings no longer in the realm of the ends justifying the means, but turns them into killings of pure selfish greed. However, with the flawed character that Yukki is, he won\'t or can\'t acknowledge that, and instead hides behind the idea of ""saving Yuna"" and his own past ignorance as an excuse. Yuna on the other hand, can\'t be saved, she still clings onto Yukki with every fibre of her being. She can\'t and won\'t let go, in fact, she would be willing to do it all again. To subject Yukki to all the pain the game had on him, to slaughter everyone in her path all over again just to get a little more time with Yukki. Funny enough It is revealed that she already has. This isn\'t the first time the game happened, in fact, it happened once before. However last time, being the final two they both decided to die together but fate won\'t have that. Yukki happened to die just a second before her, making her the new god. Unable to go on without Yukki, she roles back the clock to do the game all over again. Not to have Yukki win, but to spend just a little more time with him. So she roles back the clock onto the third cycle of the game.This time, however, Yuna knows there is no way for them both to win or die together, so she attempts to kill Yukki, become god again, and selfishly rewind the clock, playing the game again, endlessly.  Yukki of this world defies this end, not because he wants to save the world, but because of his own selfish desire to save Yuna.This leads them to a final battle in the third timeline. Yukki set on saving Yuna. However, he\'s not alone, Minene (the ninth) comes in clutch as a ""half-god"" to aid him, not to save Yuna but to defeat her.(I\'m not gonna explain to much as how Minene comes back because that would turn this into a 5-page long literature review. but basically the time god was like ""aw shit somethings kinda wrong here, hay only likeable and least flawed player, ima stick my hand in your chest give you half my power or some bullshit. If you are about to die or shit hits the fan from the game so you can fight the Yandere chick"" I\'m not complaining, she\'s easily the best character in the show so I was kinda rooting for her from the start)a Big fucking battle happens, and for the first time in the show, Yuna breaks from her unending insanity and spills the hardest truth on Yukki. Yukki would have fallen in love with anyone who let him hide behind them, it just happened to be her. And that she would have fallen in love with anyone who let her cling onto them. It\'s the hard reality, they weren\'t meant for each other, they might not have ever loved each other for who the other truly was. they only loved how they could suffocate themselves in ignorance and their own selfish needs within each other. With each other, neither of them can grow as people and they will do nothing both drag each other down into madness.Despite the 26 episodes Yukki never seems to grow as a person and for the most part, neither does Yuna. Yukki attempts to convince Yuna to kill him so she can turn back the clock and go through with her plan, feeding into her mad desires. In his own flawed morals, this is saving her however all he is doing is dooming her to an endless cycle. In the end, Yuna somehow sees the inevitability of her repeated actions, sees how none of this will ever lead to Yukki\'s happiness and in every timeline, he will die sad, and with regret. Seeing this she kills herself, making Yukki the new god of the world they just left behind. However it\'s already too late, the world they left behind is already destroyed with everyone Yukki ever cared about being dead, and due to his own guilt and inability to move on he is now doomed to it never being able to build a new world, remaining alone with nothing but his regrets for the rest of time. Arguably a fate worse than death. truly a dark, terrible, tragic amazing ending.(side note, I just wanted to add this in, the ending isn\'t all tragic. remember how I said Minene ended up being alive and helped Yukki in the final battle, well she survives the battle and decides ""fuck it, the old world is destroyed and I lost everything I loved there, ima lives here instead"" She ends up meeting this worlds version of detective Nishijima who she fell in love with during her time playing the game in the last world. He falls in love with her and one of the last seines is them having a family together years later. So at least one good character got a happy ending.)Now, let\'s move on to Redial. It takes everything I just praised the ending for, and throws it out the window. Apparently, some people didn\'t like how the only character to get a happy ending was the only character who actually grew as a person through the show and wanted our flawed awful protags to get their happily ever after. Which I suppose is fine if you do well, I\'m actually really fucking easy to please. Going into it I didn\'t see a need to have a happier ending but was like ""hm ok, this is Mirai Nikki we\'re talking about, even though it\'s not needed at all I\'m sure they\'ll make it fulfilling, maybe this world Yuna, since she isn\'t a Yandere this time will end up with this worlds Yukki.""But no, they didn\'t do that, not at all. Basically, the first half is just shitty fan service, most of which doesn\'t make sense, both in that, it doesn\'t fill the theme of Mirai Nikki and also that half of it is plot holes and doesn\'t make any fucking sense.Yuna is on some dumb shit beach with this world\'s version of Yukki\'s friends during the game. First off, this makes no sense, Yukki only met them during the game and the only reason they met Yuna during the game is that Yukki introduced them to her, not only that. one of them was LITERALLY created before the game for the second cycle of the game thus this guy wouldn\'t even fucking exist in this world. The ending of Mirai Nikki literally showed that third Cycle Yuna would have a separate friend group. But whatever, fine, ill deal with it, you wanna bring the old characters back that\'s fine. Except have the episode is just them fucking around, and them doing a ""where are they now?\' with some the other diary holders. Again, this is fine, some of it doesn\'t make any sense, like why would the cult leader be the same age as all of them, wasn\'t she like 5 years older in the original show. ""Whatever,"" I think to myself, but the episode is quickly running out of time so they better do something quick.Apparently, the time god is like ""ALMAO I\'m not gonna pick a new god, fuck it we will see what happens"" but why! We literally know what happens when a time God isn\'t in a world, that was the whole fucking point on why Yukki was doomed to a wasteland. Whatever, I think again.So for some reason, Yuna is getting some of her memories back and is like ""damn I don\'t know who, but I was toxicly in love with someone"" Despite the fact that it already was established in the first ending that this Yuna is an entirely another person from the original Yuna and wouldn\'t hold any memories at all or even feel the last Yuna had. Like I get in the first ending she had the scene where she was like ""I feel like I\'m forgetting something"" but still feels like a massive stretch.Somehow she ends up in the god realm or some shit to get ""her"" memories back, and Murmurs like ""yo, no way, you ended the world twice get the fuck out of here"" which is the only thing anyone says in redial that makes sense.  But BOOM, LOOK ITS OUR FAVOURITE CHERECTURE, MINENE and she\'s here to fucking help Yuna get her memories back? WHAT why?  Why would she do this, she literally only helped Yukki in the last world so they could kill her. She knows what the old Yuna is like and how she is willing to sacrifice a WHOLE FUCKING PLANET OF BILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO LITERALLY GET AN EXTRA YEAR WITH YUKKI. Which mind you was filled with nothing but pain and misery.Evangelion reference, and guy who shouldn\'t even exist Fuck knuckles Magee appears, somehow with all of his memories from the last him, and tries to stop her. I\'m like, ah she gonna lose, this guy beat her multiple times in Mirai Nikki, and this Yuna isn\'t even a crazy Yandere. But no, she kicks his ass. but ndui uiabufbeuwb9ubauobd how?  and he\'s like ""ah yes, I hate you, you killed everyone i cared about and know your the destroyer of not one, but two worlds, but lmao you go get your man hun""Time god comes in and is like ""nah let her do it and become yandere again it\'ll be love or something""She gets her memories back, her memories of killing Yukki\'s friends, kidnapping Yukki, scaring Yukki, causing nothing but pain for Yukki, her realizing this and killing herself for Yukki and the old Yuna basically returns. Literally throwing everything Yuna\'s ending in the original out the window.The god of time is like ""ight, ima smash time and space so you can go see Yukki in the other timeline where hes the god, fuck it, your the new god of the third world. Its not like we spent an entire series learning why that\'s not a good idea and why this should never happen again.""And what do we get from this. 30 seconds, yes, 30 seconds of Yuna and Yukki together again. out of this entire 30-minute episode because they did nothing but waste time for 80% of it. and 19 percent was a bullshit battle that i didn\'t care about. This isn\'t even the same fucking Yuna, GOD I FUCKING HATE REDIAL......but hay, i guess this toxic couple can love each other again but most impotently, the fanboys favourite yandere is back, and that\'s really all that matters right?Its like they assumed their audience would be like""OH YAH EPIC"" I scream in my room as I grip my body pillow of Yuna holding a knife. slipping into my fantasies of me to having sadist Yandere girlfriendhowever, not everyone is a masochistic teenage boy, who obsesses over Yandere Anime girls.After watching this I really questioned what demographic they expected to watch their R-rated gore psychological thriller show.ConclusionRedial takes this amazing ending and basically kills it. Redial takes place after the ending of the initial anime and basically, mistakingly attempts to have things end in a happy, wholesome ""YAY everything turned out fine, no one has to face the repercussions of their actions"" kind of way. It takes away what made the ending great. Yuki and Yuno were awful flawed people who slaughtered everyone around them so they could get their happy ending, enemy, bystander, and in the end even the ones closest to them. Moreover, a happy ending that was impossible. No matter what they did, no matter how many they killed, no matter how many times Yuna sets back the clock, they would never get their happily ever after, they were doomed from the start. Yuna had to die, and Yukki had to face the consequences of his actions and spend the rest of eternity in a broken barren wasteland of a world which they sacrificed selfishly to achieve a dream that they both knew would never come true.  Their fates were locked from the beginning, they will never end up together and it would only cause endless pain and countless deaths for them to keep trying. As depressing as it is, shown in the end, it would be better for the both of them if they never had even met each other.It\'s a bitter, cold ending and it was perfect for the dark story that Mirai Nikki was. In my mind, redial never happened, or isn\'t canon. As said it\'s full of plot holes and removes any and all dark, and depressing aspects of Mirai Nikki\'s ending. It\'s solely made for those who despite the masterpiece of an ending wanted Yuna and Yikki to be together in the end and get a happily ever after. Which mind you Retail doesn\'t even do in a good or failing way. I hated Redial so much I put more work into this review than I\'ve done with some of my term papers. Do yourself a favour and don\'t watch Redial. Watch Mirai Nikki and once you hit the ending, stop so you don\'t have to see this complete disappointment and story ruiner of a supposed sequel. gets a diary that can see into the future, but eleven other people also get diaries too and they have to kill each other, the last man standing becomes the next god of time"" he explains""what the fuck? sounds kinda wacky.

Basically, the first half is just shitty fan service, most of which doesn\'t make sense, both in that, it doesn\'t fill the theme of Mirai Nikki and also that half of it is plot holes and doesn\'t make any fucking sense.Yuna is on some dumb shit beach with this world\'s version of Yukki\'s friends during the game. First off, this makes no sense, Yukki only met them during the game and the only reason they met Yuna during the game is that Yukki introduced them to her, not only that. one of them was LITERALLY created before the game for the second cycle of the game thus this guy wouldn\'t even fucking exist in this world. The ending of Mirai Nikki literally showed that third Cycle Yuna would have a separate friend group. But whatever, fine, ill deal with it, you wanna bring the old characters back that\'s fine. Except have the episode is just them fucking around, and them doing a ""where are they now?\' with some the other diary holders. Again, this is fine, some of it doesn\'t make any sense, like why would the cult leader be the same age as all of them, wasn\'t she like 5 years older in the original show. ""Whatever,"" I think to myself, but the episode is quickly running out of time so they better do something quick.Apparently, the time god is like ""ALMAO I\'m not gonna pick a new god, fuck it we will see what happens"" but why! We literally know what happens when a time God isn\'t in a world, that was the whole fucking point on why Yukki was doomed to a wasteland. Whatever, I think again.So for some reason, Yuna is getting some of her memories back and is like ""damn I don\'t know who, but I was toxicly in love with someone"" Despite the fact that it already was established in the first ending that this Yuna is an entirely another person from the original Yuna and wouldn\'t hold any memories at all or even feel the last Yuna had. Like I get in the first ending she had the scene where she was like ""I feel like I\'m forgetting something"" but still feels like a massive stretch.Somehow she ends up in the god realm or some shit to get ""her"" memories back, and Murmurs like ""yo, no way, you ended the world twice get the fuck out of here"" which is the only thing anyone says in redial that makes sense.  But BOOM, LOOK ITS OUR FAVOURITE CHERECTURE, MINENE and she\'s here to fucking help Yuna get her memories back? WHAT why?  Why would she do this, she literally only helped Yukki in the last world so they could kill her. She knows what the old Yuna is like and how she is willing to sacrifice a WHOLE FUCKING PLANET OF BILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO LITERALLY GET AN EXTRA YEAR WITH YUKKI. Which mind you was filled with nothing but pain and misery.Evangelion reference, and guy who shouldn\'t even exist Fuck knuckles Magee appears, somehow with all of his memories from the last him, and tries to stop her. I\'m like, ah she gonna lose, this guy beat her multiple times in Mirai Nikki, and this Yuna isn\'t even a crazy Yandere. But no, she kicks his ass. but ndui uiabufbeuwb9ubauobd how?  and he\'s like ""ah yes, I hate you, you killed everyone i cared about and know your the destroyer of not one, but two worlds, but lmao you go get your man hun""Time god comes in and is like ""nah let her do it and become yandere again it\'ll be love or something""She gets her memories back, her memories of killing Yukki\'s friends, kidnapping Yukki, scaring Yukki, causing nothing but pain for Yukki, her realizing this and killing herself for Yukki and the old Yuna basically returns. Literally throwing everything Yuna\'s ending in the original out the window.The god of time is like ""ight, ima smash time and space so you can go see Yukki in the other timeline where hes the god, fuck it, your the new god of the third world. Its not like we spent an entire series learning why that\'s not a good idea and why this should never happen again.""And what do we get from this. 30 seconds, yes, 30 seconds of Yuna and Yukki together again. out of this entire 30-minute episode because they did nothing but waste time for 80% of it. and 19 percent was a bullshit battle that i didn\'t care about. This isn\'t even the same fucking Yuna, GOD I FUCKING HATE REDIAL......but hay, i guess this toxic couple can love each other again but most impotently, the fanboys favourite yandere is back, and that\'s really all that matters right?Its like they assumed their audience would be like""OH YAH EPIC"" I scream in my room as I grip my body pillow of Yuna holding a knife. slipping into my fantasies of me to having sadist Yandere girlfriendhowever, not everyone is a masochistic teenage boy, who obsesses over Yandere Anime girls.After watching this I really questioned what demographic they expected to watch their R-rated gore psychological thriller show.ConclusionRedial takes this amazing ending and basically kills it. Redial takes place after the ending of the initial anime and basically, mistakingly attempts to have things end in a happy, wholesome ""YAY everything turned out fine, no one has to face the repercussions of their actions"" kind of way. It takes away what made the ending great. Yuki and Yuno were awful flawed people who slaughtered everyone around them so they could get their happy ending, enemy, bystander, and in the end even the ones closest to them. Moreover, a happy ending that was impossible. No matter what they did, no matter how many they killed, no matter how many times Yuna sets back the clock, they would never get their happily ever after, they were doomed from the start. Yuna had to die, and Yukki had to face the consequences of his actions and spend the rest of eternity in a broken barren wasteland of a world which they sacrificed selfishly to achieve a dream that they both knew would never come true.  Their fates were locked from the beginning, they will never end up together and it would only cause endless pain and countless deaths for them to keep trying. As depressing as it is, shown in the end, it would be better for the both of them if they never had even met each other.It\'s a bitter, cold ending and it was perfect for the dark story that Mirai Nikki was. In my mind, redial never happened, or isn\'t canon. As said it\'s full of plot holes and removes any and all dark, and depressing aspects of Mirai Nikki\'s ending. It\'s solely made for those who despite the masterpiece of an ending wanted Yuna and Yikki to be together in the end and get a happily ever after. Which mind you Retail doesn\'t even do in a good or failing way. I hated Redial so much I put more work into this review than I\'ve done with some of my term papers. Do yourself a favour and don\'t watch Redial. Watch Mirai Nikki and once you hit the ending, stop so you don\'t have to see this complete disappointment and story ruiner of a supposed sequel.', 'The original series had a lot of great ideas that weren‚Äôt enough for 26 episodes. What a surprise that this OVA has more ideas that can fit in 30 minutes. Redial doesn‚Äôt feel like an epilogue. It feels like a sketch for the third season.The obligatory beach section rears its head, but it‚Äôs not here for fanservice. Once again, the franchise takes a trope and plays by its own rules. The jokes and the focus is on the cast, which is as lively as ever. The ecchi moments don‚Äôt feel like tacked on but emerge organically. They involve only the characters who will deal with...sexual confusion at that stage in life.The re-appearance of the diary holders has the same vivid characterization as the original. My theory was true. Each time a diary holder is allowed to do stuff, their personality comes alive. The 12th remains a hilarious, energetic presence. Everyone is crazy, but he‚Äôs so far out there that everyone else backs away.The 12th gets the most development, but others get some development. John Bacchus gets a few jokes of his own. The humor here stems from the characters themselves, rather than specific punchlines. Such comedy is more than funny, but builds the character. The impression these scenes leave is that Future Diary could develop a Slice of Life anime with its cast.Things get fuzzier when Redial goes back in touch with the plot. It tries to develop the romance concept, but it ends up being confused on what it wants to say. The original was satirical about it. It presented an intense love, but showed its danger. Yuno‚Äôs obsession with Yuki isn‚Äôt healthy or productive, and the original knew that.The conclusion hints at a love-conquers-all message. The original always dealt with extremes, so a love that defeats such barriers isn‚Äôt out of place. It doesn‚Äôt align with the satire, though. As an exploration of Yuno‚Äôs psych, it‚Äôs too short.The changes in the new world weren‚Äôt enough to change everyone completely. Rei still has a sadistic side to him. Expecting Yuno to be psych-healthy is ridiculous. Psychological problems often take time until they manifest. Give this a few episodes, and you could get a true psychological series. A psychological story doesn‚Äôt need a seriel killer. It‚Äôs enough just to follow a character, and this OVA hints they could do that.Even Deus and Uryuu get some development in their brief appearances. 30 minutes aren‚Äôt enough to develop all of these ideas. It‚Äôs a nice addition and it‚Äôs great to see these characters in an alternative setting, but that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs so much steam left in this franchise, it‚Äôs odd nothing else came out. Attack On Titan is getting so many spin-offs it might as well be a carousel. As good as that one was, it doesn‚Äôt have Future Diary‚Äòs lively madness.Hopefully, someone will pick this franchise again one day and give it a new spin.3 blind men out of 5 sexual confusion at that stage in life.The re-appearance of the diary holders has the same vivid characterization as the original.

I enjoyed it very much and it's a must watch for everyone who has completed the Anime.MY GOD I CAN DIE HAPPY NOW. "", 'This ending was not, for most people, a bad ending.  I have to say it\'s not necessarily ""Bad"" but I find it very generic.  Like the last season of Bleach this takes all the sacrifices of the main character and throws them away in place of a mismatched ""feel good"" ending.  I can\'t say any more without spoiling the OVA but this episode just gives people the cliche ending.

The main story was pretty good, but there are things that are left unsatisfying and just outright off. The fact that I hated most about this series was how 3 the worlds connected. The first world was just utterly sad since everyone died (except yuno but then she died so yea).The second is pretty much the same except the fact that the real Yuno was killed by the first Yuno. And the third one was actually fucking good. The problem with the third...one was that Amano and Moe were couples. which pretty much broke my heart. Then I understand that they wanted Amano and Yuno to be together but how they made it was just not that good. I still feel like there should be more scenes of the God Amano and the third world Yuno are together. Even though they ended up together, what will happen next? Is Yuno going to abandon the third world and stay with Yukki forever or some shit? Cause that is a pretty bad end. I would have rather there to be the like a way that Amano found to like resurrect the second or first Yukki instead of interfering with the third world one. Or maybe the second world Yukki could've implanted his memories or feelings to the third world Yukki and he and third world Yuno would have been a couple which in my opinion is much better because they are leading in someone from a dimension that was perfect back to that.Basically what I am saying is that the ending wasn't really that good and could've been made much better since we barely got that much screentime with Yukki or Yuno.

You can\'t say ""no, this is not possible!"" at many things.Most things in Mirai Nikki as well as in this OVA can be based on valid theories of...time (like memory dripping through interference with different timeline versions of yourself).But even if you want to be more critical about how it plays out, I feel you could easily overlook it for the sake of their happy end.

Taking place two years after the last episode, Yuno is living a happy life with her friend but constantly feels like she is forgetting something. Spoilers inbound folks, here we go.Story: 3SpoilersTime for the story. For the OVA\'s story to succeed, in my mind it has to do two things. One is show us what happened after the events and also tie up any loose ends (EG the end of the final episode), in a...somewhat entertaining and unrushed manner. Unfortunately these events wizz past you so fast you\'d think Esuno was a bullet train. After showing the end of the final episode, the show cuts to the third world Yuno lives a happy life two years in the future. Whilst I feel that showing the end of the final episode can be important and useful to give people a refresh and to keep the series chronologically anchored, when you only have 30 minutes I feel like the time could be used better elsewhere to fix some of the large plot holes. Then the show goes on to basically break all laws of common sense, as Yuno somehow is still friends with Hinata, Mao, Kousaka and Akise (Who shouldn\'t even be there as he died in the 2nd world and didn\'t have his data uploaded, and in the 3rd world Deus never needed to create him as he never made the survival game), after going through about 15 minutes of fan service where the girls all fondle each others breasts (Which is hyper annoying as the show managed to avoid overly gratuitous fan service most of the way through- Keep in mind these ar 14 year old girls folks.) and meeting all the characters apart from 8th in stupid, immersion ruining scenes (Tsubaki is stalking Kousaka because she has a crush on him, I mean how did she even meet him ever?), we finally start getting to some form of plot, with only half an episode to go. I\'m fine with having what is essentially a catch up episode, but to have the characters all tie in so jankily is bizzare and stupid, however 12th\'s scene was genuinely funny to me, but that\'s only because of the over the top nature of 12th in general. Then the plot begins and Yuno basically starts recieving flashbacks of 1st world Yuno\'s memories, and wants to find out who the person she loved is. Menawhile Deus has decided to abandon a survival game and can\'t figure out who to make a new god. It\'s nice to know the god of space and time, who knows exactly when he is going to die and has knowledge beyond comprehension can\'t even begin to plan for (let alone actually pick) picking a successor before his death. Yuno then ends up throwing herself under a blanket and talking to Deus and then wakes up in the Akashiacikikikikik (wherever that place Akise was supposed to go) records. After Murmur trying to stop her and Ninth helping Yuno out, she walks down the corridor to find Akise, who in this world somehow has all his memories and says how much he hates Yuno, he then tries to kill her with a sword and somehow this world\'s Yuno (who is just a girl in every aspect, she has had no survival game training and isn\'t even hardened from killing her parents), manages to overpower him and take his sword. She then reaches the weird sphere thing and unlocks it, finding the 1st Murmur who has kept the 1st Yuno\'s memories and wants to give them to this Yuno. Sound bull yet? Because it really is. Also Deus has decided to 180 on his duties allowing Yuno to do this and infact aiding her. She then decides she wants to go see Yuki as her memories are all back and Deus just says ""yolo"" and smashes through space and time (not sure why he doesn\'t just time travel but needs to smash open a wall), and sends this 3rd world Yuno through to go see Yuki. This is wrong on so many levels. For a start this still isn\'t the same Yuno, why is she allowed to travel through space and time, why did any of this happen. It just seems a contrived way of allowing every character to be happy at the end instead of having the bittersweet ending of the actual show where Yuki and Yuno give up everything for the other to be happy (or at least another version of them). My favourite line comes from Deus where he basically says ""I\'m not going to pick a god, because I want fate to guide us instead of me for once."" this may sound semi-profound coming out of his mouth, but we have seen what happens if he picks nobody. He crumbles and dies and then giant black spheres begin destroying everything, so he has basically said ""I can\'t be bothered to pick a successor, so let\'s watch the whole world burn lol."". Still, at least it\'s better than the ending in the manga, where you get about three panels where Deus smashes down the barrier with a literal hammer and says that he is going to make Yuno god of the third world with no explanation as to why.Art: 7Not really much to say here.

The score of 2 isn\'t necessarily for the characters themselves, as I quite like a few of the characters in Mirai Nikki, but it\'s about their portrayal and how they act in this OVA alone. For example whilst I was never a particular fan of Tsubaki\'s character they completely ruined what they built by making her stalk Kousaka and basically being any harem anime girl ever. The characters are semi spoilt by this OVA, only not being completely spoilt as they\'re in an alternate reality, however Uryuu Minene and others that carry over between the episodes really dissapoint me on this one.Enjoyment: 5Why is the enjoyment higher than the story and the characters? Well that\'s simply because it\'s an end to Mirai Nikki. If you stuck around to watch all 26 epiosdes of the show chances are you became at least a little bit invested in it, and this does give closure to the series, ending it just about how everybody wanted it, with Yuki and Yuno together (even if it is an incredibly unsatisfying way of doing it).

Because of that, expect A LOT of recaps.In the end, Mirai Nikki: Redial is a cute little addition to the ending of Mirai Nikki's last episode, and it has a cute little message...about how love can transcend even dimensions.

It's all very simple but handled properly and well done. Granted, the resolution still leaves you with a bit of a headache, but at least it is a real resolution, which is more than you can say for episode 26 of the show. What's weird, actually, is that I found out that the ending to this OVA is the ending to...the manga. So in a sense, it's a bit strange that they created this as a separate thing rather than just adding it on to the final episode. But being someone who streamed all of this together many years later I can't complain :)Tbh, this episode is better than Mirai Nikki itself in my opinion.

Unfortunately, the majority of the OVA consists of filler content that heavily relies on fan service and the nostalgic return of several characters.

This is of course just my opinion. What a lot of people seem to get caught up on about this episode is the questions it raises. Why did third world Yuno suddenly sense like something was missing in her life?? Why did Yuno have the same friends as she did in the second world although the only reason why she met those people was through the future diary game? Why is Akise aware of the things that happened in the second world when he himself is just from the third world?? And this is one question that I asked myself: WHERE THE HECK IS THIRD WORLD YUKI? I really wished they would've shown even a little clip of what happened to third world Yuki. Before I answer these questions, one thing I think this episode does well with answering is: Is Yuno actually just a crazy person, or is she not? Throughout the actual show, I always found myself asking that. And another question I asked myself after finishing episode 26 is: Would Yuno still end up being crazy despite Yuki changing the course of third world Yuno's future? Like is it just in her natural behavior to be this insane psycho girl. I wanna say no it's not. I think she is just a girl who doesn't really know what purpose to have in life but when she's with Yuki, she serves a purpose. Her actions may seem crazy especially in this episode because we see how daring she is with trying to remember her past. But if anything I think that just proves how real Yuno and Yuki's love is. Yuno was willing to go through anything to remember who her past lover was and Yuki also was willing to sacrifice himself if it meant for second world Yuno to live. If anything is apparent in this show, it's that these people do love each other. And their love is what makes them crazy. I don't think Yuno is crazy by design. I think she is meant to be with Yuki and she is crazy for that to happen. Which is WHY I think it's not completely impossible for third world Yuno to have hazy memories about first world Yuno's memories. Because regardless, they are both still Yuno and I feel like if Yuno really did love Yuki that much, then her love for him would transend through space and time. Plus we also see that first world MuruMuru was communicating with third world Yuno so that could also be a reason as to why Yuno has some feeling for the past. This kind of reminds me of the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend. But this film and this show both have that idea going that no matter what would happen, x named character would always end up falling in love with y named character. What I do kind of not understand is why didn't Yuno just look for third world Yuki? If she had distant memories of him, why didn't she just look for him in her own world. I feel like this question could've easily been answered by showing a short clip of what third world Yuki was up to. Maybe he was  dating his initial crush, glasses chic, so Yuno and Yuki could never be together in that world at least. That's the only real problem I have with this episode. As for why did third world Yuno have the same friends as in the second world, I don't think it would be a stretch for that to happen. Because I mean the events from second world could have been strong enough for Yuno to have created a certain bond with these people. Which would also have transcended through space and time. This is just a theory of course though. And a reason why I feel like Akise was able to know the events that occurred from second world even though he himself is from the third world IS BECAUSE HE WAS MADE FROM GOD. If third world god is able to know about the events from the second world, why wouldn't Akise be able to too?? Also I will say, I don't understand people that say this episode ruined the ending to epsiode 26 for them. Like episode 26 was depressing as hell lol. Why would you want that to be the last thing you remember this show by. Nah Redial gave me a lot of closure towards Yuno and Yuki and even answered a lot of questions I had at end of 26. For one it answered who would be the god of the third world. It also answered for me whether Akise was someone god made solely for the future diary games or if he created him regardless of that, which he did. And ultimately it answered for me whether Yuno was crazy or not lol. People nitpick this show for small stuff but I don't see why because it still is a pretty solid show. Is it in par to other psychological/horror animes?? No of course not. But it still is a memorable experience and serves it's purpose of entertaining. Also the fan service in this episode is to be expected lol. I don't think it's the main focus of the episode though so why focus on that.If you made it to the end of this review, here have a cupcake! :)üßÅüßÅ just throw any song on there.

It removes the insane Yuno from the equation of the romance without having to forget about her entirely. I thought it was a really sweet episode, and if you like the original series, I think this is a must watch.The story itself was pretty good, though...most of it felt like a filler and was pretty annoying. Some clips of 3rd Timeline Yuno remembering things would have been enough instead of doing an entire beach episode, but I guess it might've felt rushed without it.

At least I\'ve completed it, finally.', ""when I first finished Mirai Nikki I was left with a serious cliff hanger that was killing me on the inside because yuno took her life so yuki could win. with yuki just sitting in the void because he was so depressed really brought feels. It brought up feelings that I had inside especially with the sad paino music during the soft moments in the anime. then I heard about the OVA redial I was so stoked about it. honestly at the end it gave me tears of joy at the end. now that's a end that I love. this is reason I watch...anime because some shows can bring so many feelings out that I never had before, for the writers that made this.......thanks for the awesome series you have made a big 10/10. anime because some shows can bring so many feelings out that I never had before, for the writers that made this.......thanks for the awesome series you have made a big 10/10."", 'For poeple who didnt liked the cliff-hanger at the end of Mirai Nikki.If you didnt watch Mirai Nikki (TV) do not watch this xDIts like an extra episode, you could say its the 27th episode.This is almost not possible to write without spoilers so pls do not read if you did not watch Mirai Nikki.I do like cliff-hangers but Mirai Nikki is having a big one and a bit of a drama.so they did an extra episode which was satisfying  to me. <3...I rated everything with a 10 (Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, Overall).this episode filled my heart with joy, now i can die in piece tho.Great ""Final"" :)HAPPY END I rated everything with a 10 (Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, Overall).this episode filled my heart with joy, now i can die in piece tho.Great ""Final"" :)HAPPY END', 'Mirai Nikki: Redial (2013)This was a much-needed finisher to the series which stayed true to the Manga if only slightly out of order.

This ending feels cheap, forced, and lazy.Disappointing conclusion to an anime with a concept that had so much potential.', ""Spoilers for main series aheadThis OVA of Mirai NIkki explores the ending of the original series in further detail. A very simple 30 min OVA that probably used around 5 minutes of recycled footage from the last episode.All in all, it's a fanservice ending to the Future Diary story and the story of Yuki and Yuno. The writing is around the same level as a fairly competent fan-fiction, and the content is fairly fan-fiction-like as well.The art and animation is a bit of an improvement upon the original series given that it's one single OVA episode aired around a year after the ending....Fairly fluid and clean, with some characters' designs cleaned up a bit as well.The story is split around half-half. Half of it is a brief look at characters' lives in the third world where the Future Diary games never occurred. Which frankly I don't really care about, given that most of these characters never made an impression on me in the first place. And half of it is the third world Yuno finding a way to second world Yuki. The manner in which this occurs is fairly non-sensical, but not completely outlandish, and certainly wraps up the ending in a slightly more satisfying manner than the original. Mostly because the original ending was completely unexplained. Unfortunately, similar to the original series, if you just think about this episode a little bit, the consequences of people's actions here, as well as their motivation, are quite illogical, and the whole thing kind of crumbles.Despite that, it's still worth watching, You've come this far into the series, what's 1 more episode. Just don't look for anything more than a well-animated fanfic level ending expansion, and this shouldn't disappoint you.

I can't say much about this without spoiling it, but I'll try to say why I didn't like it without spoiling it much.Basically I liked where the series ended. The ending of the main series was were it felt right. It ended on a somber and bitter note which made sense for the main character's arc and the way the story was going. The ending of the main series was a great and fitting ending for the story.This OVA continues forward past that ending and presents a new ending with a wholly different tone. I'm not a fan of the direction this...OVA goes with it and I felt like the ending presented to the original series was more fitting.It feels to me like the ending in this OVA spits on and undoes the ending the main series left on that I felt was the perfect place for it to end. However, it's not like this ending is non-canon or something. The main series' ending did set this up so it's not like this OVA just comes out of the blue.Even though I disliked the new ending it gave, it was nice seeing the characters again and seeing where they were at so it wasn't an entirely bad experience for me.Overall it depends entirely how you felt about the main series' ending. If you liked where it left off than this OVA will probably disappoint you. If you were unsatisfied or upset with the main series ending this OVA might be exactly what you wanted.

I'm not sure why!  I'll assume you've watched the original 26 episode run so the sake of this review.Story: Redial leaves off where the original Mirai Nikki ended off.  This time, we're viewing it entirely from the viewpoint of Yuno.  We know of what came of her in the first two incarnations, so we have to remember that this is the third world.  One night, Yuno feels like something is completely off, so she...takes things into her own hands.  However, the roles of just about every character that we saw in the original series have changed, at least a little - including the second world's Minene.  When Yuno attempts to find out what's wrong, we get pretty much the ending we expected, but the way they go about it is definitely strange, even if the end result is quite nice.For starters, it feels like this third world they created wouldn't have followed the second world's timeline, even without the interference from the end of the original series.  What we saw at the end of the original series definitely changed things up, but nothing with anyone came even close to the same.  It's explained to us why Deus Ex didn't execute his game in this world - which naturally would change things - but the explanation does feel weak, based on what we see.  With such a short runtime to an attempted redo of a story, I wasn't surprised.  However, it does feel like we were cheaped out a little.  Part of the problem is that the first ten minutes or so feel rather pointless.  It's suppose to be there for setup, but we already know what happened before, so adding fluff to it seems like a questionable decision.Redial is worth watching if you were a fan of the original series, but they way they go about finishing off the story feels quite strange.  Yuno is a notable character to a lot of people and to not see her ending fleshed out very well feels like they fell short.  (5/10)Characters: Yuno's got the attention of this one, and, as noted in my original Mirai Nikki review, she's a great character!  Her backstory was hard to watch, but it is well written.  This version of Yuno is entirely different, but most of the characteristics that are of a more pure Yuno, weren't fleshed out as much as I would have liked to see.  They really could have added to it a lot better.Aside her, we do get to see most of the other diary users and, I'll be honest, it was nice to see how their life was without the survival game.  You can see how much the game changed them all and how the more innocent world connects with them.  That being said, you never really get a total grasp on what Mur Mur's true purpose here is.  Maybe there's a deeper reason that I'm missing, but it feels like they messed around her character too much, relative to the first series.  (7/10)Art: Art's the same style as the original series, so there's no real complaints to be had here.  For obvious reasons, the violence is toned down quite a bit from the original... with the exception of the very strange OP.  Don't get me wrong, the song is fine, but the graphical choice feels like it belong to the original series more than this. (8/10)Sound: Due to the nature of this OVA's tone, I wouldn't say the OST needed to shine too much.  The OP and ED are, once again, great here.  The VOs remain the same as the previous series.  Brina Palencia (Yuno) deserves more looks in main roles and this only supports that.  (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: Redial doesn't full disappoint, but I wouldn't say its an epic conclusion either.  It's a nice way to end the series, but I feel like too much screen time was given to unnecessary parts.  They could have added more time to further explain Yuno here.
