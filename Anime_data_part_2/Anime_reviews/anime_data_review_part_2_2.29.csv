Slayers Evolution-R,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5233/Slayers_Evolution-R,"['There\'s something a little bit confusing about Slayers Evolution-R, and it\'s something that may not be immediately obvious to most people, especially as the sequel to Slayers Revolution is pretty much what viewers would expect.And no, it\'s not the cunningly maneuvered ""R"". You have two guesses left.The series picks up the narrative not too long after the end of Revolution. Lina and the gang are continuing their efforts to help Pokota on his quest, and this time they\'re looking for something called the Hellmaster\'s Jar, an object which supposedly contains the soul of the red priest Rezo. Like always though, other things keep getting in...the way.Given that this is a direct sequel to the previous series it\'s understandable that director Watanabe Takashi simply proceeds with the story on the assumption that the viewer knows all of the facts, and in all honesty I found it quite refreshing that I wasn\'t subjected to a barrage of flashbacks for a change (although there are some admittedly). The plot is very similar to Revolution in its approach as it attempts to stay close to the tried and tested Slayers format. The story is often engaging and humourous, and there\'s a general air of adventure about proceedings.The problem though, is that Evolution-R keeps tripping itself up when it begins to get going. The previous series made good use of what it had, even though it suffered from utilising an aging formula, but that\'s not the case here as it seems like there was too much effort placed on trying to be funny, and not enough on actually telling a story. The proof, as they say, is in the pudding, and if one compares the two series directly it becomes noticeable that Evolution-R is a far more hurried and haphazard affair than Revolution.Now there may be many reasons for the difference, but the most obvious ones that spring to mind are time and budget restrictions. This series began airing just over three months after Revolution finished its run, and while that may sound like plenty of time to get a TV broadcast right, in reality it\'s not that long. One could argue that it would have been easier to plan the majority of the plot before the production of Revolution (which may actually be the case as it\'s a fairly common practice), but like any media the story evolves while the show is being made (e.g. writers have new ideas, plot elements are changed, adapted, added or removed, new characters are thrown into the mix, etc). As for the budget, the simple fact is that Evolution-R is actually a little worse in the animation department than its predecessor (but not by much to be honest).Throughout the series the animation is generally around the same level as that in Revolution, with nice action set pieces, and decent character motion. The problems arise at the oddest moments though, and while there are the ubiquitous drops in quality during scenes of frenetic activity that are prevalent in many anime, there are also issues that arise when nothing much is happening as well (for example, lines that haven\'t been cleaned properly, odd poses, small errors in colourisation, etc). Fortunately viewers may not pick up on these minor flaws, and the only thing that may happen in most cases is that there will be a vague sense that something was a little off in certain scenes.When it comes to the characters it\'s pretty much business as usual, and even though there are a few new faces here and there, the design principle remains relatively unchanged from the previous series. This continuity also extends to the acting, with many of the seiyuu from Revolution reprising their roles once more.  As an added bonus Kawamura Shigeyo (a.k.a Maria), plays the role of Nama, the amnesiac suit of armour, but fans of the franchise will know her better as Naga The White Serpent from the Slayers movies.As for the music, the OP, ""Front Breaking"",  and ED, ""Sunadokei"", are once again sung by Hayashibara Megumi. The former is a fairly typical J-Pop track while the latter has more of a cross between rock and pop, and maybe it\'s just me, but they seem more suited to the Slayers franchise than the OP and ED for Revolution. The rest of the music is very similar, if not the same, as that used in the previous season, and while this does add to the sense of continuity, one can\'t help but wonder if there was some belt tightening going on as well.One of the things that confuses me about Evolution-R is the manner in which the characters are handled. Over the course of Revolution and the numerous outings that came before there was always a degree of strength to the characterisations of Lina and the gang, but with the first three seasons this was tempered by a certain amount of development. One of the things that was missing from Revolution was the growth of the characters, and once again the issue is present here. Part of the problem is that the characters begin the show in much the same way they did in the previous season, which basically contradicts the method used in the story proper. If the assumption is that the viewer already knows what\'s going on, then it stands to reason that the characters should have little need for pointless introductions about who they are and what they\'re doing, and the whole deal with Nama could have been taken in a more fruitful direction.The question is, why not simply make this a 26 episode series in the first place, as that would have precluded any need to begin the tale with inane explanations. The approach taken for the narrative, together with the almost unchanged music and character design, promotes a great sense of continuity, so it shouldn\'t have been too difficult to give the characters more focus. Fortunately this aspect is not immediately obvious to the casual viewer, especially as the characters interact with each other in pretty much the same way they did over the course of the previous series. In addition to this some development does occur, but like Revolution it\'s stunted due to the length of the anime.Sadly, the characters are nowhere near as well developed as they could have been, and to me this seems like a waste.That said, I found Evolution-R to be an enjoyable romp in the realms of comic fantasy, although I could have done without the fishwife episode as it adds nothing to the story. The series is almost on a par with Revolution in many aspects, but like the previous season it has some very big shoes to fill, which is something it doesn\'t really manage to do.Even with the flaws Evolution-R is an anime that any fan of Slayers should watch, and while it is nowhere near the level of the first three seasons, it\'s also not as bad as some diehards may make out. Granted there are problems with the aging formula amongst other things, but these are easy to forgive as the series is entertaining in its own right. In all honesty though, the best time to watch Evolution-R is directly after finishing Revolution, and it may even be better to simply consider them one series instead of two.However you decide to look at this show one can\'t get away from the fact that the queen of comic fantasy has firmly set out her stall in the 21st century, and given the generally poor showings in fantasy anime over the last few years one can only hope that Slayers will once again provide some much needed competition in the future. the way.Given that this is a direct sequel to the previous series it\'s understandable that director Watanabe Takashi simply proceeds with the story on the assumption that the viewer knows all of the facts, and in all honesty I found it quite refreshing that I wasn\'t subjected to a barrage of flashbacks for a change (although there are some admittedly).

You truly deserve to be called ""Slayers"".""-XellosStory: Now, I felt this was levels above Revolution. 7 might be a bit too generous but I really enjoyed all of it except for the fish people episode. For the most part I have the same complaints as usual with a Slayers series but episodes 10-13 showed that they could do a semi-good job with Slayers if they felt like it in terms of giving a viewer some satisfaction because overall Slayers isn\'t exactly the best show around. What they did with Zelgadis in episode 10 was a great watch for me. It was written...very well and I could really feel for him. It was a great episode and really made me excited from that point on. Anyway...We have the basic ""dead end"" episodes where they\'re looking for something but end up doing something stupid. The plot picks up episode 5-6 so it\'s not that bad in terms of the number of ""filler"" episodes. Now for the criticism, kind of spoilers ahead I guess. It seems that Revolution and Evolution-R are basically a rehashed version of the original Slayers but they tossed in the jars. A lot of things didn\'t make sense and they tried to tie it all together at the end which turned out sloppy and rushed. It would\'ve been better to cut the filler but then that wouldn\'t be Slayers. The pacing would\'ve been better if this series took up some of Revolution\'s episodes because like I said, it\'s mainly the end of these 13 episodes where you really care about what\'s happening so if they stretched out some of the plot points or important character events, you wouldn\'t get that rushed feeling in the final episodes.Art: For whatever reason, 10. It\'s not top quality animation but better than the older series of Slayers of course. It was consistent and bright. I also have to give some credit for the eyecatches of episode 13. The first one showed all of the protagonists from every season of Slayers. The second had all of the antagonists from every season. I thought that was a cool little thing to throw in for fans who have watched all the Slayers episodes.Sound: I\'m a bit conflicted as to whether or not I liked the opening and ending of Evolution-R. They\'re pretty okay songs though. I didn\'t give them a very good listening but I didn\'t hate them.Probably one of the best things about this season was during the final episode. They played the opening of Slayers Next during a fight scene. No Slayers/Megumi Hayashibara fan or most people for that matter can say they did not like Give a Reason. Nostalgia ran through my head.There was also a new song played at the end kind of like what they did with Try except it\'s not in English and Megumi Hayashibara sings it. A nice song to close the series with. Too bad it wasn\'t in the opening/ending single... Where can I get this?Voice acting, obviously no problems here. Ost, nothing special.Character:Ozel - I didn\'t really mind this character. During Revolution, I didn\'t really care about her. I was too focused on hating other minor characters. Some of her bits are amusing in Evolution-R and it\'s a shame about what happens to her in the end. Wouldn\'t have minded her sticking around since unlike a lot of Slayers characters, her development was pretty well done. To see that play out more would\'ve been nice.Nama - Name sound familiar to those who watched Slayers movies? At first glance, she\'s a pretty unique character, different from what I\'m used to seeing in Slayers anyway. She goes away pretty early meaning -1 minor character to annoy me. While I said she was unique I\'m sure if she stayed she\'d get to me. I\'ll never know though... Perhaps she would\'ve made the series better.Zuuma - Well, here\'s a bit of a problem. They don\'t really explain properly why he\'s after Lina. I\'m sure many hardcore Slayers fans figured it out but I wish they would\'ve straight out explained it. If you didn\'t watch the original Slayers you may guess right away why he\'s got a problem but you may not. Then you\'d just consider him a maniac but he had a somewhat good reason I guess as far as a villain\'s reasoning goes anyway. My thoughts on him, there were way better mid-series villains in Slayers. Hated how this fool kept running away. Although I guess that happens a lot with Slayers villains, what Zuuma added to the series seemed unnecessary.Enjoyment: The end battle seemed rushed and predictable but everyone took part in it and it was quite an explosive ending. Glad I watched it. So highlight episodes this time around are 10-13 as mentioned before. Got to take a look at Zelgadis\'s past which I definitely liked. Playing Give a Reason was awesome. Not bringing Duclis back (Even in the ending song/cameo part of the series) was a big plus. 8 should be a fair score. Wasn\'t perfect but it had its moments.Overall: Now this and Revolution together didn\'t have as much of an impact on me like the other seasons. I felt that people new to Slayers starting with Revolution or this half-season would not catch all the charm and quirks of the characters we saw from 10 years ago. I mean, c\'mon, Xellos didn\'t say ""It\'s a secret."" nearly enough in Revolution and Evolution-R... I\'m not saying it\'s a horrible show. Evolution-R was pretty fun to watch despite the flaws. As a followup to Revolution which I thought was a wreck, how could I be disappointed? I\'m definitely hoping they do more seasons that surpass this one. Let\'s just hope it doesn\'t take another 10 years, they have material to pull from so that\'s not an issue.Thank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped. very well and I could really feel for him. It was a great episode and really made me excited from that point on.

Hope this helped.', 'And I thought Revolution was bad...Evolution-R started off with much potential. The battle with Zuma, Zelgadis finally confronting the truth of his body, and the part with the talking armour, and the identity of the soul trapped in it.But all the strengths it builds vanishes at the end. Especially Xellos. They always want him to be on the ""good\' side. in Try, it made sense, and in Next. But for him to fight with Lina and the others in the final battle of this series was pathetic at best. First of all, Xellos would not sacrifice himself unless ordered to, and I don\'t care...what excuse you use, he wouldn\'t fight against his lord, even if it was a ghost or whatever. And the line where he compliments them is pathetic as well. Yes, he respects their power, but that was a bit much.As much as I love Xellos, the series would have been better if he wasn\'t in the final battle, or around much at all. And at the very end, when Lina uses that power, it is as if everything she learnt in the last two seasons was meaningless.Overall, if you love slayers, DO NOT subject yourself to these newest seasons, you\'ll only be greeted with disappointment and sadness.. what excuse you use, he wouldn\'t fight against his lord, even if it was a ghost or whatever.

Super GALS! Kotobuki Ran,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1728/Super_GALS_Kotobuki_Ran,"['Upon first hearing about &quot;Super Gals, &quot; I remember thinking to myself: What could this be about, super hero females that save the world from destruction? Hahaha, but no it is actually far from it!Story: 8/10Despite the story and characters taking place in Japan, they actually give off a much more &quot;American&quot; style of flavor. The story is all based around life as a teenage gal in Shibuya in the late 90&rsquo;s, so you know its all going to be about the platform shoes and loud accessories. Now there is no over all plot to this series, it ranges between slice of life, action and...comedy. Basically we watch 17 year old Ran Kotobuki (main character) living life as head of all Shibuya&rsquo;s turf. Its kinda interesting actually, because while she does run the show in town, she isn&rsquo;t in any particular gang. Or neither is anyone else (with the exception of two) for that matter, as it is more implied or referred to. Having an actual title that acknowledges gang activity, probably wasn&rsquo;t in their best interest to do. Anyway, as the story progresses she ends up having two school members; who later become her most trusted friends, join her in the mean streets of Shibuya. Despite this title not taking itself series in the very least, (its all about the over the top comedy) there is actually great chemistry between the characters, as love triangles and rivalries abound. And can range from the girls defending their turf from outsiders, to helping one another with family affairs, to just having fun by the pool side. One good thing can really be said about the story, the enjoyment comes from no one character alone, as they all have their own antics that keep the story entertaining. Still, as I said before there is no over all plot, and it soly derives from a plot by plot basis. The ending to this is okay, but since there really is no over all story going anywhere, the only difference between the first and last episode is the new characters they actually meet. Super Gals contains little in the way of offensive material, other than bad language which mostly comes from Ran herself.Art: 8/10I swear this is one of the most colorful titles I have ever seen in an anime. While the characters and environment just scream sharp, colorful, and well detailed distinctness. Some viewers may find it a bit too much on the eyes, as its all one big bright rainbow of colors and flashy loud outfits, which can be seen as a negative. Over all its great in the art department and defiantly gives detail to every piece of background it can, I just feel they may have gone over board a bit with the color scheme.Characters: 9/10Truly, Super Gals greatest heart comes from its characters, all of which are lovable in their own way! Considering this is definitely an over the top comedy anime, you may be surprised that the characters themselves know how to act series and calm when they want to, in fact many scenes have the girls going through some inner turmoil in their lives, whether it be their love life, family problems, situations at school and so on. They really do a fine job of taking you through many touching moments along with the comedy. Which you honestly don&rsquo;t see that often in titles like these. You&rsquo;ll also be pleased that all the characters are given their own unique personalities, from crazy, to moody, to strait faced.....its all here in one package. That along with great back stories that play every few episodes, you really get to connect with them and feel what they feel! While I don&rsquo;t feel it ever reached its utmost potential, the characters are no doubt lovable and fun to watch!Soundtrack: 7/10Certainly different than most music tracks you&rsquo;ll hear in an anime, as its all about a mix of Disco and techno styled par par, which play throughout the episode in the background! And once again it ranges from a loud hyperactive opening j-pop theme, to a suttle closing where the girl are in the rain seeming to contemplate life. While its definitely a mixed bag as to whether the whole par par disco theme is actually a good thing, most will agree that it fits with the anime style. Some of the actually voices in the Japaneses version, seemed to not match their personalities as well as they did in the dub. Which is pretty rare. Its an overall good soundtrack, but does have some negative things that hinder it as well.Bottom Line: 9/10While Super Gals won&rsquo;t be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, its excellent for those of us that are looking for a good laugh, and love the over the top comedy mixed with tender moments. Which truly is this title&rsquo;s strongest feature. Seriously, I both laughed and cried (don&rsquo;t tell anyone) while going through this anime. However, for those who prefer an actual plot with there viewings, or maybe prefer a more toned down comedy title, it would be best to avoid Super Gals, as it contains none of those two whatsoever! But if you dig this style of humor and sincerity in your series, then it is truly a satisfying experience! comedy.

Its an overall good soundtrack, but does have some negative things that hinder it as well.Bottom Line: 9/10While Super Gals won&rsquo;t be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, its excellent for those of us that are looking for a good laugh, and love the over the top comedy mixed with tender moments. Which truly is this title&rsquo;s strongest feature. Seriously, I both laughed and cried (don&rsquo;t tell anyone) while going through this anime. However, for those who prefer an actual plot with there viewings, or maybe prefer a more toned down comedy title, it would be best to avoid Super Gals, as it contains none of those two whatsoever! But if you dig this style of humor and sincerity in your series, then it is truly a satisfying experience!', ""Super Gals ReviewWriten by: ErisuStory:Ran Kotobuki is the self-proclaimed world's greatest gal, and she lives to shop, eat, and have as much fun as possible. But she's not all faux nails and Hawaiian jewelry; in the midst of all of her goofing off, she protects Shibuya from all manner of undesirable people, and she often devotes herself to helping both friends and strangers out of trouble, big and small. Of course, she'd rather be eating free food and scoring good deals on clothes, but getting someone out of a big pinch can be just as fun for her. Because of this, she's widely respected by...the denizens of Shibuya, and although she may look (and even act) a bit shallow, she's got a big heart and a sense of justice that could put her Police Chief father to shame. But she's not interested in that line of work, much to her family's dismay. All she wants is to hang out with her best friends Miyu and Aya, and continue being the world's greatest gal.The story from Super Gals is if you ask me, very original. How many times do you see a kick-ass shibuya-gal like Ran Kotobuki? This proves that girls aren't ''weak'' and can do more than you think. While watching this, I laughed very hard and loved Ran's personality. It does contains bad language and there are some random episodes but to be honest, I enjoyed every single bit of this.AnimationAbout the animation, it isn't ''outstanding'' and not everything looks perfect, but I think that you should just be satisfied with it. After all, this is an 2001-anime. When you judge it as an 2001-anime, this is pretty good. Super Gals also has an manga, and when you compare the anime with that, the anime looks better, doesn't it? Than, the characterdesigns. The main character is obviously: Ran. Her design is nice, and her hair is ''original''. We also see her with long hair later in the series, which looks better if you ask me. Anyway, Ran wouldn't be Ran if she isn't as she looks like. We also have Miyu and Aya, Ran's best friends. Their designs are also very well made, and I must say that they may look better than the main character, Ran. But you'll probably love Ran because of her personality, just as I did. Conclusion: The animation gets an 8 from me, the people who made this tried their best and did a really good job.Music and SoundSuper Gals has one opening-theme and one ending-theme. It stays the same from the beginning to the end. The opening-theme, Aitsu is sung by Jungle Smile and is a song which you'll get easily addicted to. It was a very good song to choose for this anime. The ending-theme, Dakishimetai, also sung by Jungle Smile was again, a very good song. I must say that I got addicted to the ending-theme to, but... I didn't saw the relation between the ending-theme and the anime. Well, I wasn't really disturbed by this fact, the song is nice so... not something to make a fuss about. Anyway, the soundeffects for this anime are good and I agree for with the backgroundmusic they chose for some scenes. I think most of you won't have something to complain about.CharactersFinally, the best point from Super Gals. I really loved them! Especially Ran was outstanding. She had everything and she showed me that girls aren't weak and can do something. I think that all of you will notice something in her: She hates school, never does her homework, makes up silly excuses why she didn't do her homework and her whole life is about fun! Shibuya's number one Gal. Every single familymember of Ran is/was an policeofficer. But Ran herself has no attention to become one, much to her parents dismay. She has an little sister (Sayo) and an older brother (Yamato). Yamato is Miyu's boyfriend. Yuya likes her but Ran is too dense to notice his feelings. After a while she gets into a relationship with Tatsuki which she calls ''monkeyboy''. Their relationship is more like an big comedy and you will laugh from the beginning to the end. Ray also seems to like Ran, even though Aya is in love with him. Well, now we go to Miyu, a very sweet girl with a very hard past. She was an gangleader and got into a fight with Ran. The winner will get Shibuya, Ran won. They both got into the hospital and when Miyu wakes up, she sees Yamato by her side (she met him earlier when she got arrested, Yamato is an policeofficer) and fell in love with him. Miyu let her criminal-life behind her and started again, thanks to Yamato. And than, last, Aya. At the beginning, she is a nerd who dates older men for money until she meets Ran who is willing to be friends with her. Ran saves Aya from her life that's only about getting good grades and learns her how to have fun! Aya joins Ran's Gal-group and starts to hang out with Ran and Miyu. Later she falls in love with Ray. Ray is known as ''number one'' and is loved by alot of girls. He meets Ran when she tries to steal his purse which she wanted, haha. He's a bit sarcastic but what he says is true. Who he really likes is revealed somewhere at the end of the series. Than, his friend, Yuya, called ''second place'' by Ran. He ended up second after Ray and also has alot of female-fans. His actions of trying to get Ran's attention are very funny! Wow, this is getting very long, I'll talk about one more character, Mami. She's Ikebukuro's number one Gal and sees Ran as her enemy. She picks up fights with Ran alot.. In reality, she lives in a huge maison and is the only daughter of the Honda-family. So, END! This lasted like forever, but I loved every single character of Super Gals.EnjoymentIsn't it obvious already? I enjoyed this very, very much! I wasn't bored even one episode. What you guys may not like is watching the English-dub. I did watch the English-dub and must say it was really good! Trust me, I hate English-dubs, I really do, but this was really good. If you can find the Japanese version with subs than that's fine too.. What I must warn you about is the bad language, I guess. If you're very formal and don't like words like ''dumbass'' than I don't think you should watch this. I wasn't disturbed by this at all, without it Super Gals wouldn't be just as good! Anyway, that's my opinion. You'll also see voilence in this, like people getting kicked KO, but when Ran kicks them, it rocks! ;3 This is one of my favourite animes ever, so... a 10!OverallThink I mentioned everything that was important by ''Enjoyment'' but the overall note stays a 10! Ran remains one of my favourite characters ever and she'll always have a special place in my anime-heart!

Don't look at me. Okay so I've watched about three episodes of this from On-Demand, and I've warmed up to it. It's witty, it's funny, at the same time it has a hint of drama to it. It's almost like a Shoujo &quot;Case Closed.&quot; What this show is about you may ask, more or less random things. It follows the day in the life of Ran Koribuki, an all Japanese Teenage Girl. She likes to shop, hang out, and other things. Both her parents and her brother are police officers, however she doesn't have any interest in becoming a &quot;blue...suit&quot; Ran also has a huge amount of self-respect, which is not something you see in most teenage revolved shows. Ran has two friends Miyu and Aya.Aya we are introduced to in the first episode, who turns out to be a subsidized dater. (Prostitute more or less) Ran helps her out such a situation, and sure enough they become friends. Aya is cool because she's brainy, but she also just wants to have fun, and is falling in love with Otahto.Miyu is an ex-gang baby, who is hopelessly in love with Ran's brother. (Who helped her get her life strait And they are boyfriend and girlfriend) Miyu is kind of strange, b/c she always addresses her self in the third person. But she's sweet and likable.But all besides that, they also hang around with two celebs. (One voiced by Greg Ayers) So this show is pretty good. Worth watching but I'm not so sure I would buy it. I've really just seen this all from &quot;ON-Demand&quot; and I think it's rather good. It really is almost like a shoujo &quot;Case Closed&quot; b/c Ran solves a lot of mysteries. And I like the fact it isn't riddled with vanity. Check it out.This show has some rather nice art and Animation to it, so you can enjoy that.Again regarding characters, Ran is one I actually like. Because she is not this bratty teen, who is so self-absorbed it's revolting. She cares about people, such as Aya, and her home town. Now if that isn't a good character, I don't know what is. I can't stand characters who are wrapped in their own vanity.This is a little more monderney type of Shoujo, so not much in the ways of a huge original score, but decent music.So I'd recommend it to you, watch it, it's really not bad at all. It's got comedy, with a very nice blend of drama. And not superficial drama either. Real drama, real problems. suit&quot; Ran also has a huge amount of self-respect, which is not something you see in most teenage revolved shows.

THIS PLACE IS EXACTLY LIKE SHIBUYA! :DSo I kept watching it, then they never finished on TV so I went online and looked up Super GALS & here it is!This is based a girl named Ran Kotobuki she ""owns"" shibuya and is the #1 GAL. She dresses very girly BUT she is actually very strong and defends anybody in trouble. & the story gets good after a while so I recommend this show.If you think its some girly girly show, guess what?...it is LOL but its not all abuot fashion & nails (: PLEASE WATCH THE JAPANESE VERSION INSTEAD. The dubs sounds RIDICULOUS o.o it is LOL but its not all abuot fashion & nails (: PLEASE WATCH THE JAPANESE VERSION INSTEAD. The dubs sounds RIDICULOUS o.o', ""I like the manga, but somehow I'm not quite satisfied with the anime. I don't know, maybe its the sub's quality that translate everything like Ganguro become Tan Face etc etc...Sometimes maybe the term should be left the way it is.The only thing that make me keep watching was Tatsukichi's 'Ookii' (his monkey expression is priceless) and the Junior Detective....So sorry to say, the manga are better..... "", 'Super gals is a wonderful slice of life anime that shows you the grow of the 3 main characters over the anime its covers a wide array of real life subjects abusive teachers to prostitution and how each character deal with the situation. I love Super Gals because its presentation is delivered superb and the pacing is top notch. You can check out my full video review at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPK2Q-rWB1g ', ""Super Gals i one of my favorite anime. Ran is a good role model for any teen girl in my opinion. she might be a greedy brat, but she knows what's right and wrong. I have a great respect for her.Anyway, you should check it out. I pretty sure anyone would enjoy it, unless you're not into comedy. (sorry still new to reviewing anime ^.^: ) "", 'For all you girls out there: Have you ever dreamt of strutting around in your town, driving away the wrong-doers and spreading some better karma around? Have you had to juggle your family expectations, your friends, your love life, your academics and everything else in between? Do you believe in female solidarity? Do you enjoy kicking some butt when there\'s some drama brewing? Do you love shopping, dancing and eating (a lot!)? Then you might just qualify to be the next super gal. The anime Super Gals tells the story of three best friends (or, you could say ""gals""): Ran, Miyu and Aya, who pretty...much run the town of Shibuya. Through their ups and downs, they live a very fun and eventful life, which was very entertaining to watch. Although I felt sometimes the characters seemed a bit shallow, and yes, some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but the overall story of Super Gals kept me engaged, and I really enjoyed the random drama in each episode. Note that this is a pretty standard shoujo comedy/romance (so if you\'re looking for something new and different, don\'t expect to find it here), but I\'ll still explain why I liked it.Story: 8/10At the start this really did look like a typical shoujo storyline: three girls who decide to be close friends, and who see each other through the trials and tribulations of a typical teenager life (whilst shopping, partying and making more friends along the side of course!). And in a way, that\'s exactly what you get for the rest of the series - 52 episodes of Ran with her aggressive happy-go-lucky attitude, Miyu with her lovey-dovey almost-wife-like romance with Yamato (Ran\'s police-officer brother) and Aya\'s gentle, yet hardworking, way of managing things. But, there is a subtle build-up throughout the episodes. Some fall in love, some fall out of love, and I guess some learn their life lessons through their relationships with each other. By reaching the end of the anime, I really felt like I\'d experienced another year in the crazy, glamorous and hectic (but fun) life of a highschool ""gal"".Art: 7/10I scored the art a little lower than I scored the other categories, mainly because I personally have a higher standard in terms of fluidity and style for shoujo anime. But having said that, I was still satisfied with the way the characters were drawn - they had cute expressions and the outfits really fit the retro vibe of the anime.Sound: 8/10Again, along with the art, the music was quite retro (I mean, the type of music you dance to in an aerobics class if you were in the 80s/90s). I actually really liked it! Maybe because I personally like that kind of para-para music and dance, but it certainly added a bit more flavour to the anime.Character: 8/10I have to say, as with most anime, the characters here are what kept me watching the rest of the anime. Ran\'s tough, but still extremely feminine, personality really drew me in - she shrugs off all expectations other people have of her, paves her own path and fights for the people she loves. She acts as an inspiration to most of the other characters in the anime, and should act as an inspiration for people watching the anime. The only problem is, she is still in highschool gal mode, so some of the things she said seemed pretty ditzy and shallow - especially how she only lived in the present and always seemed to want boys to treat her all the time. But hey, can\'t expect a highschool gal to be perfect, I still thought she was worthy of being the protagonist.I also liked the fact that the three girls had very different personalities. Ran\'s was by far the most established; Miyu and Aya started off almost as side-kicks, and then grew to be more comfortable with who they were by the end of the series.The boy troubles were so much fun to watch - especially with Yamato, Rei, Yuya and Tatsuki. The way Yamato secretly loves Miyu, the way that Yuya laments over Ran (who barely sees him as anything other than a friend), and the crazy lovey-dovey antics of Tatsuki add the romantic element to the anime. Sometimes, you get a glimpse through the boys\' eyes, which is refreshing. My favourite boy out of them though has to be Rei. I don\'t want to spoil anything, but whilst he seems cold and distant, he pushed Aya to become more than she was.But the action doesn\'t stop there: Ran also has mutliple rivals, Naka-sensei, her family of devout police-officers, and several other friends who add adventure to the storyline. Yes, towards the end there were still new characters being introduced, which was kind of annoying to keep up with, but I feel like it was still worth having a whole host of characters rather than focusing on just three main ones.Enjoyment: 9/10So I\'m finally up to my favourite part: telling you how much fun this was to watch! This is just one of those girly pick-me-ups that is so easy to watch. There are funny moments, and sad moments, but altogether, Super Gals was extremely entertaining to watch, even if some of the episodes were a little random. I will admit, this is a pretty stereotypical high school comedy. But this is the genre that I like, so this anime rated well for me.Overall: 8/10So overall, if you\'re looking for a comedy with lots of girl power (in a not too cheesy way), Super Gals might be worth a shot. much run the town of Shibuya.

Positive and negative.Here are some pros and cons:Pros:-Badass yet also role model main character-Relatable characters-Meaningful life lessons-Relatable storylines-Explores serious issues in an appropriate matter...-Lots of action!Cons:-Relationship with very questionable age gap-Petty drama-Very Repetitive-Frequent colorism (characters making fun of other characters because of their skin tone)Now time for the review!First, if you like gyaru fashion, want to learn more about it, or just like fashion in general, I recommend this anime. This is one of the few animes with gyaru characters that aren\'t sexualized Most of the episodes usually go the same way, there is in issue in the main character\'s (Ran) friend group and the issue is usually resolved within the episode. Many of these issues are serious, like stalking, pressure from family, abusive relationships, and more. However, most of these issues are usually handled incredibly well and even teach a life lesson. Within these episodes outside the serious topics, there is usually a lot of comic relief and side plots going on, some of these plots may or may not have to do with the main plot.Although I am appreciative of the good representation and educational storylines, there is still a lot of bad in it. One thing I immediately noticed in the age gap between one of the main characters, Miyu\'s relationship with another main character, Yamato. Miyu is only 16 while Yamato is 25, which in my opinion is very questionable. I just could never ship the two despite the show pushing them as a perfect pair because of the age gap. Another thing I didn\'t like is how the darker skinned gals, the ""ganguro trio"" are often just there to be the butt of the joke or the victims of Ran\'s beatings, serving little to the actual plot. One joke was even made about the gals being invisible in the dark because of their tan skin. The way their lips were drawn was weird as well. If you can look past or tolerate what I listed above however, watch away.Overall this anime was very interesting and is recommended if you like following the life of rebellious yet smart teenagers. -Lots of action!Cons:-Relationship with very questionable age gap-Petty drama-Very Repetitive-Frequent colorism (characters making fun of other characters because of their skin tone)Now time for the review!First, if you like gyaru fashion, want to learn more about it, or just like fashion in general, I recommend this anime.

It was very enjoyable and each character had a lot more depth to them than you would think from first impressions. I was also interested in their styles and fashion throughout the show. I really liked the relationship between the main character and the people she surrounded herself with. Although I am biased and dropped the show due to the fact that she didn't end up with the love interest I was rooting for, I would still recommend the show for those who have nothing else to watch.

Noblesse: Awakening,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32668/Noblesse__Awakening,"['There are several words that come in mind when trying to describe this ONA, and the most suitable one would be that it is hilarious, even with the underlying, or rather, main theme of this work: vampires and Frakenstein.  Yes, you read right, Frankenstein and his very master that awoke after his long slumber. It must be noted that is has its share of action as well. Noblesse: Awakening is an adaptation of the of the korean manhwa Noblesse.The story surrounding vampires is nothing new, yet the fact that it incorporates both Frankenstein and his master, Cadis Etrama di Raizel, is something I have...yet to see in the medium itself. What is actually intriguing is the fact that the ""master"" awakens in modern society, so there are naturally futuristic things he quite doesn\'t understand, which creates some very amusing situations.It also includes a good amount of well executed action, which came as surprise. For the matter, it is only 30 minutes long, so it isn\'t able to represent the scope of Noblesse, and thus is quite condensed, yet this serves to transmit well paced action sequences. However, this also means that there are a lot of things introduced that aren\'t explained to the viewer, which was to be expected.As for the characters, there is not much say besides that the main protagonist, the master of Frakenstein, is silent, cunning and ""badass"" character, which is quite pleasing to see. The supporting cast are composed of zombies and vampires, which are necessary for the setting, yet their motives or why they\'re there is unknown.Concerning the animation of this ONA, it is very well done, fluid motions and great choreography in the battle scenes. In addition the backgrounds were satisfying enough, including the character\'s designs which can be a bit generic, yet is a slightly different from what audiences are used to see. I might want to add that Frakenstein and the master are represented as ""bishonens"" yet without its typical personality, which to some may be a great addition - what usually is depicted as a malformed, is now a bishonen. As for the soundtrack, it was average, yet befitting of the anime, including the opening and ending.All in all, I really enjoyed this ONA despite its generic premise and I am certainly now inclined to read the manhwa of this piece - or rather, seeing an adaptation of the series, as the premise can turn out to be something interesting. I would definitely recommend anyone to check this piece out, it is only 30 minutes long; and you never know, you may end up liking it.Thank you for reading. yet to see in the medium itself.

I JUST wished they made it longer lol. I also gave it an 8 since the OVA hasnt...changed from the original storyline which was GREAT I say, since some of us knows that OVAs usually has another world of its own.ART: 10/10WOW. Just WOW. The art was very very GOOD. They really put a great effort in doing this OVA. And All I can say is, Great Job IG Prod. Great Job.The art was beautifully drawn and characters was also given proper animation. Im really amaxed on how they've done this. The art on this one is a must see.SOUND: 8/10There is no OST present. just some bgms which fits the story and every scenes.  do i need to say more?CHARACTER: 10/10EXCELLENT! I can kiss IG Productions for this. they've given judgement to the characters. even their voices!! Rai is so gorgeous so as Frankenstein. they really didnt stray to the original manhwa and still had given proper execution on every characters. Even the villains.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Literally, I'm screaming every scenes. I enjoyed it so much and never expected that the OVA was really good. Every scene and characters are pinpoint and it made me jumped every time. If you are one of the fan of the series I say give this OVA a go. Its worth it.OVERALL: 9/10I recommend those who read the manhwa to also take time to watch this OVA.

Its been a couple of years since i read the section of the...series that this ova covers but to put it in perspective this 30 minute ova tried to cover something close to 80 chapters of the manhwa, which to me seems like a bad idea on the behalf of the animation studio, but i do understand as not alot of action happened early on in the series and i guess they wanted to get to that because thats people want to see i guess.overall aside from the extremely bad pacing which ruined and took away from alot of the characters and the plot i enjoyed this and it was really great to finally see my absolute favourite manhwa being animated, although i feel like unless  youre a fan of the manhwa prior to watching this it may seem awfully generic and lacking. so my recommendation would be to read the manhwa atleast the first 80-100 chapters before you watch this.Story i would personally give an 8 because i can understand and i know alot of stuff that wasnt shown, but if i hadnt already read the series the story would probably be closer to a 6 tbh.the art was good, nothing amazing or interesting but good and enjoyableThe voice actors were all fairly good choices aside from maybe rai and m21 who both seemed to sound alot younger than they should of.anyway overall id give it an 8, but i can understand if alot of people really didnt think much of this. series that this ova covers but to put it in perspective this 30 minute ova tried to cover something close to 80 chapters of the manhwa, which to me seems like a bad idea on the behalf of the animation studio, but i do understand as not alot of action happened early on in the series and i guess they wanted to get to that because thats people want to see i guess.overall aside from the extremely bad pacing which ruined and took away from alot of the characters and the plot i enjoyed this and it was really great to finally see my absolute favourite manhwa being animated, although i feel like unless  youre a fan of the manhwa prior to watching this it may seem awfully generic and lacking. so my recommendation would be to read the manhwa atleast the first 80-100 chapters before you watch this.Story i would personally give an 8 because i can understand and i know alot of stuff that wasnt shown, but if i hadnt already read the series the story would probably be closer to a 6 tbh.the art was good, nothing amazing or interesting but good and enjoyableThe voice actors were all fairly good choices aside from maybe rai and m21 who both seemed to sound alot younger than they should of.anyway overall id give it an 8, but i can understand if alot of people really didnt think much of this.', ""I think that anime adaptions of manhwa and manhua are greatly encouraged due to a lot of them having really great stories to tell. One of these is noblesse which is a brilliant manhwa that uses something as generic as vampires and creates something extraordinary with these vampires. However, Noblesse Awakening while being an enjoyable watch, it does not capture the integrity of the source material.Of course I can't be too harsh, this ONA is only 30 minutes or so and its hard to pack the first 80 chapters of a manga into 30 minutes. Obviously I knew they were going cut out...much detail in an attempt to cram as much info into these 30 minutes as possible.Well let's start with the positives, one, the animation is pretty gorgeous. It was colorful and fairly fluent and I really loved the character designs. There were a couple of moments where j didn't care for the animation such as when Frankenstein was bowing down to Rai. The voice actors and music were also quite good and they both fit into the story. The action and comedy were also on point and they captured the essence of the series.The story was the most dissapointing part of the ONA. This was because they extracted an excessive amount of detail from the source material. All they really gave us is the framework of a great story. The same happened with the characters. They made it so blatant that they were skipping around that characters just appeared out of nowhere contrary to being properly introduced.Well in the end there isn't much to say. This ONA is good for people looking to get into noblesse and it was quite nice. However the way I see it you should only watch this if you've red a significant amount of noblesse because in the end all this is is an overblown commercial for the amazing manhwa. much detail in an attempt to cram as much info into these 30 minutes as possible.Well let's start with the positives, one, the animation is pretty gorgeous.

This time, is the same once again, with one of the most anticipated manhwa to grace the screen as an anime series (although this time it is a single ONA), Noblesse: Awakening.Now how did the story go, for a 30 minute ONA... If I could give an analogy to this, it would...be that it’s like an appetizer to a full course meal. Something that keeps you busy while we wait for a little moment (well hopefully soon) until the full course is ready.How was the actual story?Well, it started out with a Noblesse who goes by the name of Cadis Etrama di Raizel (or in short, just Rai) who has just awakened from a long deep sleep (820 years in particular). When he woke up, he met back with his servant (well, he calls him master) who is in charge of a high school. As in normal high school life, there is also people who love playing games. This is where one of my favorite scene came about where Rai was confuses with playing a video game. Even though it felt natural and logical to behave that way, since he is in a new era, it just felt too funny for me (since I’m a semi professional gamer myself). This is where, despite the lack of character development, since it’s an ONA, it felt like too rushed in my honest opinion. I wish there are more of these little funny scenes when and if they decide to come out with a full fledged TV series in the near future.The art is where the light shines upon in the anime. God damn, it’s beautiful. The character design, to the aesthetic of the building looked amazing. The opening scene was good too. Rai looking badass as his the top ladder of the vampire world. The sinister looking vampire could easily identified as the antagonist with his sly smile of his. The high schoolers in particular, looked like people from high school. So that is a nice neat touch to it.Overall, coming into the anime without any knowledge was a good experience in my opinion. It makes you eager to wait for a full anime series that is hopefully coming soon from Production I.G. There is some area lacking, like the pacing feels too rushed, the character development is a little bit lacking. However, I enjoyed every second of it.

Despite the positive things I heard about Noblesse, I couldn't help cringing when I saw the words “vampire” and “high school.” I thought, “Please don't be another Vampire Knight.” But it definitely didn't fit that category. It was far greater than that. Keep in mind that this is an OVA, so it only gives a taste of what to expect in the overall story. Some things aren't explained, but if you seen vampire anime like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, you can understand the vampires’...abilities and whatnot.It was more of a segment than a story. The highlight was the introduction to the Noblesse (Rai) and his importance in the vampiric world. After sleeping for 820 years, he returns to a world dominated by humans and their unusual normalities (e.g. video games). His reactions to first-time experiences in popular high school activities like video games were logical. The OVA presents his unique abilities from other vampires and what he's capable of. The pacing seems rushed with dramatic events happening shortly after Rai makes an appearance in high school, but it was actually pretty steady for a segment. There's not much time for character developments or getting to know the characters in general. The majority of the show consisted of fighting, so it concludes with discarding a somewhat irrelevant part of the story. Now all that's left is Rai’s life as a high schooler and the Noblesse, as well as the several other questions you may have.The background design is where the art truly shines. It's so well defined. The destruction in the show is constant and doesn't pause to emphasize a scene. It made it more realistic. The character designs were good. Production I.G did a good job with the bishounen protagonist. His red eyes, single ear accessory, and smooth shoulder-length hair were the characteristics that screamed “hottie” to me. The sinister vampires looked dominant over the others. I could tell their status by looking at them. The high school characters looked youthful. However, the art didn't reflect injuries much. Yes, it shows the usual draws as indicators of a character's pain, but it didn't connect with the vampires’ abilities. The vampires have brutal strength, so it makes sense to see crushed fingers or hands if they step on them with all their might. Plus the characters are able to move them despite the encounter. It lacks vampiric logic. The blood was too bright to be incarnadine.The instrumental bluesy OP suited this OVA’s premise. Anything more upbeat for this type of vampire anime would've ruined it slightly for me. The background music, crunching noises, and staticky sounds during fights were great. The ED, which was one of the background tracks, calmed things down. The seiyuu did a good job, too.I don't expect much from a short OVA, so I knew it would lack in some areas, including character development. I enjoyed it regardless. It definitely leaves you craving more. Hopefully, Production I.G will decide to take on a full anime adaptation in the future.

The thing that got me confused was that they changed some names Frankenstein, M-21 and M-24 and Razel stayed the same, but Shinwa, Ik-han and Yuna suddenly became japanese.There is no OST, but the music is good.

Well first and foremost, this is an OVA, not a movie. Please remember that. If you\'re looking for a fleshed-out, character growth-type of story/show, this isn\'t it for you. Now, if you\'re looking for a quick-fix of anime, this is it for yah.Let\'s start with the story. The producers did a really good job fleshing out the main points of the story line, and drawing viewers in. They also did a pretty decent job telling the story in about 33 minutes. Of course, because there was only 33 minutes, the story seemed extremely rushed. I found myself asking a...lot of questions at the end of the OVA. But then again, this is an OVA. The story gets an 8 from me though. I hope the good reviews of this OVA will give it the green light to be developed into an Anime. It definitely has the potential to be one of the best out there.Art. This is my favorite. The crisp drawing and colors really caught my attention. I\'m a stickler for art, and I can say this. The art really enhances the story line and the character\'s persona. Not to mention the fact that the animation is pretty freaking awesome too.I gave the characters an 7 because they all seem very interesting. I\'m quite interested in finding out Frankenstein\'s story and what he was doing while his Master was ""asleep."" I\'m also interested in Rai\'s story (obviously because he\'s the main character), and how he got to where he is now. Despite the interesting story\'s that the characters may carry, they all seem to lack any unique personality. Rai is the typical, ""cool-headed, bad-ass Master."" Frankenstein is the ""obedient, loyal, second-bad ass"" character and the others are your typical ""weak female, nerdy/geeky friend, and hot-headed \'I want to save the world\'"" characters. Of course, it was an OVA, so I guess you couldn\'t see much of their personality anyway... But still, if it does develop into an anime, I hope they do away with the un-original personalities and give us something with more substance.Overall, I really enjoyed the OVA despite it being extremely rushed. As mentioned earlier, I hope that the producers will be given the green light to develop this into an anime. The story line seems to have a lot of substance, and the art/animation is exceptional.

Plus, who doesn\'t need a good Vampire anime?', 'When I saw that my favorite manhwa got animated, I was so excited I could not speak. And I enjoyed it merely because I was waiting for this for so long. But let\'s face the reality: this OVA isn\'t too good. I liked the animation, though some characters look a little different. But the soundtrack and the scenario are terrible. They threw away all hilarious and positive moments that made me love this manhwa so much, and left only the battle scenes (which looked pretty decent btw). They also minimized the plot and changed lots of detailes. Of course you\'d say ""How do you expect...them to put 80 chapters into a 30-min OVA?"" Well the answer is: the shouldn\'t make it into an OVA in the first place. In my opinion if you decide to do something, do it well. This manhwa deserves a full anime adaptation, with cool soundtrack.But as I said earlier, I still enjoyed it because it\'s better than nothing. them to put 80 chapters into a 30-min OVA?""

I can confirm that the (supposed) full adaptation will be exciting if the animation consistency is maintained in the next adaptation.Story: 9/10Compared to the Manhwa, the adaptation seems more descriptive and explanatory such as the beginning scene where the fisherman fish Rai's Coffin from the seas (which reminded me of JJBA part 3 beginning, fishing a coffin from the sea after 100 years) The episode skips all the tiny details such as Rai adjusting to the vocabulary and South Korean honorifics in his first interaction in Frankenstein's school and also...Shinwoo's first interaction was cut short. There are many large segments missing from the Manhwa that would have made the overall background of the story make more sense such as the concept of enhanced humans which would have already been explained by 16-20min into the episode. However, for a webtoon adapting into an anime this did extremely well and I was satisfied with every detail of it especially when Rai and Jake have their 'KNEEL' scene. Although, it was much more badass in the manhwa when Rai did it. Overall great story so far (I'd say it sums up 40+ chapters within 30mins which is very hard especially when including the most important details)Art & Sound: 8/10For an adaptation of a manhwa, both are exceptionally done. There is a heavy use of CGI in the episode which is noticeable but it makes movements more realistic and smooth. Hearing the VA of Jake is exactly what I expected Jake to sound like which was satisfying but seeing Jake alive for the second time hurts a lot..Character: 7/10As mentioned earlier, it was a tough choice to condense a large amount of the manhwa into a single episode but the decisions made were amazing since the main story line is still intact and any further addition to plot (such as Rai getting used to Korean or at the PC arcade) might be considered spoiler to a few people. However, to condense the plot is fairly simple but condensing character development, especially Rai's badass character development in the manhwa was pretty painful. Nonetheless, very promising Rai VS Jake scenes - I'm excited for the full adaptation.Enjoyment: 10/10No need to say anymore, one of the best Manhwa out there.

Jojo's Bizarre adventure accomplishes more in 5 minutes than this show did in 30 with its nuanced storytelling and unrelatable MC. When the most impressively tenacious and brave character in the episode is the bro character you know your powers of characterization is weak. The opening was good. The art featured a lot of these bright atmospheric shades but suffered from frankly boring choreography and stiff movement. It's a nice way to whet your appetite and a good time killer but not what I would describe as a springboard into the...manwha. manwha."", ""Well, I have been a very diligent reader of the webtoon/manhwa for a long time now. I remember how this started when I was still in middle school (now i'm in uni. GOd knows how many times I 've read this over and over again), and as such a fan, I must say that the animation could not hold all the aspects of the original. However, that is understandable as this is simply an OVA. The manhwa itself possesses so much more charm than this. So, I beg those of you who perhaps disliked the animated version, please go read the manhwa! Because it may...just feel like a rush of episodes(well, it practically is though) without the character development if you don't know the original story.Anyway, as for the overall manhwa itself, Noblesse has the Overpowering Main Character with the looks. But that does not mean that the story doesn't build up. There are many mysteries and twists regarding the characters as well as some maybe-a-little-cliche-but-still-awesome emotional moments. It is true may readers have complained about the pace of the story development as well as how some characters seem to lose their importance. Regardless of such complaints this manwhwa definitely is a masterpiece.ANIME REVIEWStory 9/10Apart from the fact that the animation felt too rushed and fast paced, it was good. However, I wish they would have focused a little more on the mystery why Rai was asleep for such a long time so that the audience could crave for more. (I really want this to become more than just an OVA).Art 8/10I can't help but compare the animation to the manhwa. I was excited to see the action scene come alive (too fast paced still) but apart from that I was quite disappointed at how less attractive the characters looked, especially Rai and Frankenstein. Both of them needs a little more of the elegance, the aura of a noble. (I will explain further on the character part) Too bad the anime could not show this through the screen.Plus, what happened to Frankenstein's beautiful long wavy hair?Sometimes Rai's body proportion also looks off at times, as well as his face.Sound 8/10To be honest I didn't mind the opening song but, it kind of felt out of place somehow. The ending was a little too boring, reminded me of the ending song of The Avengers. I could see the ending credit rolling up. Besides that, the sound was good enough to create that ominous vibe.Character 8/10As mentioned before, it is too fast paced for the animation to fully depict all the characters. In other words, there wasn't enough time for a character build up. With this in mind, the anime did hint quite well with their characters. The only disappointment would be the fact that because of the pace, Rai looks like more of a talker than he is. Plus, he isn't supposed to show much emotion but in the anime it felt like he was a little more up beat than he usually is. Plus, I wish they could have shown the psychopathic characteristics of Frankenstein a little more.Enjoyment 9/10As a fan of the manhwa I might be a little biased here, but I enjoyed it very much. I was squealing even before the start so...Well I wish there were longer action scenes as well as better explanation, but then again this is an OVA. Can't help it so thus the -1.Overall 9/10Again, I may be a little biased, but in the end I just knew that this was a 9.Besides, as a Korean reader, it was a little sad to watch it in Japanese, but the voice actors were great that I have no complaints.To be honest the OVA felt more like a promotion video to suggest people to read the manhwa to me. In other words, you probably will not be satisfies just with the anime. If you haven't read the manhwa, you'd definitely not understand why I'd give this a overall 9.If some anime production company decides to make Noblesse into a series, I hope they take a lot more into consideration. just feel like a rush of episodes(well, it practically is though) without the character development if you don't know the original story.Anyway, as for the overall manhwa itself, Noblesse has the Overpowering Main Character with the looks.

Seeing how this was a OVA you know a lot of the studio's budget would be going into this one episode, since the studio wouldn't want a potential anime to fall flat in its Ova. So with this in mind the Art and sound were quite good. The Art was in line with (at least in my opinion) what every anime should be looking like in the year 2016. As for the sound i tend to mark sound based or whether or not it  was noticeable, because all the anime i watch have sound but the good...animes are able to use the sound to add to the viewing experience. In 'Noblesse' the studio was able to accomplish this as the action scene gained quite some suspense with the sound that was added meaning it was used well.As for the story it left quite a lot to be desired. Now this can be used to dive deeper in to the story a.k.a making someone want to read the manhwa or it can be used as a excuse to be done with the series in and of itself. As for what made the story interesting i must say it is the originality of it to the extent of what a 'Noblesse' is.  Meanwhile one can easily drop this series in the thought of  'i've been here and saw this already' due to its use of a cliched plot with vampires. It is because of this average-to-good plot that i decided to mark the story as a 6 (fair).

Some scenes didn't make any sense, like when Rai gave the teenagers Frankestein's picture, and also when the kidnappers sent Frankenstein a message! The only part that was okay in the direction was the fight sequence.There isn't much to talk about the story.

He\'s the handsome badass, we all need in our lives. Or I just need him. Well, who knows. Anyways. He does not talk that much. He doesn\'t talk at all most of the time....So back to the story.

Dr. Crombell for instance, one of the main antagonists of the series and the reason for M.21 and M.24 to be hostile towards the ""Union"" wasn\'t even introduced. What the f. was going on.

Why?It should be explained WHY Marry and Jake were sent.Also, what was going on M.24 is suddenly all ""Sorry, I wanted to kill you first girl, but now I will just rescue you"". That was like ENTIRELY different in the webtoon.M.21 and M.24 DO NOT know that he is the Noblesse also NO one actually knows what or who the Noblesse really is? That part was especially fucked up. If everyone knows who he is and the ""Union"" also knows that he is the Noblesse, - well done - 2/3 of the ORIGINAL story are now worthless.The original concept was changed an effing lot to fit into the 30 min time frame - I can understand that is was meant like a preview for further projects maybe. Either way it\'s not really well adapted.Art: 8Looks amazing. I didn\'t expect any less of I.G. Production. Still, the ""blood""  looked ridiculous in many scenes.Sound: 6I don\'t know. I think - in my humble opinion - it din\'t fit into the anime. They should have sticked to a more ""classier"" approach towards the series. Rai is like old, not just old he is like ancient. The whole Baccano ""feel"" wasn\'t my cup of tea.Character: 4Rai was speaking to much. He shouldn\'t be talking at all. He was like very open towards everyone. Sorry but the whole premise of the series is HIM OPENING UP. Rai gets to knowing the humans. He starts to understand what it means to live among men.Enjoyment: 5It wasn\'t all bad. It was decent.

As a longtime fan of the manwha, I was seriously excited when I saw there was an adaptation. I settled down for what I thought would be a treat.I was majorly disappointed.This adaptation tried to mash the first 80 or so episodes (aka chapters) of the manwha/webtoon into 30 minutes. 30. MINUTES. As such, the pacing is so rushed and so much is cut out that it's left a major mess. On top of all that, the acting is so poor that it's difficult to suspend my disbelief and...invest in the story. That, plus that hackjob animation, was so distracting that I finally turned it off before I had even finished it.If you watched this and thought it was interesting, then go read the manwha. The manwha has great characters, decent pacing, enjoyable humor, and amazing story. But this adaptation was nearly as disrespectful to the source material as The Last Airbender movie was to Avatar: the Last Airbender tv show. Seriously. Go read the Webtoon. invest in the story.

I dive into this anime blindly, expecting to be somewhat like Vampire Knight. I also had prepared myself to be disappointed but boy, I was wrong.Plot line: 7It's not exactly original. After reading tones of fanfics and mangas, I can say it's typical. But what's good in this story is there's no romance involve at all.

Too bad there's no continuation to this short movie."", 'Going to make this real short since it\'s almost time to scream out ""Happy New Year"" to the people I probably won\'t like.If you have any intention of watching this show, do it only if you\'ve read the webtoon (roughly 100-200 chapters of it). Otherwise, and I\'m being rather forgiving here, you\'ll find the episode absolute chore, save for perhaps a few scenes of action.Storytelling-wise, this is a pretty bad OVA, if I\'m being honest. Considering everything they crammed in this thing, they could have actually made an entire regular season. What they did, in a nutshell, is take a bunch of scenes...from the webtoons, animate them, and put them in a relative, chronological order. They took several arcs, and tried to mold them into a single, cohesive one. Because of this, both fans of the webtoons and just fans of anime suffer, since there\'s absolutely 0 set-up to anything that occurs, pacing is complete shit, there is 0 background to anything and anyone, and, overall, absolutely nothing will make sense unless, again, you\'ve read the chapters they\'re trying to cram into 30 minutes special. I\'m actually being quite forgiving by giving the story here \'4\', because if it was a standalone episode without any background, it\'d be the most decisive zero I\'ve ever given in my life.Pretty much the only reason you\'ll watch this is art and animation, so let me touch on that briefly. In terms of artstyle, it\'s exactly the same as with webtoon, although I felt it was slightly darker, or rather director/whoever decided to focus solely on the dark-themed parts of the webtoon, hence why for some reason I felt the entire color palette took a dip to the darker shades. Animation wise, to be honest, I expected more. Action scenes were brief, and save for maybe 2-3 or animations, most others felt like something you\'d see in your everyday action anime. Absolutely nothing in terms of animation stands out, and they even had to opportunity for it since they decided to fast forward some chapters to get to the fights that were slightly more interesting. Overall it\'s definitely above average, but nothing you didn\'t see in about 10 shows this year alone.In terms of characters, it\'s the same thing as with the story: I\'m giving a huge leeway here by giving it the score I am. Also, same as the story, if it were a standalone product, absolute 0 without a second thought. Every character is randomly flung at you without any set-up, there isn\'t even a whiff of character arc, and the most \'development\' you get are from two pseudo-villains, and even that is composed of 2-3 relatively ambiguous flashbacks that offer absolutely nothing unless, again, you\'ve read the webtoon.Overall, I did actually enjoy Noblesse: Awakening. Would I have enjoyed it if I didn\'t read the webtoon? Definitely not. This short OVA should have been focused on introducing people to one of the better webtoons out there, and instead they decided to give the already established fans 30mins of what\'s actually a pretty average thing. We know we won\'t be getting a full season any time soon, so we weren\'t in the absolute need of getting the animated version of ... uhm Jake and Mary? fights. Too much was skipped in order to give fans \'something\', and absolutely nothing was established well enough for the people who\'ve never heard of the webtoon to give a single fuck for it after watching this.Let not the \'6\' overall fool you. If you\'ve never read the webtoon, this will probably linger around 2-3 AT BEST, as it feels like a slideshow of a few scenes that kind of connect, during which absolutely nothing makes sense.Off I go to get drunk alongside people I shouldn\'t.

Sakura Quest,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34494/Sakura_Quest,"['P.A. Works has been experimenting with a lot of ideas in recent years. Shows that focuses on coming of age storytelling, collaboration projects that adds a touch of fantasy to its world setting, and even mecha from their recent 15th anniversary project. Advertised as an anime about a “working series” involving people and jobs, one can’t help but relate to their previous works such as Hanasaku Iroha and Shirobako. However, Sakura Quest is also very distinguishable on its own.As an original anime running for a span of 25 consecutive episodes, Sakura Quest has plenty to offer despite the simple premise. The idea of taking...a young girl to a new place with a big responsibility on their shoulders strikes intriguing. I mean, the idea can even be relatable like the time when you had to bear a big responsibility like being the class president or organizing a sports event. For Yoshino Koharu, she reluctantly becomes the Queen of Manoyama after a case of mistaken identity. Now, she bears the responsibility to help reinvigorate Manoyama, a town with an economic struggle. Following this coming age adventure, I can safely say that Sakura Quest intelligently crafts its story with its cast of characters.A main part that attracted me to this show is the five main characters – Yoshino, Maki, Sanae, Shiori, and Ririko. They come from different backgrounds with different personalities. However, they all share the same goal and that’s to help the tourism agency reestablish Manoyama. Now I have to admit, it took me a little time to accept these characters. They each have their own personal problems. These range from graduating without a job or money, job depression, a rootless goal of a dream career, dealing with a town that gradually fades away, and living a life of isolation. In many ways, these social issues are very relatable. Think about it. Ask yourself the question: “have I ever faced one of these problems before?” Even if you haven’t, I’m sure you know someone or heard of someone that does. I can honestly confess that this problem exists in my life at one time. The bottom line is, Sakura Quest’s realism in exploring social issues is very realistic and we can all relate to them in one way or another.The storytelling itself brings promise from the first few episodes. It establishes the setting, objectives, and reasons for the characters’ roles. It has a plot that follows a well-crafted pacing to make us appreciate its themes and emotions. At many times, I feel connected to the episodes’ intentions as it interconnects them with the characters. Even the characters themselves often question about certain purposes and the actions they take. The most noticeable character is Yoshino as she is the leader and surprisingly enough, she does possess leadership skills. As the leader, Yoshino wonders about her purpose as Queen of Manoyama and carries a big burden on her shoulders. What impresses me about Yoshino is that she always wants to improve. Whether it’s success or failure, Yoshino is a girl with a determined attitude and gets back up when life knocks her down. And that’s what it takes to be successful in life. On the other hand, the overlay of the plot sometimes feels lacking with anticlimactic resolutions. I also have to admit that the sub-plots in this show could need more work for improvement.The other characters in the show each have their own distinctive roles as well. Shiori is a member of the tourist board so compared to others, she has more knowledge about Manoyama. Maki, the inspiring actress, struggles to secure a job and in some ways, I think her role in the show is very relatable to others. The idea of trying to obtain a dream job is something I’m sure most of us can relate to. Then, there’s Ririko, an isolated girl that locks herself away from society. She has low self-esteem and serves as the antithesis of a tourist. Finally, I have to admit that Sanae’s role in this show is perhaps the most mature among the main cast. With her experience from working from Tokyo previously, she can be seen as a de facto leader. In essence, these characters’ roles individually define them and amplifies personalities. It also does a neat job with clever background storytelling. Even some of the minor characters outside of the main circle gets spotlight in this show. For instance, Ushimatsu Kadota, the board and director of Manoyama often makes Koharu and the others perform difficult tasks. Erika, a sharp witted girl brings in a lot of the drama in the latter half of the show. Among the tourists, it’s also rather intriguing to see their interests.On many different fronts, I think Sakura Quest delivered its entertaining values just right without missing its mark. The comedy comes out naturally and doesn’t feel like it’s forced down viewers’ throats. This is accomplished with the usage of the show’s mascot, the chupacabra. Entomophobia also becomes a source of humor with certain characters. In addition, I think it’s important to realize that the tourist attractions themselves contain entertainment value as the main cast tries to make the most of them. Whether it’s success or failure, it’s how we see these characters strive to improve themselves and make Manoyama a better place. It inspires hope and the show has a strong attitude.The studio does it again. P.A. Works’ production quality is sharply appealing with its effective coloring, character models, and backgrounds. Manoyama is actually based on Nanto city in the Toyama Prefecture in Japan so it come as no surprise that some of the buildings and backgrounds look similar. Character designs looks mature for their age and doesn’t rely on cheap cardboard fan service to bring them to life. In addition, the show also decoratively make the characters look attractive as many of the female cast wears diverse clothing each episode. Character expressions aren’t over exaggerated but instead reliable as it’s cleverly timed.Even the soundtrack for the majority of this anime makes sense and invites attention whenever it’s used. Theme songs has a very coming of age feel and rhythm. The OST is cleverly paced that matches each scene to bring the most out of them while character voice mannerism really sounds convincingly real. Koharu’s voice plays an important role as she is the Queen and I must admit, the VA performed her role quite well to bring her character to life. Among others, Maki also impressed me as her voice matches her personality perfectly. As I took notice of this show more and more, it really has a lot of personality and each episode showcase of that with its character voices.Sakura Quest is an underrated gem that probably slipped from the radar this year. Some of P.A. Works’ series delivered questionable content in recent years but Sakura Quest proves that their original anime can still be valuable. The show takes many thoughtful ideas and molds them together to create this insightful story. With its strong circle of characters, realistic storytelling, creative themes, and high production elements, it really brings a golden slice of life anime that can be recommendable to almost anyone. With 25 episodes, you can sit back and relax to enjoy this with its easy pacing. The show is like a quest that takes these characters and embarks them on a life journey. a young girl to a new place with a big responsibility on their shoulders strikes intriguing.

Works did it again! With a fresh and enjoyable concept Sakura Quest managed to distinguish itself   from the regular seasonal shows through its original concept .  With lovely and adorable characters, with an emotional and soothing atmosphere, Sakura Quest is an anime that focuses on  promoting tourism in a rural area  called Manoyama.A story is always passed down from a person to another during  the passing time. Sakura Quest makes no exception to this rule and  each...character has his own story to tell. Their stories filled with happy or sad memories, filled with regret, filled with on spot decisions, filled with experience or reckless youth, filled with morals and lessons are the essence of Sakura Quest. What makes Manoyama  a place to live are not the houses or buildings but the people. With this in mind Sakura Quest presents the lifestyle and experiences of the people who give a reason and meaning for why Manoyama needs to be saved.Let’s talk about the characters, who without them the story cannot be passed down in Sakura Quest.  Different circumstances  and experiences led our 5 main female characters to meet with each other and work together. Despite having different points of view and personalities they influenced each other in a good way  discovering  what they really love to do for the common goal they  set their minds on .The anime does a great job of fleshing out their characters during each task they do for the purpose of promoting tourism. It also takes advantage of that and explores  the surroundings presenting the mundane lifestyle of its inhabitants.  Manoyama and the people who live there are peeled  of their secrets just  like the skin of an apple. I like how they used a local legend passed down through generations to flesh out Riri’s character and create an emotional attachment between her story and the viewers:” The dragon, surrounded by friends, smiled just a little”.Manoyama holds different meanings for each character, for outsiders like Koharu and Sanae is a place where they  can find their own identity, a place where they found their true selves and what they like to do after running from the suffocating life of Tokyo. For people who spend all their life in Manoyama  it means everything to them putting a value on the traditions held there. Manoyama is also a place where people found love and established a family, a place of meeting and farewells. You can notice from each characters experience and story how Manoyama holds a special place in their heart.Sakura Quest values patience, perseverance and innovation during the process of change that Manoyama goes through. Although the mindset of the people and the system cannot be changed overnight it takes time to do that, the small steps that our characters achieve during each task later on will have a great contribution for the whole image. The bounds and how each character works as a whole to make the change possible for their hometown is one of the strong points that Sakura Quest is worth praising for.One of my favorites themes that I must mentioned is the conflict between modernism and traditionalism but also the collaboration between those two. They are portrayed through the stubbornness of a woodcarver's work who is  used  as the first step for the Sakura Pond project . Another good example would be how they used the modern technology to improve the current lifestyle of the old population from Manoyama thus making their daily activities easier.The  characters art style  is adorable and gives a soothing feeling to your heart, the details used for the background scenery and  buildings captivates your eye and  takes you into a fleeting state of melancholy, the relaxing and slow paced ost combined with the characters story creates an emotional atmosphere and  manages to steal your tears away and put a smile on your face. As the story progresses you will fall in love with them and they will hold a special place in your heart .Sakura Quest is the perfect medicine after having a hard day, it manages to put a smile on your face, it motivates you and makes you cheer for the boldness and reckless characters, it takes you away on a trip of feels combined with relaxing ost and stunning visuals and in the end it gives you a lesson about life, decisions and a lot of morals to learn from them.

Thank you P.A. Works for such a great anime!"", ""Sakura Quest an anime that shows us the simplicity of the life. We don't need fights, powers, weird plots to like a story. We just need a connection with the characters and a story that creates a living relationship with us.How many times have we confronted problems, challenges, and feelings that affect our decisions and all around us? Sakura Quest answers that question and gives us an example in a very creative way. One day we hate our work, and the next we could start loving it as happened with Yoshino and this group of women with unique skills that complement between them. The need...to save Manoyama united this group, and they will fight hard for a common purpose on a daily basis. No matter their failures or the challenge this group will continue fighting to achieve their goal.The art is marvelous. They add several details to all the persons involved in the animation. They didn't try to create a fantastic weird animation. They focused on the simplicity. Their goal was showing an animation that could be compared with our real life, and they succeeded.The soundtrack, the OP and ED songs from both seasons are good. The sound mix is well executed on the right time. The combination of music and narrative highlights the emotions of the characters.  The correct pacing created a fluid motion combined with a beautiful soundtrack that reflects the talent of the production group.The characters could be the strongest part of this animation. I consider them as ordinary persons with some remarkable skills but with problems and fears. Yoshiko is a girl that arrived at Manoyama from a big a city, and she isn't satisfied with being there. She has a significant change after some time, similar to us when we arrive at a new unexplored place. After all, we are human beings that aren't perfect as these characters, but we could change our mind and our emotions no matter the adversities. Same with the other part of the cast that is simple but with their problems and differences.The final MAL score doesn't give a real merit to this animation. Someone could consider this plot boring and tedious, but the point of the anime is the experiences on a regular daily basis and the hard work needed to complete a goal no matter how simple it is. I recommend that you watch the first episodes and don't give up with this animation, it is worth the time. to save Manoyama united this group, and they will fight hard for a common purpose on a daily basis. No matter their failures or the challenge this group will continue fighting to achieve their goal.The art is marvelous. They add several details to all the persons involved in the animation. They didn't try to create a fantastic weird animation. They focused on the simplicity. Their goal was showing an animation that could be compared with our real life, and they succeeded.The soundtrack, the OP and ED songs from both seasons are good. The sound mix is well executed on the right time. The combination of music and narrative highlights the emotions of the characters.  The correct pacing created a fluid motion combined with a beautiful soundtrack that reflects the talent of the production group.The characters could be the strongest part of this animation. I consider them as ordinary persons with some remarkable skills but with problems and fears. Yoshiko is a girl that arrived at Manoyama from a big a city, and she isn't satisfied with being there. She has a significant change after some time, similar to us when we arrive at a new unexplored place. After all, we are human beings that aren't perfect as these characters, but we could change our mind and our emotions no matter the adversities. Same with the other part of the cast that is simple but with their problems and differences.The final MAL score doesn't give a real merit to this animation. Someone could consider this plot boring and tedious, but the point of the anime is the experiences on a regular daily basis and the hard work needed to complete a goal no matter how simple it is.

It\'s in the same vein as Shirabako and many who watch it draw comparisons between the two of them, however, they aren\'t all that similar and ultimately while Shirabako works, Sakura Quest doesn\'t.Sakura Quest has a really neat idea. The idea of these young women all with different backgrounds coming together to help out this town is a good basis. It\'s not overdone and it works well with the story that Sakura Quest is trying to tell. However, the execution of that story was missing. While there...are good moments that are able to detail the decay that happens as everyone moves to the city and what to do about it, there is also a lot of wasted time. A lot of it. Some episodes aren\'t able to make that point as well, or can\'t execute it. There is also a lot of plot filler. While those ""filler"" episodes are more notable for the characters, they do stall the plot, and sometimes it feels like the group is running around in circles rather than moving forward. In fact felt like a whole lot of circling and not a whole lot of getting anywhere. Furthermore, some of the plans that they have are pretty terrible or don\'t seem to aid in renewing the own at all. It feels like this interesting plot idea never fully got the focus and power that it could have in the end.Furthermore, it lacks in feel, while shows like Akiba\'s Trip capture the busyness and obsession of Akihabara, and Non Non Boyuri captures the life of the sticks, Sakura Quest doesn\'t capture the life of its small decaying town. While it\'s obvious that it is one and I don\'t feel true immersion into the town itself. And for a show that is about that town, it\'s a problem.The characters are really hit or miss. While they are given enough room to grow at times, it does feel like their development is often uncut by other plot lines or the annoying parts that surround some of the episodes. Some of the side characters can be really annoying. Some of the male characters in particular act in pretty annoying ways, that seem to do nothing more but point out how pathetic they are. One or two would have been fine but a lot of minor Sakura Quest characters fill this role, the worst of the lot being a serial butt grabber. Added onto that it can sometimes go for cliches in the worst of way. While Sakura Quest is trying to tell a more serious story it would insert in these childish cliches with no added value from them. They\'re played completely straight and completely generically. While it might have worked in a more childish show, the confliction and annoyance between these elements and Sakura Quest\'s more serious ideas didn\'t work well overall. While the characters did develop and grow, I never felt an attachment to that development, nor did I feel much from it. The execution of those moments was bland and lackluster, which is disappointing because if they were done right they could have been really good.The presentation is standard and it doesn\'t really help with the standard feel that it has. It never really excels at any point, and sadly that\'s too it\'s weakness. If it were more stylized I think it might have portrayed the town more accurately and powerfully. This show needed some richness to it. Each part was built up so blandly. And while that might reflect their idea of what their city was like... I don\'t think that\'s true. Each city has its own character and unique life to it. And while they explain some of that they don\'t fully express it. I can\'t feel the richness of it. It\'s the same with the characters. I can see some good development, but I can\'t feel it. And without being able to feel it, it doesn\'t work.

A. Works' best title; they might be trying to re-create that magic, albeit in a wildly different setting. If you liked that show, and want more of Cute Adults Doing...Responsible Things (with Pink Miyamori this time!), you should definitely give this a go.Elaborating on the setting: The MC ends up being appointed as the 'Queen' of a rural town which had once styled itself as the Kingdom of Chupakabura, in an ill-fated attempt to re-invigorate its dying tourism industry. We follow her as she attempts to bring it back to life with the help of her newly-made friends and some peculiar townsfolk. It presents a fine puzzle to the viewers, which serves as a vehicle to introduce themes like rural depopulation, urban vs. rural life, the quiet decay of traditional art, tradition vs. avant-garde, and something as universal as finding a purpose in life.If you like slow-burning Slice of Life shows with less drama, more natural conversation, lots of interspersed comedy and characters who are interesting because they feel real, this is for you. You can find your weekly dose of wholesomeness here. Tentatively 8/10 overall.P.S.: The only fanservice you will find here is that the main cast gets a rich and varied wardrobe.

I enjoyed to watch this anime because I like work genre anime. Especially if MC live and work in village or mountain area. Just like Hanasaku Iroha, Barakamon, etc. So the first story is nice, a girl who cannot find a job in Tokyo go to Manoyama to becoma a Queen in local area (Who can expect this one? lol), found some friends and interesting things with a job in there.Art : 8.5/10Who can deny this one? P.A. Works original anime art always attractive in my eyes. Remember Shirobako character art or Hanasaku Iroha...nature art? P.A. Works keep their quality in this aspect. Just for info, I started want to watch this anime after I saw Yoshino standing on the ricefield with coronet in her head posters. (^^)Sound : 10/10Yeah, this one I can help it. But from the start, the opening song and video was so good. I just think I won't ever skip the opening for Sakura Quest. It's not only opening, BGM or sound effect also well done. And it's not stop there, Sakura Quest also give us a beautiful ending song.Character : 7/10It's not that bad actually, just because all of 5 warriors character actually seen in other anime. Yoshino as an energetic girl, Shiori as an airhead girl, Ririko as a silent girl, Sanae as adult girl, and Maki as a cool girl. Actually I need some new character in this anime. As I expect in P.A. Works original work anime. So it's good, but I expect something new in this anime.Enjoyment : 8/10I just don't know yet how to say about this one. Because I just watch 5 episodes yet. But so far this show really interesting for me. As I said, it always based on personal taste. But this one actually potential enough to become one of best working anime in the future.Overall : 9/10Maybe for some people, this show is a kind of boring (I'm not making an irony for one of the threads) but If u want to watch working anime, slice of life in the village anime, or want to know how interesting to live in japanese village, I recommend this one. nature art?

Actually just rewatched it again after 4 years and overall from production quality to storyline all still hold up well even up against latest anime. I\'ll try to elaborate without too much spoilers.This anime bring few of notable parallel theme that contrast each other, being playout through whole season where it touch stuff that people could related to our real adult life. whats great more is both side of contrast is not wrong.:1. Abnormal vs...Normal - the main character Koharu Yoshino and other related character didnt want live her life as \'normal\' as other people, meanwhile through the story, there are peoples who not bother to be abnormal, and prefer to be normal who enjoy being as one. both side not wrong.  there also self acceptance for example is character like Ririko who is totally different than others. she always wondering if it okay if she is a weird. but everyone need just to be themself. these unique character is not something wrong to behave at.2. Outsider vs Local - outsider, who unknown to local tradition and way to do things, can see things and doing things differently vs local who some of it reject different way or cant see other path. for example the main character is outsider, who can do stuff only outsider can and see. to revitalize the town, they need both local and outsider way of doing things. local also has their way which is outsiders cant do. both side are needed each other for example Shiori who do what her can as local while Koharu and Sanae doing things that they can as outsider.3. City vs Rural - this is one of main element being played for whole season. Mayonama, a rural area is pale in comparison to city of hope like Tokyo where lot of chances waiting. The main character Koharu also from countryside who also move to Tokyo due to this reason. Other character like Erika also want to go out meanwhile there is others like Shiori or Maki\'s brother Kosuke who prefer stay in the area while his sister Maki and Sanae run from city into countryside for various reason. the parallel situation tell of how both side each has their own pro and cons.4. Change vs Stagnate - this is relate to point 2. as countryside full of elder people, where lack of booming bussiness, some people prefer change. even the presiden Ushimatsu also used to longed for change. but there is people who prefer things stay as they are. the folks who already like what they currently have and didnt bother to change. Preserving both side is important as part of the main character challenge.then later there is stronger theme that gonna play role in changing Mayonama atmosphere and lot of character\'s development1. Flow of time - even how much they prefer to stay like how they currently are, they cant change flow of time. trend changing, some change inevitable. some choose to adapt but some choose to let things happens. both not wrong as both prefer the way it end up. the town of Mayonama for example has less of people shopping around due to big convinience store, lack of younger people attraction, lot of young people migrate to city didnt take over their family bussiness etc. some youngster return home and open shop. some elder however prefer let things as there are, even they end up closed. some even pass away. they rather enjoy life moderately everyday.2. Must able to accept change - this is the core message being send for whole storyline. it related to the town folklore about an outsider dragon girl who been chased out by local. however the true story is the local actually welcoming the outsider and want to share her wisdom. the villagers dancing to welcome here but the dragon mistaken for them to get angry and she later die alone retreated in cave. this is message been told. the Mayonama town must accept outsider. originally it part of their culture. Ririko\'s grandmother for example didnt like outsider. some of villagers against changing. but the tales told that their ancestor didnt hesitate to learn from outsider and change themself, adapt throught the time. these been told until the final episode where Ririko sing the missing song of the folklore.all these element could relate strongly with audience age 20s or even 30s.whats great more, not just  major plot, but side plot and  lot of side character has \'closure\' to their role. even if just a side character. each of them has their own character development outside of main characters which is something rare. Sandal-san for example finally find his root. Kumano and Sayuri finally dating. Amamiya, finally has his redemption. Ushimatsu finally drive out tv host who played them before. The town policeman finally found love. Doku, Ushimatsu and Chitose finally fullfill their promise after 50 years. its like everyone is changing. the town overall is changingoverall story is fun, soothing and warm anime. the ending is one of anime that i could feel empty after watch. whats more, not merely end of the story but also signify the end of main character journey in the place which is already become her second home. audience also get attached to the place. the final where she left the place from train station is one of best ending that left lot of feeling for audience.all plot, character development stuff, whats important is ability to connect with audience which is this anime nailed it with characters, plot, humor and location.overall it has lot of deep meaning included in the story and overall audience definitely can see the love and passionate the animation staff put here. ""Working series"" is specialty of P.A Works and here they show their expertise while always showcase beautiful art and music alongside interesting character and plot.totally underrated anime, story must not necessary explosive, or strong in emotion but sometimes relaxing, moderate element like this als could hit hard. definitely one of best P.A Works masterpiece.

Sanae Kouzuki voiced by Mikako Komatsu who is a fellow Tokyonite and is efficient  in IT-related works, Maki Midorikawa voiced by Chika Anzai, an actress with broken ambitions and had...many part time jobs, Ririko Oribe voiced by Chiemi Tanaka, a shy hikkomori with a fascination towards the occult, finally Shiori Shinomiya voiced by Reina Ueda a staff member of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who helps Yoshino with her endeavors to rejuvenate the town.Throughout the anime and many situations they develop not only these 5 girls that also reflect on the state of Manoyama but as well as the many side characters such as Ushimatsu Kadota voiced by Atsushi Ono who is the leader of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who screwed up with the chupacabra scthick even before Koharu arrived in Manoyama, Chitose Oribe voiced by Maki Izawa who severely dislikes Kadota\'s tourism antics, Erika Suzuki voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa a bratty teenager who\'s sick of the countryside town to Kindaichi voiced by Masashi Nogawa who wants a girlfriend and Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache or Sandal-san voiced by Vinay Murthy who wanders Manoyama in search for something he\'s usually with the 5 girl\'s antics at times.Sanae\'s development is really what happens when your stalling for your future will fade from memory and be what she was before she got recruited by Koharu. Sanae was and by the most part LA\'s favourite character because of her revelation because LA could relate to her ALOT, looking more to the past than looking to the future thus stifling her place in the world and even after her ""arc"", she still got some witty comments and was still important in certain differing arcs like the outer-town elderly village where they tried to ""connect"" elderly to technology in which even that mini arc tells alot of cross generational gap when it comes to technology and bringing light to the elderly in a growing town.Maki\'s development is although LA thinks this is a smart tongue in cheek in P.A Work\'s part but it has reflections of Chika Anzai\'s career, mainly because Maki was in a theatre troupe much like Chika Anzai before she got picked up by an acting agency. Maki faces her fears to go all the way as it were in trying to be an actress and her arc works towards the Dragon Song and gives us some world building and backstory to Manoyama\'s cultural history which reflects to Manoyama\'s isolated mentality it had to the Dragon Song in opening up to outsiders (aka. Koharu is STRONGLY suggested to reflect the Dragon Song.) Maki\'s main contribution to the anime is more to Manoyama\'s history through the Dragon Song.Ririko Oribe development is essentially her finding a purpose in life and wanting to see the rest of the world however with her grandmother Chitose keeping her in check so she can take over her traditional snack store instead. Ririko does have a link to Maki as she helped her become a singer and actor but ultimately her purpose to the anime was an audience proxy to those who have lived in the countryside for the majority of their life but wanting to see more but is barred by family and planned out their lives for them.Shiori Shinomiya development is like Koharu\'s goal to rejuvenate Manoyama, however she also faces issues when dealing with living in an almost abandoned towns. She and her family has been in Manoyama and she is happy in Manoyama and wants to see Manoyama grow for the better but she clashes in beliefs with Erika, as Shori sees all the good things in an abandoned town as her family lives here and is mostly positive about the situation in comparison to Erika\'s more cynical look at living at an abandoned town when most teenagers at her age would look to the city to survive and see a more active environment.Finally we have Koharu who is the entire catalyst in shaping and reconstructing Manoyama into a great tourism spot. As LA aforementioned that Koharu is portrayed in the Dragon Song, she does have wacky ideas in trying to get exposure to Manoyama however her development does focus on her ""normalness"" but also how Manoyama\'s exposure can used in a good or horrible light. Such as the case of the TV exposure Manoyama gets (and you KNOW what happens when the main characters don\'t have full control of their TV program) and with a concert trampling on the culture Manoyama had for a rock concert turns into mindless exposure. Whereas reviving the culture of Manoyama through a real cultural experience of a local defunct festival (which ties back to Kadota and Chitose\'s past) does for exposure done right.If you just haven\'t noticed but LA just loves the character development to Sakura Quest as not only does each of the character arcs ties to other characters, but they also bring in Manoyama cultural lore as well as some ""generations gap"" messages and the capitalization of cities that causes these abandoned towns to become more rampant that become very profound and makes you resonate with these characters and you want them succeed so the culture of towns and their people will live on.P.A Works did a fantastic job in animation, from the exotically detailed characters designs in which even their character wardrobes changes alot, to their typically great backgrounding, the animation was overall above average to amazing and bets of all consistent. Sure in later episodes, there are dips in quality though rare but nonetheless LA still saw the animation to be outstanding.Voice acting wise, LA loved the majority of voice actors with some surprises like Tomoyo Kurosawa as a bratty snarky character role when she was Kumiko Oumae, some adorable ones from Reina Ueda (as usual) and some typical ones like Mikako Komatsu but even with the great voice cast, LA just loved Ayaka Nanase who voiced Koharu, LA can\'t pinpoint why LA loves her voice but there\'s a certain cadence to her that makes her vocal range to be diverse and wider ranging all wrapped up as Koharu. Ohh and Vinay Murthy who voiced Sandal-san, he did a great job as him with great Japanese and English accenting and all round some witty lines he gets.As for the finale, LA was nearly in tears by the end of it god damn it Kadota you got LA to shed some tears and seriously a rare few animes actually did that to LA. *ahem* emotional things aside, LA did accept Koharu\'s and heck even the 4 other ministers\' future plans and it definitely worked in their development as well as showing some resolution to the rest of the cast. As much of an emotional finale it took, it\'s definitely one that ended it in a most graceful and concluding manner.Sakura Quest maybe an anime about 5 girls trying to rejuvenate a nearly abandoned town and yes it does it that as a base, but it\'s also about a society\'s culture and how it\'s affected by capitalization, it\'s about the generation gap and how it can both mend and hurt families or people, it\'s about looking to the future. P.A Works did an amazing job with this anime original, from their memorable characters, thoughtful character development, Manoyama historical lore, current real life worries to a capitalizing mindset, amazing animation and voice acting and a great finale. Sakura Quest is by far LA\'s favourite anime for Spring 2017 and a strong contender for best anime for 2017. many part time jobs, Ririko Oribe voiced by Chiemi Tanaka, a shy hikkomori with a fascination towards the occult, finally Shiori Shinomiya voiced by Reina Ueda a staff member of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who helps Yoshino with her endeavors to rejuvenate the town.Throughout the anime and many situations they develop not only these 5 girls that also reflect on the state of Manoyama but as well as the many side characters such as Ushimatsu Kadota voiced by Atsushi Ono who is the leader of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who screwed up with the chupacabra scthick even before Koharu arrived in Manoyama, Chitose Oribe voiced by Maki Izawa who severely dislikes Kadota\'s tourism antics, Erika Suzuki voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa a bratty teenager who\'s sick of the countryside town to Kindaichi voiced by Masashi Nogawa who wants a girlfriend and Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache or Sandal-san voiced by Vinay Murthy who wanders Manoyama in search for something he\'s usually with the 5 girl\'s antics at times.Sanae\'s development is really what happens when your stalling for your future will fade from memory and be what she was before she got recruited by Koharu. Sanae was and by the most part LA\'s favourite character because of her revelation because LA could relate to her ALOT, looking more to the past than looking to the future thus stifling her place in the world and even after her ""arc"", she still got some witty comments and was still important in certain differing arcs like the outer-town elderly village where they tried to ""connect"" elderly to technology in which even that mini arc tells alot of cross generational gap when it comes to technology and bringing light to the elderly in a growing town.Maki\'s development is although LA thinks this is a smart tongue in cheek in P.A Work\'s part but it has reflections of Chika Anzai\'s career, mainly because Maki was in a theatre troupe much like Chika Anzai before she got picked up by an acting agency. Maki faces her fears to go all the way as it were in trying to be an actress and her arc works towards the Dragon Song and gives us some world building and backstory to Manoyama\'s cultural history which reflects to Manoyama\'s isolated mentality it had to the Dragon Song in opening up to outsiders (aka. Koharu is STRONGLY suggested to reflect the Dragon Song.) Maki\'s main contribution to the anime is more to Manoyama\'s history through the Dragon Song.Ririko Oribe development is essentially her finding a purpose in life and wanting to see the rest of the world however with her grandmother Chitose keeping her in check so she can take over her traditional snack store instead. Ririko does have a link to Maki as she helped her become a singer and actor but ultimately her purpose to the anime was an audience proxy to those who have lived in the countryside for the majority of their life but wanting to see more but is barred by family and planned out their lives for them.Shiori Shinomiya development is like Koharu\'s goal to rejuvenate Manoyama, however she also faces issues when dealing with living in an almost abandoned towns. She and her family has been in Manoyama and she is happy in Manoyama and wants to see Manoyama grow for the better but she clashes in beliefs with Erika, as Shori sees all the good things in an abandoned town as her family lives here and is mostly positive about the situation in comparison to Erika\'s more cynical look at living at an abandoned town when most teenagers at her age would look to the city to survive and see a more active environment.Finally we have Koharu who is the entire catalyst in shaping and reconstructing Manoyama into a great tourism spot. As LA aforementioned that Koharu is portrayed in the Dragon Song, she does have wacky ideas in trying to get exposure to Manoyama however her development does focus on her ""normalness"" but also how Manoyama\'s exposure can used in a good or horrible light. Such as the case of the TV exposure Manoyama gets (and you KNOW what happens when the main characters don\'t have full control of their TV program) and with a concert trampling on the culture Manoyama had for a rock concert turns into mindless exposure. Whereas reviving the culture of Manoyama through a real cultural experience of a local defunct festival (which ties back to Kadota and Chitose\'s past) does for exposure done right.If you just haven\'t noticed but LA just loves the character development to Sakura Quest as not only does each of the character arcs ties to other characters, but they also bring in Manoyama cultural lore as well as some ""generations gap"" messages and the capitalization of cities that causes these abandoned towns to become more rampant that become very profound and makes you resonate with these characters and you want them succeed so the culture of towns and their people will live on.P.A Works did a fantastic job in animation, from the exotically detailed characters designs in which even their character wardrobes changes alot, to their typically great backgrounding, the animation was overall above average to amazing and bets of all consistent. Sure in later episodes, there are dips in quality though rare but nonetheless LA still saw the animation to be outstanding.Voice acting wise, LA loved the majority of voice actors with some surprises like Tomoyo Kurosawa as a bratty snarky character role when she was Kumiko Oumae, some adorable ones from Reina Ueda (as usual) and some typical ones like Mikako Komatsu but even with the great voice cast, LA just loved Ayaka Nanase who voiced Koharu, LA can\'t pinpoint why LA loves her voice but there\'s a certain cadence to her that makes her vocal range to be diverse and wider ranging all wrapped up as Koharu. Ohh and Vinay Murthy who voiced Sandal-san, he did a great job as him with great Japanese and English accenting and all round some witty lines he gets.As for the finale, LA was nearly in tears by the end of it god damn it Kadota you got LA to shed some tears and seriously a rare few animes actually did that to LA. *ahem* emotional things aside, LA did accept Koharu\'s and heck even the 4 other ministers\' future plans and it definitely worked in their development as well as showing some resolution to the rest of the cast. As much of an emotional finale it took, it\'s definitely one that ended it in a most graceful and concluding manner.Sakura Quest maybe an anime about 5 girls trying to rejuvenate a nearly abandoned town and yes it does it that as a base, but it\'s also about a society\'s culture and how it\'s affected by capitalization, it\'s about the generation gap and how it can both mend and hurt families or people, it\'s about looking to the future.

Sakura Quest is by far LA\'s favourite anime for Spring 2017 and a strong contender for best anime for 2017.', 'I\'m not a big anime watcher, to be honest, I probably watched less than ten animes during my life. Among those animes I\'ve watched, the majority of them was about fighting, magical powers and this sort of stuff. And that\'s probably the reason why Sakura Quest had such a different impact on me.Sakura Quest is not about great and powerful people, goddesses, or anything, it\'s a show about ""normal"" people and how they struggle to find their way in life.The plot is really simple, yet imersive, it\'s just about a group of very different girls trying to find their way in life. Sakura quest has...areally nice message for the young adult audience, telling you that it is okay if you haven\'t found anything you\'re really passionate about, it\'s okay to feel like you\'re just a number inside a company and wanting to change your life radically (and it\'s also okay if you like the simplicity of your life the way it is), but the truth is that in the end, you can find your way if you really try.The characters are a great point of the show, not just the main cast, the whole cast is amazing. There\'s lot\'s of different personalties, which grow up as the episodes go on. It\'s impossible to watch Sakura Quest and don\'t see yourself in one (or more) characters.Now, about the art, while there are better animes when talking about the drawing of the characteres, the landscapes are really pretty and serene, capturing the beauty of the Japanese coutryside.Another thing that I really appreciate was the sound. The voice acting (I watched the English dubed version) was simply perfect! The musics were also amazing, I can\'t stop listening to the opening and ending songs of the show.The ending episode was really heartwarming - I literelaly teared up watching it - just to seal this beautiful piece of art.Sakura Quest is - handsdown - the best anime show I\'ve ever watched. areally nice message for the young adult audience, telling you that it is okay if you haven\'t found anything you\'re really passionate about, it\'s okay to feel like you\'re just a number inside a company and wanting to change your life radically (and it\'s also okay if you like the simplicity of your life the way it is), but the truth is that in the end, you can find your way if you really try.The characters are a great point of the show, not just the main cast, the whole cast is amazing.

However, it is better to dissect Sakura Quest not as a hidden gem but as a piece of narrative dealing with a relatively uncharted subject matter. The whole narrative revolves around a college fresh graduate named Koharu Yoshino who just can't score any first paying job at all....It does not mean that she has no potential (or even worth) as a future member of the workforce-- she just can't help but slip under the radar (even with that pink hair of hers). One day, out of desperation and failure to read the fine line, she becomes a tourist ambassador for a rural area named Manoyama-- which is neither a traditional village (they have Internet there) nor is it a utopia (the shopping district is basically a Zombie Shibuya). It is soon palpable that the lost girl and Manoyama have one thing in common: both are dealing with being invisible-- and that's where things get very fascinating.Yes, being invisible sometimes sucks but nothing is ever straightforward-- especially when it comes to human being. Some Manoyama locals actually don't mind being invisible because they have understood all too well the price it pays to be under the spotlight. While there are locals that are still optimistic and would like to shine a light on their hometown and all of its hidden glory, Manoyama is too colorful to finally agree on one unifying sentiment. However, with Koharu and her 'royal ministers', each difference is tackled, each doubt is confronted, and each struggle is worth enduring. Not every plan shall work out but at least someone is there and cares enough to come up with a plan.Even though it seems similar, Sakura Quest is not in the same group as rural-flavored anime such as Barakamon or Non Non Biyori. From the get-go, Manoyama is not exactly a fairy tale palace and regardless of the historical values and enchanting nature, there are plenty of others like that across Japan. So what is it then that makes something that is usually invisible become, well, visible? Sakura Quest cannot promise the audience the answer but gosh, it is truly a question worth finding answer for.#felixlovesanime It does not mean that she has no potential (or even worth) as a future member of the workforce-- she just can't help but slip under the radar (even with that pink hair of hers).

Second, that growing up and becoming an adult and dealing with the issues of self-image and worth that come with entering the workplace can be both a difficult rite of passage and something to be enjoyed.When this show aired, I was still in college. Having left school and looked for a job since then, I relate more than ever to Yoshino's struggles: her difficulty in spreading her...wings and striking out on her own is something that I think most adults can relate to, even those who've found success. Moreover, it's an important step in growing as a person, something that I think the show really excels at.While I've never lived in a small town and primarily experienced them as passing blips on the highway, I can say that the message about the decline of smaller towns resonates less with me, but I think it's still important to consider. The great, interconnected globalised world is not the only way of living, and there's a certain humble charm about the unique issues that small towns face that can use a lot of attention. Things like the accessibility of senior citizens or issues of rural internet connection (something that's become a contentious issue in the US as well) can often go overlooked in the short-attention-span world we find ourselves in.This is a show that puts a lot of earnestness and thought into it characters and setting, and for that, I truly do think it's a masterpiece. It's not perfect--no show is--but I really do think it has some essential themes, and I'd recommend this to just about anyone who's ever struggled with trying to figure out just...how they're supposed to be an adult. wings and striking out on her own is something that I think most adults can relate to, even those who've found success.

It has this Shirobako thing, but here is where P.A portrays its own values the most. The studio is one of fewest who doesn't have their headquarters in Tokyo, their headquarters is located in Nanto...a rural town with arround 50,000 inhabitants. What i'm saying is the references for the show come directly from their own daily lives in the town, the wood carving district, the temples, festivals everything has a relation to Nanto. It's like a declaration of why they love their town. For more information i'd likie to reccomend Koitabi: True Tours Nanto, that is an anime P.A has made especially to show the tourism in Nanto, and also the youtube channel The Canipa Effect that has a execelent video about the studio (and it's where i got most of this info).Art:9/10The background art and the character designs are great just what you would expect from P.A Works. The details, colors and styles of the characters clothes are amazing.Sound:8/10The Soundtracks fits well the atmosphere set by the show, as well both the openings and endings performed by (K)NoW_NAME and the outstanding inserted song on Ep7 -thyme- that made me shed a tear or two.Characters:10/10The characters are awesome, their personalites and strengths are well portraied, and their growth from the beggining to the end of the show is so visible. Also the way they learn things with each other from the experiences they have during the show or that they had during their lives, makes you wanna cheer for their sucess all the way. Also if you like strong female characters this show has plenty of them.Enjoyment:10/10 - Overall 9/10For me its a great and relaxing show to watch, just the right ammount of things that make a great and enjoyable slice of life anime with something more than just routine our cute girls doing cute stuff (not that I have a problem with that). For people who like more action based shows this one may feel a little boring but for the people who are looking for a great slice of life, this one can surely fill your quota. a rural town with arround 50,000 inhabitants.

If you enjoy workplace Slice of Life shows, especially of the much more low-energy, laid-back variety with plenty of well-timed humour sprinkled throughout yet still present with emotionally compelling themes, this is your show.  If you enjoy watching a show about young adults trying to find their way in life like Shirobako (which may have led you here, but don\'t expect the same high-energy intensity), especially via strong bonds of friendship forged through mutual struggle, then this is your...show.  If you enjoy a peaceful, serene, and well-written story about finding happiness in these struggles, even when they don\'t always turn out how you want, then this.  Is.  Your.  Show.  I strongly recommend it.  There will be feels.  Much feels.  I will not claim that the show is perfect, but it mostly does right.If you want a more in-depth look at my feelings towards it, dig in for the long haul and continue reading.  I break it up into the first section, which talks about the messaging and meaning behind the show, and a second section which looks briefly at the technical merits of it._________________________________________________________________________________________Sakura Quest is third in line of PA Works ""working women"" line of shows, not necessarily directly linked in story, but in spirit.  I\'ve seen many people go into this show therefore expecting something akin to a Shirobako 2.0, and I can tell you that if you are expecting such a thing, you will only hinder your own enjoyment of this show.  This show is not Shirobako, it is not Hanasaku Iroha, it carves out its own identity and it is better for it.  It shares with Shirobako the basic setup of 5 young adult women working at trying to get their careers off the ground, but lacks its energy and absurdist, rose-tinted optimism, and it shares the more serene and slow paced country setting of Hanasaku Iroha without having the same laser focus on the MC.  That\'s really where the major similarities end.  So if you\'re curious about the path Sakura Quest has struck on its own, then I implore you to keep reading; you might find something worthwhile!First off, this show has some really excellent messaging and themes to work with.  Sakura Quest on the surface has some pretty basic story setup initially (for the first half); it gives each girl their own arc of struggles to develop them, which all tie back into the over-arching story of them trying to revive a small country town.  These arcs can, at times, feel a bit isolated from the whole of the story, but by the end of the show and more tightly focused second half, I realized that they weren\'t really so disjointed.  This is due to one of the major themes of the show I came to realize: understanding that lack of success isn\'t necessarily failure and appreciating little successes and opportunities that do come your way.  Life isn\'t always easy, it isn\'t always fair, and things will rarely go the way you plan them to or desire them to, but at the end of the day it is all we have and we have to make the best of it with all of our beloved family and friends.  This stands in stark contrast to the more fairy-tale like story of Shirobako where perseverance will find you success and lead you to your goals in the end!  Sakura Quest doesn\'t play that game.  Being an adult doesn\'t mean you get what you want, it often means being happy with what you have and adapting to the unexpected.  This, in my opinion, is the biggest takeaway from Sakura Quest, and more importantly, what initially ties all of these arcs together and makes them feel a lot more cohesive than may originally be apparent, especially once it all starts folding back into the main thrust of the story: reviving the town.For those of you old enough to have had plenty of hard knocks in life, you\'re aware of what it means to keep going past these issues, to find those new doors, new pathways that open before you as others close.  As a result, watching Sakura Quest can often be a cathartic, albeit sometimes melancholic, experience.  The girls struggle to find their way on the path to figuring out where they are appreciated; often their dreams are crushed ruthlessly in front of them despite their best efforts.  This doesn\'t stop them from finding their own happiness though.  Carving out your own place in life despite these failures is what makes us stronger, and I think the writing and storytelling of Sakura Quest does an excellent job of relaying these struggles in an appreciable way.  It isn\'t in your face about this message, instead choosing to pleasantly weave this tapestry throughout the entire show\'s length on a fine spider silk that resonates more in your gut than your conscious.  You don\'t have the characters spelling out their emotions, but instead see them forge forward, constantly dodging all the blows life tries to deal them in their hunt for fulfilment and friendship.  It all feels very heartfelt, honest, and emotionally raw.  Often the girls find themselves struggling with situations and issues we all do in life, and it really helps you want to cheer them on and keeps you engaged in the story.  It makes the show feel very grounded, even despite some contrived circumstances and zany adventures.  I wouldn\'t say every situation in the show is completely realistic, it is an anime after all and shenanigans will be had, but even the silly scenarios presented were very cleverly analogous to many of our own issues in life.  This emotional depth hearkens back to the main theme of finding fulfilment in yourself, even if your outward goals haven\'t work out perfectly.This emotional depth, this tangible empathy I speak of also starts tying into the other major theme of the show: acceptance of change and different cultures/people.  I see a lot of people watch this show complain that they don\'t enjoy seeing a lack of progress from the girls or side-cast in terms of the main objective of reviving the town.  People will say this really bogs down the pacing, makes the whole thing feel pointless, and creates lack of satisfaction in the viewer.  I think that is a clear example of missing the forest for the trees and missing this second major theme of the show entirely.  The girls\' goal is to revive the town, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean they have to drastically increase its population, or increase tourism, or raise its revenue, which by all accounts they have failed to do.  In the case of this show, much of the ""revival"" the girls discovered was most important was more about simply having the townspeople be proud of their unique cultural flavour and maintaining it within them.  Things could change externally such as town boundaries, the name, the buildings, even the people, but as long as someone there remembered their culture and unique history, then it lives on in their hearts.  This change shouldn\'t be feared, it should be embraced and used to help the townspeople grow, but that doesn\'t mean they have to give up their memories and cultural pride.  This theme of the show is exemplified in the Dragon Song which very much talks about acceptance of outsiders, of other cultures, and learning from them.  Yoshino, the ""MC"" of this show, is originally an outsider.  Even after her job is finished in the end, she still considers herself an outsider, but one that is accepted and welcomed by the community.  This is not the success the girls originally sought out, but it is a kind of success, and it is an emotional triumph for them as well as the town.This second theme is often demonstrated with the secondary cast of the show, which is quite rich and deep.  They all have their own personalities and they all feel wonderful and developed by the end, or at least as much as a secondary cast tends to get.  More importantly, they all make this wonderful little country town feel lived in.  This really sells the environment of the show and does more to immerse you in it.  This seems to be a very strong point in most of these shows from PA Works, the excellent handling of an ensemble cast that leaves many other studios and directors reeling to balance.  The Direction of the last few episodes was especially strong in this regard and really helped the messaging of the show and emotions of its characters resonate with the viewer, so props to Souichi for that satisfying wrap-up.  This of course leads wonderfully into the next technical section, starting with the characters._________________________________________________________________________________________The cast of this show is incredibly diverse and interesting, with PA Works flexing their large-cast muscles again.  Of the 5 main cast, I would suggest that Yoshino is actually the weakest sell of the bunch, as her story is largely one of aimless wandering amongst a sea of personality.  She kind of got the short end of the stick there and plays off mainly as the genki fit girl of the show.  It\'s okay though, because the rest of this well-handled giant cast is all quite compelling.  With the other four girls we have Maki, a struggling actor with some familial issues, Sanae, a techie web-designer and big-city girl stuck in a small town not sure what to do with her skills, Ririko, a small town girl who starts out incredibly shy but full of dry wit and courage, and lastly Shiori, a small-town pleasant girl working for the tourism board that loves her town and all of its history.  All of these girls, as previously mentioned, get their own stories and struggles which helps to reveal their true character as well as slowly expose us to the massive ensemble cast of such a small town.  All these additional side characters often even get their own exploration to some degree as well, though obviously not to the extent of the main 5, and it really helps the whole thing feel... human.  By the end of the show, I felt like I was leaving behind a dear group of friends, I was sad to see them go.  That is the strength of these characters.  They all feel unique, they all feel important, they all have an impact in some way.  Their interactions are often wonderful and heart-warming and their banter is frequently hilarious.  Sandal-san especially, a wandering blonde foreigner that generally only briefly talks when he\'s either saving the day or imparting some ancient wisdom, is a gem for so much of the series (fun fact: his full name, Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache, is actually in the show credits as the pseudonym for the production team of the show!).  Maki ended up being my favourite character though and I think her personal story was the most well fleshed-out.  I was invested with her every step of the way through her trials and tribulations, and it really felt like any small success she was given was absolutely deserved.  I think that goes for a lot of characters in the show and what makes them so compelling.  These aren\'t just character archetypes we\'re expected to understand, they are people that earn the viewer\'s respect and earn that investment, all with their own hopes and dreams.Visually the show was quite pleasing as well.  The nice pastoral backgrounds often drawn up by PAs well known background art team aren\'t super flashy, but often allow for a very rustic, comfortable feel.  I wouldn\'t say they are as stand-out as some of their other shows such as Nagi no Asukara, but they were always consistent and helped push the feel and emotions of the show.  I always like the details PA Works likes to put into drawing scenes to make them feel more alive, be it beautiful cherryblossom trees flowering and shedding or just random items in a room to make it feel lived-in.  There were definitely times where they seemed a bit phoned in though, which was unfortunate.  The background work in their cabin quarters is one such example, and occasionally it could be distracting if you really focused on it.  Fortunately they had PA Works legendary character designer Kanami Sekiguchi along with BUNBUN to make the main performers of the show always wonderful to look at!  The amount of work that went into character design seemed to me to be astronomical.  Every single character had their own unique and defined look, and every character often had dozens of unique clothing/outfits, which must have been a labour of love to draw up.  It was wonderful to see how many new outfits would pop up in any given episode and it really helped the characters feel like more than just colourful projections.  The animation for the most part was decent and consistent as well, with a few standout moments.  It was never mind blowing but it served the show well enough.  There were a distinct couple of episodes where it seemed out-sourcing shenanigans were wreaking havoc, but due to PA\'s pretty awesome quality control, it was never so bad as to be distracting.  These were exceptions though in an otherwise solid effort.The voicework was all top notch, with some stand-out performances in both the Japanese dub and English dub for Riri\'s character.  Both Chiemi Tanaka and Brina Palencia do an amazing job during the singing scenes and I enjoy both of them greatly.  I certainly can\'t think of any weak points from any of the other actors either.  I could easily recommend either the subbed or dubbed version of this show to people with confidence.  The OP/ED work by (K)NoW_NAME is absolutely fantastic and most of the insert songs meshed well with the feel of the show.  I will say there was one unfortunate insert though that occasionally got played at distracting times when it wasn\'t even needed and hurt a couple of scenes as a result, even if just from its repetitive nature.The story was a standard working girl type affair that anyone familiar with the Slice of Life genre should know of, but it is handled competently by the Director Souichi Masui.  He navigates all the emotional currents well, trying to keep our cast busy looking for resolutions without trying to speed up the pacing to anything overbearing.  It is a very slow paced show, and while many end up finding it boring as a result, I found the whole thing quite tranquil.  The series composition can, as previously mentioned, feel a bit disjointed initially, but really picks up steam in the second half and finds its rhythm and flow, which eventually builds up to a satisfying emotional finish and goodbye.  Plenty of callbacks to earlier in the show keep it upbeat despite the tears I had flowing at that point.  The girls may not have succeeded at their stated goal on paper, but that\'s because the solution wasn\'t really what anyone in the town was expecting or originally searching for.  They found deep satisfaction in their hearts in simply restoring dignity and pride to the town and its culture.  That memory living on is enough to keep the town ""alive"", no matter what change the future brings, and its inhabitants are happy to be remembered as such.  I appreciate that the story didn\'t go the simple route of just getting the girls from A to B, but rather showing them on their journey into adulthood, wherever that may end up.  It isn\'t a message I think we see often enough in mainstream anime as it seems like people always want a clearly defined goal and success/failure, but that just isn\'t how life often goes.Overall, my enjoyment for this show was just phenomenal.  To bring up the early comparisons to Shirobako or HanaIroha, two of my favourite shows of all time, I would certainly say Sakura Quest belongs among them as one of PA Works best shows.  I definitely think Sakura Quest is weaker than both of them, but not by that much.  I\'m very sympathetic to its message of struggle and happiness where you can find it, moreso than the themes of the other two aforementioned shows, but it was a bit less tight at times with the storytelling, characters, and artwork.  On its own merit though, Sakura Quest is quite a fantastic show.  I think it caters to a bit of a niche taste and would resonate a bit more with older viewers, but a strong show regardless.  If you\'re a fan of young working adult slice of life shows in a more grounded setting, I think you owe it to yourself to at least check this show out. show.  If you enjoy a peaceful, serene, and well-written story about finding happiness in these struggles, even when they don\'t always turn out how you want, then this.  Is.  Your.  Show.  I strongly recommend it.  There will be feels.  Much feels.  I will not claim that the show is perfect, but it mostly does right.If you want a more in-depth look at my feelings towards it, dig in for the long haul and continue reading.  I break it up into the first section, which talks about the messaging and meaning behind the show, and a second section which looks briefly at the technical merits of it._________________________________________________________________________________________Sakura Quest is third in line of PA Works ""working women"" line of shows, not necessarily directly linked in story, but in spirit.  I\'ve seen many people go into this show therefore expecting something akin to a Shirobako 2.0, and I can tell you that if you are expecting such a thing, you will only hinder your own enjoyment of this show.  This show is not Shirobako, it is not Hanasaku Iroha, it carves out its own identity and it is better for it.  It shares with Shirobako the basic setup of 5 young adult women working at trying to get their careers off the ground, but lacks its energy and absurdist, rose-tinted optimism, and it shares the more serene and slow paced country setting of Hanasaku Iroha without having the same laser focus on the MC.  That\'s really where the major similarities end.  So if you\'re curious about the path Sakura Quest has struck on its own, then I implore you to keep reading; you might find something worthwhile!First off, this show has some really excellent messaging and themes to work with.  Sakura Quest on the surface has some pretty basic story setup initially (for the first half); it gives each girl their own arc of struggles to develop them, which all tie back into the over-arching story of them trying to revive a small country town.  These arcs can, at times, feel a bit isolated from the whole of the story, but by the end of the show and more tightly focused second half, I realized that they weren\'t really so disjointed.  This is due to one of the major themes of the show I came to realize: understanding that lack of success isn\'t necessarily failure and appreciating little successes and opportunities that do come your way.  Life isn\'t always easy, it isn\'t always fair, and things will rarely go the way you plan them to or desire them to, but at the end of the day it is all we have and we have to make the best of it with all of our beloved family and friends.  This stands in stark contrast to the more fairy-tale like story of Shirobako where perseverance will find you success and lead you to your goals in the end!  Sakura Quest doesn\'t play that game.  Being an adult doesn\'t mean you get what you want, it often means being happy with what you have and adapting to the unexpected.  This, in my opinion, is the biggest takeaway from Sakura Quest, and more importantly, what initially ties all of these arcs together and makes them feel a lot more cohesive than may originally be apparent, especially once it all starts folding back into the main thrust of the story: reviving the town.For those of you old enough to have had plenty of hard knocks in life, you\'re aware of what it means to keep going past these issues, to find those new doors, new pathways that open before you as others close.  As a result, watching Sakura Quest can often be a cathartic, albeit sometimes melancholic, experience.  The girls struggle to find their way on the path to figuring out where they are appreciated; often their dreams are crushed ruthlessly in front of them despite their best efforts.  This doesn\'t stop them from finding their own happiness though.  Carving out your own place in life despite these failures is what makes us stronger, and I think the writing and storytelling of Sakura Quest does an excellent job of relaying these struggles in an appreciable way.  It isn\'t in your face about this message, instead choosing to pleasantly weave this tapestry throughout the entire show\'s length on a fine spider silk that resonates more in your gut than your conscious.  You don\'t have the characters spelling out their emotions, but instead see them forge forward, constantly dodging all the blows life tries to deal them in their hunt for fulfilment and friendship.  It all feels very heartfelt, honest, and emotionally raw.  Often the girls find themselves struggling with situations and issues we all do in life, and it really helps you want to cheer them on and keeps you engaged in the story.  It makes the show feel very grounded, even despite some contrived circumstances and zany adventures.  I wouldn\'t say every situation in the show is completely realistic, it is an anime after all and shenanigans will be had, but even the silly scenarios presented were very cleverly analogous to many of our own issues in life.  This emotional depth hearkens back to the main theme of finding fulfilment in yourself, even if your outward goals haven\'t work out perfectly.This emotional depth, this tangible empathy I speak of also starts tying into the other major theme of the show: acceptance of change and different cultures/people.  I see a lot of people watch this show complain that they don\'t enjoy seeing a lack of progress from the girls or side-cast in terms of the main objective of reviving the town.  People will say this really bogs down the pacing, makes the whole thing feel pointless, and creates lack of satisfaction in the viewer.  I think that is a clear example of missing the forest for the trees and missing this second major theme of the show entirely.  The girls\' goal is to revive the town, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean they have to drastically increase its population, or increase tourism, or raise its revenue, which by all accounts they have failed to do.  In the case of this show, much of the ""revival"" the girls discovered was most important was more about simply having the townspeople be proud of their unique cultural flavour and maintaining it within them.  Things could change externally such as town boundaries, the name, the buildings, even the people, but as long as someone there remembered their culture and unique history, then it lives on in their hearts.  This change shouldn\'t be feared, it should be embraced and used to help the townspeople grow, but that doesn\'t mean they have to give up their memories and cultural pride.  This theme of the show is exemplified in the Dragon Song which very much talks about acceptance of outsiders, of other cultures, and learning from them.  Yoshino, the ""MC"" of this show, is originally an outsider.  Even after her job is finished in the end, she still considers herself an outsider, but one that is accepted and welcomed by the community.  This is not the success the girls originally sought out, but it is a kind of success, and it is an emotional triumph for them as well as the town.This second theme is often demonstrated with the secondary cast of the show, which is quite rich and deep.  They all have their own personalities and they all feel wonderful and developed by the end, or at least as much as a secondary cast tends to get.  More importantly, they all make this wonderful little country town feel lived in.  This really sells the environment of the show and does more to immerse you in it.  This seems to be a very strong point in most of these shows from PA Works, the excellent handling of an ensemble cast that leaves many other studios and directors reeling to balance.  The Direction of the last few episodes was especially strong in this regard and really helped the messaging of the show and emotions of its characters resonate with the viewer, so props to Souichi for that satisfying wrap-up.  This of course leads wonderfully into the next technical section, starting with the characters._________________________________________________________________________________________The cast of this show is incredibly diverse and interesting, with PA Works flexing their large-cast muscles again.  Of the 5 main cast, I would suggest that Yoshino is actually the weakest sell of the bunch, as her story is largely one of aimless wandering amongst a sea of personality.  She kind of got the short end of the stick there and plays off mainly as the genki fit girl of the show.  It\'s okay though, because the rest of this well-handled giant cast is all quite compelling.  With the other four girls we have Maki, a struggling actor with some familial issues, Sanae, a techie web-designer and big-city girl stuck in a small town not sure what to do with her skills, Ririko, a small town girl who starts out incredibly shy but full of dry wit and courage, and lastly Shiori, a small-town pleasant girl working for the tourism board that loves her town and all of its history.  All of these girls, as previously mentioned, get their own stories and struggles which helps to reveal their true character as well as slowly expose us to the massive ensemble cast of such a small town.  All these additional side characters often even get their own exploration to some degree as well, though obviously not to the extent of the main 5, and it really helps the whole thing feel... human.  By the end of the show, I felt like I was leaving behind a dear group of friends, I was sad to see them go.  That is the strength of these characters.  They all feel unique, they all feel important, they all have an impact in some way.  Their interactions are often wonderful and heart-warming and their banter is frequently hilarious.  Sandal-san especially, a wandering blonde foreigner that generally only briefly talks when he\'s either saving the day or imparting some ancient wisdom, is a gem for so much of the series (fun fact: his full name, Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache, is actually in the show credits as the pseudonym for the production team of the show!).  Maki ended up being my favourite character though and I think her personal story was the most well fleshed-out.  I was invested with her every step of the way through her trials and tribulations, and it really felt like any small success she was given was absolutely deserved.  I think that goes for a lot of characters in the show and what makes them so compelling.  These aren\'t just character archetypes we\'re expected to understand, they are people that earn the viewer\'s respect and earn that investment, all with their own hopes and dreams.Visually the show was quite pleasing as well.  The nice pastoral backgrounds often drawn up by PAs well known background art team aren\'t super flashy, but often allow for a very rustic, comfortable feel.  I wouldn\'t say they are as stand-out as some of their other shows such as Nagi no Asukara, but they were always consistent and helped push the feel and emotions of the show.  I always like the details PA Works likes to put into drawing scenes to make them feel more alive, be it beautiful cherryblossom trees flowering and shedding or just random items in a room to make it feel lived-in.  There were definitely times where they seemed a bit phoned in though, which was unfortunate.  The background work in their cabin quarters is one such example, and occasionally it could be distracting if you really focused on it.  Fortunately they had PA Works legendary character designer Kanami Sekiguchi along with BUNBUN to make the main performers of the show always wonderful to look at!  The amount of work that went into character design seemed to me to be astronomical.  Every single character had their own unique and defined look, and every character often had dozens of unique clothing/outfits, which must have been a labour of love to draw up.  It was wonderful to see how many new outfits would pop up in any given episode and it really helped the characters feel like more than just colourful projections.  The animation for the most part was decent and consistent as well, with a few standout moments.  It was never mind blowing but it served the show well enough.  There were a distinct couple of episodes where it seemed out-sourcing shenanigans were wreaking havoc, but due to PA\'s pretty awesome quality control, it was never so bad as to be distracting.  These were exceptions though in an otherwise solid effort.The voicework was all top notch, with some stand-out performances in both the Japanese dub and English dub for Riri\'s character.  Both Chiemi Tanaka and Brina Palencia do an amazing job during the singing scenes and I enjoy both of them greatly.  I certainly can\'t think of any weak points from any of the other actors either.  I could easily recommend either the subbed or dubbed version of this show to people with confidence.  The OP/ED work by (K)NoW_NAME is absolutely fantastic and most of the insert songs meshed well with the feel of the show.  I will say there was one unfortunate insert though that occasionally got played at distracting times when it wasn\'t even needed and hurt a couple of scenes as a result, even if just from its repetitive nature.The story was a standard working girl type affair that anyone familiar with the Slice of Life genre should know of, but it is handled competently by the Director Souichi Masui.

Thankfully, this doesn\'t actually affect viewer experience.  It only serves to get things noticed in a crowded market.  One may ask, ""How does an anime outside the usual, marketable trends get made in the first place?""  That has everything to do with the production team behind it, you see.Progressive Animation Works (hereafter P.A. Works) has a very indicative name.  It\'s clear from the name alone that the intent of the studio was to push the medium forward.  One can see several of the latest trends in anime production...by viewing P.A.

This has seemingly emboldened them enough to take on themes which are rarely seen in anime due to demographics issues.Sakura Quest is a story of change.  It\'s told through familiar methods, even if the content is unfamiliar.  Most of the roadmarks of the Hero\'s Journey are present here.  It\'s not a bad thing to base your story on familiar building blocks.  There certainly are realist works of fiction that abandon this framework, but it\'s a hard thing to do.  For every ""Madame Bovary"" there are perhaps a million amateur works that fail completely on a basic level.

Despite an initial and very understandable reluctance to take on such a strange and open-ended job, Yoshino soon takes to it like a fish to water with her can-do attitude and sheer pluck.  There are many challenges on the way, and like any real-world problem there\'s probably no ""right"" solution.  The first of these challenges is to get some people on her side, because she certainly isn\'t going to solve this problem on her own.One would be tempted to think that the local chairman of tourism, Kadota, would be the first person in her corner, but he\'s more of an impediment for most of the series.  Despite his age, he has a lot of growing up to do and he\'s living in the past to a large extent.  The one good thing that can be said about him is that he\'s willing to change things, even if he has no idea what.  The rest of the town isn\'t so friendly to the idea.  Unsurprisingly, the people most open to change turn out to be other young people.Because this is an anime, these other young people are cute girls in familiar archetypes.

Assisting in this area is the artwork, which is very clean and attractive, even when it\'s depicting a permanently shuttered storefront.

And just from that you already know that these guys are the real deal and everybody knows that P.A works are one of the best in this industry.The story,art,sound,enjoyment,etc are 10/10 from me just the first 3 episode you will understand that all of your expectations gonna be fulfilled(if you like slice of life and...P.A works style). If you like tari-tari,hanasaku iroha then you come to the right place, we all know they disappoint us once with glasslip, but you can finally get what you waiting for this time.It is at least worth 8 point and its an hidden gem of this seasonThis anime isnt just about tourism and just like hanasaku iroha it tells us about a girl who work on the countryside, people giving it low score when it still ongoing and everybody expect it to be a boring anime but now it gets 8.4 point. Im not a tourism student, i dont know and dont care about tourism but what you need to know is P.A works wont give you a boring,shitty anime that tells you about tourism every episode, in this case the tourism is just the foundation of this anime and maybe just 15-20% of it. So what you`re gonna see is 80% of their magic, there will be life lessons and problems that maybe some of us can relate to it.Summary:It will show you a bunch of hardworking girls who once thinking that the countryside is just their place to run away from their reality,their dreams,their life and now they get this second chance to prove themself to the world and support each other. These girls once were going to tokyo to chase their dreams, searching for something that they cant find when they still lived at the countryside where they were born, and now they go back again to their starting point, now these lost girls become friends and now they started to like the countryside and without they realized they already loved the village that once they hate and they working together to make that forgotten village become once again a tourist destination, now they find a new life purpose for their empty heart all this time and answer to their unanswered life question.I hope you can appreciate this art.

It\'s such a simple question that often times has no answer because many people just honestly don\'t know what to do with themselves.\xa0 It\'s here where P.A. Works brings their storytelling flair to answer that question, giving us Sakura Quest, a journey of one girl and her friends to save a dying town.Story: Koharu Yoshino is a girl with a dream of finding something special.\xa0 Leaving her countryside home for the big city, she finds herself in a rut unable to find anything stable.\xa0 With one last chance given to her way out in the...countryside to help the dying town known as \'Manoyama\', she ventures out to the almost forgotten town, and finds it in shambles with a giant castle dedicated to the Chupacabra.\xa0 It\'s here where she becomes the town\'s \'queen\' (aka, tourism spokesperson), and helps to revitalize the weathered village.Focused on the progression of Yoshino and her new friends aiding the residents of Manoyama, Sakura Quest is a twenty five episode long journey showcasing the different ways its main female cast tries to resolve its low population and tourism rates be it through gimmicks, events, or by making the quality of life better for those who live in the town\'s buildings.\xa0 As a result, the show has a clear sense of progression and character growth as the show builds upon and explores the different facets of its cast and the culture of the town they live in.What\'s more is that the show sets the place up as a living, breathing community with episode after episode building more and more of the town that is Manoyama, giving the audience insight and history on how everything came to be.\xa0 It feels genuine and like something that\'s actually alive, a quality that benefits the show greatly by giving the side cast a role that\'s essential for the storytelling of the overall product.Despite that, the show runs itself in two different directions with two diverging themes.\xa0 With the tourism board and the rest of Manoyama, the show focuses mainly on the idea of \'home is what you make it\', as Sakura Quest showcases a heaping amount of worldbuilding with its sidecast showcasing their way of life to make the place feel as alive as it does.\xa0 On the other hand, its quintet of five girls is funneled into \'what do I want to do?\', as each of the five girls are given a sort of mini saga pertaining to their individual problems on what they want to do moving forward.\xa0 The latter is quite stilted, as when compared to the former, the progression doesn\'t really feel that natural.\xa0 P.A. Works tries to use both at once on several occasions, but the former usually comes out on top and the supposed character progression, while nice, doesn\'t come off as meaningful as it probably should.All in all though, Sakura Quest was a solid show that fulfilled a great amount of what it set out to do.\xa0 The progression of seeing how the characters grow and change to help the people of Manoyama is a very rewarding storyline to witness, and the little stories about each of the town\'s residents was one of its best story elements as it gave the show an unexpected vibrancy that only improved its story.\xa0 Indeed the progression for the main cast needed much help, but overall, the story was firm enough to stand on its own merits.Overview:+ Good, gradual sense of progression+ Excellent worldbuilding-\xa0 Main character growth feels forcedCharacters: The Queen of Chupacabra herself, Koharu Yoshino, is a bright dreamer who puts her all into the tasks in front of her.\xa0 Despite being initially confused and disgusted by the state of the place that her year long contract sent her to, she gradually becomes involved in all states with Manoyama, earnestly trying to help the people of the town and fulfilling her end of the contract.\xa0 Her qualities as a protagonist really shine when you see her attitude change as the episodes roll by as she invests more and more time into learning and understanding the people of the town.\xa0 Personally I think her progression is the most prominent and rewarding out of the bunch, as it feels more natural than the rest.Maki and Ririko, or the actress become handywoman and the UMA girl, get the second-most attention in the series.\xa0 Their stories refer to a wavered dream and self-expression respectively, and a good portion of the show dedicates their growth to overcome their struggles from the past in a semi-meaningful way.\xa0 The problem I find with these two is, while they are given the time of day, their progression happens in a matter of episodes, placed back to back to give them a quick story to progress their character.\xa0 In a show where things are slower, having this rushed progression made their stories feel more artificial than they should\'ve, ultimately creating stories that while do impact the grand scheme of things, lose quality because they\'re thrown in kind of haphazardly.Sanae and Shiori however really don\'t get the time of day.\xa0 An IT girl and a country girl respectively, both of their stories are only mildly existent.\xa0 There\'re only about two, maybe three episodes that even mention the kind of internal struggles they have, and even then it\'s so little that they never seem all that important.\xa0 The imbalance becomes quite clear once the show picks up, and it sucks how the show left these two in the dust without really much payoff for them.In terms of side cast, the majority of its members are the residents of Manoyama who as mentioned before, get a large majority of the show\'s attention as Sakura Quest builds up its thriving community with more and more people with each passing episode from members in the board of merchants, to those in the tourism board and beyond.\xa0 What I like most about this side cast is, there\'s always something.\xa0 There\'s never just a generic trait or anything randomly tacked onto them.\xa0 You might not remember their names, but you remember their story and the kinds of things that they had growing up.\xa0 The side cast are treated like people, not characters, and that\'s a quality that really stands out for the show.Overview:+ Great main protagonist+ Detailed and alive feeling side cast-\xa0 Other protagonists don\'t feel as goodArt: Produced by P.A. Works, the art for Sakura Quest is...less than stellar.\xa0 The show has the customary \'P.A. Works\' look to it with a bright color palette and rather nice backgrounds, but the overall quality really isn\'t something worth batting an eye at.Sure the quality is good, but when compared to a good number of the company\'s previous works: Angel Beats!, NagiAsu, Charlotte, the quality just isn\'t there.\xa0 Of course I\'m really just criticizing the art based on the show\'s previous track record.\xa0 In the grand scheme of things, it\'s still...average.\xa0 Nothing wrong with average, but it\'s just...average.Overview:+/- Average artSound: Since the show is two cours long, the show has two pairs of OPs and Eds all made by\xa0(K)NoW_NAME, each with their own flair and tone that separates one pair from the other.For the first half, we have ""Morning Glory"" as the OP and ""Freesia"" as the ED, a pair of soft pieces with a bright and cheerful, and soft and somber tones respectively.\xa0 Personally, when I think of \'Sakura Quest\', I think of these two.\xa0 They really connect to the slice of life theme that the show exudes and the bright optimism that Yoshino has when she\'s trying to help the people of Manoyama.\xa0 Not to mention both of them are really nice tracks with memorability due to the OP\'s repeated chords and the ED\'s soft chords complimented by snapping fingers.In contrast, the second half has the songs ""Lupinus"" and ""Baby\'s Breath"" as the OP and ED respectively.\xa0 In contrast, Lupinus is a rock song with heavy emphasis on electric guitar as its instrument of choice.\xa0 To be honest, the song doesn\'t really fit Sakura Quest.\xa0 Despite being a decent song, it\'s a bit too energetic for what the show is, and doesn\'t have that special quality to it to make it memorable.\xa0 Its ED on the other hand is very similar to Freesia, relying instead on acoustic guitar accompanied by a softer voice to make it sound like you\'re returning to your roots.\xa0 Personally I think they\'re all good songs, each with something to offer, though some more than others.Overview:+ Good, memorable songs-\xa0 Second OP doesn\'t really fit the showPersonal Enjoyment: There\'s something about P.A. Works that I attach to.\xa0 Maybe it\'s the fact that they manage to input a fun little quirk within their shows to give them that special quality along with their message, the fact that most of their shows are original, or maybe it\'s because a number of my favorite shows come from them.\xa0 Regardless, P.A. Works is that one company I always anticipate, adoring their good shows and heavily criticizing their bad shows.\xa0 They\'ve done some bad shows in the past, and some...really bad ones (Haruchika, Glasslip, looking at you), but thankfully, Sakura Quest wasn\'t one of those.While Sakura Quest certainly isn\'t one of their best works, or even their most noticed, it\'s a show that is an honest return to form from the company.\xa0 Admittedly it wasn\'t the highest priority on my watchlist, but it was still something that I earnestly enjoyed because it really had the spark and quality of storytelling mixed with the inherent character wackiness that I like from P.A. Works.\xa0 And honestly, that\'s all I as a fan could ever hope for.Did I like this show?Yes.\xa0 In particular, I really liked how the show shed light on some of its crankier members of the cast, changing them along with the story and turning Kadota and Chitose into likable and redeemed characters that I actually wanted to see more of.\xa0 (Also Yoshino too, but that\'s kind of a given.)What didn\'t I like about this show?I don\'t fully understand the need to do the whole five girls thing.\xa0 They did this back in Shirobako, which albeit worked better, but quite honestly, seriously developing five characters takes a lot of time and effort, and the problems really show when Yoshino is the only one who greatly improved.\xa0 Sure the others have change to them, but it\'s really not that good.\xa0 Also Sandal.\xa0 He\'s a...weird character.\xa0 That\'s just kinda shoved in there for the sake of being weird.  (There\'s also a surprising amount of Engrish in this show.)Would I recommend this show?Yes.\xa0 Personally, I see Sakura Quest as an underrated gem that never really got the time of day it deserved.\xa0 Sure the premise is weird, and it\'s got a number of character problems, but the setting and the growth of the show over time feels so alive when you\'re watching it that a number of those mistakes can be forgiven.\xa0 But only some.\xa0 Iunno, I just want people to watch this show cause I\'m just happy we got a good P.A.

After finishing it you will only realise that there is something missing going forward in your weekly schedule. At that point it hits you that the show you were watching for the 25 weeks was overall a great Slice of Life with a lot of fun and heartfelt moments. That was my feeling when finishing Sakura Quest. The best word to describe the show in my eyes is: HONEST. All of the personal character storys felt like they could happen to real people out there somewhere. Like getting frustrated after multiple rejections or finding out that the things you wanted to do the most as a child are not as easy and will burn you out over time.

For starters it’s very relatable. Being an adult that floundered through life I can relate to our heroines trying to find their place in a world that believes they should’ve already found it. Who am I & what do I want are profound questions each must ask his/her soul and this show understands that it’s okay not to have those answers. This is in stark contrast to say a shonen epic where the main character has a clearly defined goal from day one and every step on their journey is a step towards said goal. The second...thing I loved is that they’re all adults. Not that I’m unable to relate to high school age characters, but rather that high schoolers are immature and make decisions based on that immaturity. But adults tend to weigh and measure potential consequences before taking “radical” action. Another great thing is the fact that Manoyama isn’t a real place, so the show isn’t a 24 episode tourism advertisement. Nor does require lessons in the history and geography of Japan to enjoy. This also meant they didn’t have to stay true to dress, decor etc. They were free to make their own world and expand and limit it as such. Another impressive aspect of this show is how the right answer, the correct path isn’t always so clear & that there will always be obstacles on the path of least resistance. It’s a beautiful slice of life show that showcases the other slices of life; rather than just ‘high school is the best days of our lives’. But showcases regret, nostalgia, exploration and the constant battle between progress and tradition. It’s funny, heartwarming but not insistent upon itself. It doesn’t beat you over the head with morality or lectures on the ideal way of life without avoiding such real and mature topics as they affect the lives of the characters. Because of that, it’s never boring. It’s more than a slice of life, it’s the whole pizza of life. thing I loved is that they’re all adults.

CONSISTENT VISUALS2. REALISTIC SETTING3. RELATABLE CHARACTERS4. RELAXING MUSICCONS:1. NOTHING PROGRESSED...2. CAN BE BIT BORING IF YOU ARE NOT INTO SLICE OF LIFE<LONG REVIEW>Sakura Quest is a breathe of fresh air compared to a lot of anime we received lately. If you don\'t know, Sakura Quest is an anime following the daily lives of a group of girls working in a traveling agency. It\'s very Slice of Life so if you aren\'t a fan of Slice of Life anime, skip this.Well, if you are one, then the Slice of Life in this anime is kinda different compared to other series in the same genre. What I mean is that in other Slice of Life series, there is often a sub-genre that makes it more interesting, such as comedy and drama. However in this series, it\'s just Slice of Life, there isn\'t any comedy in this, drama wise...that isn\'t really the point of this series, so what makes these kind of Slice of Life interesting is the characters.Each character in this series is likable, well-developed and relatable. This is due to the show focus a lot of time in letting us learn more about the characters. They let us know the difficulties they face in life and how they overcome it. At the same time, through developing the characters, they also progressed the ""story"".If you played close attention, I mentioned that nothing progressed in my short review. Yes, I mean it. This is because this anime focused too many time on the characters and the side stories for each character until the point where in the end, the main plot didn\'t progressed at all. The main plot of this series is to save the town and to attract more people to come and visit the place. However, after all the efforts our characters had put in, nothing progressed. The town is still the same as it was in the first episode. However, that still didn\'t made this series less enjoyable because each side story is interesting and sometimes relatable. They also led to character development. So there isn\'t any complaints I can give for the side stories.The art and animation for this series is consistent, meaning that what you saw in the first episode is what you\'re going to see for the rest of the series. It didn\'t become bizarre or beautiful, it chose to stay consistent. Also the art itself is very simplistic and realistic. So if you want beautiful art and animation, i don\'t think this will satisfy you.The music for this series is heartwarming and relaxing. It soothes the heart. The OP and ED sung by (K)Now_Name is very catchy and they suit the series well. Nothing much to say in this part.Overall, although I gave this a score of 7/10, but honestly the enjoyment I got from watching this is a serious 10/10. It\'s just that if you look at it seriously and critically, it doesn\'t deserve a 10/10 because it ain\'t anything outstanding. It\'s an anime that reached my expectation and didn\'t outbreak it. I will recommend this to those who enjoy watching the working series by PA Works or those who are tired of same cliche story every season and want a breathe of fresh air. That\'s it. Thanks for reading. 2. CAN BE BIT BORING IF YOU ARE NOT INTO SLICE OF LIFE<LONG REVIEW>Sakura Quest is a breathe of fresh air compared to a lot of anime we received lately.

It's not particularly attractive and touching either. But as the unnamed town itself depicted, things can be simple and yet you will never forget that feeling.Sakura Quest is a small story that enclose a big dream revolve around changes that none would want to make and changes that shape the characters' life, perhaps forever. It is indeed a long quest to get attached to the story but it is a journey that is worth the ticket. To understand that dream is more than just a dream and to work...hard towards one goal.This is the charming point that made up their story. The five heroic girls that started it all and ended up creating something bigger than themselves, bringing forth feelings long forgotten by the townspeople themselves and laying their recklessness, naiveness and foolishness bare to be seen by all. So futile, yet so beautiful that you couldn't help but immerse yourself in their adventure.To be honest, it was the ending song of first arc, 'Freesia' that somehow gets to me before I've even watched this. And having watched it, it is the perfect song that capture a bit of their youth and their drive to be something more than they can achieve. It has an upbeat rhythm that ignites their adventure and at the same time, dropping a melancholic taste for unseen future. An amazing combination of both.Overall, Sakura Quest will always be remembered by someone out there not only because of the sweetness of the story but also the memory that it left behind. And in the end, the queen departs, having made the town a little happier, and becoming quite happy herself.Cherish your own happiness! hard towards one goal.This is the charming point that made up their story.

And in the end, the queen departs, having made the town a little happier, and becoming quite happy herself.Cherish your own happiness!"", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I no longer live with my parents; it’s been that way for quite a while now.Having grown up in their home for so long, though, I can still picture it clearly to this day. The layout of the kitchen. Which floorboards creek. That cool sensation of the basement on a hot summer day. While nothing too extraordinary ever happened in or around the area, its own charm bursts forth all the same.This sentiment could very well be nostalgia talking. But I’m pretty sure that Sakura Quest would agree with me to some extent: that such...a beloved home will be there waiting for my return with open arms.STORYSakura Quest stands as another entry in P.A Works’ (the studio behind this project) pseudo-series of shows that combine both work life and normal life into one neat package. While a female protagonist and job-related struggles remain the norm, the narrative ditches hotels and animation studios in favor of an entire village and its pursuit to stay relevant within an ever-changing society.However, “relevant” isn’t exactly the right phrasing. “Rural rejuvenation” (as the anime would put it) highlights the main throughput a lot better. Indeed, over the course of its entire twenty-five episode run, the women in charge of the revitalization of Manoyama – namely the “Queen” Yoshino and her “champions” Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri – make it their so-called quest to keep the culture, the people, and ultimately the village afloat despite its withering prospects.These passionate ladies do so in a rather structured manner. While a few of the given episodes act as transitional or singular asides, the anime mostly splits itself up into two-episode mini-arcs. These arcs often focus on one of the women and a personal dilemma of hers which then induces semi-slice-of-life and semi-dramatic moments at a continual pace.In turn, these issues weave back into hoisting Manoyama onto its countryside feet. For example, they put together a singles-matchmaking day for women from outside of the town to possibly hook up with men from within it. Or they bring the townsfolk together with a new-food-idea competition that celebrates their homegrown foodstuffs. While the back half of the series maintains even further structure with the subplot of finding the three golden treasures of yore, the women never falter in their main quest: reinvigorate this lovely place which they call home.No matter the happenings and no matter how much the Board of Merchants and the Tourism Board butt heads, Sakura Quest feels right at home when it talks about home. In other words, its thematic exploration of what home is, does, and means provides the narrative with many a soulful moment. After all, “home is where the heart is,” and this anime has a ton of heart at that. It runs the gamut: pitting city life versus country life, having pride in one’s birthplace, finding a sense of direction in the midst of new surroundings.As Dorothy of The Wizard of Oz would put it, “There’s no place like home,” and these ladies learn this fact firsthand. Not just in their interactions with the people throughout the village but also in their different activities as they learn about the history of this quaint yet storied location. They come to sincerely appreciate its offerings if they have not already, and they realize once again what has made it so swell if they already have.In the end, Yoshino and her dear friends come to a rather simple conclusion: “home” is the place where he or she can always return to. Not too shabby of a message at all.Unfortunately, a tornado of sorts hampers Sakura Quest and its content when it seems to toss aside satisfying recompense. Truth be told, revitalizing is not so much the important part of the show as it is the catalyst that creates the groundwork for the characters and the themes to do their thing. Still, their efforts never seem fully qualified or justified. The ideas and the all-over-the-map approach to saving the town rarely results in actual results that contribute to some form of overall improvement.It’s not about them failing; that’s a somewhat common occurrence. In fact, their very first venture with the overabundance of manju concludes with them being unable to sell the snacks off in full. Yes, these moments at least demonstrate the difficulty in making their dream a reality. Rather it’s the outcomes that do put them on the right track that barely seem to mean much if not anything at all.The woodworking project, the movie deal, the old school. These arcs no doubt have a presence in how they explore that home-centric premise and do what they can to make Manoyama feel more interconnected. Nevertheless, the patchwork push to get there leads to a troubled meandering feeling. And when it hardly seems as if this rural rejuvenation bears tangible fruit, a subsequent loss in the sense of success, despite the massive efforts expended, pops up time and again throughout the season.Results notwithstanding (and forgiving Sakura Quest for perhaps relying on the upset-so-better-run-away schtick one too many times), the events and the themes still create for this story a solid narrative worthy of the similar cousins which came before it.ART & ANIMATIONTo make Manoyama a place worth visiting, Sakura Quest puts a lot of effort into curating its visuals to emphasize the splendor and the sereneness of this home away from home.Much of this feeling comes from the overabundance of scenic, establishing, and one-off shots. While they may seem unnecessary at times, their ability to highlight the welcoming nature of this place cannot go understated. The fruitful farms. The quiet streets. The sturdy trees. The filled buildings. The local attractions.While certain spots are visited more than others, such as the ladies’ cottage and the Chupakabura Kingdom, these shots are wonderful to behold. Manoyama isn’t designed to be just some random pinpoint on a map; it’s meant to be a believable place worth visiting. And the visuals certainly entice the audience in this way. If nothing else, they are extremely important, for they orient the audience to Manoyama, and they promise that quaint, homely feel through expressing the beauty, the charm, and the identity therein.On a similar level, the character designs across the board find strength due to the realistic variety on display. Heights, ages, body types, postures, facial features, hairdos. Rather than just changing up the colors, Sakura Quest goes really out of its way to make each individual citizen have their own individual style. And, in doing so, Manoyama feels that much more inviting with a populace unique to their hometown.One would be remiss in not singling out Yoshino and the other leading ladies. Not only do they channel that same mantra of realistic variety in their designs but also their attractiveness and personality exude forth without much trouble. Best of all, they seem to carry a portable closet with them wherever they go, for their outfits change constantly, sometimes within the same episode. Such attention to detail puts them one step further in terms of appeal and gives the visuals yet another edge to stand upon.Unfortunately, Sakura Quest stumbles slightly as it goes along. Certain artistic errors due pop up infrequently, such as shadowing errors and consistency in actions. More generally, the actual animation tends to noticeably worsen as the season progresses. It’s never egregious or unacceptable, maintaining at least a passable state. Still, the overall quality in movement does not stay uniform for its entire run.With the majesty of Manoyama and the variety of the designs outweighing these smaller missteps, the visual direction for the anime remains in good spirits from start to finish.CHARACTERSWhile Manoyama houses many people within its rustic abode, Sakura Quest keeps most of its focus on the five women who spearhead this rural-rejuvenation project: Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri. Each lady receives roughly two two-episode outings; one in the first half of the season and one in the second half of the season. Altogether, these developments combine their upbringings and their characteristics into a lively group, and they also give a better indication of their thoughtful ideas and meaningful aspirations.First up, as the main protagonist, Yoshino initially finds herself down on her luck. A churn of failed job opportunities and a bunch of unfortunate fortunetelling tries leave her lamenting her current situation. When she transfers to the countryside by accident, she believes things could not possibly get any worse.And she’s right; they don’t. Instead, her time as the “Queen” allows her to expand her horizons, to learn of the value in the places that she would otherwise dreadfully deem as “normal”. She connects with the townspeople, sympathizing with their own perspectives. She invests a ton of effort into making this quest a reality, acquiring a sense of the time such a massive undertaking entails. She reevaluates herself, finally discovering her true calling in life. Yoshino does not necessarily captivate the audience during her tenure at Manoyama, but her involvement no doubt leaves an impression on her new home and her new self forevermore.Somewhat in contrast, Shiori grew up in Manoyama, calling this special place her own home for here entire life. Cute, innocent, and sincere, she simply wants to see it thrive. Her optimism and her niceness shine through with her signature “No worries!” phrase, ensuring that the group maintains confidence even as problems manifest.Shiori plays the most interesting role within the group insofar as the story does not impact or influence her as much as the other women. But this direction is by design. Where they change over the course of the season, she remains somewhat static as she distills hope to those around her for the betterment of the cause. The waning village forces her to rethink her own attachments, and Erika’s views test her mindset, yet she ignites her passion for dedication despite what they may encounter. In some sense, she is the heart and soul of Manoyama, the stalwart defender of its heritage and its worth. So, watching her reaffirm her home makes for an intriguing inclusion.“Odin Detective” Maki undergoes a similar process when compared with Yoshino rather than Shiori. Tomboyish and cool, her straightforward words mean well even if they tend to seem negative from time to time. However, her greatest asset comes in the form of a Swiss Army Knife of talents. When she struggled as an actress, she took on many different part-time jobs, granting her a wide range of skills which she applies to the revitalizing project at hand and filling out the next part when needed.However, acting remains a part of her in turn, and what she thought she had already buried resurfaces to challenge her mettle once more. Incremental steps bring back some lost courage, but further failure deters her from trying harder. Thankfully, a loving family (and specifically a proud father) allow Maki to realize that it is less about striking it big and more about making sure that having fun comes first and foremost.Compared to Yoshino, Shiori, and Maki (and later Riri), Sanae is the most mature, acting as a font of wisdom with her smarts and her communication. She works with computers, and so she applies her knowledge of programming and technology where possible.She begins with a position in Tokyo, but she felt unsatisfied with the slog and the sense that her presence could easily be replaced. Naturally, then, Sanae wanted to find somewhere where she felt useful and wanted. Although she starts off just going along for the ride, she eventually finds purpose in her pursuits and worth in her actions, inspired mostly by the woodworker, by the researching professor, and their unique ideals.As for Riri, she is quite shy and therefore the quietest of the bunch. She doesn’t have very many friends, and her closest relative is her grandmother Chitose, the head of the Board of Merchants, whom she lives with and hears opposing thoughts from by proxy. She also loves the occult more than anyone: aliens, unidentified creatures, strange beings elsewhere. But the Internet is as far as she has scoured for them. Both sides of her origin combine to give her an isolated, unadventurous lifestyle.Riri rarely ever says much throughout Sakura Quest, yet it becomes clear that she wishes to break away from the routine and the walls which surround her. The story understands her ideology, too, presenting her with chances to make this breakage a reality. She improves her confidence as the main singer of the special song which encapsulates Manoyama, and she befriends the foreign visitors who likewise follow her interests in the occult, encouraging her to travel to see the world beyond her room.Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri each undergo many trials (as outlined above), so their reliance on one another and their general closeness leads to a tightknit group of dear friends between them. Their banter and their advice, their sadness and their happiness. The year they share together culminates as a positive experience that turns into humble beginnings which they can look back on with fondness – wherever fate takes them next.Sakura Quest has many, many other side and semi-main characters. Yoshino and the other four understandably earn the most attention, however, the supplemental material that these extras provide – such as Doku and his machines and Takamizawa and his bus driving – are still an intriguing addition. They either move the plot along, bring in a new viewpoint to consider, or otherwise contribute to the anime while almost never seeming as though they do not belong.In short, the leading ladies and the other cast members demonstrate that Manoyama is a worthwhile home.MUSIC & SOUNDSakura Quest refuses to rest in the music-and-sound department, giving the audience several reasons to praise the choices therein.Much of this praise goes to the original soundtrack. Jazzy drum fills, piano interludes, lighthearted cultural tunes. The anime can glide effortlessly between a countryside feel and a poignant mood without dropping a beat thanks to the simple yet wide-ranging musical arrangements at its disposal. For everything else in-between, the slice-of-life pieces and the soft, cheerful tracks jump in as needed to keep the flow of the show consistent in its emotions without overtaking the actual developments on screen.But it’s the opening and ending tracks, which pull the audience in and lead the audience out (respectively), that scratch that audio itch. The first OP, “Morning Glory”, encompasses the can-do vibe of Sakura Quest with its piano keys, guitar strings, and clapping segments. It springs forth a spry and soulful attitude in the dynamism, a sincerity in the various vocals, and a sense of home in the feint strumming of a banjo in the background. All of which come together as one excellent song.The first ED, “Freesia”, holds just as much strength as its OP counterpart. The gentle acoustic guitar and the pronounced, jangled snapping lay a foundation of calm and of yearning, and the eventual vocals, hip-hop beat, and rousing instruments form a catchy, fulfilling sound. Altogether, these elements lead to another excellent song that emboldens the listener with the notion that a steady pace and a head held high can overcome the obstacles life sometimes throws in the way.The second OP, “Lupinus”, is a bit more structured and not as interesting as its predecessor, but its goal of producing a small jam occurs anyway. The slower groove of the electric guitar and the drums working in tandem in the first half create an introspective sound as the vocalist strolls along. The second half, however, goes for a floatier atmosphere, leading to an optimistic approach that matches the tone of the first OP.The second ED, “Baby’s Breath”, follows suit in that its replacement of its predecessor incurs some slight disappointment, but such thoughts quickly leave as this new track grows on the listener. The set of notes from the acoustic guitar are so much fun to whistle along to, and the cheerful mixing of the piano, the shakers, and the female vocals make it hard not to have a smile on the face once the song ends.And, of course, the anime would not be complete without some very solid voice-acting performances out of its important cast members. In particular, Reina Ueda as Shiori channels her inner cuteness and niceness once again, solidifying her household-favorite status; Ayaka Nanase as Yoshino delivers a young, gung-ho manner of speaking in one of her first and major roles within her field and the medium at large; and Atsushi Ono as Ushimatsu brings the older, determined edge for the gentleman most invested in seeing Manoyama flourish.With nary a complaint to be found, the audio design may just be the best feature of Sakura Quest.ENJOYMENTI had a lot of fun with this show, and I attribute that feeling to a few different key factors.One, I really liked the setup for this tale. Adult characters. An enticing setting. A set of intriguing themes to explore. This anime appealed to me on a fundamental level, so I rarely (if ever) found myself disliking its direction.Two, I was fond of both Shiori and Sandal (especially Shiori). Shiori was awesome with her positivity and silliness, and I could relate to her staunch pride when it came to the love she has for her home. On the other foot (per se), Sandal was eccentric and honest, and his out-of-nowhere sayings, his crazy timings, and his English usage got me laughing right away.Three, I thought certain scenes stood out. The play in episode twenty, the flashback moments across the various episodes, and the majority of episode fourteen made for a divergence (however slight) from the usual path the anime took. I gave these scenes and others a big thumbs-up.And four, the ending managed to get me a tad emotional. Its sweet wholesomeness and its decided completeness had me nodding my head in approval.Otherwise, I was more or less entertained by this anime. While I do wish that romance was more prominent, and I would have liked to have seen better callbacks to previous episodes, I enjoyed the comedy, the interactions, the style, the nostalgia, and the maturity presented. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it an incredible anime, but it certainly left an impression on me regardless.Sakura Quest blossoms into its own wonderful project. The caring ideas, the lovely visuals, the meaningful characters, the fantastic musical offerings, and the high amount of fun turn this anime into a place that many people out there would likely consider just as beloved as any other.SUMMARYStory: Fine, rural rejuvenation and a purposeful message about home keep Manoyama afloat, but the narrative suffers from a lack of results in the efforts expendedArt & Animation: Good, numerous establishing shots give Manoyama its beauty, and the impressive number of designs and outfits prove the attention to detail, even if the infrequent lapse in artistic direction crops upCharacters: Great, Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri are each influenced in some way by this quest, their group rapport brings further strength between them, and the extra cast members contribute to the writing backing both the plot and the ladies as wellMusic & Sound: Great, the OST fits very well within the confines of the setting and the feeling of the moods, the first OP and the first ED are excellent, the second OP and the second ED are nice follow-ups, and the VA performances are quite solidEnjoyment: Good, the setup, Shiori and Sandal, certain scenes, and the ending are key factors in the entertaining time crafted hereFinal Score: 8/10-----I dedicate this review to my amazing Grandpa Ron who passed away a few months ago. Whether at the Cracker Barrel, up at the family cottage, or at his own living room, his jolly laugh and his kindhearted soul made any place feel like home. Wherever you are, Grandpa, I love you dearly, and I hope to carry on your wisdom as best as I can. a beloved home will be there waiting for my return with open arms.STORYSakura Quest stands as another entry in P.A Works’ (the studio behind this project) pseudo-series of shows that combine both work life and normal life into one neat package.

And when it hardly seems as if this rural rejuvenation bears tangible fruit, a subsequent loss in the sense of success, despite the massive efforts expended, pops up time and again throughout the season.Results notwithstanding (and forgiving Sakura Quest for perhaps relying on the upset-so-better-run-away schtick one too many times), the events and the themes still create for this story a solid narrative worthy of the similar cousins which came before it.ART & ANIMATIONTo make Manoyama a place worth visiting, Sakura Quest puts a lot of effort into curating its visuals to emphasize the splendor and the sereneness of this home away from home.Much of this feeling comes from the overabundance of scenic, establishing, and one-off shots. While they may seem unnecessary at times, their ability to highlight the welcoming nature of this place cannot go understated. The fruitful farms. The quiet streets. The sturdy trees. The filled buildings. The local attractions.While certain spots are visited more than others, such as the ladies’ cottage and the Chupakabura Kingdom, these shots are wonderful to behold. Manoyama isn’t designed to be just some random pinpoint on a map; it’s meant to be a believable place worth visiting. And the visuals certainly entice the audience in this way. If nothing else, they are extremely important, for they orient the audience to Manoyama, and they promise that quaint, homely feel through expressing the beauty, the charm, and the identity therein.On a similar level, the character designs across the board find strength due to the realistic variety on display. Heights, ages, body types, postures, facial features, hairdos. Rather than just changing up the colors, Sakura Quest goes really out of its way to make each individual citizen have their own individual style. And, in doing so, Manoyama feels that much more inviting with a populace unique to their hometown.One would be remiss in not singling out Yoshino and the other leading ladies. Not only do they channel that same mantra of realistic variety in their designs but also their attractiveness and personality exude forth without much trouble. Best of all, they seem to carry a portable closet with them wherever they go, for their outfits change constantly, sometimes within the same episode. Such attention to detail puts them one step further in terms of appeal and gives the visuals yet another edge to stand upon.Unfortunately, Sakura Quest stumbles slightly as it goes along. Certain artistic errors due pop up infrequently, such as shadowing errors and consistency in actions. More generally, the actual animation tends to noticeably worsen as the season progresses. It’s never egregious or unacceptable, maintaining at least a passable state. Still, the overall quality in movement does not stay uniform for its entire run.With the majesty of Manoyama and the variety of the designs outweighing these smaller missteps, the visual direction for the anime remains in good spirits from start to finish.CHARACTERSWhile Manoyama houses many people within its rustic abode, Sakura Quest keeps most of its focus on the five women who spearhead this rural-rejuvenation project: Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri. Each lady receives roughly two two-episode outings; one in the first half of the season and one in the second half of the season. Altogether, these developments combine their upbringings and their characteristics into a lively group, and they also give a better indication of their thoughtful ideas and meaningful aspirations.First up, as the main protagonist, Yoshino initially finds herself down on her luck. A churn of failed job opportunities and a bunch of unfortunate fortunetelling tries leave her lamenting her current situation. When she transfers to the countryside by accident, she believes things could not possibly get any worse.And she’s right; they don’t. Instead, her time as the “Queen” allows her to expand her horizons, to learn of the value in the places that she would otherwise dreadfully deem as “normal”. She connects with the townspeople, sympathizing with their own perspectives. She invests a ton of effort into making this quest a reality, acquiring a sense of the time such a massive undertaking entails. She reevaluates herself, finally discovering her true calling in life. Yoshino does not necessarily captivate the audience during her tenure at Manoyama, but her involvement no doubt leaves an impression on her new home and her new self forevermore.Somewhat in contrast, Shiori grew up in Manoyama, calling this special place her own home for here entire life. Cute, innocent, and sincere, she simply wants to see it thrive. Her optimism and her niceness shine through with her signature “No worries!” phrase, ensuring that the group maintains confidence even as problems manifest.Shiori plays the most interesting role within the group insofar as the story does not impact or influence her as much as the other women. But this direction is by design. Where they change over the course of the season, she remains somewhat static as she distills hope to those around her for the betterment of the cause. The waning village forces her to rethink her own attachments, and Erika’s views test her mindset, yet she ignites her passion for dedication despite what they may encounter. In some sense, she is the heart and soul of Manoyama, the stalwart defender of its heritage and its worth. So, watching her reaffirm her home makes for an intriguing inclusion.“Odin Detective” Maki undergoes a similar process when compared with Yoshino rather than Shiori. Tomboyish and cool, her straightforward words mean well even if they tend to seem negative from time to time. However, her greatest asset comes in the form of a Swiss Army Knife of talents. When she struggled as an actress, she took on many different part-time jobs, granting her a wide range of skills which she applies to the revitalizing project at hand and filling out the next part when needed.However, acting remains a part of her in turn, and what she thought she had already buried resurfaces to challenge her mettle once more. Incremental steps bring back some lost courage, but further failure deters her from trying harder. Thankfully, a loving family (and specifically a proud father) allow Maki to realize that it is less about striking it big and more about making sure that having fun comes first and foremost.Compared to Yoshino, Shiori, and Maki (and later Riri), Sanae is the most mature, acting as a font of wisdom with her smarts and her communication. She works with computers, and so she applies her knowledge of programming and technology where possible.She begins with a position in Tokyo, but she felt unsatisfied with the slog and the sense that her presence could easily be replaced. Naturally, then, Sanae wanted to find somewhere where she felt useful and wanted. Although she starts off just going along for the ride, she eventually finds purpose in her pursuits and worth in her actions, inspired mostly by the woodworker, by the researching professor, and their unique ideals.As for Riri, she is quite shy and therefore the quietest of the bunch. She doesn’t have very many friends, and her closest relative is her grandmother Chitose, the head of the Board of Merchants, whom she lives with and hears opposing thoughts from by proxy. She also loves the occult more than anyone: aliens, unidentified creatures, strange beings elsewhere. But the Internet is as far as she has scoured for them. Both sides of her origin combine to give her an isolated, unadventurous lifestyle.Riri rarely ever says much throughout Sakura Quest, yet it becomes clear that she wishes to break away from the routine and the walls which surround her. The story understands her ideology, too, presenting her with chances to make this breakage a reality. She improves her confidence as the main singer of the special song which encapsulates Manoyama, and she befriends the foreign visitors who likewise follow her interests in the occult, encouraging her to travel to see the world beyond her room.Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri each undergo many trials (as outlined above), so their reliance on one another and their general closeness leads to a tightknit group of dear friends between them. Their banter and their advice, their sadness and their happiness. The year they share together culminates as a positive experience that turns into humble beginnings which they can look back on with fondness – wherever fate takes them next.Sakura Quest has many, many other side and semi-main characters. Yoshino and the other four understandably earn the most attention, however, the supplemental material that these extras provide – such as Doku and his machines and Takamizawa and his bus driving – are still an intriguing addition. They either move the plot along, bring in a new viewpoint to consider, or otherwise contribute to the anime while almost never seeming as though they do not belong.In short, the leading ladies and the other cast members demonstrate that Manoyama is a worthwhile home.MUSIC & SOUNDSakura Quest refuses to rest in the music-and-sound department, giving the audience several reasons to praise the choices therein.Much of this praise goes to the original soundtrack. Jazzy drum fills, piano interludes, lighthearted cultural tunes. The anime can glide effortlessly between a countryside feel and a poignant mood without dropping a beat thanks to the simple yet wide-ranging musical arrangements at its disposal. For everything else in-between, the slice-of-life pieces and the soft, cheerful tracks jump in as needed to keep the flow of the show consistent in its emotions without overtaking the actual developments on screen.But it’s the opening and ending tracks, which pull the audience in and lead the audience out (respectively), that scratch that audio itch. The first OP, “Morning Glory”, encompasses the can-do vibe of Sakura Quest with its piano keys, guitar strings, and clapping segments. It springs forth a spry and soulful attitude in the dynamism, a sincerity in the various vocals, and a sense of home in the feint strumming of a banjo in the background. All of which come together as one excellent song.The first ED, “Freesia”, holds just as much strength as its OP counterpart. The gentle acoustic guitar and the pronounced, jangled snapping lay a foundation of calm and of yearning, and the eventual vocals, hip-hop beat, and rousing instruments form a catchy, fulfilling sound. Altogether, these elements lead to another excellent song that emboldens the listener with the notion that a steady pace and a head held high can overcome the obstacles life sometimes throws in the way.The second OP, “Lupinus”, is a bit more structured and not as interesting as its predecessor, but its goal of producing a small jam occurs anyway. The slower groove of the electric guitar and the drums working in tandem in the first half create an introspective sound as the vocalist strolls along. The second half, however, goes for a floatier atmosphere, leading to an optimistic approach that matches the tone of the first OP.The second ED, “Baby’s Breath”, follows suit in that its replacement of its predecessor incurs some slight disappointment, but such thoughts quickly leave as this new track grows on the listener. The set of notes from the acoustic guitar are so much fun to whistle along to, and the cheerful mixing of the piano, the shakers, and the female vocals make it hard not to have a smile on the face once the song ends.And, of course, the anime would not be complete without some very solid voice-acting performances out of its important cast members. In particular, Reina Ueda as Shiori channels her inner cuteness and niceness once again, solidifying her household-favorite status; Ayaka Nanase as Yoshino delivers a young, gung-ho manner of speaking in one of her first and major roles within her field and the medium at large; and Atsushi Ono as Ushimatsu brings the older, determined edge for the gentleman most invested in seeing Manoyama flourish.With nary a complaint to be found, the audio design may just be the best feature of Sakura Quest.ENJOYMENTI had a lot of fun with this show, and I attribute that feeling to a few different key factors.One, I really liked the setup for this tale. Adult characters. An enticing setting. A set of intriguing themes to explore. This anime appealed to me on a fundamental level, so I rarely (if ever) found myself disliking its direction.Two, I was fond of both Shiori and Sandal (especially Shiori). Shiori was awesome with her positivity and silliness, and I could relate to her staunch pride when it came to the love she has for her home. On the other foot (per se), Sandal was eccentric and honest, and his out-of-nowhere sayings, his crazy timings, and his English usage got me laughing right away.Three, I thought certain scenes stood out. The play in episode twenty, the flashback moments across the various episodes, and the majority of episode fourteen made for a divergence (however slight) from the usual path the anime took. I gave these scenes and others a big thumbs-up.And four, the ending managed to get me a tad emotional. Its sweet wholesomeness and its decided completeness had me nodding my head in approval.Otherwise, I was more or less entertained by this anime. While I do wish that romance was more prominent, and I would have liked to have seen better callbacks to previous episodes, I enjoyed the comedy, the interactions, the style, the nostalgia, and the maturity presented. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it an incredible anime, but it certainly left an impression on me regardless.Sakura Quest blossoms into its own wonderful project. The caring ideas, the lovely visuals, the meaningful characters, the fantastic musical offerings, and the high amount of fun turn this anime into a place that many people out there would likely consider just as beloved as any other.SUMMARYStory: Fine, rural rejuvenation and a purposeful message about home keep Manoyama afloat, but the narrative suffers from a lack of results in the efforts expendedArt & Animation: Good, numerous establishing shots give Manoyama its beauty, and the impressive number of designs and outfits prove the attention to detail, even if the infrequent lapse in artistic direction crops upCharacters: Great, Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri are each influenced in some way by this quest, their group rapport brings further strength between them, and the extra cast members contribute to the writing backing both the plot and the ladies as wellMusic & Sound: Great, the OST fits very well within the confines of the setting and the feeling of the moods, the first OP and the first ED are excellent, the second OP and the second ED are nice follow-ups, and the VA performances are quite solidEnjoyment: Good, the setup, Shiori and Sandal, certain scenes, and the ending are key factors in the entertaining time crafted hereFinal Score: 8/10-----I dedicate this review to my amazing Grandpa Ron who passed away a few months ago. Whether at the Cracker Barrel, up at the family cottage, or at his own living room, his jolly laugh and his kindhearted soul made any place feel like home. Wherever you are, Grandpa, I love you dearly, and I hope to carry on your wisdom as best as I can.', ""This is a no spoiler review. This is not really going to be a full review as the anime is not yet completed at the time I am writing this review. In fact this isn't so much a review as it is just some of my thought on why I enjoy what I have watched so far and why others may find this show appealing. I'm going to write this assuming you read the synopsis of the show. First I want to talk a little about the surface of the show, which ill start with the aesthetics, first off the show has a very pleasing...color pallet from the characters to the village of Manoyama, which really stands out during scenes that are directed during the day and evening. Every thing looks lush and is very pretty and easy on the eyes. The characters all stand apart in their design from their hair, apparel, facial design, physique, and personality which extends to the supporting cast. The characters themselves feel like they fit some archetype some more than others and for the most part they fit these archetypes, however there is more to each character and some change than I expected and hope that continues even in the smallest of ways. the voice acting and sound quality is great even with out understanding Japanese you know which character is talking due to the voice actors and actresses performance and the music that is present is fitting for the scenes in which they are played. Each character is like able in their own regard and the show itself is easy to relax to.  Now what I really want to talk about is the theme. If you aren't aware of Japanese culture today many if the villages throughout japan have been going through the trouble of the younger generations leaving to find work in big cities across japan leaving the older generation to try and keep their community and culture from dying. This theme is very much played throughout the show. The show is very much slice of life but its more recurring and central theme and story is bringing in an outsider and other outsiders to build a tourism department to help revitalize the village while trying maintaining a sense of integrity and utilizing it's natural agriculture and culture to appeal tourism to their village. There are scenes where the the tourism department clashes with some of the local over the methods they try to use in bringing in tourists to the village due to some of the villagers not finding these methods true to there village and this is what i like most about the show. How do you save a village while trying to stay true to itself and  maintain integrity but also adapting to new ways and ideas while not letting parts of old traditions hold you back and how to reinvent old traditions that in a way that can maintain its long history and spirit. Like I said in the beginning this is what I have taken away so far from watching just 8 or 9 episodes, so be aware this may change with further viewing. Any way I hope this helps in making your decision to watch this anime and thank you for reading and sorry for any grammar spelling mistakes and writing structure this is my first review. color pallet from the characters to the village of Manoyama, which really stands out during scenes that are directed during the day and evening.

It isn't something to be looked up upon as the greatest at what it does, but for what it's worth. It was an enjoyable experience that had emotion. Character interactions were fun and seeing Yoshino build this town up with the help of her friends was cute. Might not be up there with the likes of Hyouka or Violet Evergarden, but it's still something I love dearly.Soundtrack is something calm for a show of this type. OP's and ED's are great as well. A good lil slice of life tale of friends helping out a small little town. "", 'I did watch this show when it was initially airing, and have rewatched it recently after buying the blu-ray. It was a favorite of mine, and I think it does have very high rewatch value after the past five years. It was maybe more enjoyable for me on the second watch. I was actually surprised how much of the show I remembered. This one stuck with me more than many slice of life series. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a more realistic, and relaxed slice of life series to enjoy.I was immediately sold on the initial premise of this show after...the first episode. Japan does have an issue with many small towns in the country dying because the young people are moving to Tokyo and other larger cities. This abandonment of the countryside is happening all over the world, but is very prevalent in Japan. I follow some youtubers and vloggers who talk about this kind of thing often so it was a topic that I am already familiar with and am somewhat interested in. The first episode does a good job selling you on Yoshino as a character, and why she would decide to stay in Manoyama despite being from a small town herself and resenting it. Most of the first half of the series is focused on fleshing out the main five girls, and why they are here. The other 4 main characters: Sanae, Shiori, Maki, and Ririko all are pretty different from each other and have different strengths and reasons for joining Yoshino as her ministers of tourism.The Kingdom of Chupakabura idea seems random, but Japan actually did a lot of wild things around the 80s and 90s because the country just had a lot of money and spent it on random things. Later Japan’s economic bubble would burst, and many expensive tourist attractions would be abandoned. There are a number of abandoned theme parks, love hotels, and other random buildings in Japan’s countryside. Japan has a lot of domestic tourism, meaning Japanese people travel around Japan a lot. So Manoyama’s unique set up actually does make sense for them to have made, but when we begin the show it is very apparent that it is outdated. Japan has an obsession with Tokyo, and most young people think that is where this is supposed to be. Sakura Quest’s goal of showing that you can find happiness somewhere else is nice to see because of how different it is from what most anime or how people in real life feel about the subject. The simple kind of happiness is the hardest to achieve.Sakura Quest takes a very optimistic approach for dealing with the problems they face trying to boost local tourism as well as interest in Manoyama to outsiders, and the actual residents of the town. The series is positive, but not unrealistically so. The tourism board does not always win, and it takes a while for Yoshino to really decide what she wants the goal to be for herself and her ministers in Manoyama. They initially just try to do anything that will make an impact, and increase the tourism in the town. Also they do a few random things to help the people that currently live there. Their metrics of success are hard to measure, but this leads to some unique storylines during the show. The vague goal of the tourism board is something that the show does address.The characters are probably the greatest strength this show has. Our five main heroines all have a lot of character growth from where we meet them in the first 2 episodes. A big theme in this show is finding your purpose in life, and all of these young women are still trying to find that themselves. I found Yoshino, and Sanae to be very relatable myself, and I think Maki may have been the most well developed by the end. Some of the girls receive a little less focus then the others. The show never does tell you why Sanae decided to go to Manoyama which seems really important. Most of the story arcs tend to focus on one character specifically to tell their story in better detail. The supporting cast also does have some memorable characters who are very important to the story and the setting of Manoyama as a whole. Sandal is a personal favorite, and he provides a lot of unexpectedly comical moments as well as having a very interesting back story himself.It is unfortunate that this series is not more popular, but I guess it is not very surprising. The workplace comedy genre is kind of small, and the average anime fan is pretty young still. Sakura Quest fits this kind of weird spot where it is not a healing/Iyashikei anime, but is a slice of life that is not a romance either. Now the show does have a lot of comical moments, but overall the sense of humor is more amusing then what you may call a comedy anime. Also there is some conflict that the characters’ deal with. The show does not have much fanservice thankfully, but there is this weird ongoing theme of people harassing Sanae specifically. This was not funny, and distracts from what the show really is and kind of undermines the message of that particular story arc in episode 17. It would have been better if these scenes were not in the show at all, but thankfully these moments only really happen twice. Outside of those moments Sakura Quest is mature in a different way that many anime fans probably won’t be ready for until they are adults trying to figure out what to do with their lives. If I had to describe it with one word it would be either motivational or uplifting. Sakura Quest is a very positive series overall that makes sure to show that it is okay to fail. Over the last five years I wish we had more shows like this, and less garbage isekai anime that are competing for who can have the silliest name. More importantly though it is a shame that this show may not be getting a follow up movie. The other 2 workplace shows that P.A. works made before Sakura Quest both did receive a movie.Sakura Quest is very meaningful to me and holds a special place because it originally aired when I was in my last semester of college, and ended when I was at my first real job. The optimistic message about work legitimately helped me for some of the early months of that job which did not go well. A lot of the messages and quotes stuck with me, and with rewatching the show it was good to see some things I forgot. Being an adult is hard, and things don’t always go the way we planned when we were younger. The ending of the series is also beautiful. “Whatever your job is you can find inspiration in it” is something I want to feel myself one day. the first episode.

For many others, the journey to a profession and aspiration, is a zigzagged path filled with uncertainty, frustration... and excitement. From the start of Sakura Quest, pink-haired protagonist Yoshino finds herself going down the latter, more scenic route. The anime in which she stars is a similarly uneven, though worthwhile work that narrates Yoshino and four other young women's tenures as travel ambassadors working to revive the rural town of Manoyama.Sakura Quest consists of two halves: one side focuses...on the characters' personal issues and development and the other centers on the town's struggles with its dwindling population and economy. The first cour of the anime is very dialed in on the main characters. The travel ambassadors are the primary agents of the show, so it's natural to spend time delving into their backgrounds and personalities. Unfortunately, the way the show goes about it is very formulaic. After introducing Yoshino, the writers devote two-episode mini-arcs to each of her fellow members. The episodes aren't bad in and of themselves—the one with Maki acting in a low-budget zombie movie is a hectic good time—but the tidy way that each girl's conflicts are resolved puts a damper on the realism that the show tries to build. Ririko's arc is the most egregious in this aspect, as her issues seem too serious and entrenched to be addressed in such a short period, and her problems never resurface as an obstacle later on.Yoshino's development is an important component of the series, as she's initially reluctant to become Queen of Chupakabara, Manoyama's mini-nation attraction. Although it's satisfying to see her grow from an immature kid who hates the sticks into a capable woman who embraces her role and the community, her maturation happens too early and too quickly for it to make a big impact by the end of the show. It's also very heavy-handed: more than once, another character comments on how much Yoshino has changed for the better.One of Sakura Quest's strengths, however, is the travel ambassadors' natural chemistry. They cooperate in their work, they start and resolve arguments, and they make fun of each other, e.g. Sanae's nickname of choice for Maki, “Oden Detective.” The variety of the women's traits make for some interesting dynamics, though the degree to which they have to interact with other members of the community limits the screen time that could go towards deepening or further exploring their relationships. Even so, it's no coincidence that the show is often at its most entertaining when all the girls are hanging out together in their lodging.Speaking of Manoyama's residents, the supporting characters are a mixed bag. Kadota Ushimatsu, the stubborn chief of the tourism agency, is by far the most colorful character, and the show provides a backstory on him that sheds light on his current behavior and mindset. Kadota's energy makes him a catalyst for several plot events, but he's not so over-the-top that he comes off as annoying or out-of-place. On the other hand, you have the man known as Sandal-san, who's pretty much only good for Mitch Hedberg-esque one-liners and an occasional plot device. He can sometimes be funny, but as a character he's flat and sitcom-y. Most of the other townspeople are unmemorable, though one exception is Erika, a cranky young teenager who gets a nice arc that also fleshes out Maki and Shiori. It's also great that she stays rebellious instead of changing overnight after the focus moves on from her.The other major angle of Sakura Quest is the central conflict of reviving Manoyama. One theme that the show does well in examining is the tension between bringing in external influences to boost the town's visibility (at the cost of diluting the local culture) and rejecting outside help (which limits its opportunities for growth). This balancing act that the tourism board has to perform throughout the show is pretty interesting to watch. Of course, the elephant in the room for the series' overarching concept is that the revival of a country town is a very long, protracted process. To its credit, the show doesn't bother attempting to make Yoshino out to be some kind of savior within her year-long contract. But the premise effectively forces it into portraying a couple festivals, a mention of Manoyama on television, and a modest video channel for the town as being more significant than they are, because the alternative to maintaining this optimistic outlook would be to admit that the main characters' efforts won't amount to much in the long run.Sakura Quest has decent presentation and production value. It's not a series that demands a ton of animation, but what's there is adequate. The character art is attractive and distinctive, and the show features a high number of minor characters with unique designs. Another clear indicator of attention to detail is the complexity of the five main characters' wardrobe, as each girl wears over a dozen different outfits over the course of the show. The anime isn't lacking in the sound department either. The voice acting performances are solid, and the opening and ending songs are catchy and competently performed. The first OP is particularly fun due to the animation's synchronization with the music.It's easy to see how Sakura Quest's potential is capped by its premise. Bringing a town back from the verge of death is a task that can't be completed in the time span that the show covers, and even signs of progress are difficult to achieve in the length of Yoshino's contract as Queen. Because of this, the show lacks a plot-related payoff that's truly meaningful. What the series does offer, however, is a glimpse into the life of motivated people working in a rural setting, as well as a relatable, if somewhat shallow, story of a young woman's transition from adolescence to adulthood. In that regard, Sakura Quest does its job just fine. on the characters' personal issues and development and the other centers on the town's struggles with its dwindling population and economy. The first cour of the anime is very dialed in on the main characters. The travel ambassadors are the primary agents of the show, so it's natural to spend time delving into their backgrounds and personalities. Unfortunately, the way the show goes about it is very formulaic. After introducing Yoshino, the writers devote two-episode mini-arcs to each of her fellow members. The episodes aren't bad in and of themselves—the one with Maki acting in a low-budget zombie movie is a hectic good time—but the tidy way that each girl's conflicts are resolved puts a damper on the realism that the show tries to build. Ririko's arc is the most egregious in this aspect, as her issues seem too serious and entrenched to be addressed in such a short period, and her problems never resurface as an obstacle later on.Yoshino's development is an important component of the series, as she's initially reluctant to become Queen of Chupakabara, Manoyama's mini-nation attraction. Although it's satisfying to see her grow from an immature kid who hates the sticks into a capable woman who embraces her role and the community, her maturation happens too early and too quickly for it to make a big impact by the end of the show. It's also very heavy-handed: more than once, another character comments on how much Yoshino has changed for the better.One of Sakura Quest's strengths, however, is the travel ambassadors' natural chemistry. They cooperate in their work, they start and resolve arguments, and they make fun of each other, e.g. Sanae's nickname of choice for Maki, “Oden Detective.” The variety of the women's traits make for some interesting dynamics, though the degree to which they have to interact with other members of the community limits the screen time that could go towards deepening or further exploring their relationships. Even so, it's no coincidence that the show is often at its most entertaining when all the girls are hanging out together in their lodging.Speaking of Manoyama's residents, the supporting characters are a mixed bag. Kadota Ushimatsu, the stubborn chief of the tourism agency, is by far the most colorful character, and the show provides a backstory on him that sheds light on his current behavior and mindset. Kadota's energy makes him a catalyst for several plot events, but he's not so over-the-top that he comes off as annoying or out-of-place. On the other hand, you have the man known as Sandal-san, who's pretty much only good for Mitch Hedberg-esque one-liners and an occasional plot device. He can sometimes be funny, but as a character he's flat and sitcom-y. Most of the other townspeople are unmemorable, though one exception is Erika, a cranky young teenager who gets a nice arc that also fleshes out Maki and Shiori. It's also great that she stays rebellious instead of changing overnight after the focus moves on from her.The other major angle of Sakura Quest is the central conflict of reviving Manoyama.

Joining her are four other young women who are local residents of Manoyama and come from their own unique walks of life, each aiding Yoshino to help develop plans to attract attention to Manoyama.Sakura Quest offers up a rather unique premise for an anime as it explores the struggles faced by small towns to adapt to changing economic conditions.

With Manoyama's tourism committee, the plans that are laid out to draw attention to the town also explore a number of the realities involving rural struggles with town locals preferring to stick with their traditions, clashes between younger and older generations, and the elders not realistically considering moving to an urban area thanks to having practically lived their entire lives in the town they consider home. Sakura Quest is conscious about the realities of Japan's rural conditions and does a solid job at exploring the dilemmas facing rural residents with changing times.What makes the series also worthwhile is the characters surrounding it. Yoshino and the four main girls of the series all have their own distinct backgrounds and personalities with each facing their own unique dilemma such as job struggles, the impossibility of a dream job, or living in isolation. This gives the group of girls something for audiences to connect with thanks to their characters being fleshed out and nor being a full-blown archetype.

I cannot find a...reason for an anime lover not to check this out. reason for an anime lover not to check this out."", ""I watched Sakura Quest. Here are my thoughts:Sakura Quest is a 25-episode show that is mainly focused on the efforts of various civic employees working to promote commerce in a small rural-Japan town and restore its tourism industry. The show is fairly self-aware and is clearly meant to be a social commentary in some ways. Although it is genre tagged as a slice of life, it usually felt more like a drama to me, albeit a slow-paced and not overly emotional one.I liked the main female characters in this. They were all relatable in various ways and felt like real human beings. Much of my...enjoyment of this anime was derived from my appreciation of the characters. I empathized with multiple characters in various ways. The young-adult career search is a frequent theme in the show, which I'm sure many people will find relatable. This anime does a good job of depicting authentic female friendship, carefully built up through personal connections, instead of just superficial character interaction. If you're looking for an anime with female characters that feel like real human beings instead of tropey moeblobs, then Sakura Quest might be worth a try.I have mixed feelings about the writing; although sometimes crude, in some ways it was one of the things I enjoyed most about this anime. There were aspects that I liked and disliked about the writing. Sometimes there are 'coincidences' in the story that are a little too convenient. These sorts of 'plot conveniences' are a symptom of lazy and poorly planned writing, in my opinion. The story demands a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. At times it felt like the plot was a little bit 'forced' and unnatural. These are subtle criticisms, the importance of which will likely vary significantly among different viewers.I really liked the overall themes that were used in the writing, but the plot mechanics through which they were implemented were often very crude. In other words, from a very broad perspective I liked the writing, but the detailed specifics often seemed amateurish and careless. The author had good broad-view ideas, but they were poorly executed. I'm still able to appreciate the writing in some ways, but that requires that I look past the crude details. Providing examples would require spoilers, but I think someone watching the anime will understand my point here. The social and economic issues of rural Japan, and the ways those issues affect individual characters, are core themes in the writing.I liked the writing themes, I liked the individual characters and their respective arcs, but the actual episode-by-episode plot was often boring and almost always crudely executed. Keep in mind that this is a 25-episode anime with minimal 'filler' content. Meaning, no fight scenes, singing scenes, slice-of-life silliness or unrelated comedy skits; the show is nearly always advancing some kind of plot (albeit, a usually mundane one). As a result, when the plot starts to drag it really craters the entire show. I wish that this anime focused more on the character arcs of the cast instead of the seemingly neverending sequence of mundane inconsequential events that took up most of the screentime.In terms of direction, the show has an amateurish feel in this regard as well. Speaking as a very patient viewer, even for me the pacing was slow at times. As I've said in the past, I'm fine with slow pacing as long as screentime is being used effectively. The problem with Sakura Quest is that there is not much else of entertainment value. The viewer is forced to sit through the slow march of the mediocre plot without any other noteworthy potential sources of enjoyment.There are some funny moments. At times, the humour is fairly intelligent as well. It got some chuckles out of me, but it's usually not really a laugh-out-loud kind of humour. Much of the humour is derived from the social commentary aspects of the show, so from a comedic perspective it feels more like watching an amusing parody.Visually, this show is not particularly well animated, but a lot of attention and care is paid to body language and facial expressions. I appreciated this a lot. To me, this is far more important than highly fluid animation. However, unfortunately the art style is quite bland. The character designs are also fairly simplistic.The voice acting is average overall. However, I liked the voice acting for the MC (Koharu); the VA fit her role well and was unique in subtle ways. The OST is unremarkable, although I liked the first ED song.My overall rating: 6/10This anime is amateurish but also charming in some ways. There are some good characters. The writing exhibits many good ideas, but they are poorly executed. enjoyment of this anime was derived from my appreciation of the characters. I empathized with multiple characters in various ways. The young-adult career search is a frequent theme in the show, which I'm sure many people will find relatable. This anime does a good job of depicting authentic female friendship, carefully built up through personal connections, instead of just superficial character interaction. If you're looking for an anime with female characters that feel like real human beings instead of tropey moeblobs, then Sakura Quest might be worth a try.I have mixed feelings about the writing; although sometimes crude, in some ways it was one of the things I enjoyed most about this anime. There were aspects that I liked and disliked about the writing. Sometimes there are 'coincidences' in the story that are a little too convenient. These sorts of 'plot conveniences' are a symptom of lazy and poorly planned writing, in my opinion. The story demands a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. At times it felt like the plot was a little bit 'forced' and unnatural. These are subtle criticisms, the importance of which will likely vary significantly among different viewers.I really liked the overall themes that were used in the writing, but the plot mechanics through which they were implemented were often very crude. In other words, from a very broad perspective I liked the writing, but the detailed specifics often seemed amateurish and careless. The author had good broad-view ideas, but they were poorly executed. I'm still able to appreciate the writing in some ways, but that requires that I look past the crude details. Providing examples would require spoilers, but I think someone watching the anime will understand my point here. The social and economic issues of rural Japan, and the ways those issues affect individual characters, are core themes in the writing.I liked the writing themes, I liked the individual characters and their respective arcs, but the actual episode-by-episode plot was often boring and almost always crudely executed. Keep in mind that this is a 25-episode anime with minimal 'filler' content. Meaning, no fight scenes, singing scenes, slice-of-life silliness or unrelated comedy skits; the show is nearly always advancing some kind of plot (albeit, a usually mundane one).

(contains minor/few spoilers)-The setting is unique, set in a small countryside town in modern Japan.-The theme is unusual, cool, and also unique, it is about the revival of a small town from population decline to prosperity, and the show doesn\'t go around this subject in a very neat or easy way but a fairly realistic and practical manner which I appreciate. Especially since this is a real issue today, and seeing the issue brought up in an anime is heartwarming to say the least, even if I\'m not from a small...community like that.-The main character is so cute! A normal person who values and seeks abnormality. They are a recent college graduate with no luck finding a job in Tokyo, an urban center full of opportunity! Instead, her opportunity is back at the countryside...yet not even back at her hometown, instead in a foreign community that is largely indifferent. But, our MC finds ways to help this town in a positive way that aligns with the small town\'s community values...while also finding herself and about her values in the same process...Oh and, I guess the most important part is that the MC reminds me of Rimuru Tempest from that slime isekai show (y\'know...that one), why? Well, she sure doesn\'t have super powers nor is this show an Isekai. But, the charm of the MC that reminds me of Rimuru is her cute expressions that are foolish, adorable, curious, peculiar, sneaky, sly. The character feels very much alive and real (like most other characters in this show)...yet she fulfills the role of the main protagonist who inspires others with the power of kindness and high level persuasion skills in a fulfilling manner.-The rest of the cast of characters are fairly well developed, especially the main supporting characters that are often around Rimu- I mean our MC \'Yoshino\'. But, the cast of characters in this show is large particularly for the ""background"" characters. They all also feel alive and full of personality, and I don\'t think I\'ve seen any characters in this show which directly remind me of a stereotype. Sure, these aren\'t real people, but those characters are built on (the elderly, shop owners, kusogaki curry ""I wanna go to Tokyo because my hometown sucks"" girl, etc.) a well developed essence to each one of them that as the show progress I could feel immersed with this fictional community.Art style...uh, it\'s not bad, right? And it probably isn\'t a masterwork. Yet, everything seems to match together very well. The backgrounds especially are probably renditions of real life locations, and the movements of the anime characters is interesting to look at sometimes because I don\'t often see those types of animations (like a drunk failed actress dancing as a semi-hostage in a room full of separatist elderly village people, or kids dressed up as zombies or kids and teenagers beating those drums).The story? I love the story! Why should I try to review the story which I enjoyed thoroughly? What good would me pin pointing a certain part of the show which may or may not have bugged me, even though the end product was still great? Well, there is probably a good reason, but the point is that the plot does progress and the plot is interesting. This is a WORK-LIFE Slice of Life type anime show, so it doesn\'t have any queen slaying dragons, instead a hometown queen supporting her UMA-Minister friend to sing a song which adores and apologizes the dragon. Oh, and I like the international undertones throughout the series, especially the enigma which is Sandal and the Spanish folks.Sound? Can\'t tell if it\'s great or not but it\'s certainly not terrible. There isn\'t a masterpiece orchestral soundtrack for this show either, but once again, everything worked out the way it was. And the UMA-Minister\'s song is sweet and simple.Personally, I enjoyed this show immensely from start to finish. So, I give it a 10/10.But, reality is calling me and is telling me to be more objective...so, if YOU are someone who likes these types of shows then I would say this anime is a solid 8/10. 6/10 if you are trying to be really fair. And, anything below that would be a cruel judgement...you ""young foolish outsider""...baka! community like that.-The main character is so cute! A normal person who values and seeks abnormality.

And, anything below that would be a cruel judgement...you ""young foolish outsider""...baka!', 'File this show under \'pleasant surprises\'. An anime drama I tried out mostly tried on a lark turned out to an unexpectedly interesting look at one of Japan\'s major domestic issues, carried by good production values and decent writing.STORYA cutesy anime girl takes a job in a small Japanese farm town due to mistaken identity, finds four other anime girls to be her teammates at the local Tourism Department, and... has to contend with Japan\'s growing problem of rural depopulation as the combination of the country\'s infamously low birthrate and increasing urbanization leaves many areas with uncertain futures? OK, I didn\'t see that coming....Not to say this show is a dry social studies thesis trying to disguise itself as an anime- \'Sakura Quest\' does function perfectly well as a drama about early adulthood. I\'ve seen other anime that tried to address contemporary social and political issues, such as C-Control\'s commentary on the financial crisis of the late 2000\'s, but that show ultimately fell apart as its attempts to get THE POINT across caused the rest of the writing to suffer. Meanwhile, SQ is able to avoid those pitfalls and works as a drama even if you don\'t understand the context. There\'s an interesting little narrative trick to this show: it starts off largely episodic as the main 5 girls simply bounce from one tourism gimmick idea to another, but begins to develop more long-running plot threads as the cast begins to form more solid and coherent plans. I won\'t say SQ is the drama to end all dramas, but it is solidly written.ART & SOUNDPA Works has a reputation for making well animated shows and SQ is no exception. It doesn\'t quite ever reach Kyoto Animation heights and the art style is as \'anime standard\' as it gets, but it is aesthetically pleasing and consistent. Look, I know I\'m a \'writing\' reviewer, not an \'art and music\' kind of reviewer, so I don\'t have much say on this topic other than both topics are solidly done although not mind-blowing.CHARACTERSCall me crazy, but this anime reminded me of \'The Andy Griffith Show\'. Yes, an anime from 2017 made me think of a 1960\'s American sitcom. Hear me out, both center around small rural towns with large casts of quirky characters who bounce around relatively normal \'straight man\'. Sakura Quest manages to build a large cast with strong characterization. These cast members may not all undergo large-scale character arcs, but we do quickly get a sense of what a character\'s \'schtick\' is and how they interact with the other cast members. It helps the viewer keep track of everything in a story that\'s as much about the town as it is about any one character. Points are also in order for making a cast with a clear majority of adult characters actually act and sound like adults. They deal with issues like career burnout, parental conflicts, and long-term grudges in ways that seem plausible for grown human beings. And how many anime can you think of where one of the central long-running conflicts is the small town politics between the Tourism Department and Board of Merchants, and the cast makes it both believable and interesting? The character arcs are relatively straightforward and don\'t throw any truly unpredictable curveballs, but they do have good drama writing behind them.ENJOYMENTI personally appreciated that Sakura Quest was able to combine commentary on significant Japanese social concerns with solid entertainment. Other folks with less interest in issues with sexy names like ""increasing urbanization"" will still appreciate it as a good drama about a young adult woman trying to find her place in the world and understand what she truly wants in life.OVERALLAll-time classic? I doubt it. But I will be using \'Sakura Quest\' as a solid benchmark for what is and what isn\'t a good drama anime.

But I will be using \'Sakura Quest\' as a solid benchmark for what is and what isn\'t a good drama anime.', ""I've taken an interest in P.A. works since watching Hanasaku Iroha back in 2011. The studio makes original  stories that are rarely seen in anime and other forms of media and they can turn them to really interesting and entertaining shows. For Sakura Quest, it is no different. This is the studio's third attempt at making a working women anime. The focus here is on our MC, Yoshino, who is an young adult trying to find a job in Tokyo. Through certain events, she ends up working at a town in the countryside of Japan along with our other 4 heroines. Her job however...is to somehow promote this town and make it a vibrant place again which is a large challenge for them to tackle.The story of Sakura Quest could have gone several ways. Through my personal experience with P.A. works, their works can be very bipolar. From the calm yet beautiful atmosphere of Hanasaku Iroha to the garbage that is known as Glasslip (YES! Glasslip was a mistake!). There were several moments in the beginning that had me worried about the direction the show would go. Thankfully, the show did focus on these 5 working women and not stray of course. The plot has small arcs after episode 1 which are around 2 episodes each focusing on each main heroine. This formula continues until the second half of the show only to slightly re-continue. Overall, I enjoyed what each arc showed and the development it gave to the main character. I also loved all the little issues presented as should be with this setting including topics like the elderly and technology, resistance to change, migrating out of rural areas to big cities, and working a job you like vs or following your parents footsteps. The biggest drawback to the story would be around episode 20 when it has this small arc dedicated to one of the child characters I found difficult to enjoy because of my annoyance of said character.The art of the show was good. P.A. works has continually done beautiful work and it continues here. There were moments where I was impressed with what I was seeing. There were however moments when the art slightly dipped in quality. Despite this, the show looked good but I would rank it below Hanasaku Iroha which was P.A. works best in terms of art.The sound of the show was an area I had the hardest time with but that doesnt mean it was bad or even forgettable. First, the first ending to this show is absolutely glorious. The band has done Hai to Gensou no Grimgar's opening but I never really cared for that. Sakura Quest has proved me wrong. This band is really good. The soundtrack also does the job well but in moments where there should be a huge emotional impact, I found the soundtrack was weaker than I expected. Lastly, while I liked the second opening, I found the song to not match the show and would've better fit a sports anime.I found the characters of Sakura Quest to be its strongest point. Much like how people who live in rural areas are more connected to each other, I found the side characters to be charming, memorable, and most importantly, realistic. They have their own ideas, their own personalities, preferences, and I couldn't help but like this diverse side cast. Similarly, I enjoyed the main cast as well. Each had small arcs dedicated to them and were very engaging. Personally, I found Sanae and Maki to be the best written while I found Shiori and Yoshino to need a bit more development.Overall, I'm glad to say I really enjoyed Sakura Quest. I had my worries it would become okay or worst (Glasslip)... but am glad with how it went. The show despite its seemingly bland plot, was able to engage me throughout and even made me want to go to visit Manoyama. This was one of P.A. works better shows and had me engaged throughout.

I was wrong and I really enjoyed it!!The storyline is original and what I loved about it is that its not a typical harem or romance anime. It was enjoyable to watch and I actually got sucked into it but wasn't hooked on it (where I would want to finish it all at one time). It has a good storyline about friendship and how a small town can be fun and rewarding. It makes me want to know how all the characters ended up...a couple years later! a couple years later!"", ""Thursday, April 26, 2018, 8:18 AM Is the day I started watching this. It Is now Saturday, July 14th, 2018 1: 54 AM.... It took me over 3 months to watch this. That entire time I only watched two new shows that came out in that time.It's not that this is a bad show. I, in fact, see this as being a rather good show. The animation, Characters and some of the storylines are fairly interesting.  I think the reason as to why it took me so long and now holds the record for the longest amount of time I've spent watching a show...( I've read a bad and boring manga and it only took me 2 months) Is two reasons.I around that time just started getting into LN and started mostly reading that. I also found issues with some of the storylines or characters in this.The main storyline I'm not a fan of. In fact. The only one that I can say I really like is the storyline of Mika, Voiced by a personal favorite actress. Just about everything from her personality, Design, and storyline I like. I'm not a fan of how obvious it is that she won't get a job as an actress. I was actively wanting her to become one and liked the relationship between her and her actress friend.  I do wish both Mika and the pink hair girl ( Forgot her name) Became famous together and entered acting together.Other storylines I don't find as much interest in. Sure the main girl's storyline is kind of interesting but the story doesn't do much ( By the way I call BS on her not being famous, Any person that has Pink hair like that would be famous and not just in acting but also science, PINK HAIR IS NOT NORMAL!)I don't like the elders in this. From some annoying grandma and dude in charge of Tourism all the way to some dude making Exo suits ( Get's flashbacks to COD) I honestly dislike the science dude. He is annoying and his inventions that the military have problems, It kind of is annoying and takes out the Slice of life and turns into more into a fantasy story.I do like all the characters though, At least the female ones. We do get some annoying male characters and an annoying little brother ( Thankfully we rarely see him) I like that the story has these people be adults and do adults activities. It's rare for me to see stories like that so when I see the characters drinking I am surprised for a minute tell I remember their age.The animation is pretty good. I didn't really have any problems with it. Was a step above the usual good animation.I at times did find myself skiping some scenes or even episodes and was able to tell what's happening still.I'd say the biggest problem is that It's not really a story for me. I still enjoyed it and won't be biased cause of my frustration of how long it took me to finish this. I think something that also bugged me is that you don't see much in the way of the city improving at all. We're just told it is.

As a college student i still don\'t know what i still want to do after i graduated, sure i do want to practice my engineering degree but not to the point that i\'m really looking forward to work, mainly because one of the big reason i choose this path is career opportunity. This anime reminded me that not all things we plan/want will go our way sometimes we need to go a thorny path in order to...grow and learn, in this way we can appreciate every little things we have and be mature enough to understand that at one point we are foolish to dream of something unrealistic that we forgetting how important the present is. Shoot this anime got me really hard. The OST is perfect i love every songs in this anime. The art is great, it might not be top notched but the ambiance was there and lastly the anime might be boring at first half(at least for me) however there\'s something about it that you want to stick around and for me that is to know what will be the conclusion of the 5 heroines. It shows that every one of us have different dreams and perspective in life but at some point in life you\'ll be surprise to meet these different people become part of your life and what do you know? you\'ll help each other grow and become friends(sounds cliche? yes but it\'s still beautiful) along the way that will help each other to realize to chase your dreams and your not fighting alone.

It shows that every one of us have different dreams and perspective in life but at some point in life you\'ll be surprise to meet these different people become part of your life and what do you know? you\'ll help each other grow and become friends(sounds cliche? yes but it\'s still beautiful) along the way that will help each other to realize to chase your dreams and your not fighting alone.

And to be honest I believe I should've watched it back in 2017 when it dropped because with all these years of watching anime, I think that my taste in anime has changed a lot, and Shōjo is no longer a genre that I feel attracted to. So I dropped the anime now...just cause it's not the type of anime I like anymore, even though the 4 episodes I've watched were actually good. I might go back and watch it again, but for now, I will put it on my dropped list. just cause it's not the type of anime I like anymore, even though the 4 episodes I've watched were actually good.

RahXephon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/165/RahXephon,"[""To start off, I'm going to say I am not a big mecha fan. All I knew when I started this series was that it was a mecha/sci-fi/action anime that some of my friends looked down upon due to its unfavorable comparisons to Neon Genesis Evangaleon (which I haven't seen). Other than that, I had no idea what I was in for, and that's how I like it. What I got, in short, was a surprisingly great show, well made, that really grew on me very quickly.STORY: The story can be the weakest part for some people, it isn't simple or linear, but, I think,...it's not too, too complicated. You are in Ayato's shoes at the start, and it's very understandable to be confused as to what's going on. With a little faith and some brain power, keep going forward and it'll all be revealed if you keep your eyes open. The story is woven well and, without giving much away, I'll say that it's about Ayato's journey to learn about: the world he's in, the real world, who he is/was, who the giant flying robots are, and what his purpose is in relation to the people around him. Vague, right? I know, this area is pretty sketchy, and intentionally so. The story is deep, the story is more than slightly convoluted, and the story is good. Give it a chance. 8/10.ART: One of the things I instantly liked about this show was the art. I knew this anime hadn't come out yesterday and, despite being a guy who just has to have what's new and now, I really liked the animation. The colors are great, everything is well drawn, with special detail to the mechas (which, surprisingly, some mecha animes overlook, go figure). I didn't find anything that really stood out as bland and there were few- if any- weak points in the animation. It didn't feel dated at all despite having come out 6 years ago. 9/10.SOUND: The Opening/Ending to RahXephon really caught my ears, just like the art caught my eye. The ending theme is beautiful, and sent me to sleep (in a good way) more than once while watching the episodes back to back. The music always fits the mood, the sound effects are great, and a lot of the tracks are lovable. Indeed, one of the 'themes' of the show is about sound, and there's a bit about singing, which I won't get into unless I want to get into spoiler-land, but Sound is definitely one of RahXephon's strong points. The voice acting is top notch, if you're someone like me who always wonders whether to bother with the dub, well I loved it. Ayato's voice was great, the supporting character's were pretty good, and Vic Mignogna was... well, he's Vic Mignogna. 10/10.CHARACTER: Second to Sound, here's where the series shines the most. And yet it gets an 8- why? Because of the unavoidable connections between Character and Story. The complexities of the Story mixed with the large cast of characters sometimes made it hard to keep track of who was who, something I found really disappointing. Also, aside from Ayato and the main, let's say other two, it was difficult to tell who the main characters really were. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, but the ambiguity, imo, could have been handled a little better. Nonetheless, the characters themselves, once you've gotten to know them, will blow you away. I really connected with Ayato and many of the supporting cast. A lot of them are deep and, over the course of the series go through so many intense emotional periods, the most passionate parts of their lives. You see them at their best and their worst, really getting to know them, and though it can get kind of tricky keeping track of them all, you'll definitely have an opinion of them if nothing else. 8/10.ENJOYMENT: I really don't know what it was. Could it have been the 'artsy' undertones? The score, the production, the characterization? Or maybe I'm just a mecha fan underneath who hasn't come out of his shell, I don't know, but what I do know is: I really, really liked RahXephon, and I put it up there in my top 3 favorite animes ever. I forget how I stumbled across it, really, but I'm glad I did. What began as a way to kill time ended as really something of an experience. I understand this series has many parallels to NGE (see above), and after watching this I started to understand why NGE fans so vigorously shoved it into my face, for I was doing the same with RahXephon. You COULD say having to watch the series a second time to understand everything counts as replay value, maybe, but who knows? I know I didn't fully get everything on the first go around (which is really what keeps this thing from truly, truly being perfect). 9/10.OVERALL (aka: tl;dr version):STORY: Ayato's journey of self discovery takes him into his own mind and places far beyond. Well written, but very complex; worth giving your full attention. 8/10.ART: Fluid, beautifully done, smooth and nicely drawn animations that keep your attention. 9/10.SOUND: Amazing English dubbing, and the japanese voices are nothing short of what you'd expect either. Spectacular music, OP/ED, and overall great OST/sound effects. 10/10.CHARACTER: A (perhaps too) large and real cast of characters, very real, very human, that may or may not make or break the series for you. 8/10.ENJOYMENT: I'm not sure on this one. Watch the first, let's say 6 or 7 episodes, wait for things to really get rolling, and if you don't like it/are totally lost/absolutely hate it, don't watch it. I for one could not stop watching this anime. 9/10.So how do two 8's, two 9's, and a 10 average out to an overall 10? I have no idea, but I cannot recommend this anime strongly enough. It truly is a work of art.[This was my first review; if you did not find it helpful, please let me know. I'm always happy to talk about this series!] it's not too, too complicated.

First the disclaimer: RahXephon is definitely not for everyone. It\'s usually best to have little to no expectations so as to not contaminate the experience. With RX there are some things you should, and a lot of things you should NOT, expect.I would be remiss if I didn\'t mention how significantly challenging of a show it is to get into. You certainly have to be in the right mood/mindset for it. It is easy to label this show as an action, drama, sci-fi mecha romance (or whatever), but what does any of that mean? If you\'ve seen Neon Genesis Evangelion, expect this...show to have a very familiar... setting. This is usually the first thing people notice (and usually complain about). Mecha is probably the least important aspect of this show however. The story is also very heavily character driven, so the pacing is very slow and the action is sparse. Coupled with this, the sci-fi aspects of the show are limited and more of a sub-plot if anything. At its heart however RX is ripe with drama and romance, but above all else, it is a very well written and a stunningly artistic show.That being said, if you are the kind of person who likes to analyze things and gestate them and appreciate the fine art in works, then RX has a lot to offer. This is not to say that RX is an intellectual tour de force meant only for the highest of brows, but rather as a hint for people who like that kind of stuff. If this is not your style or what you are in the mood for, then there is a very good chance you will find this show simply boring, meaningless, and/or just an inferior version of NGE.I initially tried to watch this show with my brother and we were both wondering ""when does anything cool happen?"" Some months later I tried watching the show again, by myself this time, late at night. Under these conditions I was able to just sit back and enjoy what was going on. So I definitely recommend watching this under similar settings where you have time to view at least a few episodes and focus on them.Story:There\'s not really much to say about the story that isn\'t covered in any synopsis. There are elements of mystery that can be confusing at times, but get more or less resolved/explained eventually (with minor exceptions). Some of the temporal ideas they play with are kind of interesting. The way information is revealed is pretty well done. You slowly get immersed into the world(s) and things become more intriguing and entertaining the more you get to know the characters. What\'s more, it actually has a conclusive and COHERENT ending, which is more than I can say for the majority of anime. There\'s nothing I hate more than getting really into a series only to have it end in some crazy, sudden, ambiguous, and/or arbitrary manner. I HATE THAT SO MUCH. *deep breath* Ok, so, stories with good endings get high marks from me. I can\'t really say what it was I liked so much about the ending without essentially spoiling it, but suffice to say I found it very.... emotionally satisfying.Do not be fooled. Even though the Japanese love to throw robots into almost everything, RahXephon is scarcely a mech show except in the most token of ways. The fights involving mechs are brief and mostly forgettable. They really serve more of a symbolic and artistic purpose than any kind of technical combative entertainment. This is most prominently exemplified in episodes 19 and 26. The sci-fi part of the story is mostly nonsense, but it\'s very pretty looking and sounding nonsense. This is what really counts here. It doesn\'t matter if the plot is silly or has been done before, what matters most isn\'t what is said but HOW it is told. The real story lies beneath the surface of the sci-fi mecha mumbo jumbo, and if this isn\'t clear by the end then you\'ve really missed something.NGE vs. RX:If you\'ve already seen Neon Genesis Evangelion then you might be put off by how strikingly similar this show appears to be. It\'s true; the parallels between RahXephon and NGE are uncomfortably pervasive. They both have a young male lead thrust into piloting a mech for some organization to fight against abstract enemies. They both have an older female character who introduces and protects/shelters the main character. They both take place, obviously, in (post-destruction) Tokyo and of course are mankind\'s last hope against a prevailing alien threat. Coincidences like these will probably catch your eye throughout the show, however, RX is not the blatant ripoff one might think. These common threads are superficial and are no more egregious than two shows having the same ""harem of girls fawning over an awkward guy"" plot.Here\'s where the shows stop being similar: NGE provided a more realistic mech story with deep psychological overtones and Christian themed undertones; RX centers around capturing a certain... aesthetic more than anything else. So if you are going to watch RX, it is important to bear in mind that the thing you\'ll take away most from it is not the ""edge of your seat action"" or the ""mind blowing concepts"" but one thing: aesthetics. Here RX triumphs over NGE most magnificently; it is simply and stunningly beautiful.Art:The character designs put me off a little bit in the beginning. There was something so simple and plain about them that didn\'t sit right with me. Their colors were too solid and too flat. The designs are definitely different, and after a while I either grew used to them or stopped caring, because everything else about the art in RX is just amazing. The time and effort they put into the backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking. The other thing I liked about RX is that even though the enemies are abstract looking, they\'re not just weird floating giant eyeballs or anything obnoxious like that. The abstraction in RX actually retains a certain ""realistic"" genuine design, they look like something someone might actually build.Sound:I\'d say the sound in this series shares in the same spirit of aesthetics. I mean, how could it not? The plot revolves around the idea of a world suffused with sound. If you are spinning a story that is largely character driven and are trying to immerse the viewer in visuals then it is equally important that the music draws them in as well. Some of the melodies are really solid/memorable, but the most important part is that the mood and tones are always set just right. Since music/sound is supposed to be a big theme of the show, it would\'ve been nice if there had been more distinguishable harmonic singing as opposed to the mostly tonal chanting that goes on. In this area I don\'t feel they really tapped into their full potential beauty and the incessant droning can get a little annoying...The Op/En themes were alright, maybe a little too tranquil for my tastes. The dubbing was surprisingly good. I usually watch an episode or so dubbed and then watch a couple subbed before deciding how to watch the series, but the dub was so well done that the thought to switch over never even came to me. This is not to say it was flawless, Vic Mignogna\'s voice didn\'t seem to quite fit, but whatever. Comparing it to the subtitling, I might even go as far as saying that the dubbing was possibly better...Characters:The main character is a refreshing alternative to your typical amoral badass or whiny, obnoxious brat. No stupid sidekicks or comic relief here, no retarded antics and none of the usual cliche archetypes that make up your usual lineup. Most of the characters are really well done, a few of the minor characters could\'ve been better developed, but they\'re all fairly believable and likable. With the exception of Makoto, who is just an unbelievable prick. It\'s never really explained why he\'s such an insufferable douche bag either. This ultimately doesn\'t matter, some people are just bastards for no good reason, but it would\'ve been nice if at least A reason was given. In fact, it would\'ve been better if some of the characters motives had been elaborated on more.If you\'ve seen and liked Eureka 7 (also by Bones) then you already have an idea about what a story driven by wonderful characters is like. Of course, having good characters alone is not what makes this show unique. More so than the visuals or the sound, where RahXephon really excels is how heart warmingly romantic it is. I don\'t mean this in some cheesy, lovey-dovey, soap opera kind of way. It\'s somewhat hard to explain. You can watch this show and not even pick up on it, but that\'s part of the magic. It\'s not overdone and it\'s sort of subtle about it but still effective.Even the characters are beautiful in a way. I hate stories where characters act or react in ways that have no bearing to real life, so when they interact believably it just makes it that much more enjoyable for me. Let\'s take harem shows for instance where the main male lead is either painfully oblivious to (or shows no interest in) any of his would-be female suitors. Or, when there\'s some ridiculously breasted female character (and there\'s a lot of them in anime) and people just act as if it\'s the norm, when you know, YOU KNOW, every single male (and lesbian?) eye would be locked on to that woman all-the-time; everywhere she went. I HATE when shows do that.So I was SO glad to see RahXephon took that extra step to make the characters feel more real rather than just inundate the viewer with more of the usual idealistic/innocent baloney -- and I\'ll always love it for that. The characters are so sincere and so genuine with one another that it made watching them gripping. In that same vein of realism, I absolutely loved how... amorous the characters were. You\'ll see scenes where cleavage might catch someone\'s eye, or where there will be an air of sexual tension, or proximity promiscuity, and all these other sensual elements that were deliciously but tastefully mature. This extra layer made the characters so much more... human. I really loved this about the show, and it is probably what I\'ll remember most: just how playful and fun and passionate and real they appeared to be. So by the time I got to the end, it was such a memorable and moving journey that I was sad when it was over. The characters were just so alluring and endearing.Other:There are a lot of mysteries in the show I never understood like who Kamina\'s parents were, or how Haruka found him at that gateway after the disappearance, or the whole clone craziness, or the whole elaborate setup at the end, or why the mu were on earth or where they came from... but none of that really matters. I can\'t really do justice to how much I liked this show, but there\'s a review of it on ANN that puts it into much better words than I have. This is a show anyone who values substance owes to themselves to watch. show to have a very familiar... setting. This is usually the first thing people notice (and usually complain about). Mecha is probably the least important aspect of this show however. The story is also very heavily character driven, so the pacing is very slow and the action is sparse. Coupled with this, the sci-fi aspects of the show are limited and more of a sub-plot if anything. At its heart however RX is ripe with drama and romance, but above all else, it is a very well written and a stunningly artistic show.That being said, if you are the kind of person who likes to analyze things and gestate them and appreciate the fine art in works, then RX has a lot to offer.

So if you are going to watch RX, it is important to bear in mind that the thing you\'ll take away most from it is not the ""edge of your seat action"" or the ""mind blowing concepts"" but one thing: aesthetics. Here RX triumphs over NGE most magnificently; it is simply and stunningly beautiful.Art:The character designs put me off a little bit in the beginning. There was something so simple and plain about them that didn\'t sit right with me. Their colors were too solid and too flat. The designs are definitely different, and after a while I either grew used to them or stopped caring, because everything else about the art in RX is just amazing. The time and effort they put into the backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking. The other thing I liked about RX is that even though the enemies are abstract looking, they\'re not just weird floating giant eyeballs or anything obnoxious like that. The abstraction in RX actually retains a certain ""realistic"" genuine design, they look like something someone might actually build.Sound:I\'d say the sound in this series shares in the same spirit of aesthetics. I mean, how could it not? The plot revolves around the idea of a world suffused with sound. If you are spinning a story that is largely character driven and are trying to immerse the viewer in visuals then it is equally important that the music draws them in as well. Some of the melodies are really solid/memorable, but the most important part is that the mood and tones are always set just right. Since music/sound is supposed to be a big theme of the show, it would\'ve been nice if there had been more distinguishable harmonic singing as opposed to the mostly tonal chanting that goes on. In this area I don\'t feel they really tapped into their full potential beauty and the incessant droning can get a little annoying...The Op/En themes were alright, maybe a little too tranquil for my tastes. The dubbing was surprisingly good. I usually watch an episode or so dubbed and then watch a couple subbed before deciding how to watch the series, but the dub was so well done that the thought to switch over never even came to me. This is not to say it was flawless, Vic Mignogna\'s voice didn\'t seem to quite fit, but whatever. Comparing it to the subtitling, I might even go as far as saying that the dubbing was possibly better...Characters:The main character is a refreshing alternative to your typical amoral badass or whiny, obnoxious brat. No stupid sidekicks or comic relief here, no retarded antics and none of the usual cliche archetypes that make up your usual lineup. Most of the characters are really well done, a few of the minor characters could\'ve been better developed, but they\'re all fairly believable and likable. With the exception of Makoto, who is just an unbelievable prick. It\'s never really explained why he\'s such an insufferable douche bag either. This ultimately doesn\'t matter, some people are just bastards for no good reason, but it would\'ve been nice if at least A reason was given. In fact, it would\'ve been better if some of the characters motives had been elaborated on more.If you\'ve seen and liked Eureka 7 (also by Bones) then you already have an idea about what a story driven by wonderful characters is like. Of course, having good characters alone is not what makes this show unique. More so than the visuals or the sound, where RahXephon really excels is how heart warmingly romantic it is. I don\'t mean this in some cheesy, lovey-dovey, soap opera kind of way. It\'s somewhat hard to explain. You can watch this show and not even pick up on it, but that\'s part of the magic. It\'s not overdone and it\'s sort of subtle about it but still effective.Even the characters are beautiful in a way. I hate stories where characters act or react in ways that have no bearing to real life, so when they interact believably it just makes it that much more enjoyable for me. Let\'s take harem shows for instance where the main male lead is either painfully oblivious to (or shows no interest in) any of his would-be female suitors. Or, when there\'s some ridiculously breasted female character (and there\'s a lot of them in anime) and people just act as if it\'s the norm, when you know, YOU KNOW, every single male (and lesbian?) eye would be locked on to that woman all-the-time; everywhere she went. I HATE when shows do that.So I was SO glad to see RahXephon took that extra step to make the characters feel more real rather than just inundate the viewer with more of the usual idealistic/innocent baloney -- and I\'ll always love it for that. The characters are so sincere and so genuine with one another that it made watching them gripping. In that same vein of realism, I absolutely loved how... amorous the characters were. You\'ll see scenes where cleavage might catch someone\'s eye, or where there will be an air of sexual tension, or proximity promiscuity, and all these other sensual elements that were deliciously but tastefully mature. This extra layer made the characters so much more... human. I really loved this about the show, and it is probably what I\'ll remember most: just how playful and fun and passionate and real they appeared to be. So by the time I got to the end, it was such a memorable and moving journey that I was sad when it was over. The characters were just so alluring and endearing.Other:There are a lot of mysteries in the show I never understood like who Kamina\'s parents were, or how Haruka found him at that gateway after the disappearance, or the whole clone craziness, or the whole elaborate setup at the end, or why the mu were on earth or where they came from... but none of that really matters. I can\'t really do justice to how much I liked this show, but there\'s a review of it on ANN that puts it into much better words than I have. This is a show anyone who values substance owes to themselves to watch.', ""RahXephon is a Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Romance, Drama about a high school boy Ayato Kamina, who believes in the reality that is present before him. However everything changes once he discovers the truth about the world, that humanity is at war.From the very beginning you will be thrown right into the thick of it, knowing very little about the plot, story and overall premise. However as the show goes on it slowly reveals, bit by bit, what it is all about, which is about humanity's struggle against some weird invaders. The story is told well because everything is straight forward and you won&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed...with the back story and all the terms given. However this anime series may lack some originality because it is not too difficult to spot the numerous parallels between RahXphon and the ever-so-popular Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both series about boys being thrust into a war against unknown beings, plus having romantic interest on the side. Nonetheless, RahXephon does manage to become an anime of its own.The characters are fairly well-defined and well developed but only Ayato Kamina stands out, as the protagonist. Yet every episode usually focuses on one of the supporting characters, developing them further. Nevertheless there are times when the characters&rsquo; actions and thoughts are confusing or just don&rsquo;t make any sense.The animation and music quality is the sort of thing to expect from BONES. Even though the animation style is somewhat dated, the way in which everything from the amazing fights to just simple talks is animated so well. Whereas the music adds to the impact of the action and drama, seeing that music is a major element in the show. Yet the music does get fairly repetitive.Overall RahXephon has proven to be a Mecha anime worthy of being included in any mecha anime fan&rsquo;s collection. The combat is pretty impressive and so is the musical score, which goes well with the artistic concept. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a tough show to understand however at times things end up being explained poorly, which can confuse us viewers making the show less enjoyable to watch.

I respect their opinions obviously; but here is my opinion:Quite bluntly said, it was very disappointing.After the first few episodes it is quite easy to agree on this Anime being one of those you enjoy watching. The animation is so-so, but the story is pretty like able since it's being told pretty nicely. Not literally told; but the process in general is well done.My compliments on that, RahXephon.However, the...downfall of this Anime came closer the more the plot came closer to me, the viewer. You see; an Anime can't expect to get a high rating while all they did was complicate a complicated story; thus confusing the viewer.Many things are really badly explained; not to mention that besides this, many things that are part of the story start annoying you.For instance, all these weird looking mechas sing. It's part of the story; I get that much. But after a while; after hearing them singing over and over, episode in and out with that weird noise. It annoys you, irritates you and pretty much 'forces' you to skip that part.Yes, that's true. I've skipped parts. Why?It's simple; the story wasn't convincing enough and became a nuisance.The complicater the story isn't the better. Neither is complicating the images and scenes as well. Vague images appear; nothing much gets explained. Sure, one vague image gets explained. But what about the other ones. What was his motive?Why this, why that?So many answers were unanswered; and for a series that has 26 episodes and a pretty good concept it just didn't quite make it. It's unacceptable.You see, the characters were pretty good. But why complicate things more?For instance, there were over 10 love interests for whoever and whatever in the serie. If I try to recall; I can mention at least 3 people one person had his eyes on, one after the other. Some of them don't even make sense and are quite hard to get. Why was this put in?.. and why so vaguely? Is this reality or isn't it?If only they made the story clearer; this would've actually been good. Though some things get clearer after you watch the movie; it is still not a part of the original tv series. Thus doesn't count. As for this one; it's too confusing that only the first half of this series is actually fulfilling. Many things I was able to guess and foresee. Maybe that's because the story put the concept of one great dramatic scene, not once, but more than three times into the story. That's right, the same exact concept is used; opening my eyes was easy and I was able to see a pattern. And I'm supposed to be dense. Not to mention that the designs of the ending are quite bad. But hey, that's just taste. Too bad the story has nothing to do with taste.The only thing I really liked of this Anime in a whole was the female lead character; though it is discussable if she really is the female lead. But well, she was my only reason of enjoying the last 8 episodes. And even she gets vagued out. So useless and random; I just can't see how making the story more vague this much is thought of to be interesting, good, developing, mysterious and great. Since it just doesn't makes any sense.As for the series in general, and if you should watch it.Well, if you are bored and really want to watch an anime reasonably enjoyable, go ahead. But don't expect much of the story or try to crack your brain; things get explained in the end (partially). It's easy to get; just doesn't makes any sense. So don't worry about thinking things through; the story really did turn crap near the end. At least the ending wasn't sucky right. And I did enjoy this anime for a bit; especially the first half.So yeah, your choice, your time. Just make sure to not blame me if you didn't like it; many people do seem to like it here though, check the other reviews ratings. downfall of this Anime came closer the more the plot came closer to me, the viewer.

It\'s not that it\'s hard to point out positive aspects of something. But it\'s a bit harder to justify your praise for it, without coming off as a fanatic that choses to ignore it\'s flaws. By contrast, it\'s far easier to justify a negative review. My last review of School Days was one of the easiest things i\'ve ever written. A show that i detested for so many reasons, and that others felt the same about, so it was easy to justify my negativity. But what about a review of my favorite show?...One that i believe to be a masterpiece, yet many do not, either out of ignorance of the shows existence, or out of spite for it\'s similarities to the elephant in the room of anime. It\'s been a review that i\'ve been a bit fearful of writing, but i simply cannot hold back any longer. This, ladies and gentlemen, is my review of my number one favorite anime, RahXephon.Story (9/10)In the year 2012, a human-like species called the Mu invade Japan. But that is not where our story begins. Our story begins in the year 2015 in Tokyo, where a young artist named Ayato Kamina is attacked by government officials, only to be saved by the mysterious woman, Haruka Shitow. When Ayato learns that those government officials have blue blood, Haruka promises him the truth that has been kept from him for so long, only for him to run from her to chase after a mysterious girl by the name of Reika Mishima with whom he stumbles on a giant egg that holds the RahXephon, an ancient mechanical titan  than can only be piloted by Ayato. With this, he learns that there is a separate world, right outside the one he\'s lived in all his life, with a 12 year difference to that of Tokyo\'s time. With Haruka and the anti-Mu organization TERRA, Ayato will find the truth. About the RahXephon, about the Mu, and, most importantly, about himself.As you can tell by that not-so-brief description, there is a lot going on in RahXephon. It\'s a series filled with lore, mystery, and symbolism that is just begging to be answered and analyzed, yet the series always chooses to hold close to it\'s chest. The show always gives you enough to work off of, and plenty to keep you interested, but the answers come quite slowly, and there are plenty of times where you\'re left in a state of confusion where you simply have to sit down for a minute or ten, and think about what you just saw. This makes it such a joy when you finally do get those answers and everything finally comes together, but so frustrating to actually continue on with. Many will find themselves fascinated with the show, and invested to find out it\'s secrets, but there are plenty that simply get fed up with being kept in the dark. This is understandable, but RahXephon is definitely a series worth sticking with, and and even greater joy to revisit, once you know all the secrets, and realize that the show gave you a lot more to work with than you gave it credit for.RahXephon is a show doused with Mayan lore and Aztec culture, mixed in with the studies of the fictional continent of Mu, thought up by James Churchwood, plenty of classic literature influence, and plenty of reference to surrealist art. But above all, RahXephon plays with the concept of music. Each episode ends with the words, ""The world, suffused with sound"", and many music terms are often brought up in cryptic riddles, for example. All because one of the main themes of RahXephon, is the idea of music changing the world, though put in a much more cryptic and spoiler-ish manner, and as such, the show itself plays out like a symphony, playing until it reaches it\'s coda, and ends with a striking crescendo.But, while you may further enjoy the show with proper knowledge of it\'s influence, you don\'t need to know them to like the show. RahXephon is a cerebral art piece indeed, but it\'s primarily a romance that centers around revelation and inner strength. It shows how easy it is to come face to face with reality, how hard to is to accept it, and how strong you have to be to move past it in order to find happiness in the bonds that you spend time creating and strengthening, and while it may come with occasional heavy-handedness, the show itself it so genuine, honest, and respectful to it\'s audience with how it\'s presented, that those moments never dampen the show, and the shining moments are ones that will linger on with you for quite a while.Art (9/10)RahXephon is brought to us by Studio BONES, a studio which few, if any, anime fans are unaware of. How could they be when BONES brought us some of the most noteworthy anime to come out, such as FMA and it\'s reboot FMA Brotherhood, Wolf\'s Rain, Eureka Seven, Soul Eater, and Ouran High School Host Club. What some people might be unaware of though, is that RahXephon was one of their first works, and their first big success. While RahXephon is somewhat of a small title these days, it\'s possible that without it, BONES wouldn\'t have the same illustrious future. It seems that BONES may have been aware of this at the time of RahXephon\'s conception, because the show is beautiful, even by todays standards.The show is surprisingly bright and colorful, despite it\'s ominous tone, brought out through the simple yet effective design of the island of Nirai-kanai where most of the show takes place, making it all the more relevant when the tone changes and the backgrounds go dim and eery. As a cerebral show, it loves it\'s share of symbolism and imagery, such as the ever present contrast of red and blue, the reappearing dove portrait, modeled after Rene Magritte\'s ""La Grand Famille"", the use of common day items as representation of characters emotions, such as windshield wipers and a chime. But the most distinct aspects of the art in the show has to be the character designs, done by Akihiro Yamada. It\'s often said that body language speaks louder than words, and RahXephon has proven, possibly more than any other show, that animation is no exception. It\'s almost baffling just how expressive these characters are. The show says more in it\'s character expressions more than some shows say in entire series worth of dialogue, and some more subtle touches, like someone taking a few seconds to look someone in the eye, or just a look that the camera panders on for a second or two too long, can almost tell you everything you need to know about that character.The show doesn\'t slack in the animation department either. In fact, i wouldn\'t say that it\'d be too much of a long shot to say that some parts of the show rival that of modern theatrical releases. But there are two reasons why this section doesn\'t get a perfect score. The first being the actions scenes. The animation for the action scenes isn\'t bad, far from it in fact, and the designs for the dolems are actually quite eye-catching, but it doesn\'t really have the cool factor that you find in most mech fights, and can be a bit formulaic. The second reason is episode 20, which was outsourced to another studio, and looks positively dreadful. Mind you, it\'s the only episode that looks dreadful, but that simply makes it all the more noticeable. Still, what the show delivered in visuals is far exceeded expectations, and made for a defining point in the career of one of anime\'s most beloved studios.Sound (10/10)To match the show\'s outstanding visuals, the soundtrack provides a score of equal quality. RahXephon\'s OST was composed by Ichiko Hashimoto, providing a divisive score, mostly orchestral pieces, where every song stands out from the other and fits the visuals of the show perfectly, but because of this if actually hard to describe, and you\'d be best listening to some tracks yourself and then judging it.As for dub vs sub, you can\'t go wrong with either one, but they actually provide fairly different experiences. The Japanese track is very subtle and sedated, bringing in some real talent with names like Hiro Shimono, Aya Hisakawa, and, my personal favorite, Maaya Sakamoto, each presenting great performances. The dub on the other hand, is actually a little clunky at first, with some performances starting off rather rough, but eventually evolves into one of the better dubs you could possibly listen to, with Chris Patton and Monica Rial giving possibly their best performances to date with their respective roles as Ayato and Haruka. Unlike the Japanese dub, it\'s much more emotional, and more fitting to a drama. Both tracks cater ideally to the show, but in different ways, so it really all comes down to personal preference. RahXephon is a show that centers around sound, so it\'s only fitting that the sound for the show itself comes out with near perfection.Character (10/10)RahXephon is a story of love, determination, realization, and acceptance. These are themes that can only get across with a great sense of humanity in it\'s cast. Luckily, RahXephon delivers fully in that category. The characters follow archetypal designs for it\'s cast, with Ayato being the calm competent protagonist, Haruka being the protective older woman, Quon being the mysterious doll like girl, so on so forth. But there\'s one thing that evolve them far past these tropes and labels into something so much more. Their interactions. No line of this show is unimportant, and often, when one character says one thing, they\'re actually saying 10 different things. It may sound simple, but to achieve it to the level that RahXephon has done is far from an easy task.By the end of it, these characters seem lot less like works of fiction, and more like actual people, complex with genuine desires, motivations, attitudes, and feelings. It\'s this that makes a simple fanservice character like Sayako into a tragic case of solitude and unrequited feelings, or a despicable character like Isshiki into a pitiful being of inadequacy and unfilled hopes. While there are some standout characters, like Maya Kamina, who is one of the best maternal characters period, or Johji Futagami, whose basic role in the series is to just keep being awesome, you\'ll be hard-pressed to find just one favorite character, as there\'s something to love and adore in nearly all of them. Similar to how i liked the School Days ending because it gave the characters exactly what it deserved, i love RahXephon\'s ending because it does the same. Only in this case, it takes an incredible cast of characters, shows them true suffering, but eventually gives them the fate that they had deserved right from the beginning.Evangelion ComparisonIn reviews, it\'s rarely a good thing to compare the work you\'re reviewing to another work. To be honest, i didn\'t really want to have to address the RahXephon/Evangelion comparison, but the show has become so associated with Evangelion, that it\'s almost impossible to avoid. RahXephon came out years after Evangelion, giving the world of mech anime the boost that they needed, and one that would\'ve be given again until the release of Gurren Lagann years afterwards. Since it\'s release, RahXephon has often been compared to Evangelion by fans and critics alike, some saying that it\'s an improved version of Evangelion, while others label it as a blatant rip off. Both of these, i highly disagree with.What makes something a rip off, is when a work tries to ride the coattails of another popular work because the writers simply lack the talent to make something of their own. RahXephon, is an original work with superficial similarities to Evangelion, but is practically it\'s opposite in themes, tone, and execution. But even if they weren\'t, would it really matter? Does it matter that the show in front of your face got it\'s idea from something else, when it provides you a smart, well-written, and emotional story? To some people, it does, and you can spend your time moaning and groaning about it on forums and message boards. But, i will be spending that time watching a fantastic show.Enjoyment and Overall (10/10)RahXephon is an anime that has been all but forgotten, in the West and in Japan. But even so, it has it\'s own loyal fan base that continues to support the show even to this day, and i am proud to call myself one of them. RahXephon has it\'s flaws and could be considered a bit esoteric to some, but it\'s imperfections only make it more beautiful in my eyes. RahXephon is my favorite anime, and i doubt that any other show will be taking it\'s place anytime soon. Anyways, that\'s all for now. Til next time. One that i believe to be a masterpiece, yet many do not, either out of ignorance of the shows existence, or out of spite for it\'s similarities to the elephant in the room of anime.

It seems that BONES may have been aware of this at the time of RahXephon\'s conception, because the show is beautiful, even by todays standards.The show is surprisingly bright and colorful, despite it\'s ominous tone, brought out through the simple yet effective design of the island of Nirai-kanai where most of the show takes place, making it all the more relevant when the tone changes and the backgrounds go dim and eery. As a cerebral show, it loves it\'s share of symbolism and imagery, such as the ever present contrast of red and blue, the reappearing dove portrait, modeled after Rene Magritte\'s ""La Grand Famille"", the use of common day items as representation of characters emotions, such as windshield wipers and a chime. But the most distinct aspects of the art in the show has to be the character designs, done by Akihiro Yamada. It\'s often said that body language speaks louder than words, and RahXephon has proven, possibly more than any other show, that animation is no exception. It\'s almost baffling just how expressive these characters are. The show says more in it\'s character expressions more than some shows say in entire series worth of dialogue, and some more subtle touches, like someone taking a few seconds to look someone in the eye, or just a look that the camera panders on for a second or two too long, can almost tell you everything you need to know about that character.The show doesn\'t slack in the animation department either. In fact, i wouldn\'t say that it\'d be too much of a long shot to say that some parts of the show rival that of modern theatrical releases. But there are two reasons why this section doesn\'t get a perfect score. The first being the actions scenes. The animation for the action scenes isn\'t bad, far from it in fact, and the designs for the dolems are actually quite eye-catching, but it doesn\'t really have the cool factor that you find in most mech fights, and can be a bit formulaic. The second reason is episode 20, which was outsourced to another studio, and looks positively dreadful. Mind you, it\'s the only episode that looks dreadful, but that simply makes it all the more noticeable. Still, what the show delivered in visuals is far exceeded expectations, and made for a defining point in the career of one of anime\'s most beloved studios.Sound (10/10)To match the show\'s outstanding visuals, the soundtrack provides a score of equal quality. RahXephon\'s OST was composed by Ichiko Hashimoto, providing a divisive score, mostly orchestral pieces, where every song stands out from the other and fits the visuals of the show perfectly, but because of this if actually hard to describe, and you\'d be best listening to some tracks yourself and then judging it.As for dub vs sub, you can\'t go wrong with either one, but they actually provide fairly different experiences. The Japanese track is very subtle and sedated, bringing in some real talent with names like Hiro Shimono, Aya Hisakawa, and, my personal favorite, Maaya Sakamoto, each presenting great performances. The dub on the other hand, is actually a little clunky at first, with some performances starting off rather rough, but eventually evolves into one of the better dubs you could possibly listen to, with Chris Patton and Monica Rial giving possibly their best performances to date with their respective roles as Ayato and Haruka. Unlike the Japanese dub, it\'s much more emotional, and more fitting to a drama. Both tracks cater ideally to the show, but in different ways, so it really all comes down to personal preference. RahXephon is a show that centers around sound, so it\'s only fitting that the sound for the show itself comes out with near perfection.Character (10/10)RahXephon is a story of love, determination, realization, and acceptance. These are themes that can only get across with a great sense of humanity in it\'s cast. Luckily, RahXephon delivers fully in that category. The characters follow archetypal designs for it\'s cast, with Ayato being the calm competent protagonist, Haruka being the protective older woman, Quon being the mysterious doll like girl, so on so forth. But there\'s one thing that evolve them far past these tropes and labels into something so much more. Their interactions. No line of this show is unimportant, and often, when one character says one thing, they\'re actually saying 10 different things. It may sound simple, but to achieve it to the level that RahXephon has done is far from an easy task.By the end of it, these characters seem lot less like works of fiction, and more like actual people, complex with genuine desires, motivations, attitudes, and feelings. It\'s this that makes a simple fanservice character like Sayako into a tragic case of solitude and unrequited feelings, or a despicable character like Isshiki into a pitiful being of inadequacy and unfilled hopes. While there are some standout characters, like Maya Kamina, who is one of the best maternal characters period, or Johji Futagami, whose basic role in the series is to just keep being awesome, you\'ll be hard-pressed to find just one favorite character, as there\'s something to love and adore in nearly all of them. Similar to how i liked the School Days ending because it gave the characters exactly what it deserved, i love RahXephon\'s ending because it does the same. Only in this case, it takes an incredible cast of characters, shows them true suffering, but eventually gives them the fate that they had deserved right from the beginning.Evangelion ComparisonIn reviews, it\'s rarely a good thing to compare the work you\'re reviewing to another work. To be honest, i didn\'t really want to have to address the RahXephon/Evangelion comparison, but the show has become so associated with Evangelion, that it\'s almost impossible to avoid. RahXephon came out years after Evangelion, giving the world of mech anime the boost that they needed, and one that would\'ve be given again until the release of Gurren Lagann years afterwards. Since it\'s release, RahXephon has often been compared to Evangelion by fans and critics alike, some saying that it\'s an improved version of Evangelion, while others label it as a blatant rip off. Both of these, i highly disagree with.What makes something a rip off, is when a work tries to ride the coattails of another popular work because the writers simply lack the talent to make something of their own. RahXephon, is an original work with superficial similarities to Evangelion, but is practically it\'s opposite in themes, tone, and execution. But even if they weren\'t, would it really matter? Does it matter that the show in front of your face got it\'s idea from something else, when it provides you a smart, well-written, and emotional story? To some people, it does, and you can spend your time moaning and groaning about it on forums and message boards. But, i will be spending that time watching a fantastic show.Enjoyment and Overall (10/10)RahXephon is an anime that has been all but forgotten, in the West and in Japan. But even so, it has it\'s own loyal fan base that continues to support the show even to this day, and i am proud to call myself one of them. RahXephon has it\'s flaws and could be considered a bit esoteric to some, but it\'s imperfections only make it more beautiful in my eyes. RahXephon is my favorite anime, and i doubt that any other show will be taking it\'s place anytime soon. Anyways, that\'s all for now. Til next time.', '""There are no original ideas. There are only original people.""- Barbara Grizzuti HarrisonOriginality doesn\'t exist nowadays. If there is an idea out there that someone is contemplating, chances are,  someone already beat them to the punch. I remember, during my freshman year of high school my teacher told me that even Shakespeare had taken ideas from even older writers for his plays. In writing, it is common that your ideas share similarities with other works. However, it is the writer’s responsibility to distinguish his/her works from others by adding their own unique style to it. The same applies to anime. RahXephon borrows a lot...of elements from its predecessors: Evangelion, Brave Raideen and still manages to maintain its originality.Story(9/10)- Simply put, the story is about a young boy, Ayato Kamina, who lives a normal life in Tokyo, until one day, mysterious creatures attack. He encounters a strange but beautiful girl, and tries to find his way out of this carnage. Unbeknownst to him, Ayato has the special ability to pilot a mysterious Dolem/mecha called, ""RahXephon."" Now, this is probably a cliché found a litany of other shows, but do not be fooled, this show is anything but a cliché. Ayato soon finds himself in an alternate reality which he feels misplaced. Separated from both his family and friends, Ayato pilots the RahXephon in hopes it will give his life a purpose. RahXephon weaves in its existential themes without preaching them to you; it gives the viewer a chance to absorb it. The ending is usually the part that makes or breaks an anime like this. Let me tell you, this ending is probably one of the best endings to an anime ever. I am not just saying, I mean it 100%. After all the drama and pain, the payoff is well worth it.Sound(10/10)- Music is an integral part to Rahxephon. The show effortlessly incorporates the theme of music into every part of the show. In the title, the root word, Ephon, means the -phone in an instrument. It is the force, besides art, that drives to show to new heights. If you listen closely to the music in RahXephon, it pitches to the many thematic highs and lows of the story. I can tell you, any lover of music will truly appreciate RahXephon.Art(9/10)- The art still remains breathtaking till this day. Studio BONES is best known for the beautiful animation in Wolf\'s Rain, Darker than Black Etc. The show has a very soft color palette; it is very easy on the eyes. It gives off a calming atmosphere, one that will soothe you. There is a lot of symbolism in this show, not Penguindrum or Evangelion levels, but it is present.Now the part everyone has been waiting for, the Evangelion comparison. The show’s number one criticism is that it is exactly like EVA. I scoff at the notion, as the similarities between RahXephon and Evangelion are merely superficial at best. When you get the core of both shows, you recognize they are both fundamentally, and philosophically different from each other. Yes, they are both shows about teenaged boys trying to find meaning in their lives but while EVA is more cynical in its approach, RahXephon is much more optimistic. Evangelion tries to weave a more realistic story with its cynical and flawed characters while RahXephon is a much more, surrealist experience, every episode feels like you are waking up from a long, long dream.Characters(9/10)- The cast of RahXephon is very contradistinctive when compared to cast of most modern day mecha anime. They stray away from the usual archetypes: tsundere, psychopath, generic emotionally repressed villain among other common character tropes. All of the center characters are really fleshed out and very…..human. Everyone has their own faults but they battle with them, and move past them rather than wasting several episodes brooding over events in an, “O woe is me,” attitude like most angsty teenaged protagonists.  Briefly touching on the romance aspect, I must say it is very tastefully done. Every romance comes off organic and real. Instead of the over the top teary confessions you find in most romance anime, RahXephon relies on subtlety and nuance to present romance. From two characters simply holding eye contact with each other, or them flirtatiously wrestling around, you know the characters like each other without them saying it outright. So many heartwarming moments like this lace the show and makes it much sadder when the journey ends.RahXephon is a show that can stand tall on its own merits. It borrows from several sources but keeps the anime from turning into a pastiche by melding all these ideas into a cohesive, poignant and emotionally evocative experience.  By seamlessly blending mysticism, philosophy and romance, RahXephon is able to stand apart from its counterparts. It has a soul of its very own, and that is what makes it shine so incandescently. of elements from its predecessors: Evangelion, Brave Raideen and still manages to maintain its originality.Story(9/10)- Simply put, the story is about a young boy, Ayato Kamina, who lives a normal life in Tokyo, until one day, mysterious creatures attack.

A Bones animation I didn\'t like.A oddly well-received anime, it must translate poorly to Western viewers.STORY: One of the hardest things in anime is setting up an explanation on (1) why giant robots run around battling each other and (2) why teenagers would be allowed to pilot them.  RahXephon fails badly.  It forms an alternative alien society that has singing giant robots with an Egyptian/Mayan motif, throws in various conspiratorial entities and characters, adds a dash of military, and blends in a gaggle of harem romances.  All of this mixes together to form an unfortunate scramble that was a tad overcooked....The protagonist is boring, most of the female romantic interests (I think that there were like 10 or so) are uninteresting, and the other supporting characters undeveloped.  The military unit acts like they are all in high school.  I won\'t spoil the plot but it doesn\'t make any sense.ART: This is Bones, so it is good.  Not as good as DTB or E7, but pretty good.  I hated the design of the mecha, but since the mecha don\'t really matter that much anyways it\'s not a biggie.SOUND: For an anime based on singing and music, the sound in this anime is pretty boring.CHARACTER: See my story section, it says it all.ENJOYMENT: I wish I would have skipped this anime so I could have spent my time watching or re-watching something else.OVERALL: 5.  The art is good, the rest lags.Final assessment: those who said that if you hated Evan, you would probably like this were wrong.  While not as terrible as Evan it\'s not that great.  If I hadn\'t enjoyed Code Geass and to a lesser extent Gurren, I would have given up on the genre.  But while I won\'t avoid future mecha anime I sure won\'t seek them out either after seeing this ""classic""!

RahXephon...Where do I even begin?First off, if you're walking into this with expectations, you'll be disappointed. If you have almost no  expectations at all (Like I did), you'll still be disappointed.Story:I find it funny how people can praise this as being, “Well written,” or say it has a, “Complex story,” seriously...If you thought either of those things after watching this the whole way through, then you need to see a doctor. Yes, I know there's different ways of telling a story, but then there's just throwing a bunch of random bull!@#$ at the viewers with no context or meaning. Yet, people seem...to have a big enough of an imagination that they force themselves (And others) to believe that, if it doesn't make sense you just have to, “Think harder,” because every little thing is symbolic somehow right? People LOVE using symbolism to convince people that the piece of crap they're trying to sell you is actually a diamond. “Well, if you look at it this way.” they say...Don't listen to them, or that little voice in your head saying that you might have, “Missed something,” or that maybe, “It's just to complicated for you.” Because it's not. Some other shows? Maybe... but this one? No, just no.You'd have to be delusional to say this is a, “Great anime.” After watching RahXephon, just reading through the reviews here will make you lose your faith in humanity (If you have any left).

Life is hard :'(  “ doesn't mean they actually have personalities, ok?)Or when they die and then reappear again with absolutely no explanation like nothing ever happened?Or how about when the main one is having an identity crisis every other episode, even after he's already come to the conclusion that he knows who he is TWICE already! And that's on top of the fact that he keeps forgetting who he likes every time there's a girl who throws herself at him.This isn't even supposed to be a romance drama is it?

The plot was absolute nonsense and none of the characters were interesting in the least. The animation, soundtrack, and dialogue were all completely average. I wouldn't personally recommend this show, but that's just my  opinion. Clearly, other people have found something in this show that i haven't seen so feel free to look elsewhere for advice, but I did not enjoy this show. "", ""A special anime.Another anime that's arguably is one of the top ten anime ever. RahXephon is compared by many to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Most say it's better just because it came out a little over a year first. I whole heartily disagree. Evangelion was a complete waste of time. Where Evangelion had a convoluted story, annoying charcters, and bad music.Where Evangelion fails RahXephon succeeds. Rahxephon follows the story of Ayato Kamina who lives in Tokyo, the last out post of the human race. At least that's what he believes until he meets Reika Mishima. She secretly has known him since they were children. She...convinces Ayato to leave Tokyo with her, and they escape aboard a giant robot called the RahXephon. When they leave Tokyo every thing changes for Ayato. He learns that there are people still alive on earth outside of Tokyo, and that the people inside Tokyo are called MU and aren't human. RahXephon blends all the elements of drama, action, romance and some comedy beautifully. There's nothing to complain about. The story is crafted perfectly and coherently so you can understand what they creators of the show are trying to say. The animation style is great, and the music is classic. I loved them adding classical music to anime. Ultimately though what made this a great anime were the characters. None of them were annoying, each growing and moving forward, showing emotion and making you believe they are alive and care about them. I first watched RahXephon back in 2003. I just recently finished watching it for the fourth time. I haven't seen to many anime that are better than RahXephon. I will keep recommending it over Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's a must see. convinces Ayato to leave Tokyo with her, and they escape aboard a giant robot called the RahXephon. When they leave Tokyo every thing changes for Ayato.

It's a must see."", ""A very impressive anime; wonderful animation and brilliant plot.PLOT: On the surface you do immediately get Neon Genesis Evangelion vibes, but RahXephon quickly establishes itself as unique with fantastic character development and a highly original convoluted plot. The show is also much more balanced than EVA – carefully crafted plot progression and with a satisfying ending, it makes for wonderful viewing as each episode adds something to the rich tapestry of plot threads. The characters are extremely well developed and likable – there is a notable lack of the angst that permeates EVA as RahXephon instead focuses on romance. Indeed the main thread of...the plot is a touching love story more than anything else – I found this extremely refreshing in a mecha series. Of course the show has numerous points that had me highly confused and I can not claim to understand exactly what happened at the end, but I got most of it in this 1st viewing – I’ll definitely be watching this show again at some stage though as I’m positive I’ve missed some subtle plot points. Do not watch this show unless you are willing to commit some of your brain cells to it, as the complexity of the plot requires you to be awake when watching!ANIMATION: Wonderful. Simply wonderful – it’s rare to get such consistently high quality animation in a 26-episode TV show, but BONES have delivered a stunning show. The backgrounds are detailed and vivid, the mecha designs highly original and organic, and the character designs are well thought out and pleasing to the eye. Lots and lots of symbolism is used throughout the series, a lot of it centred on the contrast between the red blood of the humans and the blue blood of the murians – the two opposing colours are the most dominant in the colour palate used. Overall a very well animated show – BONES have once again outdone themselves.MUSIC: As much of the plot revolves around music and sound, the soundscape of RahXephon is nothing short of brilliant. Highly atmospheric and rich in tone, the score is like another character and supports the plot perfectly. Lots of operatic vocal work for the D1 Aria’s elevates the action scenes to another level as a cacophony of sound assails you. The background music is well composed and has a timeless classical air to it. I also loved the OP & ED and never skipped over them.VOICE ACTING: A extremely talented group of seiyuu provide the voice work for this series, so many that’s its hard to pick out the best of them! However Hiro Shimono (Akihisa - BakaTest, Keima - KamiNomi ) as Ayato deserves praise as it would have been so easy to let Ayato become bogged down in Shinji-type angst, but he manages to hold back and keep Ayato’s character strong but sympathetic. It’s all the more remarkable, as this was Shimono’s debut role and I generally don't much like his voice! The rest of the cast is equally strong.So yeah, I really liked RahXephon and really highly recommend it to everyone – especially anyone who enjoyed Evangelion. the plot is a touching love story more than anything else – I found this extremely refreshing in a mecha series. Of course the show has numerous points that had me highly confused and I can not claim to understand exactly what happened at the end, but I got most of it in this 1st viewing – I’ll definitely be watching this show again at some stage though as I’m positive I’ve missed some subtle plot points.

However Hiro Shimono (Akihisa - BakaTest, Keima - KamiNomi ) as Ayato deserves praise as it would have been so easy to let Ayato become bogged down in Shinji-type angst, but he manages to hold back and keep Ayato’s character strong but sympathetic. It’s all the more remarkable, as this was Shimono’s debut role and I generally don't much like his voice! The rest of the cast is equally strong.So yeah, I really liked RahXephon and really highly recommend it to everyone – especially anyone who enjoyed Evangelion."", ""I only gave a couple 9's for variety's sake there, this is one of the best. If Anno and the Evangelion crew hadn't scrambled for an ending, and if they had even a trace of sympathy for their fellow man, and if they'd used BONES to animate, they might have come out with RahXephon.It's about supernatural robots, it's about one young man shouldering the responsibility to save the world, but more importantly it's about things that Eva isn't &mdash;&nbsp;love, family, faith in each other, and it carries a message of hope rather than contempt for humanity.It does all that in an action-packed, surreal, package...that's spiced up with a little romance and populated by realistic and likable characters. that's spiced up with a little romance and populated by realistic and likable characters."", ""I don’t really know what to say, seems I’m still digesting everything I saw, ultimately very good.

Wow, I mean the soundtrack alone, such beautiful compositions as well as perfect tones and spot on creative sound design. The editing of this show, as well as the animation for being a 2002 animated tv series (done by Bones no less) has some stand out episodes.

The characters all get enough time to shine with no one feeling too underdeveloped. I think my main gripe with the series is that it’s ‘artsy’ tone can sometimes come across a little too heavy handed, and the references they do use seem a little underbaked, that or I’m just too dumb to get it. When it does move into the more philosophical messages, especially in its dialogue, it doesn’t always hit home with me because I feel they seem to rush or it is too jarring a transition from the scene prior.

This is how RahXephon came to be, and the end result is as difficult to describe and discuss now as it was to predict then. Knowing where to begin, though, has always been painfully easy. RahXephon is not trying to be Neon Genesis...Evangelion. Whether you found Eva to be a spectacular failure or just plain spectacular, its goals are not Rah\'s goals, and to call RahXephon either a ripoff or an improvement of Evangelion would be unfair to both anime. RahXephon has its own story to tell and its own messages to convey, and while it may not have taken the world by storm the way Eva did, the strength of its core, beauty of its craftsmanship, and humanity of its characters still set it apart as an excellent work that can stand tall on its own.Still, their similarities needn\'t be ignored completely for a discussion to be worthwhile; they do exist and people will inevitably notice them. RahXephon is an introspective giant robot anime about a uniquely qualified pubescent pilot who gets drafted by a shady organization to fight otherworldly monsters to protect a world that\'s already been shaken by a cataclysmic event that took place during an iconic year, while also struggling to deal with puberty, distant parents, his own sense of self-worth, romantic entanglements, the expectations of adults, and growing up in general. There\'s no question it would\'ve been made very differently—or not made at all—in a world where Evangelion didn\'t exist, and RahXephon even pays its more famous forerunner direct, loving homage a few times. My personal favorite is a scene in episode 11 that is a backwards shot-for-shot remake of an iconic (and awkward) scene from Eva episode 5. Except that the context, meaning, and emotions conveyed are all completely different, which says a lot about RahXephon as a piece of art inspired by another piece of art. Evangelion was a very important influence to RahXephon, but their similarities are only skin-deep. True inspiration means borrowing concepts that you admire or find fascinating, and then casting them in a completely new light to create something new that reflects your unique view of the world rather than repeating someone else\'s, which director Yutaka Izubichi and his crew have done admirably.Evangelion is also far from the only influence that colors this series. RahXephon draws from many older, perhaps forgotten mecha anime as well, notably Brave Raideen, which informed the design of the titular titan and some of the series\' mythology. Outside of anime, the series blends influences from numerous cultures, time periods and media both obvious and obscure, from ancient Mesoamerican civilizations to Japanese folklore to Churchward\'s mythical continent of Mu to the paintings of Salvador Dali. Thankfully, most of these cultural references have some narrative or thematic connection to the story and never truly cross into ""details for the sake of details"". The series can be watched and thoroughly enjoyed without having read The Dandelion Girl or understanding the meanings of musical terms like Allegretto and Falsetto, but that extra knowledge is a nice bonus if you\'re willing to hunt for it. The world of RahXephon is saturated with subtle and not-so-subtle details and eye-catching visual concepts almost to the point of overload, but all the seemingly disparate pieces fit together in the end, at least in spirit, and everything in its world feels like it belongs there.RahXephon was also blessed with the technical and artistic strengths to convey that world. This was one of Bones\' first projects as an independent studio, and also made during the very early days of digital animation. But the results wildly exceed expectations and have stood the test of time very well. The character designs are sharp and distinctive, and their facial expressions are capable of communicating all manner of complex, subtle emotions with great finesse, which is especially important in a series where characters have a tendency to say a few words to convey volumes of meaning. These are further bolstered by excellent cinematography, beautifully rendered backgrounds and brilliant color choices, with particular emphasis on contrasts between red and blue. The animation itself can be limited compared to modern Bones and some of the effects are noticeably dated, but for the most part it knows its limitations and works well within them. The design work on display is more than enough to carry it even at its most restrained, and the staff at Bones knew how to manage their money, meaning the animation peaks at all the right moments. At worst the production work here is still a notch above merely competent (with one or two noticeable but ultimately forgivable dips in quality), and at best it\'s a visual treat over a decade later.While the animation has aged quite well, time has not been so kind to the English dub, but it\'s not for lack of effort. Contrasting the more low-key and soothing Japanese language track, the dub is loud and raw to a fault. On the downside, this means that some characters sound awkward and over-acted, and at times unsure of the emotions they\'re supposed to be conveying. Some actors take several episodes to grow into their roles, and others never do at all, to say nothing of some of the stiff, overly direct translations they have to read. Still, a few good performances can do a lot to elevate an uneven product, and the standouts of this dub own their roles completely. Chris Patton, who plays the protagonist Ayato, captures the thoughtful and strong-willed but at times emotionally immature teenager remarkably well, and Monica Rial does a positively bang up job capturing both the tough and fragile sides of Haruka. Both actors have cited their roles (and this series) as personal favorites, and the passion behind their performances can be felt. While this isn\'t enough to recommend the overall very clunky English dub over the far more polished Japanese version, it may still be worth a listen.But in a show that uses music prominently as a motif, it’s the soundtrack that really holds it all together. The composer, Ichiko Hashimoto, is a jazz pianist who’s never scored an anime series before nor since, and she gave RahXephon a sound unlike that of any other anime. An eclectic blend of rock, jazz, chamber music and several other styles integrate effortlessly and give the series a personality that\'s classy and dignified, yet also friendly and inviting. It\'s also an incredibly diverse score that can explode into blaring trumpets and war drums when a battle begins, descend into glorious experimental madness when Ayato enters a dream sequence, and envelop its audience in enigmatic, otherworldly chanting as we delve further into the mysteries of the Mu. The only songs not composed by Hashimoto are the opening theme, ""Hemisphere"", and ""Garden of Everything"", which is never used in the show but is nonetheless perhaps RahXephon\'s most iconic song and perfectly encapsulates what the story is really about. Both pieces are composed by Yoko Kanno and sung by Maaya Sakamoto (the latter is a duet with Steve Conte), and both are completely worthy additions to an already outstanding soundtrack, making it a must-listen for anime music enthusiasts.If RahXephon were a conventional mech action series, it could be recommended on the strengths of its style and aesthetic alone, but delivering spectacular robot fights isn\'t its first concern. Like an Evangelion unit, the RahXephon moves quite organically, but unlike an Eva its movements always seem burdened by its own weight. Every motion it makes is slow and deliberate, and consequently from an action choreography standpoint it simply doesn\'t have the cool factor Evangelion did. That\'s not to say the fights lack tension or suspense or a sense of purpose, though. The monsters, enormous clay puppets called Dolems, are varied in both their designs and abilities, often genuinely threatening, and the battles against them are filled with unique imagery. It can be quite captivating to see an organic golem split in half while gushing blue blood. During one battle, there is a shot of the RahXephon\'s hand forcing its way out through a Dolem\'s face, fingers emerging around its still-screaming mouth, and it’s just as awesome as it sounds. But generally this series doesn\'t have the pulse-pounding blow-by-blow excitement of a true action series. While Eva is mostly remembered and revered as a heavily introspective character piece, part of the reason for its mass appeal was that it could initially hook audiences on pure, powerful spectacle. RahXephon has no such hook early on, and this can present a challenge to new viewers who don\'t know what kind of anime to expect.And indeed, the question of what to expect going into RahXephon is not an easy one to answer. We see the world mostly through Ayato\'s eyes and learn as he learns, from the ground up. It takes a full three episodes to reveal the very basic premise you\'d generally expect to see on the cover of the box, and another two or three to establish a solid dynamic that the rest of its episodes can build off of. From there it becomes somewhat easier to follow, but this is definitely not a series you can multitask while watching. RahXephon\'s mysteries are many, complex, and very slow to unravel, and if you\'re not paying careful attention you\'ll end up missing a lot. This is a mature, adult fantasy that speaks eloquent words in a soft voice, delivering key plot points and casual character interactions with equal importance. Like watching a painter at his craft, whether you can see beauty in each individual stroke or are just waiting for the finished product will come down to your own patience and proclivities.The ""strokes"" with which RahXephon paints its picture are its characters, and at the center of its cast is the hero Ayato Kamina. Ayato is a seemingly ordinary teenager who lives in a version of Tokyo that has been displaced from the rest of time and space, and leaves his home to discover that he is destined to ""tune the world"". Over the course of the series, he slowly discovers the truth about the separation between the blue-blooded Mulians that now occupy the world known as Tokyo Jupiter and the red-blooded human beings they\'ve isolated themselves from, unlocks the secrets of the powerful golem known as the RahXephon, and must find out what his own role is in this war between worlds with powerful figures and close friends and family pulling at him from both sides. But while the power he\'s been granted may be extraordinary, Ayato himself always feels like a fully realized, thoroughly grounded, and very real person, despite his reality being repeatedly turned on its head. He\'s not above the influence of others, often getting dragged along one way or another when he\'s lost and without direction, sometimes escaping one controlling environment only to fall into another one. He also has a dangerous habit of not asking important questions when he\'s afraid of what he\'ll find. But he still acts on his own agency, lashing out when he feels wronged, deceived or betrayed and drawing his own conclusions, for better or for worse, from every new discovery he makes.Still, Ayato is just one in a cast of around twenty characters, and to the series\' credit, they all very much take on a life of their own, many of them growing far outside of the archetypes it\'d be easy to initially pin them as. Supporting Ayato, in every sense of the word, is Haruka, the woman who pulled him out of his world, known as Tokyo Jupiter, and into hers. It becomes immediately clear that while her intentions toward Ayato are benevolent, she\'s not being completely honest about her motivations, and her tough, confident exterior belies a very old, very deep emotional wound that she cannot bury no matter how hard she tries. She and Ayato—and the relationship between them—are the clear heart and soul of the story, but they are far from the only great characters worth mentioning. The other cast members have varying levels of depth and complexity, but the series still manages to breathe life and humanity into nearly all of them, ranging from the wonderfully complex characters like Ayato\'s estranged mother Maya and the outwardly cheerful but distant and secretive Doctor Itsuki, to simple, likable ordinary people like the idealistic but dependable TERRA officer Souichi and the reporter Futagami, a character whose sole purpose in the story seems to be spouting exposition, and yet every moment he spends onscreen is a delight. Together, they lend the series a warm, earthy charm that helps to keep it emotionally accessible even when it gets intellectually overwhelming.Like any great painting, though, the true beauty of RahXephon lies not in its individual strokes, but in how they come together. This is a story of resonance between worlds and between people, and its true depths only surface when two characters are given the chance to talk and interact, and the bonds between them are forged, tested, broken and reformed. ""Words can\'t change anything,"" Ayato says. ""They can when people talk to each other,"" his friend Souichi replies. And talk they do. Whether it\'s casual banter between friends, key exposition to give the audience and characters another piece of the puzzle, or a thoughtful elaboration on the series\' themes, nearly every exchange flows with stunning natural ease, and quite a few of them are surprisingly high-minded and poetic, shedding light on some fantastically nuanced relationships. There\'s Maya, for instance, and her relationship with Ayato, which is caught between her genuine desire to care for him as a son and her obligation to raise the perfect Instrumentalist. The compromise she reaches between the two is understandable and even sympathetic, but bears disastrous results. Rebound, unrequited and possessive love are given their due alongside the real thing because, after all, they\'re a part of life too, and seeing characters connect or fail to connect is a rich enough experience that it could have been its own reward.But then there\'s the conflict between the Mu and the red-blooded humans, which gradually becomes world-ending in scope and scale as the deadline for ""tuning the world"" approaches. Attempting to balance and reconcile these two storytelling approaches could have resulted in the series becoming dichotomous and unbalanced. But RahXephon utilizes its larger conflicts to give weight, context and justification to the wide range of small personal issues its cast finds themselves contemplating and debating, often using parallel editing to highlight this, most notably during the iconic, incredibly cinematic climax of episode 19. This comes full circle in the finale, where Ayato finds himself empowered to tune the world and create something new, but he would not be able to accomplish this without a vision, and he derives his vision for a new world from the things he has seen and people he has met in the current one. Inspiration. This series may not be as trailblazing as Evangelion, but it is a passionate, elegantly crafted and thoughtfully woven story about all the timeless, unchanging things that make us human.Ultimately, RahXephon is about something old as dirt, infinitely complex and incredibly simple. RahXephon is about love, in all its shades and hues. Connecting with others can bring pain and hardships, but a world without these bonds is sterile and joyless. The freedom to choose the life you want to live and the person you want to be with, even if that choice leads to suffering, is something everyone needs to live a fulfilling life, and if you find someone you want to be there for, even as the world is coming down around you, then your existence is a meaningful one. It’s an overwhelmingly positive and empowering message that feels completely earned, and that’s something to be celebrated. Simply put, RahXephon is fantastic. It successfully unites a grand, ambitious story, lofty artistry, and a beating human heart, and the end result resonates long after the final curtain has fallen. That’s more than enough to cement it as an enduring great that deserves to be remembered and rediscovered for many years to come. Evangelion. Whether you found Eva to be a spectacular failure or just plain spectacular, its goals are not Rah\'s goals, and to call RahXephon either a ripoff or an improvement of Evangelion would be unfair to both anime.

This series may not be as trailblazing as Evangelion, but it is a passionate, elegantly crafted and thoughtfully woven story about all the timeless, unchanging things that make us human.Ultimately, RahXephon is about something old as dirt, infinitely complex and incredibly simple. RahXephon is about love, in all its shades and hues. Connecting with others can bring pain and hardships, but a world without these bonds is sterile and joyless. The freedom to choose the life you want to live and the person you want to be with, even if that choice leads to suffering, is something everyone needs to live a fulfilling life, and if you find someone you want to be there for, even as the world is coming down around you, then your existence is a meaningful one. It’s an overwhelmingly positive and empowering message that feels completely earned, and that’s something to be celebrated. Simply put, RahXephon is fantastic. It successfully unites a grand, ambitious story, lofty artistry, and a beating human heart, and the end result resonates long after the final curtain has fallen. That’s more than enough to cement it as an enduring great that deserves to be remembered and rediscovered for many years to come.', ""Okay, let me get this out of the way first: Rahxephon is one of my favorite anime, ever.I can't say I've ever been much into the mecha genre of anime. I saw Gundam Wing in the early days of Toonami when I was a wee little weaboo, and held little interest for giant robots and political entanglements between fictional countries that I couldn't keep track of.I remember when Rahxephon was still airing in Japan, and there was a big fuss being made about it over there. In fact, it had caused enough buzz that it was quickly licensed and was already being dubbed by ADV...in less than a month after its last episode aired. Not only that, but the art style was interesting, especially the color choices.The first time I picked it up and watched the first volume, I hit the series' first snag - it can be pretty difficult to get into. It was too abstract, too confusing; I had no idea what the hell was going on. I dropped it for a year or so. I'm glad, however, that I picked it up again a few years ago just to see how it ended.Yes, Rahxephon is very difficult to get into. It's very abstract and doesn't follow too many of the usual anime norms; not to mention all the negative press that it gets for being an Eva rip-off. I feel I need to remind the reader that Evangelion was written as a PARODY of the mecha genre. Yes, there are similarities between the two; but those similarities are exactly what Evangelion was making fun of. Please keep that in mind.Despite this initial pitfall of being difficult to understand, I have to stress that the series becomes a lot more clear if you stick it out through the end. Unfortunately, unless you pay very close attention to every character and everything that goes on in every episode, the actual plot might still be muddy to you. The whole story is never clearly and succintly explained; I kind of like that, even if I have trouble sorting out the &quot;bad guy&quot;'s motivation and intentions.I'm a sucker in general for main characters, but I love Ayato. He's not always strong, he doesn't always know what he's doing, he's a bit naive. But he's a good kid and always comes through in the end, and he's very realistic and flawed. Haruka is also a heavily flawed but still likeable character, and you really see why she is how she is by the end of the show.As for the music and animation, the art style is striking and has a really impressive color palette. Rahxephon's distinctive art direction still sticks in my mind to this day and is a big inspiration in my artwork. The music is also very unusual and never overbearing.So, bottom line: give it a try, and watch through the end. (Read my review of the Rahxephon movie for additional info) The show is very unusual, but ultimately beautiful. It's heavily abstract and symbolic, so you need to have the right openness of mind to be able to see the show for what it is, but if you do, it's amazing what you'll find in it. in less than a month after its last episode aired.

What isn't mentioned as frequently is how people try to run away from reality. This varies from seeing images of people that aren't real (focusing too much on positive or negative aspects of a person instead of seeing the whole picture), seeing the world either extremely positively or extremely negatively, or simply running away from interacting with people for fear they might hurt you.This is a fascinating concept that has been explored in many other anime series, from Neon Genesis...Evangelion to Lain. What is different about RahXephon, however, is the way that it views that running away from reality may not necessarily be a bad thing, if it can help the people around you and accomplish something better for many people.This is treated with a great deal of ambiguity and is left morally grey for the viewer, and it wouldn't work if it wasn't for this show being excellent in presenting its story. The story is very distinct from many mecha series, and while there are undeniably massive influences from more popular mecha shows, the show soon develops an identity on its own and doesn't attempt to clone elements that simply were fit for those particular shows.The show is extremely rich in themes, from Mayan mythology to music to perception of reality and there is a lot of depth to sink your teeth into. The show is extremely skilled at making the viewer curious about the overall pieces of the plot, showing all of the clues and not holding the viewer's hand or lecturing them about plot details but instead using the absolutely stunning animation quality and various imagery to tell the story, and it works extremely well.The characters are all developed and almost none of them fall into archetypes that plague the genre. They are all distinct and multi-layered, which is very refreshing. Their actions always make sense, and they never act inconsistently or out of character, although many character actions require a rewatch to fully understand.The artwork looks gorgeous and the character designs are an absolute beauty to look at. The backgrounds and the scenery present throughout the show is beautiful to look at, which adds wonders to the show's tone and makes the show's presentation all the better.I cannot praise the absolutely amazing soundtrack enough, which fits the mood of the show, has extremely high hearing value outside of the show, and the various tunes present in the show which fit the mood so well and never feel out of place. This show has one of my favorite soundtracks out of anime and I honestly adore it to pieces.This show is underrated and under-appreciated, and while the show appears to be very unoriginal initially it quickly becomes very distinct and stands completely on its own. This show deserves more attention and I honestly recommend it a lot if you want a very different experience from your typical mecha anime. Evangelion to Lain.

That advice was perfect for me.All in all, the characters and story really made it for me.  The characters and their decisions were believable and you go through a good range of emotions while watching it. "", 'This is my first anime review, although I\'ve watched many anime. So I apologize if spoilers might have crept in this review unknowingly.What are we waiting for? Lets get to the review!STORY: (8.2/10)Many say that this anime is rip off of Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is true that the latter served as an inspiration to Rahxephon and the theme of anime seem to be similar, that is ""aliens invading earth and protagonist having a key role in retuning the world"". There ends the similarities.Rahxephon, it is an exhilarating admixture of suspense,action,romance,science fiction and psychological elements. The way the plot is portrayed, its like the various...events which have a very intimate connection, yet you wont feel any connection at all until the last part of the last episode.I cannot comment about the story much without spoiling.Even a small slip up from me results in disastrous spoiler!I don\'t know why many people say something like,""For instance, all these weird looking mechas sing. It\'s part of the story; I get that much. But after a while; after hearing them singing over and over, episode in and out with that weird noise. It annoys you, irritates you and pretty much \'forces\' you to skip that part.""If you don\'t like mecha genre don\'t watch that anime in the first place. Don\'t just say that anime is horrible/bad just because it does not suit your genre. Judge anime by its plot,the way the plot is portrayed. If you can\'t understand the anime then it is your problem.And those mechas singing, it is the basic physics. Even in real world some singers can shatter glass by singing at high pitch and frequency. If a high pitch and high frequency sound can shatter a glass, then why not it can be used in war? With some modifications ,of course. That\'s the basic idea behind those mechas singing.The way the story is portrayed, the way various elements like dolems (golem) were introduced, depict that the author had done a great deal of work in learning ancient history and myths, their literature, art and culture.In a bottom line the concept behind the story is excellent.The story is good.It always keeps you on edge.Its mysterious too. But it is not some thing you can call a masterpiece. Still it is good.MUSIC: (9.4/10)Music in this anime is top class.It is alluring,captivating yet with slight melancholic taste.The opening theme.....lets just say....it  is in a league of its own.The moment you hear that captivating music,those alluring yet deep lyrics,your heart will undergo various phases of emotions.ART: (9.1/10)Art is quite good. Its eye catching sceneries, mystical sculptures of Mu really captivates your attention.CHARACTER: (6.2/10)Portraying the feelings of characters,particularly in romance is one of the areas where this anime needs improvement.How can a girl who has deep romantic feelings over one boy dates other? Also how can a girl who has feelings over one boy instantly switches to other?I won\'t mention the names of those characters, as it might spoil the suspense, but those who have watched the anime might get what I mean.I like the serious demeanor that prevails over TERRA members but don\'t you think it is too serious?There are similar flaws like these in character development.Other that that the character development is fair.ENJOYMENT (8.8/10)This anime really kept me on edge.

There is also the fact that the director of the series Yutaka Izubuchi has worked with Hideaki Anno on a few projects together and he helped with the design drafts of the EVA units.In a world where time passes at...a crawl and the blood of your neighbor runs blue, 17 year old high school student Ayato Kamina goes about his daily life within Tokyo Jupiter oblivious to the world around him, having been educated with the fact that the all civilization but Tokyo has been destroyed. But all that changes when the mysterious civilization ""MU"" invades his home, raining destruction down from the sky in the form of strange monsters called Dolems. The events that occur next will lead Ayato to the mysterious woman named Reika Mishima, to the truth of their existence, the discovery of what and who he is, and to the powerful angelic robot RahXephon.Like I said, the plot, premise, and even the characters is almost similar to EVA although it manages to not mess up or try to make it sound artsy or too pretentious whenever they run out of story ideas, albeit EVA was more of a parody/psychological breakdown of the genre. There is the plotline of being in a war using giant mechas piloted by teenagers to battle with and also the utopian/dystopian element where Kamina discovers that the world he’s been in for so long is not what it seems, with the “humans” in Tokyo Jupiter bleeding blue blood instead of red. Maybe the story isn’t as original and being like NGE, but it is a straight-up mecha anime story that is actually played off well and something that I saw myself liking, much like watching Eureka Seven for the first time.The characters are ranges from being well-developed and semi-interesting, although I will say once again, the character traits have an EVA feel to this, but I’m proud to say that the main character Kamina Ayato is not a Shinji Ikari as you do feel for him when he discovers his whole world is a lie and how would you react, plus it helps that he isn’t a whiner most of the time. I will say that Haruka Shitow is exactly like Misato Katsuragi for being the older motherly figure to Kamina but has some problems of her own, too, and there’s her sister Megumi, which I would say have some similar features to Asuka, but thankfully, not that much as she gotten to be less annoying and more relatable throughout the series. I really can’t tell who the Rei Ayanami of this show is basically either Reika Mishima or Kuon “Quon” Kisaragi as both happened to be silent and stoic figures of the show. There are also Kamina’s friends at Tokyo Jupiter Hiroko Asahina and Mamoru Torigai, who are also more messed up than him ever since he left as one of them discovers the truth for them and that one of them is quite a prick (Try and guess who I am talking about).The animation by BONES is now quite dated with its’ character and mecha designs, being made in the early 2000s, 5 years after EVA, and for what it was, it had great animation for the time being with the art style and colors being muted. Musically, it was rather good to an extent; the background music can get a bit repetitive but sometimes I don’t even notice it that much but I really do love the opening theme for show, “Hemisphere” which was produced by Yoko Kanno but sadly, that’s the only thing she handled in the music department and the ending theme was very silent-sounding and docile but I happened to think it somewhat fits well into the show.The ADV Films dub was actually an okay dub with some overacting in some parts. I really did like Chris Patton’s performance as Kamina Ayato and I can see why the guy is a great voice actor as he played someone that would act realistic in a situation of crazy proportions. I’ll say Monica Rial was good in her role as Haruka but whenever it’s her cue to react or scream at something, it pierces into overacting a little and yes, I will mention that Vic Mignogna is also a part of the dub and he was an alright addition as capturing the prick nature in Mamoru.FINAL VERDICT: All-in-all, Rahxephon is something that I would watch and actually recommend over Neon Genesis Evangelion as this actually goes into that territory without having to stoop into being overly pretentious although Rahxephon is guilty of being like that sometimes. a crawl and the blood of your neighbor runs blue, 17 year old high school student Ayato Kamina goes about his daily life within Tokyo Jupiter oblivious to the world around him, having been educated with the fact that the all civilization but Tokyo has been destroyed.

Becoming the chosen pilot of the mecha Rahxephon,  Ayato fights to protect humanity against the Mulian threat while trying to make sense of what is real to him and who he can trust in a crisis where he feels like a pawn to both...sides fighting in the conflict.Before I get going on the review, I should address one infamous bit of contention that older mecha anime fans usually go off about and that is accusing Rahxephon of being an Evangelion ripoff. While there are a number of scenes in Rahxephon similar to being depicted in Eva, said similarities are mostly superficial as there is a difference in moods and themes depicted between both titles. Eva milks Kaballah and Judeo-Christian imagery while dabbling into psychological insight with the problems facing its major characters and relishing in the dysfunction and despair faced by them. On the other hand, Rahxephon dabbles into music and Mayan lore for its plot elements and has themes more focused around revelation and transcendence. In spite of some similarities, both titles are completely different beasts for mecha anime and it is not that uncommon for mecha anime to utilize character and plot cliches found from past titles of the genre.Setting aside that sordid matter, Rahxephon is primarily focused on Ayato's character as he tries making sense of what is a truth and a lie with his life as he tries determining who among the Mulians and TERRA he should trust. The series drops hints of many of the characters that he interact with having past connections to him or having ulterior motives for needing him. Understandably, Ayato does find himself quite angry and frustrated at points as he tries making sense of his predicament and coming to his own answers with what he should do in his situation. His quest to uncover what is real to him leads him to clash with both factions throughout the series as he tries to understand what he should believe in and learning who he can legitimately trust.Besides Ayato, Rahxephon offers up a good deal of exploration of its futuristic world and characters. The series has a large cast of characters among both humanity and the Mulians who get fleshing out to understand their motives for engaging in battle with one another and what they seek from our male lead, notably Haruka Shitow who is shown to have strong emotions for our male lead and several factions attempting to manipulate events to benefit their goals. In addition, the series explores a good deal of the phenomena and technologies utilized among the characters, most notably the Tokyo Jupiter phenomena that the Mulians are isolated in and the mysterious Reika Mishima sharing some sort of bond to the Rahxephon. The series slowly unveils more to its characters and world as it progresses and helps add more to the complex mystery it offers up with what purpose Ayato has to both TERRA and the Mulians and builds up to an epic-filled ending that neatly wraps up many of its lingering plot developments.Praises aside, Rahxephon does still run into its occasional bumps in quality. The first few episodes are a bit slow in their buildup as Ayato learns about his predicament while still inside Tokyo Jupiter, which may turn off first-time viewers of the series. Also, the series is still prone to some of the common flaws of many mecha anime titles as the first half of it squanders episodes on “monster of the week” plots with the Dolems deployed by the Mulians and the Rahxephon mecha not being too seriously challenged by many threats that it confronts, killing any sense of conflict and suspense out of any fight scenes that the mecha gets involved in.For its time, Rahxephon was a gorgeous series to look at as it sported beautiful scenic shots, vivid color and a rich amount of detail put into characters, mecha and scenery. Animation for the series was above average in quality for its time as the series sported a number of elaborate animated sequences involving the various mecha fights and some visual effects milked at a number of points to show off the bafflement and confusion that Ayato undergoes when encountering a Dolem or the mysterious Reika Mishima.On the musical end, Rahxephon sports a strong soundtrack offered through both Yoko Kanno's composition and Ichiko Matsumoto's vocal performances. With a mix of intense and hauntingly powerful musical tracks, the soundtrack is very fitting for the complicated and dramatic plot that the series offers up.Overall, Rahxephon is a mostly well-executed mecha title that dabbles into existential drama and romance in its focus on Ayato's struggles. In spite of a few hiccups, the series offers a unique storytelling experience and strong presentation that will leave you hooked on it from start to finish. sides fighting in the conflict.Before I get going on the review, I should address one infamous bit of contention that older mecha anime fans usually go off about and that is accusing Rahxephon of being an Evangelion ripoff.

Animation for the series was above average in quality for its time as the series sported a number of elaborate animated sequences involving the various mecha fights and some visual effects milked at a number of points to show off the bafflement and confusion that Ayato undergoes when encountering a Dolem or the mysterious Reika Mishima.On the musical end, Rahxephon sports a strong soundtrack offered through both Yoko Kanno's composition and Ichiko Matsumoto's vocal performances. With a mix of intense and hauntingly powerful musical tracks, the soundtrack is very fitting for the complicated and dramatic plot that the series offers up.Overall, Rahxephon is a mostly well-executed mecha title that dabbles into existential drama and romance in its focus on Ayato's struggles. In spite of a few hiccups, the series offers a unique storytelling experience and strong presentation that will leave you hooked on it from start to finish."", 'I really thought I would love and never forget RahXephon. Being a huge Super Robot fan made me super pumped to watch it. But it didn\'t really bring anything new to the table.Characters:Too unmemorable for me to have anything to say about them.Sound:Only two memorable tracks: The opening and the ending. But that\'s only due to listening to them 26 times. The rest of the music was nice to listen to, but forgettable.Art:It\'s simply nice to look at, but none of the character, mech, or Robeast designs was memorable at all. Same for the background art, which I\'ve seen a million times before....Story:Sure it\'s a typical Super Robot vs Robeasts series, but the ""mysteries"" between fights are too vague to be interesting. Plus it takes far too long for anything to happen. (""Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah?"" Is anything happening yet?)Enjoyment:Not unwatchable, but not the best. Why was this labeled an action series? I was excited for action, but then it turns out a single episode of Power Rangers had more action than the entirety of RahXephon. That\'s right. The unmemorable fights are few and far between, the ""mysteries"" weren\'t interesting at all, and the invincible RahXephon doesn\'t even have to attack anything for more than 30 seconds. And it ended with both an Anticlimax Boss and a Reset Button Ending, both of which I dislike.Verdict: Average - go rewatch How To Train Your Dragon instead. That movie has an actual followable plot and an epic climax. Story:Sure it\'s a typical Super Robot vs Robeasts series, but the ""mysteries"" between fights are too vague to be interesting.

I watched Evangelion before this, although I did so years ago, if you're curious. In the end, I did somewhat regret watching this series after Evangelion, on which I'll elaborate more on at the end of this review.I'll also try to make this spoiler-free.StoryThis is, in my opinion, the weakest part of RahXephon. The story was a bit too complex for me, as there were many subtle allusions to events in the characters' past throughout, and I had trouble keeping track of them....By the end of the series, I had forgotten about most of them due to my emotional involvement in the series, which ultimately triumphed over my intellectual involvement. This is the first thing to keep in mind: RahXephon will require quite a bit of thinking if you want to uncover all the mysteries in the plot, some of which weren't solved by the end (I'll probably have to watch it a second time). However, the story's complexity does provide some depth. The plot builds up to the  ending very nicely, although the ending itself was rather frustrating for me, as I found it contradictory of events earlier in the story. It didn't ruin the series, but it made RahXephon's place in my memory much less secure.ArtConsidering how old RahXephon is, the art is fantastic. Everything, especially the mechas, is given a lot of detail, and the landscapes contribute to the atmosphere quite nicely.Sound - English subsThe music is varied, blending jazz, classical, and other styles. The soundtracks are wonderful, and like the art, they complement the atmosphere very nicely. The voice acting is great, and the characters sang nicely.CharacterThe characters are, for the most part, very good. Ayato is given lots and lots of development, as is the case with most of the other characters. The story's complexity enriches them and gives them a lot of background, which is nice since it renders them not one-dimensional. There are lots of emotional struggles that give the series lots of meaning.EnjoymentThis was mainly influenced by the story's ending and how it didn't fit into the series as well as it could have. However, I did very much enjoy the moments leading up to it, and RahXephon had no problem in rousing the same nihilism in me as Evangelion did.Since the makers did decide to take a lot of ideas from a classic like Evangelion, I thought it would be unfair to judge RahXephon as I would normally. Instead, I unconsciously raised my standards significantly so that RahXephon wouldn't just get the easy way out from copying Evangelion. This was for me the only option besides considering it a complete ripoff and not watching it. In the end, I felt that RahXephon fell short of those standards since it didn't elaborate enough on the parts it took from Evangelion or present enough new material to be considered unique from Evangelion. However, the ratings in this review were made without this in mind, since I felt that the makers at least made a legitimate attempt in creating something new. Had I decided to factor in Evangelion's influence, these ratings would likely have been lower.Finally, I conclude that RahXephon is an earnest but misdirected attempt at setting a new standard in the mecha genre of anime. Despite its similarity to Evangelion, I would at least give it a try, as it does have its own artistic merits.

It was the directorial debut of Yutaka Izubuchi, a veteran mecha and character designer who got his start back in the 1970s.RahXephon’s plot starts in rather complicated fashion. We are introduced to Ayato Kamina, a 17 year old high school student who is an aspiring artist. Ayato and the general populace believe Tokyo to be the only city remaining on the Earth after...a mysterious force known as the Mu invaded in 2012. When an enemy force attacks Tokyo, Ayato’s world is suddenly thrown upside down. After departing a crashed subway car, Ayato is pursued by government agents and rescued by a mysterious woman, Haruka Shitow, who requests he come with her. Ayato instead escapes from her as well and encountering fellow student Reika Mishima they soon finds themselves in an underground station before a giant egg. The egg hatches, exposing the titular mecha, RahXephon.In short order things get even stranger for Ayato. He finds himself able to pilot the RahXephon and defeats a giant clay mecha known as a Dolem after it seemingly kills Mishima. The RahXephon transports outside of Tokyo, which is surrounded by a barrier called Tokyo Jupiter. Haruka, who had accompanied Ayato outside reveals the truth to him, that the rest of the world remains, and that time passes far slower inside the barrier. Outside, 12 years have gone by. The Mu control Tokyo, and their ranks include his own mother, who is revealed to bleed blue blood before the RahXephon escapes. A lot to digest in just the first few episodes, but things shift to a more traditional narrative as Ayato joins up with the anti-Mu organization known as TERRA and fights against Dolem attacks while getting used to his new life.RahXephon has a healthy mix of character development and mystery, while one will find that most of the mecha battles are curb stomps where the RahXephon wins pretty easily. The show often comes off as if the mecha fights were included because that’s the genre it’s in, but the producers wanted to get through them as quickly as possible. This is especially apparent early in the show before things settle into more serialized storytelling around halfway through. It may not be the best show for mecha junkies, but is incredibly satisfying from a plot perspective throughout and contains a ton of interesting, and sympathetic characters. The show can certainly be complex at times; there are mysteries that go the entire course of the series before being solved, cryptic characters and the show has a healthy mix of technobabble, or should I say Mulian babble. By the time you are through with this show you will have heard terms such as “Ollin”, “Ixtli” or “Yolteotl” more times than you can count. The show also has a really fulfilling love story, one of my personal favorites in anime, albeit one that is rather non-traditional for reasons I won’t get into to avoid spoilers. It is a quite an emotional experience; an episode around two thirds of the way through is widely acclaimed on that front by anyone who has seen the show and I find the show’s conclusion just as good.RahXephon has often been described as an Evanglion ripoff and I can’t stress enough to ignore such claims and watch the show without considering the shadow of Eva. Those who claim the show to be a ripoff are quite ignorant of their mecha anime history. While both shows are of the same genre and share some surface similarities as a result, RahXephon in fact draws its primary inspiration from the 1970s anime Brave Raideen and the Robert Young short story Dandelion Girl. Much of the show’s terms and concepts also draw upon James Churchward’s fictional continent/civilization of Mu. RahXephon I actually consider to be quite superior to Eva, it lacks the numerous production issues that plagued that show, paces itself far better, has far more likable and sympathetic characters and sticks to a proper landing with its ending.Aesthetically, RahXephon’s animation is fairly strong, with only one episode that I can think of being of noticeable less quality than the others. I am not the biggest fan of the character style, although they are generally well designed and unique in appearance. While the mecha battles tend to be rather short, the mecha designs are quite strong, with numerous examples of bizarre enemies for Ayato to fight. Musically the show is quite the masterpiece. Composer Ichiko Hashimoto does a tremendous job mixing a wide variety of genres including jazz pieces, piano, even rock songs. She also has many musical themes inspired by the Polovtsian Dances from the opera Prince Igor. Hashimoto sings the song’s ending theme, Yume no Tamago, a wonderful piece of music and one of my all-time favorite anime ending themes/sequences. She also provides the voice for Ayato’s mother, Maya, in one of the most haunting voices I’ve heard in an anime. I’ve never run across her again in any other anime I’ve seen, which is quite unfortunate. The show’s opening theme, Hemisphere is also quite strong, composed by the well-known Yoko Kanno and sung by Maaya Sakamoto, who voices Mishima. The one downside is that despite having 3 separate CDs released for it, there are still many songs, including some of the best ones that are completely left off the soundtrack.I can’t stress enough how good this show is. It is a strong recommend for any fans of the mecha or sci-fi genre. a mysterious force known as the Mu invaded in 2012.

Characters were slowly introducted, each given a moment to demonstrate what role they would be playing, perhaps even given some background knowledge.  Each episode covered new, and interesting plot developments, taking its time to explain exactly what was happening, and covering sufficient points to make it all believable.  This all changed somewhere near episode 18 or so.  For whatever reason the enjoyablely comfortable pace which was unfolding before the veiwer rapidly...increased and became very confusing.  Characters actions became far-fetched, absurd, and nonsensical.  The plot was rushed and nothing was explained.  What was once close to being a perfect anime, crumbled away to medeorcrisy.The characters themself were all extremely thought out.  Our protaganist, young Ayato, your average high school kid, is thrust into an unbelievable situation which he has no control over.  Everything he has ever known and learned to believe has been chalked up to lies and fantasies, and now he must learn some hard truths while dealing with it all.  All he can really do is go along with it and hope things work out.  His main responsibility consists of piloting the RahXephon, a giant mecha which only he can manouver.  He is complimented by an arsenal of military men and women, a small number of friends, and a mother.  All have a certain role which they are doted with an each play that role very well.The art is a very simple, very clean, 90\'s style of animation.  It\'s honest beauty is unparalled with todays standards, but in my opinion, there is absolutly nothing wrong with it.  It\'s perfect.  The character designs were unique and not overused.  The costumes had a certain chic futuristic look.  The backgrounds were swarming with small details that tied entire scenes together.  And the camera angles captivated me and left me wanting more.  All in all, one of this series best qualitities.My favorite aspect of this series, however, were RahXephon\'s enemy.  The D1 are one of the things that I found were rushed and not explained properly.  This being said, each one was designed and drawn perfectly.  Each one was completely original.  And when each one ""sang"", with its mouth gaping open, its eyes poppping from its sockets or squeezed shut, its face distorted, it transformed into an unimaginablly frightening (literally) experiance.  And its shrill voice topped it off like nothing I have ever experienced.  I want to give the guy or girl who developed those mecha beasts a huge hug and tell them that what they did changed me.  They are THAT cool.Other then the confusing and rushed plot during the last 8-10 episodes, and the very confusing last epiosde, I would say that I really liked the series.  I tried to keep pace with what was going on during those last few, but in the end I just sat back and took it at face value.  The interesting characters, classic art style, beautifully rendered BGM, excellent voice acting, and certainly the D1 enemy made this not only an enjoyable watch but one I would highly recommend. increased and became very confusing.

To be precise, it is on the level evangelion could\'ve been, if things went differently, and circumstances aroudn first evangelion were more favorable... if Shinji wasn\'t a wuss, if the story was more complex. So perhaps you could say it surpasses even Evangelion.This anime, Rahxephon, is without a doubt on masterpiece level.  From the beginning that starts with an amazingly well done mindscrew, it presents a complex story resembling a puzzle, that is being shown out of order to you. Fior the duration of 26 episodes, it keeps throwing more and more pieces of the puzzle at you,...and each piece you get is well crafted and well done. But even in the end at the final episode you\'ll still have to think and piece everything together by yourself. So do not expect questions to be easily answered here.One of the amazing aspects of this anime is musical component, and various creepy creatures that sing. The singing goes through the whole anime, creating some sort of unerathly, ethereial and magical overtones that go through the whole seriea.The story itself gives impression of something that is bigger than inidividual characters, than humanity as a whole, and in that sense it reseminds me of that time where I watched some of the best episodes of Legends of Galactic heroes, except that rahxephon is less indifferent towards its character, and rather than just giving you the big perpsective, it shows characters, entertwines their fates, plays with them, and then puts everything into events that are bigger than humans.And it works out amazingly well.Detailed breakdown below:Story: 10/10. This is outstanding. The anime has next to no filler, and manages to present its story in such way that you\'ll be figuring it out till the last second of the last episode. Even in this case there will be many things that are left to your interpretation, and are ambiguous. They make you think.The story also had some similarities to the more surreal parts of the anime such as The Big O. But explaining anything more without spoilers would\'ve been difficult.There ARE some very minor issues such as characters occasionally displaying ""death flags"", which are highly predictable, but they\'re overshadowed by positive side of the experience.Art: 9/10:The art gets straight to the point. The characters have realistic proportions, do not ever go into chibi mode, there are details, but there are no details that are unnecessary. A similar art style, I believe was employed in ""Twelve Kingdoms"" (Juuni Kouki), and similar styles were employed in titles such as Tenchi Miyou.. or even Outlaw Star. Meaning ... fluid noticeable lines, but there are biger flat areas filled with the same color without overly focusing on shading.Sound: 9/10: Amazing soundscape through and through. The sound has a bit of ""non-standard harmony"" feeling about it, which creates eerie feeling that persists across the series. The musical theme of Rahxephon likewise dos great job depicting mysterious atmosphere about it.Character: 7/10: Characters are convincing enough, but I would say they\'re a bit on a predictable  side and sometimes are a bit naively portrayed. Some of the characters are a bit stereotypical as well. However, they\'re believable enough, and sympathetic in situations where they\'re portrayed. So they do their job. However the anime shines the most in situations where it goes into ""mindscrew"" mode, and starts throwing odd and strange imagery at the viewer.Enjoyment: 9/10: Enjoyed it a lot, but there were some episodes in the middle which felt weaker for me. Still, watching it all the way till the end paid off with the ending.Overall: 10/10. This is a masterpiece level material, and ""highly recommended"" type of anime. IF you haven\'t seen it, you probably should give it a try. I can\'t really think of much reasons to skip this one. The story is interesting, eerie, makes you think, and it is a very interesting/unusual take on mecha genre as well.So if you have the time and an opportunity, check this one out. and each piece you get is well crafted and well done.

In fact, it has done what NGE failed to accomplish. The only reason why people said it is like NGE is because there is a robot. The starting of the story really made people think that it is like NGE because of a giant robot attacking the city. :P It left me satisfied with its ending. So people who say that it is a ""copycat"" of NGE, you guys are dead wrong. It is not really trying to be deep. It is really just because of the ""foreshadowing"" and...the perfectly executed plot. It is not psychological but it is purely sci-fi.Art: What can I say? Very Good Art is one of its strong points. Especially when the main character is an artist himself. It would be a shame if it has bad art XD The character designs were pleasant to the eye and the mecha designs were one of the most unique I have ever seen because almost every mecha in anime looks humanoid :DMusic: Music being one of its main themes, it is its main point. Music influences the world, not just the in this anime but also applied in the real world. I was really in awe because it is rare to have both the OP and ED to be equally good( Exceptional). No problem hereCharacters: The characters really were its strong point. Unlike in NGE where the MC is a sissy, the MC in Rahxephon has a very strong personality. He was confused at first but he faced it like a man.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed all the way through. Though it has harem-like elements, you really can\'t blame the girls because the MC is awesome. He is an artist, good-looking, and he controls the ""Hope of Mankind"" which is the Rahxephon.Overall: I give it a 10. I admit that EP 1 was not the first episode because I saw it in an anime channel. I downloaded it and I did not regret watching it. So guys try not to think of it deeply because that will really ruin the show for you. So just pay attention to the show because the show has lots of details that should be pieced together in the END!10 OVERALL the perfectly executed plot. It is not psychological but it is purely sci-fi.Art: What can I say? Very Good Art is one of its strong points. Especially when the main character is an artist himself.

So just pay attention to the show because the show has lots of details that should be pieced together in the END!10 OVERALL', 'RahXepon was.. something different. Wildly experimental and strikingly abstract, RahXepon shows a great potential in its early episodes. Does it live up to the expectations? Well, not quite.The show draws a lot of strong influences from other works of art, namely Neon Genesis Evangelion and The Lost Continent of Mu. You can draw many parallels between NGE and RahXepon, that is not to say that RahXepon isn\'t innovative or original, it is, but with that being said ..Opening episode starts great. The story kicks off with Tokyo being invaded and our main character Ayato Kamina finding himself in the middle of all of this. While...looking for help he encounters his former classmate Mishima Reika, stringing him along a number of puzzling events. He is attacked by government officials and then saved by mysterious woman, Haruka Shitow. The curtain of the ""real world"" Ayato so firmly believed in starts cracking. Why did those government officials have blue blood? What is this strange woman babbling about, how could Tokyo be isolated from the rest of the world by time dilating barrier!? After Ayato is led to a shrine by his classmate Mishima where he awakens the cryptic Xephon, him and Haruka escape through the barrier in to the real world. Like I said, first episode is great, pacing and dynamic are very well done and anime succeeds in grabbing your attention.After the initial episode, we get episode 2 and anime just kinda.. falls flat on it\'s face from here on. Honestly, it\'s full of bad writing and plot holes. The show never really FULLY explains it\'s mysteries to you. It gives you vague explanations of certain aspects of story and you\'re supposed to fill in the blanks yourself, I suppose? Big part of anime is the music, but the show never once mentions why is it so important to the Mu (the main antagonist race in the anime). The Mu use Dolems aka weird mecha things as weapons and their main way of dealing with enemies is singing. I get it, they like singing, but after a while it gets kinda boring. It just felt very disappointing that they never explained intentions of Mu, their culture, history, mindset, NOTHING. We learn NOTHING about them. They invaded the Earth, created Tokyo Jupiter and just kinda let go. After killing a billion people or so of course, because aliens are evil and it\'s only natural for them to be evil.Later on in the show we learn about some old guy who apparently created the System of RahXepon and that the world  is supposed to be tuned by instrumentalists, our protagonist and Quon, (again) myterious girl who is same age as Ayato and has the same mark as him on her belly. I\'m not going to get too much into this aspect of the story because of the spoilers, but I\'ll let you know that when you see the ending you\'ll probably be as disappointed and empty as I did. Once again, the show suffers from major writing issues and felt rushed and forced.Another major concern I have with the show are the characters. Yeah, some get an alright progression and you can feel attached to them but the cast is just way too big and most of the characters straight up feel unnecessary (I liked the commander though, and his friend with a goatie, they\'re cool). Midway through the show I honestly felt like I was watching a harem anime. There are like dozen love interests for our lovely protagonist and most of them feel so forced and unnecessary, it\'s like it\'s there just to give meaning to the characters, and I straight up hate characters whose only purpose of existing is having a romantic feelings for protagonist, it shows some very lazy writing. Characters could have been a strong point of this anime, but I just can\'t forgive it for almost turning this into a harem anime, disgusting.Art is okayish, scenes from Tokyo had a very Serial experiments Lain feeling of aesthetic to them with the vague images and purplish shadows. It strengthens the feeling of mysteriousness which is further amplified by the soundtrack. Oh boy did I love the soundtrack of this anime. Both opening and ending themes are beautiful, and the soundtrack is very pleasant and soothing, it\'s almost like a serious of lullabies. The ending theme put me to sleep countless time since I have tendencies to watch anime late at night.Overall, I can\'t say it was a terrible show because it wasn\'t. It was a decent show ruined by my own expectations of it, but I just can\'t shake off the feeling of disappointment when I think about it. It had 26 episodes of airtime and it could have accomplished so much more with the time it had. Would I recommend it? I don\'t think so. It falls into this niche line of deconstruction shows but it doesn\'t do a very good job at deconstructing, but that\'s just my take on the show. looking for help he encounters his former classmate Mishima Reika, stringing him along a number of puzzling events.

Oh boy, was I not expecting something so utterly shitStory: 2Tbh, I have basically no fucking clue what is going on in the story. I have read that this is because the audience is basically seeing through the mc's eyes and getting information as he does, and naturally he himself was thrown into some weird shit and also knows nothing. However, this style of storytelling and worldbuilding can be done correctly and does not excuse the utter confusion and boredom I felt when watching this. It wasn't the type of confusion where I wanted...to seek out the answer and watch the next episode, it was the type of confusion that made me drop this at 6 eps.From what little information I managed to get out of those episodes, there seems to be some sort of alien/non-human invasion or something (they bleed blue or some shit) and they took over a city and time runs slower in that city. The aliens use weird giant mechs or something to attack and there is an organisation on the outside that defends against these attacks (I can see parallels to evangelion here with the angel attacks). The MC is some kid who is half alien and can pilot some mega op mech called rahxephon. And he also sees some chick that he likes or something who always leads him to the mech. Oh and there was a girl who liked him and since the aliens took over and time flows slower where he lives, shes actually a fair bit older than him now, and there seems to be some romance between them but the whole age thing doesn't make it any less weird.Idk how accurate I got that but the show seems pretty fucking weird from what I remember.Art: 5There was nothing particularly memorable about the art or animation. It didn't stand out as amazing, nor did it stand out as bad. The only thing I really have to say about it is that the mech designs look weird as fuck and aren't very appealing at all.Sound: 3Probably just comes down to my preferences. I really can't remember anything about the sound except for how shit the op is. My friend praised it as really good and it was extremely disappointing. Based on that, it's a 3.Character: 3All of the characters so far seemed pretty 2 dimensional. Nothing more to say cause I was too busy being confusedEnjoyment: 1Between the lack of anything enjoyable, ugly robot designs and confusing storytelling + confusing story itself, I lacked any enjoyment as I watched the 6 episodes of this that I watched.Overall: 3 to seek out the answer and watch the next episode, it was the type of confusion that made me drop this at 6 eps.From what little information I managed to get out of those episodes, there seems to be some sort of alien/non-human invasion or something (they bleed blue or some shit) and they took over a city and time runs slower in that city.

The difference is ""RahXephon"" has a really good ending.', ""This is one of the first anime's I fall in love with.  Many people compare this to Neon Gen.., but to me they are very different shows. I highy recommend you, watch this show, or even they movie which is good. "", ""RahXephon caught my attention for probably the wrong reason, and maybe it’s also the reason that you want to watch it, but I’ll say this about RahXephon. Any comparison to Evangelion is stupid, because RahXephon is two things: A show that is just as good, if not better (depending on who you ask) than Evangelion and a show in its own right. Just because its shares some similarities with Evangelion doesn’t mean it shouldn’t exist or that it’s a bad show and if you don’t take my word for it…. Watch the show and make your own judgement, and for those who don’t have a...clue what Evangelion is, don’t you worry your pretty little heads about it.The Short Version:(+)The music man, THE MUSIC!(+)The emotional impact of some scenes are phenomenally executed.(+)The pace of the story is damn near perfect.(+)There’s not a lot to hate.(-)The art is a little bit dated.Story (9/10): When you look at the synopsis, the first thought you’ll have about the story is that it’s probably about saving the world, as it is with most Mecha shows, or just most shows in general, and you’d kinda be wrong. While the story is about saving the world, it’s a lot more focused than just that general goal, focusing more on the hero and the people helping him save the world instead of the actual saving itself. That’s the thing I feel will draw you to this show, because it just builds the characters to such a point that when they go into battle that doesn’t look that great, you’re actually scared for these characters.I’m not even going to get into all of the Mayan and Aztec culture references, and just how psychologically deep they get with the main characters, other people will do and have done that for me, and I’ve always geared myself towards strictly entertainment value, like 90% of the community BUT. If you like your anime to be a bit more intellectual then RahXephon’s got you covered. Hell, that’s the reason people call it a rip-off of Evangelion.Characters (10/10): When I look at the characters in this anime (As in all of those with a name.) I look at them and I feel like all of them are actual people and I could tell you that this person loves that person, this person is secretly related to that person but not by blood, but before that a quick run-down of the main characters:Ayato Kamina: The pilot of RahXephon and the one who faces many a dilemma to come.Shitow Haruka: Mother figure to Ayato and seems to know something about ReikaQuon Kisaragi: The ‘mysterious’ character and the one who doesn’t mind just casually touching Ayato whenever she wants.Reika Mishima: Classmate of Ayato and is somehow connected to RahXephon.While the entire cast does get some development in, there’s always the few who don’t but in this case I’m going to wave that aside because:1. Its only 4 characters and2. They development everyone else more than they needed to.The script writer really went all out when thinking of the character development, and sometimes it’s not even your normal; Character-tells-other-character-something-just-within-earshot-of-the-MC, it’s more, yeah-there's-something-in-this-shot-that-tells-you-about-this-character. An example is how they development the commander, who comes off as a dick up until a certain point, but then the episode finishes and you suddenly know why he is such a straight collar military man to his core, this sort of development happens to almost every character with the exception of only a few.Art & Sound (8/10 & 10/10): The art for the time would’ve been just fine, even nowadays it would hold its own with most of the common show’s that come out. Not the prettiest show to look at, but its fluid as hell, for back then this was probably considered some of the best stuff you could do without treading into movie territory. The sound HAD to be good, considering that the show involves crypt dialogue that heavily hints at musical piece, hell the core elements of the show, RahXephon and Ayato, are later referred to in musical terms. So with all that in account I can say that…. The sound is bloody beautiful, if I find an OST disc I’m buying without a doubt. Keep in mind I only have one other OST disc. I take my OST’s very seriously.What do you think of this anime?I ordered a copy off eBay as soon as I finished it.Would you recommend this anime?Yes. Hell yes. In my opinion this anime is grossly underrated because of its apparent ripping off, but if the Evangelion was never made, this show may very well be on the same level of fame as Evangelion.

I first started watching this show after listening to DJ Sharpnel\'s ""World Sound"" and wondered if there was a theme song for some anime that was in it so I scrolled down... and found about 5 different people saying ""It\'s the opening theme for RahXephon""SO I decided to look at it and from episode 1 I was confused as hell... but when I got to the 4\'th episode... I COULD NOT STOP WATCHING IT. The story just wraps itself around you and sucks you in. I LOVED how the main character, Ayato Kamina had to literally accept reality...as it was and that the world he was in wasn\'t really a thing. I loved the fight scenes, the humour was done just right as well. The best part however, aside from Ayato accepting reality, was the romance. it was extremely well done and sometimes blatant, but sometimes subtle and you\'d have to pay attention and see who wants who.Overall I would strongly recommend this to anyone who loves a good story driven anime, it will completely suck you in for the 26 episodes.

I really like Mech's I'm that kind of nerd but at the same time I do not like certain ones. Any ways, I watched this in American and Japanese. The Japanese version is so much better like most animes. Anyways the story line was good, they made some stuff confusing but it was mostly easy to fallow. "", ""This show had a tedious beginning where I began to start asking about 100 questions right out of the gate. Although it does seem to smooth out in the middle, it fails in helping me appreciate it more when it kept intoducing more and more questions for me to answer. The last part of the series was probably the best part as characters started to become more likeable and believable in their actions. The love story is decent between Ayato and Haruka, but it doesn't seem to scream out perfect couple since it felt bizare to see the two communicate or work together to resolve...their conflicts. Overall, it is a good anime, however I would not reccommend it to those who want an opening to pull them directly into the series. their conflicts.

Well, if you\'ll be able to find it somewhere, then read it after the anime.STORYAs you read before, the plot is Terra vs Mulians, the ancient people with blue blood that wants to regain the world from humans, the red...blooded people that has their hearts full of despair.The story evolves Ayato\'s being the only pilot for Rahxephon, a god who controls fate but it\'s main goal is to grant pilot\'s happiness/desire.ARTOh, the times where anime wasn\'t full of CG effects and Bones focused more on quality than popularity.Besides Rahxephon is from 2002, that are some good animation going on, better than some of these new popular series out there.SOUNDHere comes one of the most important parts of Rahxephon, the world needs a retune.You will notice that not only the Xephon but also all dolem\'s have a voice, a tune. Even Quon\'s urge to create the perfect melody and constantly singing.But the main thing here is the soundtrack, search for it and if I\'ts possible, read the op and ed lyrics.Plus, there\'s a song called ""The Garden of Everything"" that has a deep connection with Ayato and Reika.CHARACTERSThrough the series, the main characters development is pretty clear, there is nothing inexplicable.Quon\'s might be hard to understand if you don\'t watch the OVA or don\'t pay attention to her riddles.Ayato is definetly one of the most easy to get characters ever. His desire to know himself is completely undertandable, just imagine being at his place.Reika is actually the most puzzling.

Rahxephon does the opposite of that. You will have to use your problem skills, connect all the dots and watch it without distractions or you will find yourself lost and displeased with the ending.If you are able to understand the symbolism, the camera angles, use of lighting and the emotions that these characters are really feeling, you will come to find yourself to really enjoy this.

', ""I'm going to have to come back and give this a full review upon completing it, but I feel like I have to say something about this show right now.This show is constantly compared to Neon Genesis Evangelion for better or worse. As a huge Evangelion fan who is intimately familiar with the TV show there is no way you can watch RahXephon's early episodes and not see the many homages to Evangelion. I specifically say homages because it feels like the people working on this show love Evangelion too. Sure, there are some characters that fill the same roles either by their personality...or appearance, but there are unmistakable editing, shot framing and designs in these early episode that directly call back to Evangelion in ways that cannot be a coincidence.At the outset this certainly seems like a quality production with an interesting setting and characters. The lore appears to be dense and the mecha designs are super unique. I hope anyone watching this show can enjoy the overlap this has with Evangelion and also enjoy it on it's own rather than try to compare the two. or appearance, but there are unmistakable editing, shot framing and designs in these early episode that directly call back to Evangelion in ways that cannot be a coincidence.At the outset this certainly seems like a quality production with an interesting setting and characters.

This is clearly a major theme of the show, and overall I liked it.-  It was well acted.  Even the english dub seemed solidly written and performed.-  The ending felt conclusive.  Even built on the Eva model, it was clear the writers knew how they wanted to end the show, and I enjoyed it.-  The 2nd half was a big improvement over...the 1st half, being far more interesting and did better to explain what was going on.  The 1st half did not do well trying to be both mysterious and entertaining.-  Characters generally seemed consistent and mostly interesting.  No one was straight up crazy, and they all eventually developed into reasonably believable people. although many suffered the usual characteristics of ignorance and immaturity (common to this kind of show) at the start.  If only people could talk to each other, all of their problems could be solved!What I thought it did poorly:-  Its not very original.  Anyone who has seen the Evangelion series will be endlessly reminded of the similarities, not often in good ways.  Its not wrong to be similar, but RahXephon is too similar, and not usually in Eva\'s best attributes.-  The roles and organization between the Foundation, Federation, and Terra aren\'t believable.  In Eva they can get away with this because civilization was mostly destroyed.  In RahXephon, Tokyo is really the only serious casualty, so how these groups work together (or fail to) and their chain-of-command is utterly ridiculous.  A few tweaks to the writing could have fixed this and kept everyone in their place.-  Sound and music are not featured in enough quantity or quality despite claiming to be important to the story.  There is constant talk of ""world full of sound,"" music, and songs from the Mu and dolems, but there is more reference to this concept than actual application.-  A really boring 1st half.  I understand the desire to save the big twists and mystery reveals for the 2nd half, but that means capturing the audience in others ways leading up to it.  I considered dropping the show due to the lack of character or plot progression and general entertainment, but was determined to see it through.-  Boring battles.  For what is basically a mecha show, the fights were boring.  Add to that, we\'re given no explanation for what dolems really are, how they function, and why RahXephon is special such that it wins its battles at all (despite getting its ass kicked), making them feel pointless and lacking in any tension or excitement.Overall, it was a good watch.

The over all setting is an interesting one as things are a little normal but not really as humanity still has to fight off the ""Mu"" who are an advanced civilization from another dimension and have occupied tokyo aka ""Tokyo Jupiter"" for it\'s out ward appearance. This anime does a pretty good job at keeping things interesting and the whole thing seemed pretty well planned out with character development and the it didn\'t get repetitive and episodic with a monster of the week sort of deal and there were defiantly parts that I thought were all around genius in execution.the only cons in my initial impression was that this wasn\'t the greatest anime, I didn\'t feel like a great anime but as I like back on it now, I thought it was pretty damn good, but not perfect.Characters:I will admit that the characters of RahXephon were a little hard to warm up to at first but as you get to know them and you get see them more you come around to really like them.The first character is Ayato Kamina aka Shinji ikari with a back bone. one thing I liked about this character is that despite his fears of piloting a giant robot to protect humanity he does understand the importance of such a task which was kind of a refreshment in comparison to some of Evangelion\'s characters.Next is Huruka Shitow aka Misato with short hair, I didn\'t get particularly attached to this character in particular as she seemed like a copy and paste Misato from evangelion.The last one I\'m going to mention is Quon Kisaragi, who was actually like none of eva\'s characters, she was happy, curious, and was a rather unique character as she would say things in some cryptic manner that made her interesting.Final verdict:I\'m going to give this one an 8 out of 10and I would recommend this to anyone with an empty after noon or is looking for an alternative to evangelion. cat, that is not particularly true as the story goes in a different direction than NGE, but I am only writing this to let you know, because I may mention Evangelion from time to time but I will try not to mention it to much.O.K? lets beginImpression:The set up of this show is pretty good however maybe a little confusing at first as it is not intirely clear who is the actual enemy and what is actually going on until around episode 4 when the series really gets rolling and you finally get everything, though they do take you on a bit of a ride while doing it.The show like evangelion does go over psycho analysis but in this series the psycho analysis is not as crucial or is not given as much attention but is still entertaining to watch.

You need to really pay attention... it\'s not an ""easy-to-watch-anime"" or something to pass the time.It\'s the kind of anime that you watch to think, or maybe refflect about its story.So I admit this is not an anime for everybody... especially if you want a spetacular animation (it\'s not a bad animation, it\'s actually fine if you consider the time it was made).But considering the technical aspects it\'s a BRILLIANT anime. And I did\'nt enjoy it too much... it\'s more like a really deep type of...mecha.So, if you are looking for a reflective, ""hard-to-understand"" and complex mecha, with great characters (main and supporting), RahXephon it\'s what you\'re looking for! mecha.So, if you are looking for a reflective, ""hard-to-understand"" and complex mecha, with great characters (main and supporting), RahXephon it\'s what you\'re looking for!', ""I recommend you watch this anime if you have nothing else to watch.Its really mediocre but i give it  6 Overall because i like mecha anime.This anime is interesting but only a little bit.The plot is really hard to understand and quite boring at first.Later they start making better plot but still not a story that will make you excited.The thing i didn't like the most are the looks of mecha.Skulls,head etc.It gives a story more dark feeling but they failed there too.It only makes it depressing.I have not finished this anime yet but i will and then i will update my review but...only if things get interesting if not this is what you get.The main character isn't taking his situation very well at first and we can see few hints of romance now and then.In the plot there is someone who is like our MC but for now their view on the life is very different.This is it from me this time i didn't want to write anymore because it would have spoilers and with slow story development you need something new.I usually dont write bad critics like this but i need to be honest and of course everyone have their own taste so anyways i hope you will enjoy it only if things get interesting if not this is what you get.The main character isn't taking his situation very well at first and we can see few hints of romance now and then.In the plot there is someone who is like our MC but for now their view on the life is very different.This is it from me this time i didn't want to write anymore because it would have spoilers and with slow story development you need something new.I usually dont write bad critics like this but i need to be honest and of course everyone have their own taste so anyways i hope you will enjoy it"", ""RahXephon tells the story of Ayato Kamina, a student in Tokyo who dreams of being a painter. One day, Tokyo is attacked by an unknown force and Ayato is lead by his mysterious classmate Reika Mishima to the giant clay doll called the RahXephon. With the RahXephon, Ayato discovers that the world he knew is false and he is now the deciding factor in a war between two races over the fate of the Earth.My thoughts:This anime was addicting. I started watching and couldn't stop. It's a good thing I have all the episodes on my computer. RahXephon is a 'mecha' type anime but...with a more in-depth story than Evangelion. The characters are more developed and have bite to them. There are no wishy-washy characters in Rah. The art is awesome, and the supporting cast fit perfectly. The story begins and keeps going to its end. No interruptions from filler episodes you often see with other anime.Although there is lots of action with Rah fighting the invading Golems, the story revolves around Ayato and Haruka. Because of the time dilation in Tokyo Jupiter and the outside world, Haruka aged at a normal rate, while Ayato aged more slowly, which is why he looks 17 instead of being closer to mid-twenties as he should be.RahXephon has it all, action, romance, suspense, intrigue, friendships...and the emotions come across so well.

Like this anime confused me on who the hell was good and who the hell was actually bad. But of course as you can see from my rating, I really liked it.(May contain spoilers.....sort of?Yes contains some spoilers)Story---> So the story is about this guy who is just fucked up in time. Apparently Tokyo was separated with Japan or some shit like that and those in the dome, time is slowed down. So basically 1 second inside of...the dome is equal to like 4 seconds outside the dome (if i did my maths right). Now to back up my statement, oh yea and before that here is kinda a spoiler but not really an important one, Ayato and Haruka's age difference is 12 years. They last met when they were 14 I think. So Ayato was trapped inside the dome until he was 16-17 and Haruka's age when he got out of the dome was 28-29. So if you subtract 29 and 17 you get 12. And if Ayato was in the dome for 3 years aging Haruka to be 29, so if you divide 12 and 3, you get 4. So one second inside the dome is four seconds outside the dome, one minute inside the dome is four minutes outside the dome, one week inside the dome is four weeks outside the dome, one month inside the dome is four months outside the dome and one year inside the dome is four year outside the dome. In this case four multiplied by three is twelve so correct me or message me if i'm wrong. Now Ayato is just a normal highschooler when he meets with Haruka whom he lost memories of. There are two kinds of people in this universe I guess. Mulians and normal humans. Mulians are basically humans with blue blood and normal humans are... well normal humans with normal blood.This being said, Ayato gets confused and 'follows' Haruka to fully understand why this is. Then after that everything goes skadaddle prap prup pam. After watching this anime I still don't know the origins or anything cause I wasn't really paying attention because I was waiting more on the romance and ho ho ho the fucking romance was amazing. I really want to see more romance anime where the male MC is with and older female MC. Well in this case Haruka is technically older but still the same age? Well basically a male Mc with a mature looking female. But the Male can't be a Shota. yea. oke. So you get the Idea. And the ending is fucking perfect. Well could have been better but it is real good since there aren't many anime with this kind of ending. You'll get what I mean when you finish it. So if the ending was shit i'd rate it a 7 or 6 but it didnt and i really liked it so I gave it a 10. If you don't agree with me go fuck yourself then. jkArt----> The art is great. You can tell the anime is produced by Bones just by the animation. Well if you've seen Eureka Seven of course (which i recommend if you have the time). Old animations honestly are much better than the new ones these days. In my opinion of course. I like how the characters looked, It wasn't bad and seemed likable to my point.Sound----> the voice acting is... well.... plain good I guess. It is like most anime out there so there isn't much to comment on. But I have to comment on the ending song. real fucking cool to see what they did.  At times the ending would start with 'oshiete' or 'tell me', sometimes an english language, sometimes 'kotaete' which means 'answer me'.It's different lyrics but the same video. Like House M.D with they're different openings. Oh yea and the opening for this anime ain't bad. (cuz i skipped every single time sorry).Overall / Enjoyment----> Now I know the I did not comment on character. Well, honestly it's because I am too lazy but don't tell that to anyone. I rated it 9 so i'm basically saying there weren't any people I got really irritated to. So the the anime was enjoyable, the drama was okay. Romance was fucking great. And I would recommend to you if you have nothing to watch. This is probably my longest review yet, so i've wasted some precious time. If you decide to watch this then have fun!

It\'s underrated because its confusing world and concepts and weak mecha battles turn off viewers who were looking for strong action and romance, before they have a chance to really decipher Rahxephon\'s message. It\'s overrated because like Wolf\'s Rain, this message is executed well by the story but not by the characters, which prevents it from fully capitalizing its massive emotional potential.I can see why this series only has a 7.5 average raiting- it doesn\'t hook you in with bombastic mecha action nor oversaturated emotional drama. Its battles are cerebral experiences and its characters are relatively subdued. Character...motivations and emotions take a while to unearth and understand. This is a series that takes at least two rewatches to appreciate, as the first time around viewers\' confusion is going to get in the way of some of the emotional weight. It\'s a methodical, meditative burn that culminates in a grandiose ending that ties the fate of the world to the emotional stakes of the main characters. Not that it feels slow, as the pacing is pretty good, but it\'s just that you\'ll have to wait a long time to find out the answers.Whether or not this ending is set up well makes or breaks Rahxephon, and for me it still needs a few touches on the finer points of characterization for the ending to work and for the message to get through.So what is Rahxephon trying to say anyway? The crux of Rahxephon\'s argument is that people should connect with those that love them, even if they\'re afraid of being hurt from being so close. Most people get the first part because it\'s generic lovey dovey shit that feel good series peddle out as deep revelations. Rahxephon avoids this cheapness by investigating the opposite argument; whether or not a message is preachy depends on how well a show illustrates how compelling the counter arguments are. Isn\'t it obvious that people should connect to other people? Well, there are good reasons why people don\'t, and that\'s why it\'s not that obvious. The closer you get to someone, the more you see yourself reflected in that person and the more ugly things you see in yourself. Communication is also a big roadblock to connecting with people and the failure to communicate, combined with the ugly side of people, often leads to deep emotional scars. It\'s easier to keep your distance from people in order to avoid looking at your ugly side and the ugly side of others. It\'s easier to turn your eyes away from it, shutting yourself off in your own world, and that\'s what the protagonist, Ayato, does.For a better viewing experience, I would advise potential viewers to look at how the above themes are explored through allegory and the use of blue to represent coldness towards others and red to represent human warmth. Then, all the complicated backstory and confusing events start to fall into place.In addition, each of the characters are explorations of variations of the central theme. However, while the story is used as a coherent allegory for Ayato\'s inner journey, the characters suffer from being used as additional pieces to convey the message and lack proper characterization. All the characters mirror the theme of connecting with people who care for you instead of ignoring them. This means that there are a ton of ""I love him but he doesn\'t notice"" dynamics between every female and male character. The problem is, the show tries to set up romances before they set up compelling individual characters. Characters end up being defined more by their attachment to another character than their own distinctive traits. There was one episode featuring three characters as kids which showed decently written personalities, only for the three characters to be completely lifeless as adults in the next episode. Even discounting the lack of characters that feel like real people, the romantic chemistry wasn\'t there.  It\'s all too easy and cheap to have one character pine after the other. It\'s really easy to write ""I love you"" but it\'s hard to write characters that feel lovable and interactions that form bonds in a natural way. Rahxephon gets too caught up in its artsy storytelling to bother with the finer points of characterization, the most important points.This wouldn\'t be a big problem if they got Ayato right, since he\'s at the center of the story and the message, but his personality is simply ""protagonist"". He\'s a generic nice guy with good looks, and this is enough justification for every girl that he meets to fall for him. Yeah, he\'s polite, but you\'d be hard pressed to find a scene where he actually has a natural conversation with someone that reveals more about both himself and the other person. One of the girls crushing on him says he\'s a nice guy after having a one sided conversation with him in which he ignores what she talks about. This is representative of how Rahxephon has to inform the viewer of Ayato\'s likability and the connections he forms with others, rather than showing it. It seems to gloss over how connections are actually formed in real life--- by getting to know people, sharing fun times, and empathizing with them. Ayato\'s staleness weakens the romance that is the basis of the show\'s emotional core and intellectual message. While I find that Haruka is pretty sexy, she can\'t carry the romance by herself (it also doesn\'t help that she\'s relegated to crying for Ayato for most of the episodes). Plus, Ayato\'s reason for ignoring her is weak, making him seem like a jerk.Ayato\'s lack of interesting characterization also undermines the main story as well, since there seems to be no good reason for this generic schoolboy to be the one to possess this much importance and power inSPOILERSreshaping the worldENDSPOILERS.As for the complicated lore about the Mulian stuff, I do think that some of it can be simplified or at least better explained because I do not think that the complication helps articulate the main message. Or perhaps I\'m missing something. Anyway, it\'s a minor problem since you can look up the explanations online.Art: The character designs are amazing. The faces are beautifully human and allow for the expression of a wide range of emotions without exaggeration--- you can see the hurt and sadness in characters\' faces. I think the main mecha design could use some simplification, but overall, both the human and mecha designs have a unique, sensual aesthetic.Music: The ending theme really takes the cake. Combined with the art and direction, it gives off a dreamlike, mysterious, and contemplative atmosphere tinged with sadness. In general, no matter my misgivings about the series, Rahxephon\'s direction and atmosphere are as profoundly beautiful as its painting of the girl in the yellow dress. Like Wolf\'s Rain, it\'s worth checking out for the experience alone.For all of its inadequacies in the character department, Rahxephon succeeds in so many ways. The characters are by no means bad or flat (they each get their due attention) while the story, atmosphere, message, and sheer ambition should be admired. You can tell that a lot of love and care went into making this series. I really want Rahxephon (and Wolf\'s Rain, also by Bones) to be the masterpiece it was meant to be. Basically, replace Ayato with a great protagonist and get a better writer for the dialogue. As it is, I still highly recommend people watch this series keeping in mind the themes I mentioned here and taking the time to try to understand all its symbolism, its allegories, and its allusions to Mayan/Aztec religion. You\'ll be rewarded with a highly emotional, moving conclusion that ties together threads from all 26 episodes. motivations and emotions take a while to unearth and understand.

You\'ll be rewarded with a highly emotional, moving conclusion that ties together threads from all 26 episodes.', 'This is a tale of love crossing and enduring time...A tale of maturation and liberation...A tale of finding your true self, discovering your true yearning and understanding and accepting oneself and finally, expressing all of that...Admittedly, this tale is not for everyone. In my younger days, I once attempted to watch this but could not quite stomach the symbol-laden style of storytelling and my experience was akin to looking for a fun tale to read and coming across a complex Shakespearean work. More than this, Rahxephon\'s symbolism is not one that the majority of post-Christian societies will readily understand -- much of the work\'s influences...are derived from the Mayan/Aztecs and James Churchward\'s idea of the lost continent of Mu. If you are not one who is receptive to a story told partially through symbols and personifications, much of what this show has to offer may very well fly over your head. Heck, despite giving this show an objective 10, I was admittedly bored while watching and laughing at the misuse of the term Feynman diagrams (particle collision diagrams) as a sci-fi explanation for how physical dimensions work.Made in the early 2000s just when animation technology was making rapid advancements, Rahxephon was admittedly not extraordinary in terms of visual splendor. In terms of artwork, it is readily beaten by its contemporary and fellow mecha genre entry of the same year - Gundam Seed. However, this becomes irrelevant as the show does not rely on stunning animation to impress, but instead is ripe with visual symbols and juxtaposition beginning as early as the first episode, continuing all the way to the end. Sound-wise, the show employs several distinguished names for voice actors/actresses. Amongst them are voice-actresses Maaya Sakamoto, Houko Kuwashima and Ayako Kawasumi, all of whom are celebrated names today. Yoko Kanno\'s contribution to the opening themes leaves behind an iconic theme that perfectly captures the mystery and pensive atmosphere of the show.For otherwise shallow aspects of a show to so strongly boost the themes and mood of the work, I give the visuals and sound a solid 9/10 and 7/10 respectively.As for the ""meat"" of the show, the story is, as many would agree, a complex one. It is one that combines many positive themes and weaves them all into a story that is still coherent. In its essence, it is a story of a boy growing up. The many obstacles this boy faces on his journey to maturation could be said to be symbolic to many real life obstacles.The difference between an inculcated reality and the actual world, accepting this fatal difference and moving on with life afterwards...The rebellion of the people who bleed red against those who bleed blue could very much translate to the struggles of the everyday people, especially youths, against the greater world at large and those in power, the adults, the ""blue bloods""...The search for Xolteotl (heart) and its reconciliation with Ixtli (face) is like a journey into oneself to understand one\'s innermost psyche and reconciliation with one\'s outwards behaviors...Even the complex nature of the main pairing of the show can be said to be a message -- the notion that true love does not care about sex or age, it will endure even the effects of time dilation.For each of these themes, the characters serve a purpose and are not just merely people, but a symbol. Ayato is the vehicle that navigates between each stop. Reika is a personification of an inner self, Haruka poses as that which is far away. Yet in between these, even though those who are non-human remain mostly symbolic, the human characters of this show still prove to be incredibly human in the way their id, ego and superegos are portrayed.I can say I was genuinely impressed; the story deserves a solid 10/10 for the artistic way it is weaved together over a mere 26 episodes and the characters, a decent 8/10. are derived from the Mayan/Aztecs and James Churchward\'s idea of the lost continent of Mu.

There was one episode towards the end where I felt really f****** bad for the MC, tough luck kid.  The one thing that kept bothering me was the fact that the story kept revealing that certain people...were related to the MC to the point where it was annoying and didn't really have any impact.Art was at times both good and bad. Sometimes the magic of bones animation shined and other times it looked rough.

In conclusion, 7/10."", ""Despite it's interesting plot and setting, things in it seemed to be badly explained (NOT as in - went over your head, BUT rather either explained too early or too late for any drama.)All of the main characters felt really fucking cliched even though it's side-characters were great. It still ruined the quality overall. it nearly felt like a fucking harem at points and I really hated that as well. the main romance was also extremely forced, but at least the last episode explained it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. (like I said, too late for that. the show is literally over by the time they get to it....so all of the dramatic moments earlier just feel hollow.)In terms of characters they nail the side characters but the main leads are incredibly shallow.Haruka was upsettingly disingenious from the very beginning although they try to redeem her by the end. they failed. I still hated the character and the backstory seemed like more of an excuse than a genuine longing. (ie; - something they could've easily fixed had they shown it earlier than the LAST FUCKING EPISODE.)They also wrote her to be a far worse character than her sister even though she was basically useless in the plot, like LOL. okay.Reika Mishima is... idek... [spoiler]she's like a part of ayato's memory or some mulian god or some shit. I don't really understand how it worked. they never explained it. she was like Ixchtli or something, so that would make her a mulian but she also looked like Younger Haruka -[/spoiler] which made no fucking sense. they never explained that part.Quon is like.. a rei clone without any of the same level of identity crisis or emotional depth. she sings I think and lives with her brother. that's about it. that's the most you get out of her character.Ayato is also just a complete fucking cliche. he's like, if you took Hikaru Ichijo from Macross and removed all character flaws and reduced him to a confused husk of a boring protagonist. the most interesting he gets is around ep11-16 but after that it's like his development is reversed for some odd fucking reason.I would've preferred it, had they made him more cynical like they did in those few episodes, but oh well. some cliche about love or some shit.The best character in this show was Johji Futagami but he only gets very little dialogue, despite that his role in the show is revealed to be far more interesting than anything else revolving around the main drama.I cared more about Jin Kunugi, Souichi Yakumo & Elvy Hadhiyat than I did about Haruka and Ayato. They were actually likeable characters that not only had believable flaws but could also be pretty humurous at times while retaing a serious air to them. The most we got out of Haruka and Ayato were interactions in the first few episodes that already felt off - because of the nature of the plot.There's also Itsuki, Makoto, Helena and Sayoko. Despite being given very little attention were far more interesting and far more developed than any of the main cast. My favorite episode was episode 15 and it had nothing to do with the main cast and focused only on 3 side characters.This was the episode that showed me how this show was missing potential. I think the biggest flaw was trying desperately to emulate older better shows when it just could've been it's own thing. Main Characters were written waaaay toooo fucking conventionally for an unconventional plot and it really didn't work. They weren't written like this to subvert a cliche the same way something like Evangelion does, instead they were just there for fan-service and probably merchandising (tho, I doubt the second one.)Eitherway it felt too constrained with narrative tropes and lacking depth so it's like one of those Scifi shows that's really only a little interesting and not too deep or philosophical as it pretends to be. You could watch Black Lagoon and get more emotional depth out of that show than this.Overall, it was fine, the plot was good but reviews on this site definitely over-hyped it.

The designs are well done, the characters are hit-and-miss, and the themes are... I'm not really sure what the themes are. It could just be that I missed them, perhaps I wasn't looking in the right place, but I left this show feeling confused and not entirely satisfied.

None of this really goes anywhere and it really just seems to exist to serve as padding in the episodes- that's not to say that I wasn't interested in these characters and how they interacted, but I was never really able to feel like I got something out of it.The thing I liked the most about this shows, I will say, was that its atmosphere was superb, like a dream that you really can't make heads or tails of, but one that's at least pleasant to look at for a while. It certainly had some good ideas, but I can't help but think that there were better ways to convey whatever it is that it was trying to get across.

Numerous characteristics are taken or perhaps stolen. The most obvious of them are the character models in which the narrative is woven around.

Let\'s dig a bit, shall we?Story: There are various opinions on the story. Here\'s my schpeal: the story is complex, complex to the point of intriguing confusion....Sorry for not having an IQ of 690, I had to look up the more minute details on the wiki. I\'m a sucker for slow burns with dialogue that causes you to pause and reflect. If ya dig, consider this series.Art: Anime has come a long way in terms of hand-drawn and CGI. RahXephon being made in 2002, the art is of lower quality compared to recent innovations. However, there is a vintage feel to the animation. The character designs and scenery are pleasant to gaze upon.Sound: The sound, in my opinion, is a highlight of the series. The theme song is composed by the notorious Yoko Kano and ost by Ichiko Hashimoto. The score is jazzy, ominous to compliment the complex narrative and dialogues.Character: While the ideas are not ""original,"" the way the writers handled them is applaudable.

Taiho Shichau zo The Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2013/Taiho_Shichau_zo_The_Movie,"[""What a huge surprise! I went into this movie completely blind as to what the You're Under Arrest! franchise was about. I hadn't watched the anime or read the manga, I didn't know who any of the characters were or their relationships to one another. But honestly, you don't really need to know anything to enjoy YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! THE MOTION PICTURE. It just jumps right into its own story, providing necessary background to all its characters, enough to know who is who and then gets right into its story, which I believe is a stand alone story that has nothing to do with the...anime. What is the story you ask?Two policewomen are assigned a spot on the Boku Police Patrolwomen. Meaning they deal with speedy and reckless drivers on the big streets of Tokyo. The skilled and badass Miyuki is teamed up with the sometimes lazy Natsumi as they and a bunch of other pretty ladies make sure the streets are safe. But when they encounter a car full of guns, suspicions rise as to what is going on, are they dealing with the mafia? Or a possible drug cartel? It's all up in the air until one of the bridges in Tokyo is blown up, the girls race to secure the area, only to find out it was a decoy and the real target, was the Boku Police Station. What is happening? Who is behind this? And what is the secret behind Bee One? A computer system that may have the ability to completely shut down Tokyo.This film could be a staple for action anime of the 90's. There are crazy gun battles and slick car chases (and boat) that make up most of the one hour thirty minute running time. But its so worth it, I loved all the characters, you had a wide variety from the cold and calculated Kinoshita Kaoruko to the totally ditzy Nikaido Yoriko  and of course the two leads. It's funny, cool and mean. The music was rad, totally complementary to the 90's action genre. I dug everything about YOU'RE UNDER ARREST THE MOTION PICTURE, maybe I seek out the anime and give that a try and I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for the DVD of this one of the best on this list so far. anime.

I had just finished watching the first season and the specials, so I came in with context of all the characters and how they interact, but I was watching with a friend who had 0 context and they also loved it.It encapsulates all of the best elements of the anime series that came before it. This movie is riddle with action and intense situations, but treats them all realistically. The chemistry between the characters, their dialogue and their teamwork, all fits together flawlessly and doesn't come off as awkward or cliche at any...moment. The story keeps you on your toes the whole time; even when it is a relatively calm moment you still have that sense that the scene is driving the plot forward.  This is an hour and a half experience where even if you don't know the story of You're Under Arrest you will enjoy yourself immensely. moment.

If you want you can read my review in Spanish.In this franchise, Taiho Shichau zo The Movie (1999) is a controversial film because a lot of fans consider it a break from the main show. Instead of a sitcom in which they face minor cases, they carry out their civic duties and resolve their personal affairs; here we have a police thriller in which members of the traffic department have to stop the terrorist acts of a former member of the police force. The change in focus appears to be in accordance with the...idea that the films should narrate events equal to or more extraordinary than those seen in the show. Hence, many popular franchise movies are about heroes saving the world from some threat. However, the film also seems to have received some influence from the Patlabor saga, especially from the second film.The feature film, however, does not involve as drastic a break or a change as Oshii did in Mobile Police Patlabor 2: The Movie (1993) to express his personal concerns. To begin with, the tone of the film is indeed more serious and sober because the professionalism of the police force and the magnitude and nature of the crimes (arms smuggling, destruction of infrastructure and sabotage of communication systems) stand out to a greater degree. But it also significantly reduces the show' own humor by avoiding the inclusion of extravagant characters like Strike Man and reducing the quota reserved for the dynamics of the group members and their individual behaviors. Still, the humor is there, although in a moderate way — Natsumi's delays or Yoriko's nosy attitude. And despite everything, the film is far from the gloomy and muted tone of Patlabor, which was also explained by a corresponding visual design. Nishimura's film enhances realism and formality, although the whole is familiar and friendly.In relation to crime, the film - like Oshii - opts for terrorist attacks devised by a mastermind. However, there are important differences between one and the other. On the one hand, Patlabor 2 is a slow-paced political thriller that reflects on the political problems and internal contradictions of Japan in the 1990s. Instead, this film is a more hectic-paced police thriller with less intellectual pretensions and greater attention to entertainment through a less complex and realistic criminal plot and a greater presence of action. That is to say, the work in question, although it draws heavily on the famous director's feature film, is not as comparable to this one but rather to a good Hollywood thriller.Comparisons aside, the Hachi Ichi Gou case can be considered genuinely intriguing. Initially, the pieces of the puzzle give the impression that there is no relationship between them. To this lost connection is also added the unknown of the mysterious informant and the contents of the confiscated disk. Despite finding and arresting the traffickers, the film makes a plot twist by involving the boss in the events, catching the viewer by surprise, although we are all aware of his innocence. However, this helps us to know the name of the culprit —Emoto— and his friendship with the boss, although we still need to know his motive. After locking up the boss, a mysterious man calls the police station to warn that the Sakura Bridge will explode and that, later, another will.From here, the film gains a lot in terms of suspense because the police force goes into action and the antagonist's plan takes place, allowing us to understand the reason for the breakdowns, the content of the disc and the objective they are pursuing.On the other hand, the assault and subsequent pursuit of the criminals generated most of the action of the film. The quality of the chase, destruction, and gunfights scenes is among the best in the franchise, reaching the rating of remarkable. In part, they do not reach a higher level because animation exhibits limitations due to the use of frequent static images, which are not exactly the result of an artistic decision. Despite this, the action transmits tension and emotion, with touches of humor such as the use of paint guns or the balloons in the boxes. Of all the scenes, however, the landing of the police vehicle of the protagonist couple is the most outstanding.This film is a novelty that distances itself from the animations that make up the animated catalog of the franchise by not coinciding in part of its essential features. However, this fact is not a setback as it becomes a proposal capable of granting greater diversity and quality to the ensemble thanks to the suspense generated by the terrorist case and the high-level police action. Perhaps a greater participation of characters like Nakajima or Futaba is missing, but in general it does not disappoint.You can also find my review here: https://elarmarioanimados.blogspot.com/2021/01/resena-estas-arrestado-la-pelicula.html idea that the films should narrate events equal to or more extraordinary than those seen in the show.

This is my first review so bear with me.The story-line is simply AMAZING, for a movie of less than 2 hours long. The main series itself doesn't have any flaws, but this movie has fulfilled my thoughts on what the series should add. Mind you, I have already finished all the seasons + OVA before starting this.The art, to be honest, well i have grown used to the ever changing hair color + overall style for Aoi, so the overall art gets a 9 only for that...factor. I don't have any other remarks on this topic or so let's move on!The character(development) in this case gets a 7, mainly because I'm actually pissed at how Toukairin was potrayed in this film. I see him as a calm and collected kind of person during emergencies but it was shown otherwise, although it was only during one part. However, it is always nice to see the duo still at their best and the emotions shown nearing the end.Overall, my score for this is actually a 9, even though I really enjoyed this and will be rewatching it sometime soon. factor.

Taiho Shichau zo: Second Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2014/Taiho_Shichau_zo__Second_Season,"['One could write about how this is just a continuation of original series and has continues with the same format of ""adventure of the day"".  For the first half, yeah, you can say that.  Then something happened for the second half, they actually wrote a multi-episodic story with some major character development.  Thus I will focus on that part.Like I said earlier, the first half was the standard, but the second half was very good.  It all starts with Natsumi getting an invitation to join a police special forces group.  This made all the her co-workers/friends, esp. Miyuki really question...how each other are part of this group.  Even Ken started having doubts about himself because of a situation with Miyuki.  Even the ending strengthens the characters with each other.I do enjoy this series because they characters are adults instead of being there as comic relief for junior high/high school students.  We adults have problems also.So to break it down:Story - 8:  I had to give it an 8.  The average of the first half and second half.Art - 7: This will never be as good as the details from the OVAs of the first season.  The artwork did take a hit.  I wish more time was given to make the characters and scenes look better at times.Sound - 7:  Felt overpowered by the background sound.  I do miss the sounds of the motors that Fujishima puts into his creations.Characters - 9:  All were great!  We got to see more of everyone, including the rookie Saori and Nakajima\'s dad and step-mom.Enjoyment - 9: Of course.  Just seeing an adult cast in a slice-of-life series was worth it.Overall - 8: It had it\'s weaknesses and strengths.  You will enjoy this a bit more if you enjoyed season 1. how each other are part of this group.  Even Ken started having doubts about himself because of a situation with Miyuki.

The Second Season follows the story from the First and done everything better, the stories are way more polished, and pacing is done well; the Second Season is also shorter with less fillers so the plots are denser and way more engaging in comparison.There were nothing haven been seen before comparing with the First Season, the overall arc of the Second Season is more grounded and tame and less over the top actions, but the stories are very compiling and really focusing on the characters. If you look hard enough you can spot some familiar...tropes from other anime or Asian TVs in general but the progression is so natural thanks to the well established characters from two seasons everything happened so seamlessly, the decisions and the struggles characters been through are very believable and immersive.Finally, it is good to see the characters' journey, the personal growth is finalized in a well round up Second Season with a well tide up ending to end the series which left me very satisfied. tropes from other anime or Asian TVs in general but the progression is so natural thanks to the well established characters from two seasons everything happened so seamlessly, the decisions and the struggles characters been through are very believable and immersive.Finally, it is good to see the characters' journey, the personal growth is finalized in a well round up Second Season with a well tide up ending to end the series which left me very satisfied."", ""If you are expecting to see more actions, fresh plots and surprises, you might be disappointed.The story in season 2 started with a fresh opening but didn't live up to one's expectations. It had got many cliches you can see in other anime, and a lot of themes had already been done in season one too.This series depicted more on character's relationships. It became a drag and annoying when it failed to get across what the main character was actually thinking and deliberately went to the extreme at some points.However, if you are looking for romance and drama, it might just be...your cup of tea. your cup of tea.""]"
Taiyou no Kiba Dagram,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2257/Taiyou_no_Kiba_Dagram,"['I like Taiyou no Kiba Dagram a lot, but it is a hard show to recommend. Never before have I seen an anime that is both so brilliant yet flawed. It is easily among the best anime about revolution and war. While the anime started out as the classic ""boy fall into mech cockpit and fight for what he believe in"", it is NOT the kind of simplistic Star Wars-like rebellion tales. The show is amazingly detailed and realistic.The anime explore every aspect of a guerilla war for independent: troops and officers recruitment, propaganda, supply lines, politics,.... Of course, some of the elements weren\'t...as detailed as it is in real life, and any history and military nerds can pick it apart, but every thing still hold together as a very believable epic war story. This is also one of the few mecha anime in which combined arm tactics is important. The main mecha is just a cog in a machine, not the win button.Realism aside, what is truly important for fiction is still story and characters, and this anime has it. The show has some of the best villains of all time. None of them are simple ""I want to destroy the world"" assholes. They are real people with complex motivations and desires. Once again, this anime got on my good side for having actually competent military commanders on both sides. All of the main cast are likable, although kind of bland.The story is slow moving, but became very engaging later on, as question like: ""Is the sacrifice worth it?"", ""what is a true victory?"", ""how much  power human have in the course of history?"" were asked. Despite looking silly, this anime is very intelligent.Unfortunately, the Dagram has some serious flaws that caused it to be forgotten. First of all, production value is bad, even by 80s standard. It look worse than Gundam 0079, which is  2 years older. The music is decent, but very repetitive. The story, as I said above, is good, but the build up is too long. In the age where most anime is only one cour long, this old anime took 3 cours to truly get going. Plenty of modern audiences will likely be very bored by this series. There are lots of 80s silliness and immersion breaking moments as well. Sadly, Taiyou no Kiba Dagram  didn\'t age very well.To sum up, this anime\'s one of my favorite, but it might not appeal to many. Because of that, I will list the pros and cons and let reader decide for themselves:Pros:-Intelligent story-No over-powered mecha-No annoying characters-Great villainsCons:-Slow pacing-Very long-Lots of inappropriate silly moments-Some plot armor and contrivances-Poor animation and repetitive music as detailed as it is in real life, and any history and military nerds can pick it apart, but every thing still hold together as a very believable epic war story.

In the middle of this, young Crinn Cashim, son of the kidnapped Ambassador, flies to Deloyer in order to save his father just to learn there that his father was pretty well and that it was all one of his schemes in order to raise hate against the guerrillas and an oportunity for him to make his victorious comeback. Young Crinn doesn\'t understands well the political plays that are taking order but he feels that they are wrong so he ends teaming up with the rebels who have developed an new mobile armour prototype (mecha) called Dougram and settles his goals to fight the tyranny along his new Deloyearan team mates.[End of the little spoiler on the beginning of the story]The story, as well as lot of other mecha anime that came in early 80\'s,  is pretty influenced by the original Gundam series and uses a lot of political plays and schemes and sometimes it even makes me wonder how young Japanese kids would have understood what was going on on there back in the early eighties.

Only the ending of the series will tell why it has become forgotten, or maybe perhaps why it was purposefully forgotten?', ""Dougram is one of the first mecha anime that followed the Gundam craze of the early 80's where the emphasis was less on a titular robot usually comprised of multiple parts piloted by different characters to form a super robot that would engage in monster of the week aliens or robots a la a tokusatsu-like style. Instead it opted for the grounded, more serious narrative that focuses on the characters and worldbuilding to formulate a fairly intricate albeit well-put-together story.As is the nature of a show that was inspired heavily by Gundam, the plot and the way it executes its themes are quite similar in...tone. Just like the Spacenoids that wish to secede from the Earth regime in 0079 Dougram's landscape is of a future Earth colony called Deloyer that advocates for total autonomy from Earth's regime. And following the similarities the story largely focuses on a group of kids and young adults who become guerrillas fighting against the Earth federation for that goal. It's a simple premise but the show does a very good job at keeping things interesting without forcing itself to drastically shift gears or focus on unrelated plotlines and the few subplots that exist are quite engaging and often serve well throughout most of the story.What keeps this story consistently interesting is a memorable cast of characters on both the Deloyer and Earth sides, the villains especially having some surprisingly complex personalities and motivations that are explored a great deal that it never feels that they're acting out of character. Fans tend to state that the villains are far more interesting than the protagonists, and while that's true that doesn't necessarily mean they're bad protagonists. A word would be predictable; archetypal to what you'd expect when you see them. And if anything that serves as a strength to contrast a very pivotal point of war and politics where it establishes how much more intricate a villain's plan can be compared to the hero. The heroes simply want freedom, but the villains have a lot more complicated goals other than simply wanting to maintain the status quo.And while I compare this show a lot more to Gundam it's actually quite similar to Legend of the Galactic Heroes with how it chooses to focus a lot on political developments and jumping around multiple locations with different characters. Not to say that it was an inspiration, but this show focuses a lot less on the titular robot than even Gundam does which had already significantly toned back on that aspect from super robot shows. Unlike other mecha shows from this era the length is not spent on filler or drawn out arcs as an excuse to extend the air time. Dougram is paced well and while there's a couple of recap episodes there's very little actual content that could be considered filler. Again like LotGH it does its best to make every bit of dialogue feel necessary to listen to to understand the buildup to character actions and motivations as well as being immediately relevant to the episode it takes place in. It might be a little wordy for some people but it's the type of show where if you're following along then you shouldn't ever be getting lost.Now it's no mystery to anyone but 75 episodes is not short. This show visually has not aged well at all. Dougram had the unfortunate fate of being produced while the Gundam movies were being released, all the way up until Xabungle, Ideon's movies and Dunbine. Naturally, they'll prioritise the works of Tomino over a newcomer director which leads to its visuals taking a serious hit. Granted there is worse from this period and the storyboards are mostly fine so everything is conveyed in a very clear way. But the art direction leaves a lot to be desired as well as its character designs. While not awful they lack originality and feel like a pale imitation of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's style with a more rough and unappealing look. One detail I never quite got was how some characters can have tiny cheekbones that make them almost look sickly and I can't tell if that's an intentional design or not. With that said characters and mecha designs are rarely off model, it just has very unimpressive art and especially animation. Despite coming out 2 years after 0079, the animation manages to be noticeably sloppier than it is in that show.In addition to that I'm really not a fan of the combat armour designs. Understandably this is always going to be a lot more subjective than other points but Dougram and the many other designs derivative of it throughout the show are ugly. They almost look like monster trucks with legs instead of wheels except there's no visual creativity to reinterpret that concept. It really feels like a truck was copy pasted onto a pair of mecha legs, given some arms and called it a day. This show unlike Gundam does have a lot less supernatural elements so designs that are more comparable to real life designs makes sense but there was very little attempt at making them visually appealing, at least to me. In the end though I'm sure there's still some guy out there that owns every Dougram model kit that's ever been released.Speaking on related topics, the soundtrack is also not particularly great. That's not because it's bad because it isn't, but more due to the lack of diversity and track number. I'm not exaggerating when I say you will hear like half of the entire soundtrack in a single episode on average. A lot of episodes start with the same minimalist percussive track and ends with the same dramatic motif at the climax of a battle. Even if it were mismanagement of using and placing the tracks in the right moments it's still got roughly 30 tracks to spread across 75 episodes which nowadays is the bare minimum for a 24 episode show. And to rectify the earlier point of it not being bad - It's good, there are some absolutely fantastic tracks sprinkled throughout. The main theme in particular is one of the best opening themes I've heard from an 80's anime which is saying a lot. But it suffers from repeating the motifs in many tracks. It feels like there's even less than 30 odd tracks as a result.One more piece of criticism I can grant to the story is its lack of theming. The message of this story isn't a large part of its writing which can lead to it feel directionless at times. Not that it loses its footing and has bad pacing but that it doesn't play with any central ideas that drives the narrative and characters other than putting an end to war for the sake of independency. Gundam for instance while being about a war still offers the idea of finding where you belong in a world that you feel alone in and that war can be overcome if humans learn to understand one another even if ultimately it's something that may never happen. A simple premise but these themes drive a lot of the character dynamics further into the story that make for some extremely memorable character arc and story conclusions. And while Dougram does try to do this late into the story it feels like there was a lot more room for this discourse from the beginning. This isn't necessarily inferring to a story without meaning, there are messages and takeaways within the episodes of the hopelessness and harshness of war but it rarely goes beyond that.All in all this show is still good. It's old and before Sunrise hit their stride as a massive studio so of course it's going to have its production problems and be longer than it should be but the narrative is extremely tight, has great characters and it has some fantastic buildup. Even if it came before Votoms and far before 08th MS Team this is still a Ryou Takanashi and Kanda directed anime who are highly respected in the mecha community. I know that I compared this show a lot to Gundam but it's a comparison worth making as it's one of the first mecha shows that was inspired by its grittier premise, themes on war and serves as a good indication of where the genre could be taken with guidance outside of Tomino's lenses; an indication that the genre isn't doomed to poorly copy Gundam. The length and visual quality may deter you from giving this show a try but if you're a fan of the original Gundam that would prefer a more gritty depiction as in other Takanashi shows like Votoms then this may be for you. Don't get distracted by its removal from the annals of history, Dougram is well worth changing the channel to. And with the advent of a recent manga headed by Yasuo Ohtagaki and supervised by the man himself Takanashi who knows. Sunrise never hates the opportunity to shill a new toy line and their fanbase is always chomping at the bit for a new mecha anime series done by them no matter how niche it ends up being. Not to say that it's even remotely likely but it's always up in the air as long as there's proof it hasn't been completely forgotten. tone. Just like the Spacenoids that wish to secede from the Earth regime in 0079 Dougram's landscape is of a future Earth colony called Deloyer that advocates for total autonomy from Earth's regime. And following the similarities the story largely focuses on a group of kids and young adults who become guerrillas fighting against the Earth federation for that goal. It's a simple premise but the show does a very good job at keeping things interesting without forcing itself to drastically shift gears or focus on unrelated plotlines and the few subplots that exist are quite engaging and often serve well throughout most of the story.What keeps this story consistently interesting is a memorable cast of characters on both the Deloyer and Earth sides, the villains especially having some surprisingly complex personalities and motivations that are explored a great deal that it never feels that they're acting out of character. Fans tend to state that the villains are far more interesting than the protagonists, and while that's true that doesn't necessarily mean they're bad protagonists. A word would be predictable; archetypal to what you'd expect when you see them. And if anything that serves as a strength to contrast a very pivotal point of war and politics where it establishes how much more intricate a villain's plan can be compared to the hero. The heroes simply want freedom, but the villains have a lot more complicated goals other than simply wanting to maintain the status quo.And while I compare this show a lot more to Gundam it's actually quite similar to Legend of the Galactic Heroes with how it chooses to focus a lot on political developments and jumping around multiple locations with different characters. Not to say that it was an inspiration, but this show focuses a lot less on the titular robot than even Gundam does which had already significantly toned back on that aspect from super robot shows. Unlike other mecha shows from this era the length is not spent on filler or drawn out arcs as an excuse to extend the air time. Dougram is paced well and while there's a couple of recap episodes there's very little actual content that could be considered filler. Again like LotGH it does its best to make every bit of dialogue feel necessary to listen to to understand the buildup to character actions and motivations as well as being immediately relevant to the episode it takes place in.

If you like UC Gundam, you might like this.  The war/politics between two worlds is surprisingly good, but don't watch this if you want exciting Mecha battles as this is the show's main flaw.  Though the action does get pretty decent in the last arc.One can easily make comparisons to Gundam First, but they are totally different in regards to focus and execution.  The action in Dougram is interesting as each battle is a little different with a clear objective in mind.  It can be...as simple as crossing a bridge or taking out an artillery battery.  These scenarios keep things fresh.  The problem is the execution.  The battles feel rather wonky up until the last arc.The show excels in drawing you into the conflict between two worlds.  It feels like a real conflict with real people on both sides.  The game of politics is surprising good and adds to conflict between worlds.  The main characters aren't terrible, but do feel a little lacking in character development.  The real stars of the show are the leaders of the conflict.  They all have their own goals in mind and are either plagued with ideology, pride, ambition, ect which makes for a surprisingly good watch.If you are more a fan of the war/politics side of UC Gundam than the action, then this is a must watch as this show definitely has more meat.  Also, no newtype magic crap is present in this show.  Some would consider this a plus.Cheers. as simple as crossing a bridge or taking out an artillery battery.  These scenarios keep things fresh.

Trying to get independence through guerilla war movements, TNK shows us the hardness of liberation movements, how idealisms are transformed into realities based on blood and sweat. How these movements can be directed by elites (and also from the people) and the importance of economic power in diplomatic relations. How guerrillas cannot succeed if they are not transformed into a disciplined army (Jackie Zaltsev) and the need for officers. At the same time, specific moments can...ignite the flame of revolution. The story is guided by emotions not by reason (Donan) and how, in the face of a revolutionary movement, it is possible to calm tempers with good actions, although it is a relatively difficult path (Rick Boyd). The grays of revolutions. There is nothing black or white. And therefore there are no good and bad, so one must follow the bat he believes in (Donan).I recommend watching it, especially if you like politics and other similar anime like LOGH. Howewer bear in mind that this anime has some weak points, like Music, Animation not the greatest, 75 episodes felt too long though few episodes could be erased and also some incoherences regarding the character development, that in general is good. I consider that this anime shapes the POLITICAL world in a proper way and for me thats enough to watch it and recommend it.More information AND SPOILERS:From the military level there is a certain strategy and above all a lot of tactics, usually of good quality but there are some fights that really dont have any sense (Episodes 29 & 30), there gets a point where Dougram feels can beat anyone else and also military incompetence becomes evident.As for the characters, I would say that in general terms, the series is concerned with developing the most important ones, which does not mean that it does it well. Since there are many subplots, this gives rise to many characters, which is appreciated. However, some of the main characters in my opinion remain unexploited. This is the case of Crinn. How is it possible that someone who risks his life does not know why he is risking it, and also risks it for those who tried to kill his father? The series tried to argue it, but I don\'t think it is a feasible point of view. (EPISODE 12, example). Crinn is a character that for me could have evolved into an insurgent leader, more than the mere soldier who pilots Dougram.His relationship with Daisy at the same time is undoubtedly empty. The same goes for Rocky and Cannary, two certainly flat characters. The only point where we see a different Rocky practically at the end. It could be said that being in a constant war does not give us time to reflect or be ""more human"", but the series does show us certain moments of unrest, which could have been used to develop these characters. Crinn comes to have deep reflections about what he is doing and why he is doing it. Also with his alleged harassment and demolition by enemies, which causes fever. But the mere fact that they came to suspect the professor at the last moment leaves a lot to be desired on the part of Fang of the Sun. When we thought we had reached a certain level of maturity, it is still not there. In the end it turns out that they are the most idealistic, wanting to continue fighting even without having sufficient resources. .Does a person who leaves everything behind like Professor Shamalin really let a coup d\'état hit him in the face? In this sense, it is credible, but I personally am not convinced. At that point, I think the professor would have done everything necessary to continue to the end, and not resign himself to being removed from power. At the same time, his last speech, in my opinion, makes little logical sense. He tells them to look for a new life to form a new society. But how will they achieve it if they will continue to be subject to the same ties of economic-political power? With what happens in the end with Lecoque it seems that Deloyer will gain some power, but deep down that is not the case. Even so, his idea of \u200b\u200bhuman cosmopolitanism must be made compatible with the defense of the rights of his people.In the end the most developed character is the villain Lecoque, who goes from seeming like a helpful secretary to boasting monumental ambitions.It is true that the music can be repetitive, but this way the theme of each of the characters is precisely identified, which is fine. also some chapters are a repetion of previous ones, but maybe they are like 4 as maximum.It\'s not an anime that I regret having seen, but I might think about it if I watch it again. ignite the flame of revolution.

Tropical-Rouge! Precure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44191/Tropical-Rouge_Precure,"[""I made 2 big mistakes I'll never forget in this lifetime: first was when I first-picked Sona in my last promo game and second... when I thought of Precure as a series that is for welp young girls or really hardcore mahou shoujo fans only.As a disclaimer, I've watched to the end Heartcatch only (and I'll be probably looked down upon by the true fans for that), tried a few other random seasons (ended up postponing them), started Hugtto recently (and I'm loving it), got the gist regarding how the series works and plan to watch a few more. I'm rather new to the...franchise, but there's something I find really charming about it. It is like a return to the roots so to speak. Every Sunday I wake up (or before I go to sleep sometimes as I'm not that functional) and watch THE episode. Now, I'm not thirteen, but that's exactly how I feel. It's got this rather fanciful atmosphere surrounding it and I want more people to give it a shot.Production 2.1/3I really like the character design (especially Asuka). I feel like they are really well done and each and every one of them has got some peculiarities that make it shine brighter. Moreover, even the supporting cast's looking pretty good. Now, when it comes to a staple in the genre, the transformation scenes, they were pretty damn solid (despite being a bit stiff), especially Asuka's with that Trigger vibe going on. They are vivid and full of energy plus that 'Let's make-up!' catchphrase has somehow... Caught me in.The art style is very suitable. Even watching a scene out of context, you'd know this is a magical girls show. It's really colourful and pleasant, as long as you don't mind a more tropical palette. Composition-wise the series is doing fine too, as the 3dcg (which is quite well done) is not that blatant and it blends in really well with the other elements of the show. The framing's been pretty good too. What stood out the most for me were maybe some of the shots from the fight scenes and those 'cool guys don't look at explosions' poses after each victory, which I found rather quirky and unique. I'm not used to seeing those in an anime, but I don't mind them at all. They actually kind of remind me of some video games.Story 1.2/2What you have to understand is that Precure is aimed at kids. As such it follows a format that is easy to watch and doesn't require some 200iq charts to remember what's going on. Kids don't mind the episodic format (at least in the early parts from what I've seen + they fit together quite nicely). Don't expect to find a masterpiece of a story that you'll dissect with dem bois on a 2005 forum, each coming with a new theory for what Manatsu meant when she said she wants to tropica-shine, especially as the series' focal point is the relationship between its cast and how they interact with each other, not the plot. However, you can expect a really fun light-hearted adventure that even the villains don't take that seriously. Even though Precure can really do drama, so far this feels like a more fun and energetic season. Moreover, for the aforementioned reason the pacing of each episode's been really good so far. If it were too slow, kids would easily get bored, while if it were too fast they wouldn't follow it.The show is pretty action packed, but it is a bit too early to make too many remarks regarding other aspects of it, as I have no idea what path this will take. However, from what I've seen so far, the first episode after introductions was a pleasant surprise.Characters 0.6/1They are likeable and, despite the black-and-white morality (Laura's is a bit questionable at times and that's perfect, I'd add^^) that's pretty strong within this series, they've all got their own personalities. They have their strengths and obviously their weaknesses. The precures are fun to watch while interacting with each other as they are well-balanced as a cast and Laura's banter is pretty good. The only thing I'm not the biggest fan of is Manatsu's overbearing at times personality. That's pretty standard for pink cures (or so I'm told), but she's still a bit too much. To be fair, even the rest are pretty standard Precure deal when it comes to characters/backstories and that's exactly why this can work as a starting point into the series. On the other hand, Asuka's cool chara's a really nice addition.Another thing I really liked is that the villains are not that serious about their job. I've always felt like life, in general, shouldn't be treated too formally as you'll miss on a lot of things. The 'it is what it is' attitude is pretty healthy I'd say, as long as you can keep it in check. Same thing can be said about them, as they don't seem that motivated (quite ironically) to dry everyone's motivation.Sound 0.7/1I like the op and I find it to be quite a good match for the overall tone of the show. The ed's nice too and the overall sound design was good. The voice acting is really good and I'm glad that Eripiyo's getting so many big roles lately, as she totally killed it in Oshi ga Budo. I'm quite shocked to see her fit so many different roles so well.Enjoyment 2.4/3This is what Precure is: a really enjoyable experience that every anime fan should at least try. I feel like this would be a great starting point as watching this on a weekly basis adds quite a few to the series' fanciful feel (at least for me it does), instead of binging it in a few days when it's over. At the moment, it doesn't look like the best Precure season to be completely honest, but this can change easily. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, as it is a mixture of light-hearted comedy, drama and action aimed at kids, but please give this a chance. Don't disregard it because of its premise, as you might end up actually liking it. I didn't grow up with it or anything like that, as such you can't blame it on nostalgia, but I feel like Precure overall is a series that's done dirty by the west.I haven't seen that much Precure. I'm not a hardcore fan and maybe my thoughts about this season and series are not on-point, but I feel like the opinion of a newcomer might matter to potential newcomers mainly because there are people that feel disheartened when a huge fan of a show recommends it and discard it as bias. As an anime, I wouldn't say it's the second coming of Jesus, but as an experience, this is definitely worth every second.T= 7 franchise, but there's something I find really charming about it.

The only thing I'm not the biggest fan of is Manatsu's overbearing at times personality. That's pretty standard for pink cures (or so I'm told), but she's still a bit too much. To be fair, even the rest are pretty standard Precure deal when it comes to characters/backstories and that's exactly why this can work as a starting point into the series. On the other hand, Asuka's cool chara's a really nice addition.Another thing I really liked is that the villains are not that serious about their job. I've always felt like life, in general, shouldn't be treated too formally as you'll miss on a lot of things. The 'it is what it is' attitude is pretty healthy I'd say, as long as you can keep it in check. Same thing can be said about them, as they don't seem that motivated (quite ironically) to dry everyone's motivation.Sound 0.7/1I like the op and I find it to be quite a good match for the overall tone of the show. The ed's nice too and the overall sound design was good. The voice acting is really good and I'm glad that Eripiyo's getting so many big roles lately, as she totally killed it in Oshi ga Budo. I'm quite shocked to see her fit so many different roles so well.Enjoyment 2.4/3This is what Precure is: a really enjoyable experience that every anime fan should at least try. I feel like this would be a great starting point as watching this on a weekly basis adds quite a few to the series' fanciful feel (at least for me it does), instead of binging it in a few days when it's over. At the moment, it doesn't look like the best Precure season to be completely honest, but this can change easily. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, as it is a mixture of light-hearted comedy, drama and action aimed at kids, but please give this a chance. Don't disregard it because of its premise, as you might end up actually liking it. I didn't grow up with it or anything like that, as such you can't blame it on nostalgia, but I feel like Precure overall is a series that's done dirty by the west.I haven't seen that much Precure. I'm not a hardcore fan and maybe my thoughts about this season and series are not on-point, but I feel like the opinion of a newcomer might matter to potential newcomers mainly because there are people that feel disheartened when a huge fan of a show recommends it and discard it as bias. As an anime, I wouldn't say it's the second coming of Jesus, but as an experience, this is definitely worth every second.T= 7"", ""Tropical-Rouge Precure is a series I originally started to watch as a 'joke' to see how silly it is because I saw it's cover and thought 'that's probably the most stereotypical shoujo anime ever'.Well I was very wrong but also glad I decided to watch it because it's super cute, entertaining and well-written.The Story is probably it's weakest point but it can still be consindered a solid 7/10. Tropical Rouge is a not a plot focused series after all but rather a character focused one. It is nonetheless a decent story with a very promising ending.The Art was also pretty good, nothing incredibly outstandind but...good and I have to say the the cute artstyle as well as the character designs grew onto me pretty quickly.The Sound was overall pretty amazing. Tropical-Rouge's opening became one of my favorite anime openings since it's so catchy and energetic. The various character themes are also great no matter if it's from protagonists or antagonists.In the Character section I gave 10/10 since I think the characters are by far the best thing about Tropical-Rouge Precure. Laura is by far my favorite character and something like the de-facto main character of the series but Manatsu, Sango, Minori and Asuka are also absolutley great and likable characters with their own stories. Even the antagonists are really well-written and believable and I love their portrayal as beings with feelings and personality that can even be passionate about things even if they claim to want a world without motivation.Overall I enjoyed Tropical-Rouge a lot and I would heaviy recommend it even to non-Shoujo fans since it basically awakened my interest in Shoujo anime.This was my first review and English is not my native language so I apologize for my simple word choice and probably poor grammar. good and I have to say the the cute artstyle as well as the character designs grew onto me pretty quickly.The Sound was overall pretty amazing.

But we're past half way, and I've found myself completely uninterested in continuing to watch it - which hasn't occurred since the travesty that was Happiness Charge.STORY: 6Precure rarely has much of an overarching story - instead, it typically relies on a few narrative goals, surrounded by character arcs, to drive itself along. Tropical Rouge is no different, except for the part where it lacks both goals and growth.None of the characters' grow much, apart from the one that makes me want to bash my head...through a wall, which obviously isn't saying much,  Any time there's so much as a semblance of evolution, or a hint of past traumas, the show just brushes it under a rug to be adressed... never. At least, not yet. Which, for a show nearing the half-way mark, is deeply frustrating.Besides that, the goals of the team are lax at the best of times, and just pure selfish stupidity at the worst, which seems like the last thing a children's show should be promoting.CHARACTER: 6.5We've already covered their complete lack of growth, but in addition, most of this season's cast feel like they've been hodge-podged together from previous series without much care for how they actually relate to each other, or even for their own depth of character.Summer, our lead, is incredibly annoying, but at least has some self-awareness unlike some comparable past leads, and is uniquely the child of apparently separated parents. But that's as deep as that gets, given it goes unexplained and unexplored - much like every other facet of her character. She's as flat as her cardboard cut-outs.Laura is the equally irritating mermaid who steals every scene, every time, from everyone, and for no apparent reason. Her entire motivation is bland, unexplored, and entirely selfish, which makes her both unlikeable and uninteresting, feeling at times like a dupe of Milky Rose but without the tragic backstory. Which is a shame, given her unique sassiness had so much potential.Flamingo is Chocolat 2.0, only with no chemistry with the main cast whatsoever. Poor Coral is both underused and underdeveloped, having a pathetic power set and often shown - even on the poster art - to be an outsider within their friend group. Sango's mermaid nerdiness is a copy-paste of Custard, but with none of the lovable quirks.Overall, I struggle to see how any of this cast could possibly improve by the end of the season, without first nuking their existing paper-thin personalities.ART: 7.5Look, Precure has at least learned a thing or two about action sequences over the years, along with character design, and what pretty shiny plastic things it can sell to children (along with obsessive completionism collector adults like myself.) So of course the designs are mostly fabulous.The lack of a tanned character in an island-themed anime, and clearly a tropical one, is troubling and rather bizarre. It's particularly concerning given Precure has proven that absolutely can include dark-skinned  PoC characters - yet in this, a canonically foreign setting where natives would likely be just that, there are none represented.But - at least aesthetically - where it fails the most is the generic bad guys, who could very easily fit into any other water-themed anime with evil. Though, villain are not what sells, so I can hardly blame Toei for keeping them looking rather basic.SOUND: 6Look, I don't want to get into the cultural appropriation , but let's just say I was not impressed with some of their choices.That said, the op and ed are both entirely appropriate for the series, and the sound effects are as charming and mildly camp, as per usual.The voice acting is perhaps some of the weakest in recent seasons, likely due to the majority of the cast being less experienced. I won't mention the full details, but  let's just say Toei usually divies the funds up a lot more evenly than they did this season.OVERALL & ENJOYMENT :  6.5Look, I've seen worse series, and even worse Precure seasons.

Now, to set something straight: when it comes to this season in particular, you’ll either love it, or you’ll hate it.Me? I absolutely ADORED it. It’s so silly!!! But even though it was, it still had a great story. I loved all of the characters, especially everyone’s favorite sea fairy, KURURUN.The music in the show I wouldn’t necessarily say is phenomenal, but it IS iconic and really enjoyable, especially the second ending.The visuals in this show are absolutely gorgeous, and there were several arcs in the show that were extremely...fun to watch. My favorite episode HAS to be episode 33: its just one big compilation of alternate-universe shorts LOLOverall this season is EXTREMELY great, and I would highly recommend this to…quite literally everyone.Therefore, my rating: 10/10 fun to watch.

I actually do like the Precure designs. To start, for me, it’s somewhat of a boring season due to the more of lighthearted tone and not a serious one. I know that this is supposed to be a fun season for a pandemic but it wasn’t that interesting. The villains of this season are not that threatening. However, I do think that the first 5 episodes were decent and the fight scenes were done alright and the rest are either...boring episodes and perhaps, short or even no fight scenes at all. There is one later episode that has some nice animation fight scenes but the art-style suffer a little. The final battle is questionable since the fight scene animation scene is decent but the overall combat scene were fairly short. Also, the later half of the story took for a downfall. This season wasn’t really constructed that well or actually prepared for a decent storytelling near the end. Although, near the end of the series, the other main characters does get their own final development arc which is done decently. Wish they get more developments throughout the series, though. Many people noticed that the spotlight or well developed has been shine upon one of the characters which is definitely true. Overall, it’s not a really great season for me at least but the older seasons such as Smile Precure is recommended. However, feel free to this show to see if it fits your taste.

I feel Healin Good didn´t capture the values by  Precure seasons like Futari wa Precure or Hugtto Precure did. Tropical Rouge Precure! really capture the importance of friendship. Every girl has her special episodes and also they showcased how their friendship between them developed.Some episodes were really heartwarming.  Also the animation in the last episodes really improved.What I didn´t like was that it felt repetitive, there were a lot of...episodes about their club activities. I wish they would explore a bit more about  the villain´s past, for example,they explained but not really much.It was really sweet to see how the 5 of them became so united.One thing I have to critize  in most recent seasons is how the villains are so weak, they are attacked and they don´t do anything to avoid it. Also the attacks became super long, before they weren´t so long.My favorite character was Sango, she was really sweet but was brave when they needed her. I will miss the team, even tough Laura isn´t exactly the type of character I really love, I liked how she cared for others later.Asuka´s past was interesting to see and how she developed her feelings was heartwarming.Minori also changed, because she was  a loner before and now dare to write her own things.And for Manatsu, I wish they would develop her more, sometimes it felt Laura was the main protagonist and Manatsu was left behind.I love their friendship of these two, just I wish they would make a more special arc about her dreams and future, I feel the writers didn´t know what to do with her, same for Kururun, the fairy, who didn´t do anything really important.Overall, the season was ok, it could have been better tough. I recommend it, even tough I must say people shouldn´t have so much expectations on this season.Despite this, I´m going to miss these girls. episodes about their club activities.

Seriously, I\'ve made no secret of the fact that Healin Good Pretty Cure is one of my favorite seasons of Pretty Cure. Other than not utilizing all of its villains except for Daruizen enough and having to cut episodes due to delays from the pandemic, Healin Good Pretty Cure, I feel, did pretty much everything right in terms of what I feel a magical girl series should be, something I hadn\'t felt since Heartcatch or Go...Princess. So when the series after that, Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure was announced, I decided to watch it. But something told me that it wasn\'t going to hold a candle to Healin Good in my eyes, but at the same time, I didn\'t want to be that person and just judge it solely because it wasn\'t Healin Good. But dear lord...even with my low expectations, Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure has to be one of the biggest disappointments and letdowns I\'ve seen in a while.So what\'s the story? A chipper young girl, Manatsu, moves to mainland Japan to start middle school, as her home island doesn\'t have a middle school. While preparing for the trip, she meets a real life mermaid, named Laura, who had to flee to the surface because her underwater kingdom was attacked, and she\'s been tasked to find four warriors, Pretty Cure, who can defeat the evil witch that decimated her home. Manatsu is more than happy to accept the task, and three more girls, Sango, Minori, and Asuka, join them on their quest. Together, they must fight the witch\'s minions and stop them from stealing Motivation Power from their family, friends, and the rest of the townspeople...but they\'re not quite sure just what the Witch of Delays even wants with Motivation Power in the first place. And yes, the premise is exactly as stupid as it sounds. I\'m not even kidding. This leads me to the first of Tropical Rouge\'s biggest issues: There\'s literally no stakes or conflict! All the villains ever do is turn people into monsters by sucking away their motivation, which doesn\'t even kill them BTW, and as a result, there\'s no palpable tension or sense of urgency, and the battles feel less like high stakes action and are about as boring as eating lunch. Plus, the three minions who serve the Witch of Delays are solely defined by being lazy, and never even fight the Pretty Cure themselves! Even Mahou Tsukai\'s villains, as bad and cliche as they were, did more than just lie around and steal energy from people.But the lack of a compelling storyline and bland villains aren\'t the only thing wrong with Tropical Rouge. Secondly, the show\'s themes feel really bizarre: How exactly are motivation, procrastination, and cosmetics supposed to go together? How does makeup contribute to motivation? I know effort goes into applying it, or that in some cases it can boost your confidence, but...I don\'t know. The themes don\'t seem to mix very well here. Manatsu, the main character, says she uses makeup to deal with loneliness and uneasiness in a new place, but honestly, makeup and cosmetics feel really out of place in a situation like that unless you\'re deliberately trying to get people to notice you. It feels like TroPri just threw its themes together in a blender just for the sake of it without taking into account whether the contents would actually mix well enough or not. I know Pretty Cure is mainly a glorified toy commercial, and I have no problem with that, but there are lots of times when it felt like TroPri really wanted to hammer in the fact that they were selling toys to kids in the audience, even though they used more subtle methods of introducing them in previous iterations.Plus, you\'d think with 40-something episodes, Toei would use that time to flesh out the characters at every opportunity, build on their chemistry, and make the audience actually care about them, right? WRONG! Previous Pretty Cure seasons would flesh out their main characters early on, showing us their strengths, weaknesses, personalities, idiosyncracies, and reasons for becoming Pretty Cure. Heartcatch Pretty Cure welt full hog on this as early as episode 4. Healin Good had Nodoka\'s reasons for wanting to be a Pretty Cure established in episode 2. Smile Pretty Cure eschewed its narrative in favor of developing its main ensemble, and while it didn\'t always succeed, the creators\' hearts were in the right place. Do you want to know how long it takes for Tropical Rouge to put the spotlight on any character that\'s not Manatsu or Laura? EPISODE 28, more than halfway into the series\' run! The entire first half of the series is little more than comedic filler used to pad things out unnecessarily, and it often felt to me like the show actively refused to develop any of its main characters, or even flesh them out in ways that made them feel more like people and less like over-the-top stereotypes. Sango in particular is the biggest victim of this, because episode 3 established a character flaw she has, that she\'s a conformist who\'s afraid of going against the in-crowd, and Toei could have done a lot with that, since there\'s a lot of people who can relate to that. But instead, said flaw never comes up again, and she only ever gets a grand total of TWO focus episodes, both of which are extremely late into the series\' run, and even then, they barely do anything with her, so she\'s literally nothing more than living background scenery taking up space! And I say this as someone who really likes Sango, and I wish she had gotten to do more! She deserves better! Minori and Asuka are more fleshed out, thankfully, and out of the five Cures, Asuka is actually the most well developed and three-dimensional, as she got the best material in the show.Basically, Toei basically put off developing the other Cures in favor of shilling Manatsu and Laura to no end. Now, I want to say that I actually don\'t hate Laura as a character. I agree that she\'s become a bit of a spotlight hog since she became a Cure (That\'s not even a spoiler, BTW. She turns into a Cure in episode 17, which is really early by Precure standards), but I think she\'s fine, and I feel she earned the right to become a Cure. Plus, she doesn\'t annoy me NEARLY as much as, say, Haa-chan from Mahou Tsukai. But this isn\'t exactly an issue Toei is unfamiliar with, as their tendency to shill one character at the expense of others who really need more screentime has been prevalent as far back as Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart. Honestly, I think the biggest offender here is Manatsu, who\'s...just bland as hell. She\'s literally nothing more than a zany, loud, overly cheerful cipher who acts like she\'s high on sugar and is just there to shout ""tropica-shine!!"" every chance she gets. Now, I do admit I know I throw a lot of shade at Megumi from Happiness Charge Pretty Cure, and made it clear she\'s not my favorite character in Precure in general. But I am, however, going to give her credit for one thing: For as overly saccharine and annoying as Megumi could be, the staff on that show at least allowed her to show emotions other than over-the-top happiness and allowed her to have moments where she could be sad, vulnerable, jealous, angry, and insecure. Granted, other seasons did it better, but I am willing to give Happiness Charge credit where it due when it matters, because if you have a character behave one way all the time, the audience isn\'t going to connect with them. Manatsu doesn\'t get that. My problem with Manatsu is that, after 30-something episodes, she hasn\'t shown any emotions other than being over-the-top happy and zany, constantly shouting ""Tropica-shine!"" all the damn time, and the few times she acts anything but happy is played for laughs. There\'s literally nothing in-between! Manatsu is often way too happy for no reason whatsoever. Happiness should be spontaneous, not granted or forced. She\'s not allowed to be vulnerable or even act like a normal human being, which annoys the shit out of me, and the one episode that actually tried to address that issue shoots itself in the foot due to bad writing that made the characters seem needlessly dumb, and still played Manatsu\'s angst for laughs and not even trying to treat it like a genuinely serious situation! Furthermore, early in the show, Manatsu says she puts on makeup to deal with loneliness and uneasiness, but the show never actually SHOWS Manatsu being any of those things. 99% of the time, she\'s zany, loud, and acts like an overgrown five-year-old, and very rarely is she allowed to be vulnerable or realistically emotional in any way, so the anime kind of shoots itself in the foot when it can\'t even be bothered to develop any of its characters beyond their most basic personality trait.Which leads me to the show\'s biggest problem: The fact that it\'s so laser-focused on comedy in favor of everything else. It always felt to me like Tropical Rouge has this mindset that if it can have characters act zany and make funny faces all the time, it won\'t lose the kids\' attention, and considering how much it put off actually bothering to flesh out the story and the characters in favor of it, it comes off as patronizing and condescending at best. Here\'s the thing: I can understand Toei wanting to make a more lighthearted, comedic series after the more emotionally charged Healin Good, especially since we\'re still dealing with the COVID pandemic. Hell, the whole reason Smile Pretty Cure was created was so kids can be cheered up after the awful 2011 earthquake. But here\'s the thing: Smile also had a heavy focus on comedy, but it actually gave a shit about developing the characters and giving the audience reasons to care about them. Yes, it was very episodic and had a lot of filler, but Smile knew what to focus on and what to keep limited, keeping the comedic parts where it was appropriate, and allowing its characters to be vulnerable when it mattered. Smile didn\'t always succeed, but it at least tried. Smile didn\'t focus so much on comedy that it was at the expense of literally everything else, which is, unfortunately, what Tropical Rouge did. Most of the early episodes consist of Manatsu and Laura doing stuff that did nothing to progress the story, feeling more like they were just padding things out, and by the time the show remembered it needed to flesh out Sango, Minori, and Asuka, it was too little, too late, and I was no longer invested in the anime anymore. Seriously, Toei, your shows work better when you actually put effort into the writing and characters! Even Digimon Ghost Game, which is airing right now, understands this!Alright, I think that\'s enough of the bad stuff. Let\'s talk about the good stuff. First: the animation. Everything is bright and colorful, with CGI being used when appropriate, the girls\' Cure designs are actually pretty creative and fit the tropical theme the show is going for, and the actual character animation is fairly solid. The soundtrack is pretty good too, and, surprisingly enough, Toei actually held back on reusing BGM from Healin Good here. I only noticed two pieces of background music from Healin Good being used, though I could be wrong, so good on Toei for putting in some effort there. The songs are well sung too, with the opening being a total ear worm. I also liked a lot of the minor and side characters who appeared from time to time, like Manatsu\'s teacher Sakuragawa, Asuka\'s former friend-turned-rival Yuriko (the blue haired student council president), Sango\'s mom, that blue haired girl who loves astronomy, and so on. I also appreciate that Kururun isn\'t a living plot device or important to the story for once, as she\'s just a cute animal mascot, but still manages to be useful when the time calls for it. Also, I love that one episode that was just a bunch of vignettes done in different animation styles, and that was the absolute best justification to have the Heartcatch Pretty Cure girls make a cameo for a few scenes. The show does have some flashes of brilliance every now and again. Unfortunately, they\'re very few and far between, and not enough to save the show from being anything above aggressively mediocre.Before anyone says anything, no, I don\'t expect children\'s shows to be on the level of Van Gogh-style masterpieces, nor am I one of those chuds who only like dark, edgy magical girl shows. Pretty Cure, at the end of the day, is a glorified toy commercial for little girls. But shows like My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Ojamajo Doremi, Card Captor Sakura, and even other seasons of Pretty Cure, have proven that you don\'t have to be completely soulless when making them. All I ask is that the people who make these shows actually care and put effort into making said shows for girls, not simply My Little Pony Newborn Cuties-style visual fodder to plop kids in front of the TV so they can be babysat for half an hour every day. Every Pretty Cure season has things they\'re good at and some things they aren\'t. Mahou Tsukai took great care to flesh out its setting, Suite Pretty Cure made great use of its music themes, Smile Pretty Cure could be genuinely funny when it tried, Heartcatch really ramped up the action scenes and developed its main ensemble, and so on. Other than improved animation, Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure doesn\'t really have anything that makes it stand out from the other Pretty Cure seasons, or anything that it\'s really good at. It\'s a shame, because had it done more with itself, it could have been amazing, had it not tried so hard to be solely driven by comedy, filler episodes, and unnecessary shilling of both Manatsu and Laura. Granted, I still think Happiness Charge Pretty Cure is worse due to trying too hard to emulate other seasons, ignoring plot points it established, bad writing decisions, and poorly executed characters, so for the few things Tropical Rouge did do right, I\'m willing to give it some credit where its due.That being said, if you want something to show your daughter or little sister so they, or you, can kill time or have a good laugh, feel free to watch Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure. But it is absolutely NOT one of the better Pretty Cure seasons by a country mile. It wastes its time on needless filler and is just a massive chore to watch. I really hope Delicious Party Pretty Cure turns out better, and if it\'s not, I\'m just gonna rewatch Heartcatch. Don\'t expect anything extraordinary out of this one. Princess. So when the series after that, Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure was announced, I decided to watch it. But something told me that it wasn\'t going to hold a candle to Healin Good in my eyes, but at the same time, I didn\'t want to be that person and just judge it solely because it wasn\'t Healin Good. But dear lord...even with my low expectations, Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure has to be one of the biggest disappointments and letdowns I\'ve seen in a while.So what\'s the story? A chipper young girl, Manatsu, moves to mainland Japan to start middle school, as her home island doesn\'t have a middle school. While preparing for the trip, she meets a real life mermaid, named Laura, who had to flee to the surface because her underwater kingdom was attacked, and she\'s been tasked to find four warriors, Pretty Cure, who can defeat the evil witch that decimated her home. Manatsu is more than happy to accept the task, and three more girls, Sango, Minori, and Asuka, join them on their quest. Together, they must fight the witch\'s minions and stop them from stealing Motivation Power from their family, friends, and the rest of the townspeople...but they\'re not quite sure just what the Witch of Delays even wants with Motivation Power in the first place. And yes, the premise is exactly as stupid as it sounds. I\'m not even kidding. This leads me to the first of Tropical Rouge\'s biggest issues: There\'s literally no stakes or conflict! All the villains ever do is turn people into monsters by sucking away their motivation, which doesn\'t even kill them BTW, and as a result, there\'s no palpable tension or sense of urgency, and the battles feel less like high stakes action and are about as boring as eating lunch. Plus, the three minions who serve the Witch of Delays are solely defined by being lazy, and never even fight the Pretty Cure themselves! Even Mahou Tsukai\'s villains, as bad and cliche as they were, did more than just lie around and steal energy from people.But the lack of a compelling storyline and bland villains aren\'t the only thing wrong with Tropical Rouge. Secondly, the show\'s themes feel really bizarre: How exactly are motivation, procrastination, and cosmetics supposed to go together? How does makeup contribute to motivation? I know effort goes into applying it, or that in some cases it can boost your confidence, but...I don\'t know. The themes don\'t seem to mix very well here. Manatsu, the main character, says she uses makeup to deal with loneliness and uneasiness in a new place, but honestly, makeup and cosmetics feel really out of place in a situation like that unless you\'re deliberately trying to get people to notice you. It feels like TroPri just threw its themes together in a blender just for the sake of it without taking into account whether the contents would actually mix well enough or not. I know Pretty Cure is mainly a glorified toy commercial, and I have no problem with that, but there are lots of times when it felt like TroPri really wanted to hammer in the fact that they were selling toys to kids in the audience, even though they used more subtle methods of introducing them in previous iterations.Plus, you\'d think with 40-something episodes, Toei would use that time to flesh out the characters at every opportunity, build on their chemistry, and make the audience actually care about them, right? WRONG! Previous Pretty Cure seasons would flesh out their main characters early on, showing us their strengths, weaknesses, personalities, idiosyncracies, and reasons for becoming Pretty Cure. Heartcatch Pretty Cure welt full hog on this as early as episode 4. Healin Good had Nodoka\'s reasons for wanting to be a Pretty Cure established in episode 2. Smile Pretty Cure eschewed its narrative in favor of developing its main ensemble, and while it didn\'t always succeed, the creators\' hearts were in the right place. Do you want to know how long it takes for Tropical Rouge to put the spotlight on any character that\'s not Manatsu or Laura? EPISODE 28, more than halfway into the series\' run! The entire first half of the series is little more than comedic filler used to pad things out unnecessarily, and it often felt to me like the show actively refused to develop any of its main characters, or even flesh them out in ways that made them feel more like people and less like over-the-top stereotypes. Sango in particular is the biggest victim of this, because episode 3 established a character flaw she has, that she\'s a conformist who\'s afraid of going against the in-crowd, and Toei could have done a lot with that, since there\'s a lot of people who can relate to that. But instead, said flaw never comes up again, and she only ever gets a grand total of TWO focus episodes, both of which are extremely late into the series\' run, and even then, they barely do anything with her, so she\'s literally nothing more than living background scenery taking up space! And I say this as someone who really likes Sango, and I wish she had gotten to do more! She deserves better! Minori and Asuka are more fleshed out, thankfully, and out of the five Cures, Asuka is actually the most well developed and three-dimensional, as she got the best material in the show.Basically, Toei basically put off developing the other Cures in favor of shilling Manatsu and Laura to no end. Now, I want to say that I actually don\'t hate Laura as a character. I agree that she\'s become a bit of a spotlight hog since she became a Cure (That\'s not even a spoiler, BTW. She turns into a Cure in episode 17, which is really early by Precure standards), but I think she\'s fine, and I feel she earned the right to become a Cure. Plus, she doesn\'t annoy me NEARLY as much as, say, Haa-chan from Mahou Tsukai. But this isn\'t exactly an issue Toei is unfamiliar with, as their tendency to shill one character at the expense of others who really need more screentime has been prevalent as far back as Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart. Honestly, I think the biggest offender here is Manatsu, who\'s...just bland as hell. She\'s literally nothing more than a zany, loud, overly cheerful cipher who acts like she\'s high on sugar and is just there to shout ""tropica-shine!!"" every chance she gets. Now, I do admit I know I throw a lot of shade at Megumi from Happiness Charge Pretty Cure, and made it clear she\'s not my favorite character in Precure in general. But I am, however, going to give her credit for one thing: For as overly saccharine and annoying as Megumi could be, the staff on that show at least allowed her to show emotions other than over-the-top happiness and allowed her to have moments where she could be sad, vulnerable, jealous, angry, and insecure. Granted, other seasons did it better, but I am willing to give Happiness Charge credit where it due when it matters, because if you have a character behave one way all the time, the audience isn\'t going to connect with them. Manatsu doesn\'t get that. My problem with Manatsu is that, after 30-something episodes, she hasn\'t shown any emotions other than being over-the-top happy and zany, constantly shouting ""Tropica-shine!"" all the damn time, and the few times she acts anything but happy is played for laughs. There\'s literally nothing in-between! Manatsu is often way too happy for no reason whatsoever. Happiness should be spontaneous, not granted or forced. She\'s not allowed to be vulnerable or even act like a normal human being, which annoys the shit out of me, and the one episode that actually tried to address that issue shoots itself in the foot due to bad writing that made the characters seem needlessly dumb, and still played Manatsu\'s angst for laughs and not even trying to treat it like a genuinely serious situation! Furthermore, early in the show, Manatsu says she puts on makeup to deal with loneliness and uneasiness, but the show never actually SHOWS Manatsu being any of those things. 99% of the time, she\'s zany, loud, and acts like an overgrown five-year-old, and very rarely is she allowed to be vulnerable or realistically emotional in any way, so the anime kind of shoots itself in the foot when it can\'t even be bothered to develop any of its characters beyond their most basic personality trait.Which leads me to the show\'s biggest problem: The fact that it\'s so laser-focused on comedy in favor of everything else. It always felt to me like Tropical Rouge has this mindset that if it can have characters act zany and make funny faces all the time, it won\'t lose the kids\' attention, and considering how much it put off actually bothering to flesh out the story and the characters in favor of it, it comes off as patronizing and condescending at best. Here\'s the thing: I can understand Toei wanting to make a more lighthearted, comedic series after the more emotionally charged Healin Good, especially since we\'re still dealing with the COVID pandemic. Hell, the whole reason Smile Pretty Cure was created was so kids can be cheered up after the awful 2011 earthquake. But here\'s the thing: Smile also had a heavy focus on comedy, but it actually gave a shit about developing the characters and giving the audience reasons to care about them. Yes, it was very episodic and had a lot of filler, but Smile knew what to focus on and what to keep limited, keeping the comedic parts where it was appropriate, and allowing its characters to be vulnerable when it mattered. Smile didn\'t always succeed, but it at least tried. Smile didn\'t focus so much on comedy that it was at the expense of literally everything else, which is, unfortunately, what Tropical Rouge did. Most of the early episodes consist of Manatsu and Laura doing stuff that did nothing to progress the story, feeling more like they were just padding things out, and by the time the show remembered it needed to flesh out Sango, Minori, and Asuka, it was too little, too late, and I was no longer invested in the anime anymore. Seriously, Toei, your shows work better when you actually put effort into the writing and characters! Even Digimon Ghost Game, which is airing right now, understands this!Alright, I think that\'s enough of the bad stuff. Let\'s talk about the good stuff. First: the animation. Everything is bright and colorful, with CGI being used when appropriate, the girls\' Cure designs are actually pretty creative and fit the tropical theme the show is going for, and the actual character animation is fairly solid. The soundtrack is pretty good too, and, surprisingly enough, Toei actually held back on reusing BGM from Healin Good here. I only noticed two pieces of background music from Healin Good being used, though I could be wrong, so good on Toei for putting in some effort there. The songs are well sung too, with the opening being a total ear worm. I also liked a lot of the minor and side characters who appeared from time to time, like Manatsu\'s teacher Sakuragawa, Asuka\'s former friend-turned-rival Yuriko (the blue haired student council president), Sango\'s mom, that blue haired girl who loves astronomy, and so on. I also appreciate that Kururun isn\'t a living plot device or important to the story for once, as she\'s just a cute animal mascot, but still manages to be useful when the time calls for it. Also, I love that one episode that was just a bunch of vignettes done in different animation styles, and that was the absolute best justification to have the Heartcatch Pretty Cure girls make a cameo for a few scenes. The show does have some flashes of brilliance every now and again. Unfortunately, they\'re very few and far between, and not enough to save the show from being anything above aggressively mediocre.Before anyone says anything, no, I don\'t expect children\'s shows to be on the level of Van Gogh-style masterpieces, nor am I one of those chuds who only like dark, edgy magical girl shows. Pretty Cure, at the end of the day, is a glorified toy commercial for little girls. But shows like My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Ojamajo Doremi, Card Captor Sakura, and even other seasons of Pretty Cure, have proven that you don\'t have to be completely soulless when making them. All I ask is that the people who make these shows actually care and put effort into making said shows for girls, not simply My Little Pony Newborn Cuties-style visual fodder to plop kids in front of the TV so they can be babysat for half an hour every day. Every Pretty Cure season has things they\'re good at and some things they aren\'t. Mahou Tsukai took great care to flesh out its setting, Suite Pretty Cure made great use of its music themes, Smile Pretty Cure could be genuinely funny when it tried, Heartcatch really ramped up the action scenes and developed its main ensemble, and so on. Other than improved animation, Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure doesn\'t really have anything that makes it stand out from the other Pretty Cure seasons, or anything that it\'s really good at. It\'s a shame, because had it done more with itself, it could have been amazing, had it not tried so hard to be solely driven by comedy, filler episodes, and unnecessary shilling of both Manatsu and Laura. Granted, I still think Happiness Charge Pretty Cure is worse due to trying too hard to emulate other seasons, ignoring plot points it established, bad writing decisions, and poorly executed characters, so for the few things Tropical Rouge did do right, I\'m willing to give it some credit where its due.That being said, if you want something to show your daughter or little sister so they, or you, can kill time or have a good laugh, feel free to watch Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure.

After Healin’ Good turned out… well, good, there was a sliver of hope for this franchise. It seemed like we were back to the glory days were all the Cures were likable, had fair screentime, and the villains were evil and gave us cool fights. Sadly Tropical-Rouge (With a hyphen for some reason. Like crap-hole.) doesn’t really do much of that. Let’s check out how!First, there’s the story. Or rather, there isn’t. See, Tropical-Rouge was created to cheer up people after COVID, much like Smile after that huge earthquake. And much like Smile that means it barely has a plot. Actually, it’s...even worse than Smile, since at least Smile loudly pretended to have a plot and progress. Tropical-Rouge… Doesn’t. For the first two thirds of the series or so (not exaggeration), the only “plot” we get beyond the Cures joining is a short arc for the mid-season Cure, who was the most obvious choice for one by the way. Like, I get this is a fun season, but that doesn’t mean it needs to have Max Heart levels of filler. It’s a bit hilarious how near the end of the season we get a recap episode and most of it is just recalling on how each Cure joined and showing their attacks once again. Yes, even the recap has padding. Wow. Seriously, why is this season the one to get a recap episode, when it doesn’t need it?Anyway, once we get to episode 29 Toei remembers plots are things and that stories are better with them, so they throw a massive infodump in that episode and from there onwards we get actual stuff happening until the end. And you won’t believe this, but despite what little plot this season have they STILL manage to make it a huge mess! For starters, the Witch of Delays (the main villainess) is made sympathetic and we’re told she wasn’t really evil the whole time. Except when the Cure who joined halfway was captured and the Witch tried to make her join her team. Guess she felt evil that day. Worse, when she captures the Cure she says her motivation is creating a world of lazy people. Why? Who cares! But then at the end she has forgotten her motivation, which is then given as something entirely different. It’s like the first half of the series and the second half were written by different people who didn’t check notes, or a higher-up forced a change halfway, consistency in storytelling and proper plot logic be damned. So to summarize, there’s almost no plot and what there is, is lazy and poorly written. Fantastic. And for a “comedy” it’s not very funny either. The ending, while cute, it’s also a clear example of Toei somehow wanting to have its cake and eat it too. It’s not a bad ending but it really feels too convenient. Still, it’s probably the least offensive part of the story.Now some people will be saying “Eh, PreCure isn’t big on plot, the characters matter more.” and I agree with that. The problem is the cast is poorly used too! The main issue is Manatsu, the leader Cure. She doesn’t wear pink or has pink anywhere minus partially her hair when transformed, but she’s the “pink Cure” regardless. And boy, does she pink Cure the crap outta the series. Basically, remember Haruka “loud ugly hog” Haruno and Hikaru “loud cacophonic idiot” Hoshina, the GoPri and Star Twinkle pink Cures? Well, Manatsu is a mix of their worst traits, with more negative traits added on, and none of their few good bits. She’s easily the worst Cure in the franchise and is just plain awful. She has no hobbies and no special interests, and only really cares about having fun and doing fun things. Instead of Cure Summer she should be called Cure YOLO as that summarizes her character. Hell, there’s one episode where the other girls talk about their future jobs and the episode makes a big deal from what Manatsu will pick, but at the end she only says “I dunno lol, will think about it” which is a really lame copout. And the series treats this as a great reply! Oh yeah, did I mention she has more screentime than everyone else and is favored by plots consistently? Figured you would expect this. Plus her “Tropica-shine” catchphrase is spammed way too much all the time, and is dumb and ridiculous too. Manatsu is terrible. Oh, and ugly to boot, especially transformed. Why did Toei hire again the GoPri character designer, the world will never know!Thankfully the other Cures are good! But only one has real spotlight and screentime: Laura, the mermaid who becomes a Cure one third into the series. She’s funny, amusing, has a decent arc for the series, a popular VA that fits her well, and is overall the best girl in the series (But not my favorite). Yeah, sometimes she’s ridiculously proud or overly ignorant of the surface, even lacking common sense, but she’s likable overall. Sadly the other three are often moving background and don’t get much screentime. Asuka actually gets a better-late-than-never plot involving Yuriko the student council president (a recurring character) and is not too bad, but shy fashionable Sango and kuudere bookworm Minori get scraps. Toei giving the introverted heroines crap for focus? That has never, ever happened before. Other characters ae the aforementioned Yuriko who is cool, family members, the token bumbling villain trio, and… Kururun. For some reason Kururun got stupid popular, which must probably be some sort of joke I’m not allowed to get, because Kururun SUCKS. They add nothing to the plot, do nothing important, and in fact don’t do anything period except causing trouble (which is the source of suffering for Manatsu for one episode, but of course Kururun is not punished) and being annoying. They also have no dialog beyond parroting their name. Kururun is the worst mascot in the franchise in spite of stiff competition, which says a lot.Moving elsewhere, there’s the fights. After all, Toei was interviewed recently and they said again PreCure was about cool fights, so they must be good this time around, right? They, huh, aren’t. There’s ONE good fight (episode 29 again) and all the other fights are decent at best. Even the final battle is lame as hell, barely taking half the episode (if that) and being as generic as possible. I’m not expecting Splash Star levels of kickassery here, but at least like the previous season? Come on! Art and music stay good overall, aside from some ugly designs (Manatsu…) because as said the GoPri character designer should rethink their job. The ending song is still the “same” ending they’ve had since Fresh, so no comment there. The VAs are good, but I feel really bad hearing Ai Fairouz waste her voice yelling dumb things when she can do better, like she does with Jolyne for example. At least she’s happy with the job I guess.Overall Tropical-Rouge is just bad. Not bad-bad, but definitely a Bottom 3 season (so far). It tries to be a comedy (and fails) but then it tries to be serious (and also fails), the worst character hogs the spotlight, and the fights are subpar. Avoid this season unless your age is a single digit. Hopefully Delicious Party will satiate my hunger for a good season! even worse than Smile, since at least Smile loudly pretended to have a plot and progress. Tropical-Rouge… Doesn’t.

Vandread: The Second Stage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/181/Vandread__The_Second_Stage,"['It is impossible to enjoy the Vandread series without watching Vandread: The Second Stage. I believe that between the 2 series, the second one is superior.Obviously, the second season is a continuation of the story that began in the first season. What I noticed about the second season is that all characters went through huge developments; if not, revelations. I don&rsquo;t want to give out too many spoilers, but in the second season Hibiki is moving closer to his goal of proving his existence, his relationship with Dita is improving even more, and we learn more about characters such as Meia, Jura, Magno and B.C.There...are also new characters that will be introduced. In fact, there&rsquo;s so many of them but only 1 or 2 will take up more screen time than the other new characters. Here&rsquo;s a clue for one of them: If you remember Ezra from the first season, then you&rsquo;d probably have an idea of what kind of person the first new character will be.Most of the voice actors from the first season have been retained from the first one, and thank goodness for that because I would have pouted to death if the had removed Tomokazu Seki from the billing. He is one talented guy, and he always does a great job with each character he portrays (for this one, Tomokazu Seki plays Bart Garsus). Of course, like I said in my review of the first season, the other seiyuus were also able to bring out the personalities of their individual characters.The second season&rsquo;s visuals were more or less similar to the first season, except I did find it to be more consistent. The &ldquo;morphing faces&rdquo; or anything like were kept to a minimum. I also realized that the used repeated scenes more often for the second season. That&rsquo;s just laziness, but it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Most of the repeated scenes used are the ones wherein Dita&rsquo;s dread and Hibiki&rsquo;s van-types were combining.I like the opening song of the second season better. The song &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; by Aki Kudou was almost a synopsis of what the characters of Vandread are trying to accomplish. They are trying to fight for their justice, for a great future and they want to keep it that way. As for the ending song, it&rsquo;s OK. &ldquo;Yes Together&rdquo;, also by Aki Kudou, was too slow and mellow for my taste. Like the first season, the BGM was also well done this time around.Vandread: The Second Stage is definitely a good way to end the Vandread series.

Generally when dealing with a sequel we are left with an anime that tries too hard to better the original but in the end simply cannot compare. Thankfully, that is not the case as we have a powerful continuation that follows through with the strengths of its predecessor and takes it a step further to the next level.Unlike other sequels, The Second...Stage doesn't try too hard to introduce anything new; rather it builds on what was already laid out in the prequel and jumps right into the action. Slowly, but surely more pieces of the plot are revealed and in the process does a splendid job of fleshing out and developing character personalities. The former cast all make a return appearance, with the exception one new face, Misty, a cryogenically frozen girl who brings new energy to an already jam-packed and fun-filled group.  The strong cast of characters is what drives this anime to success. Using several character-centric episodes, we can clearly see how the characters grow and begin to apply the lessons they have learned about each other and themselves, to help one another in their fight for survival.The visuals have been improved and are as impressive as ever. GONZO a specialist in animation does not disappoint in this regard. Vandread: The Second Stage looks like a high budget OVA, showing considerable improvement over the First Stage with the nearly seamless integration of the CGI with its surroundings that remained consistent throughout the entire series. Not only do we have a great storyline, but one that looks good telling it.Similar to the first installment, The Second Stage, manages to stay fresh and funny. As the anime progressed the atmosphere begins to change as most of the comedy is dropped for a more serious, dramatic tone. Some viewers may not be particularly fond of the loss of humor, while, some might see it as a welcome change. In any case, what we have is an enthralling storyline full of twists and turns and breathtaking action sequences that most would find hard not to enjoy. Although, there may be a common complaint about The Second Stage's questionable conclusion which, not to say lacks any sort of finale, rather leaves a lot more to be desired.If you enjoyed, Vandread: The First Stage, than this an anime you will definitely not want to miss. The Second Stage is a worthy sequel that concludes the series on a high note packaged full of all the cheerful characters and all the space action you can handle. So, grab this anime, buckle up and enjoy the ride.Wriiten by AlterGenesis-XOct 11, 2005 Stage doesn't try too hard to introduce anything new; rather it builds on what was already laid out in the prequel and jumps right into the action.

I really like the core idea - far in the future, men and women live on different planets, having developed methods of living separately, considering each other enemies and not even remembering that they can have relations (friendship, love, sex, make children). Then when a few guys get on a women pirate space ship, they have to find their way of changing the ideals they have been risen with to learn to cooperate with women (and vice versa).Then there is the main evil - the Earth which has turned half-robotic and needs constant supply of fresh human bodies to live. This topic can be seen in a lot of other pieces (like Matrix for example), but they do not get into too much detail about it either. The core idea they succeed to prove here is that sacrificing your body and your life for the rest of your kind is only good when you make that decision yourself.The battles show a lot of courage and just feelings, so they make me feel happy. The other thing is the scientific aspect of combining robots which fight with swords, shooting with huge laser rays, making black holes and stuff. If you are a physicist like me it is best to ignore the small pieces when they try to explain how the devices work.Finally, the best part, best resembled in such pieces like onegai sensei, is the idea of overcoming your standstill, opening your eyes, starting to live your real life, living for the sake of both yourself and others.

The characters make a wide spectrum, from calm people like the scientist girl and the doctor to completely crazy people like Dita who loses her head because of love or Paiwey, who is always running around ruining peoples\' quiet moments together and making photos at the least suitable times. There is however 1 thing that joins all these people - somewhat sad and lonely past, and happiness of being together even though they sometimes fail to admit it.

The action was a lot more bombastic and fun, the characters actually developed in some interesting directions (even if some of them remained largely frustrating), and while some of the plots evoked S1 more than S2, it felt like there was genuine progression and a through-line to this season that was lacking in the first. It's far from perfect, but it did more than I was expecting, so at least there's more to like...here, albeit less than I really wanted out of this series. here, albeit less than I really wanted out of this series."", ""The Second Stage has a rather interesting plotline that follows the heroic crew of Nirvana as they struggle to fight past the Harvest fleet and reach their home planet. However, the numerous emotional turmoils they go through are a bit of a drag. The Harvest fleet has several new surprises in store for them, making it a tough battle. The anime tries to teach the deep significance of proving to oneself and others that there is a reason for one's existence, but it overdoes it with repetitive lessons that Hibiki keeps relearning. The love triangle between Hibiki and the girls Misty and Dita is downright...annoying and repetitive, and watching it is the hardest part of the anime.The show has quite a large cast of characters, but unfortunately, most of them are frustratingly annoying, especially the main characters, Hibiki and Dita. The rest of the characters were on a case-by-case basis, and there were some cool characters like the stoic ace pilot Meia and some funny ones like the silly girl with the frog puppet Paiway. One good thing is that several characters go through significant growth and character development in this season, especially Bart, who takes a stand and finds a reason to fight.In my opinion, this show failed to integrate CG into the action scenes effectively. While the lasers flying around looked somewhat cool, the overall execution seemed rather cheesy. Also, it was quite frustrating to see none of the Van pilots from Nirvana getting seriously hit despite so many lasers flying around. Although some of the Vandread combinations were impressive, most of them had a Power Rangers kind of feel. The character designs were unoriginal for the most part, and the animation seemed simplistic for a sci-fi fantasy anime.If you're a fan of sci-fi space anime, there are better shows out there with more engaging action and storylines. The romance aspect of this show is the most difficult part to watch. However, the show does well in developing minor characters, which makes it a fairly compelling drama.

Yozakura Quartet: Hoshi no Umi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8457/Yozakura_Quartet__Hoshi_no_Umi,"['I decided to watch ""Hoshi no Umi"" before watching ""Hana no Uta"" becuase people say it\'s a prequel. I was little scared at first because I\'ve watched the previous Yozakura Quarter series and it had quite different character designs. At first I hated new ones but at the second sight I realised they\'re still really great.So on to the actual review:""Everyone says the starry night sky is beautiful.""To Azuma Rin starry night sky was something that she hated the most in the whole world. Why? You need to watch those 3 episodes to know because Rin is the real main character here!Story 8/10Story starts...really fast and viewer can feel somewhat lost in all those characters and places. I heard that 4 first volumes of manga weren\'t animated, so it may be  a good choice to read them first (I can\'t read manga online because of my eyes).When I finally remembered most of the characters and met some new ones I really enjoyed the story. There was a lot of funny moments, especially with Yue and all her bears but you can find plenty serious scenes too.Pacing of the story is really well too, I mean you won\'t get bored but you will get some slower moments too.Art 7/10Overall art wasn\'t that bad. We got nice character designs, vibrant colours and detailed (but static!) backgrounds.Animation and art in opening is top-notch.The thing I didn\'t like was details.. no I mean LACK of details. Sometimes we were getting beutiful detailed eyes and second later we had seen the same eyes that looked like just 2 dots of colour. Nothing nice.Animation was crappy sometimes too. It looked like it was having lags.Sound 6/10Why ""only"" 6? Because there is some music but you will notice it mostly at the end when some nice piano background-song is playing. Other than that I noticed a lot of quiet moments that could use some fast-paced action music because I think action scenes beg for some good sound.. really.Opening is really nice (but english of those singers is not) and voice acting too. I loved Zakuro\'s voice because she had mean and slutty voice as well as good and calm (TOO CALM) one too.Character 8/103 episodes are not too much to meet SO MANY characters and I really mean MANY.Nurse, youkais, hanyou, some strange little boy, his maid, Enjou (??), demon hunters and MUCH MUCH more.I was overwhelmed by their numbers but I loved each of them. They all have different characters and that\'s something nice to see.Enjoyment 9/10I enjoyed this short series a lot. I laughed at Yue\'s bear moments and was sad when watching scenes with Rin. I loved the ending too and all this stuff with ""starry night"".Overall 8/10 (7,6)8 matches here because it\'s Very Good. Really.

Sketchbook: Full Color's,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2942/Sketchbook__Full_Colors,"[""Every once in a while, you just need to relax, chill and wach something easy. That's when Sketchbook is perfect. It doesn't hve a lot of humor, and the story is, well, not a story. The animation quality isn't anything outstanding either. What catched me when I watched Sketchbook was how calm and quiet it was. And of course, the cats! If you like cats, that's a reason in itself to give Sketchbook a try.Story-wise, it just follows an episode-by-episode formula, with each new episode bringing abotu an event totally unrelated to what happened in earlier episodes. Each episode is very tranquil, and the pacing...is very slow, but as I said earlier, it's perfect when you just need to relax, either because you've been very stressed or because you've watched some heavy anime earlier.The artwork isn't especially detailed or vivid, but it's not directly bad either. I think the best description of it is &quot;average&quot;.Soundtrack-wise, Sketchbook is fairly good. I rarely notice the soundtrack, but when I do, it was some good piano pieces I heard. It fits right in with the calm mood of the series, so that's a plus. The first OP theme is very good though, and the same goes for the ED. I'll keep them for times I'll need something calming to listen to. The voice acting is great, too, and they manage to keep the calm tone of the series in their voice acting.I loved the characters though, and they're very colorful. Since it's a slice of life anime, don't expect a lot of character development, but the varied and colorful cast may cover enough up for this since it's just a 13-episode series.All in all, there's nothing spectacular about the series, but if you watch it at the right time (when you need some relaxation), you'll probably enjoy it anyway.To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) is very slow, but as I said earlier, it's perfect when you just need to relax, either because you've been very stressed or because you've watched some heavy anime earlier.The artwork isn't especially detailed or vivid, but it's not directly bad either.

First if you are someone who needs action and a story driven series to keep you entertained, Sketchbook is not your kind of show.  This is a very slow and methodical slice of life series that will have you feeling at ease and relaxed.. or asleep depending on the episode you’re viewing.Almost the first thing I am reminded of when viewing Sketchbook is Aria, and rightly so as they were both produced by the same studio.  There are even several appearances...of Aria characters in the series.  But even though Aria had the same sort of pacing as Sketchbook does, this series feels more disjointed and inconsistent.  Some episodes are humorous and nostalgic feeling, the one that I probably felt the most emotional connection with was towards the end when Sora is home sick.  I found it fascinating how some things, such as the boredom of lying in bed and the things one imagines or thinks about transcend culture and language.  However this was not the case in many of the others.  Slice of life tends to always walk the line between soothing and being boring.  When we look at our own lives, how exciting really is most of the things that happen to you during the day?The characters also hurt the series.  They just aren't that interesting.  In this genre the characters have to be strong to carry the lack of plot and action but I didn’t really find myself carrying all that much for any of them.  Sora is the lead, she is a painfully shy girl who borders on complete anthropophobia.  She can’t even so much as say her name to people she has just met and only finds any level of comfort with people she has known a while.  She does make a breakthrough at the end of the series so in that sense that was good to see.  The rest of her personality doesn’t make her all that much more interesting.  That’s not to say she isn’t very sweet and moe, but really her only other character attributes is her love of cats and sketching and the blissful state she enters when drinking her favorite tea.  The rest of the cast is pretty much just as socially awkward and strange.  Many of them feel like they have some very deep seeded emotional issues.  They grow on you a little by the end as only a cast of complete lunatics can.  Most of the comedic moments revolve around the non human members of the cast, the group of cats that Sora is so fond of.  As characters the cats are probably the most interesting the show has to offer.From a voice acting and music standpoint, Sketchbook is truly brilliant.  The music is outstanding, the songs are so beautiful and serene that I think I could have listened to them all day.  The art is very inconsistent.  Many of the backgrounds are really beautiful and the colors are vibrant, but when it comes to the characters themselves most of them look dull and boring.  Individually characters like Sora sometimes look great but at others she doesn’t look good at all.  Some of the character models are downright ugly.  I do give the artists this though, these characters were probably the most realistic in terms of bodies than any series I have seen.  No impossibly short miniskirts, fantastic busts, and waist lines a runway model would kill for.Overall if you like the slice of life then this might be worth your time.  Those of you didn’t like Aria you won’t like this one either.  If you did, then this could be your cup of tea.  For someone who has seen neither and wants to sample the genre, then I would recommend you check out Aria instead. of Aria characters in the series.  But even though Aria had the same sort of pacing as Sketchbook does, this series feels more disjointed and inconsistent.  Some episodes are humorous and nostalgic feeling, the one that I probably felt the most emotional connection with was towards the end when Sora is home sick.  I found it fascinating how some things, such as the boredom of lying in bed and the things one imagines or thinks about transcend culture and language.  However this was not the case in many of the others.  Slice of life tends to always walk the line between soothing and being boring.  When we look at our own lives, how exciting really is most of the things that happen to you during the day?The characters also hurt the series.  They just aren't that interesting.  In this genre the characters have to be strong to carry the lack of plot and action but I didn’t really find myself carrying all that much for any of them.  Sora is the lead, she is a painfully shy girl who borders on complete anthropophobia.  She can’t even so much as say her name to people she has just met and only finds any level of comfort with people she has known a while.  She does make a breakthrough at the end of the series so in that sense that was good to see.  The rest of her personality doesn’t make her all that much more interesting.  That’s not to say she isn’t very sweet and moe, but really her only other character attributes is her love of cats and sketching and the blissful state she enters when drinking her favorite tea.  The rest of the cast is pretty much just as socially awkward and strange.  Many of them feel like they have some very deep seeded emotional issues.  They grow on you a little by the end as only a cast of complete lunatics can.  Most of the comedic moments revolve around the non human members of the cast, the group of cats that Sora is so fond of.  As characters the cats are probably the most interesting the show has to offer.From a voice acting and music standpoint, Sketchbook is truly brilliant.  The music is outstanding, the songs are so beautiful and serene that I think I could have listened to them all day.  The art is very inconsistent.  Many of the backgrounds are really beautiful and the colors are vibrant, but when it comes to the characters themselves most of them look dull and boring.  Individually characters like Sora sometimes look great but at others she doesn’t look good at all.  Some of the character models are downright ugly.  I do give the artists this though, these characters were probably the most realistic in terms of bodies than any series I have seen.  No impossibly short miniskirts, fantastic busts, and waist lines a runway model would kill for.Overall if you like the slice of life then this might be worth your time.  Those of you didn’t like Aria you won’t like this one either.  If you did, then this could be your cup of tea.  For someone who has seen neither and wants to sample the genre, then I would recommend you check out Aria instead."", ""Ok, by now i've been thinking about what to write for about 30 minutes already. The same was when i was trying to write a review for Aria. I simply do not know what to say.Might as well explain the ratings ...1 for story as it had no story. While Aria the Natural had a different story every episode, this one has none. It's easier to add those mini-stories to Aria because of it's sci-fi elements. Adding that to a bunch of students' everyday life is hard.9 for art because i loved it. Again, similarities to Aria can be seen.10 for sound. The ED songs...are made by Makino Yui, the same voice actress who made the OP songs for Aria. Great, calming music. The OP songs of Sketchbook were so good that i decided not to skip the opening sequence (i usually do).9 for character - THERE ARE TALKING CATS HERE !! Yes, that's right, talking cats.Anyways, this one is rated so high because the variety of characters in the art club is rather wide. They are all unique (except Ryou and Fuu who seem like the same person :P). And of course the cats, can't forget the cats.I won't be doing any in-depth character analysis, you will see more about them when you watch it.10 for enjoyment since there is no other option here. I'm a solid fan of the slice of life genre, watching these series is truly relaxing, especially after a hard day at work.9.5 Overall. I'm not counting the story part in here. Sketchbook is highly recommended to slice of life fans. It won't disappoint you :)I hope this review turns out helpful to at least one person, that'd make my efforts worthwhile .. are made by Makino Yui, the same voice actress who made the OP songs for Aria.

What made the show interesting for me was the main character Sora's and other characters opinion and perspectives on life. I like that everyone in the show sees things differently and I felt that this was something that made the story unique. Because of the lack of interesting story, I was already anticipating slow paced story telling and plot. Honestly though that slow pacing really made the...show all the more enjoyable. This is because I got to understand the characters more. It was relaxing in a way and lastly I was able to get to know their back stories and why they each like what they are talented at. Overall I gave the story 8/10 simply because it's enjoyable if you have the right amount of patience to sit through it.Character 8.0/10Now, with the characters, I liked almost all of them. I do not have any complaints or anything that I would want to see change from them. I believe that each character played their role perfectly and help bring some sort of comfort and enjoyment to the story. Sora of course is my favorite of the bunch. This is mainly due to the fact that she is a bit of an airhead, very spacey, and as mentioned earlier she has a very unique perspective of life both in and out of school. I also mentioned earlier that the characters have their own unique personalities which makes for an interesting cast. Overall I was very impressed with the characters and wouldn't want to see anything changed.Animation 7.0/10Nothing too special with animation. Sketchbook is presented with generic late 2000 animation, decent considering it's time of release however, I personally felt like it had a more early 2000's look to it perhaps 2001-2002-ish visuals. Either way, it was still pleasant to watch and appealing enough for me to enjoy. Character designs were also pretty good. Some of the characters were a bit odd... but I managed to pull through.Soundtrack 8.0/10As mentioned in lots of my other reviews I am a sucker for pianos. As a keyboard/pianist it's sort of self explanatory. The music in the show has a great relaxing feeling to it. The piano songs in the background help  enhance not only the mood of me (the watcher) but also it helps reflect what the characters are doing as well as the mood.  Voice acting was pretty good too. Lots of the voice actors did an amazing job with their roles. The opening song is my favorite thing about the soundtrack though. It's very peaceful and relaxing. It's sort of like the embodiment of the show. It really represents what to expect from the story and characters. I actually don't have too much to add on the subject of the soundtrack.... anyway I'd have to give it 8.0/10Enjoyment 9.0/10Overall, I loved Sketchbook. I felt like it fit my needs.

The show must retain the hallmarks of the genre (subtlety and atmosphere, among others) while still telling an interesting story. There is a thin line between a smart but subdued series and an absolute snorefest. With its quirky sense of humor, fun plot, and loveable cast of characters, Sketchbook ~full color'S~ is...a fine example of an anime series that is clearly on the better side of this line, managing to avoid common pitfalls and excelling in entertainment.Narrated by Sora, a bashful high school student, Sketchbook focuses upon the daily adventures of her and the art club that she belongs to. Sora's shy nature nudges her out of the spotlight and places her in the role of an observer, allowing us to see the world through her eyes. This world is one full of smiling friends, suspiciously-intelligent street cats, and fascinating subject matter worthy of being immortalized in pencil lead. Sora's perspective manages to make any situation worthwhile; while there are occasional lulls in the story, Sketchbook is largely devoid of dull moments.Sketchbook is enjoyable not only for Sora's refreshing outlook on life, but also for the contributions that the show's sizeable supporting cast makes to every episode. Each character has something to add to the story, whether it is in the form of the ambitious plots of Ms. Kasugano, the chicken-obsessed teacher of the art club, the gross misunderstandings of Japanese language and culture by Kate, a Canadian exchange student, or the downright bizarre sense of humor of Ryou and Fuu, two older students who rarely even attend the club meetings. Each one of Sora's friends has a well-defined personality. Nobody is simply placed into this series to take up space.Sketchbook is almost flawlessly executed. The plot, the characters, and the pacing of the series are all presented in an easy to swallow thirteen episodes that remain fresh throughout their run. There is nothing spectacular or life-changing about Sketchbook, but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, earning it a very strong &quot;7&quot; rating. a fine example of an anime series that is clearly on the better side of this line, managing to avoid common pitfalls and excelling in entertainment.Narrated by Sora, a bashful high school student, Sketchbook focuses upon the daily adventures of her and the art club that she belongs to.

All over we're seeing a boom of series about cute girls who really do nothing at all, but a relaxed atmosphere and endearing characters make the show enjoyable. The problem is, when one tries too hard for a relaxed atmosphere, one can often end up being boring. Likewise, when one tries too hard to make endearing characters, they just end up being stupid. Sketchbook did both.In a multitude of anime set in school settings without any visible plot, Sketchbook simply does not do enough to differentiate itself from the mixture. Activities that consist of &quot;plot&quot;...are too dull to constitute a call to attention. Apparent the art club supervisor (vicariously through the staff) is too cheap to take these kids anywhere, so the boring lifeless school is constantly the backdrop. What could be exciting sketching excursions are dulled thanks to this never-ending scenery. This is further backed up when we get snippets in which the various cats that appear throughout the series have their own stories. As they wander about town and interact, it is far more exciting than watching the actual main characters.This is mostly because the cats at least have some passion for life. Main character Sora might as well be a stick in the background. Though there are attempts to give her personality some needed quirkiness, none of these efforts do anything to make her more interesting. Moreso, she is pracitcally mute for the duration of the series, communicating with people she knows entirely through her sketchbook. This is cute for about one episode, maybe two, and then you realize this is who you're going to follow around for 10 more episodes. Her friends don't help much either. One has a personality relegated to talking through and with puppets, and the other is just as bland as Sora. A multitiude of other supporting characters, including the criminally underused Kate, show up on occasion but none are ever developed so really everyone in this show is ultimately a waste of any possible potential.The animation likewise does not fit the serene idea this series is trying to convey. It is simply too angular and broad to give an idea of tranquility. In addition, character designs are often too cartoonish to be taken seriously. We're talking characters who look like they're in a permanent SD reaction. It's not only distracting but also annoying.Though a lot of talented seiyuu worked on this, it really feels like a waste of their efforts. No one shines or does anything remotely of interest with the rare and thankful exception of Kate, as performed by Yuko Goto, who is pitch-perfect in a delivery that sounds identical to an actual North American person trying to speak Japanese properly. The OST is nothing to scream about either. Ocean sounds are more interesting than the dull and lifeless BGM. Yui Makino did provide a decent ED song though.In summary, a slice-of-life show cannot support itself without interesting characters or an interesting setting. If you don't have one, the other, or both, you are left with a show about nothing that has no reason to be. Sketchbook is such a show. Personally, I greatly enjoy the subgenre so I could stand it, but I cannot forgive it. Though it is somewhat saved by the cats and Kate, there's far better of it out there than this.

It\'s awesome.The cast breaks the typical slice-of-life formula of picking 10-15 archetypical characters (moé, tsundere, tsubokki, et c.) and throwing them together. While each character has a little detail on his/her personality that makes him/her unique, Sketchbook ~full color\'S~ has only one character whose personality falls into an archetypal category.While there is little, if any, of a plot, Sora\'s thoughts, which give sort of a ""base"" for the way in which the events are portrayed in the show, are full of poetry and common wisdom, and the show is very slow-paced and tranquil. That\'s why, despite...of not having a major plot, I gave an 8 to the show stories.The music (25 songs for a show that\'s only 13 eps. long... wow!) is charming, specially the songs Sketchbook wo Motta Mama (the ED) and Chiisana Shiawase (a song played in ep 10, with European reminiscences). They fit very well with the gorgeous landscapes which depict so masterfully the wonderful world in which the girls live in, that I consider them to be a masterpiece by themselves.Even though it has no major plot, the show is so enjoyable I\'d kill for seeing a sequel to this. 9.5/10. of not having a major plot, I gave an 8 to the show stories.The music (25 songs for a show that\'s only 13 eps. long... wow!) is charming, specially the songs Sketchbook wo Motta Mama (the ED) and Chiisana Shiawase (a song played in ep 10, with European reminiscences).

However, one day I stumbled over a show that was so completely different from everything else I had ever seen that I could not help but be fascinated by it. That show was Sketchbook ~full colors~ and it belongs to what is known as the Iyashikei genre.The goal of all art is to emotionally...connect with the audience. This is reflected in the names of genres like “romance”, “thriller” or “horror”. For action shows the feeling that is meant to be conveyed is the excitement of a fight and the triumph in it. For Iyashikei it is the direct opposite, it is meant to be the least exciting, but that doesn’t mean “boring”. Instead, Iyashikei is meant to convey feelings of comfort and relaxation. And as its name (meaning “healing type” in japanese) suggests, it is something you can watch to reduce the stress from your job or other sources. You could almost fault Japanese society for having to bring something like this forth, but I find the absence of titles trying to enable similar emotions in other countries even more remarkable. The biggest comparison I could find are things like nature documentaries or The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross, but neither are narrative stories.Iyashikei shows aren’t completely devoid of conflict, but the problems that arise are usually minor and relatively quickly resolved. In Sketchbook for example we follow Sora Kajiwara, a first grader that joins the art club at her school where the biggest issue is that one of her upperclassmen perhaps shouts a bit too much, and cats don’t lie still long enough for her to draw their toes.With a light jazz soundtrack and beautiful watercolor backgrounds depicting Fukuoka’s countryside, the show is just endlessly relaxing, while at the same time able to retain the attention of the viewer through small comedic moments enabled by a surprisingly vast roster of more than twenty recurring named characters, far outnumbering most other shows of its type. Primary focus is on Sora and her closer circle of friends, but interactions with other characters often occur and are interesting for their own sake and without it being overwhelming. It also includes a group of alley cats that get their own episodes to highlight how their group deals with things such as a new cat arriving in the neighborhood, with them given voices through the magic of film.In particular I want to highlight the fourth episode. Here the art club had planned to go on a nature walk with opportunities to draw, but most members skip out on it due to a bad weather forecast. Sora ends up alone with Nagisa, a tomboyish girl who likes insects, and shows Sora and the viewer small details like butterflies hiding under tree leafs to avoid the rain. Though the episode is mostly drenched in dull grays due to the weather, it is nevertheless enjoyable throughout.I would classify Sketchbook as a particularly pure example of the Iyashikei genre, as even the comedy bits that are sprinkled in are very light and don’t disrupt the overall tone, whereas many other series that have also received the Iyashikei label are much more high strung, just with a rural and/or low-stakes environment. Sketchbook on the other hand has one single goal it fulfills to the best of its ability: Radiate tranquility.Sketchbook is unfortunately nowadays largely forgotten, with less than 30,000 people having seen it on MAL. Perhaps it was a bit overshadowed by the similarly titled Hidamari Sketch which was released about nine months earlier and with which it also shares elements such as the main characters being art students and both series based on yon-koma manga. Sketchbook unfortunately did not have the benefit of sequels or a studio with a cult following. I also love Hidamari Sketch, but I would classify it more as a straight up comedy and it just doesn’t quite scratch the same itch. And even then, the viewership numbers of Hidamari are still only about 10% of what a popular show racks up nowadays.If Sketchbook has one remarkable thing going for it, it’s being one of Seiyuu superstar Kana Hanazawa’s first main character roles, giving voice to Sora’s delightful idiosyncrasies. Sora is perhaps an oddball and it is rare to see “the quiet one” being the main character of a show, but she is also very entertainingly portrayed through her inner monologue and HanaKana is of course excellent in her role. The show also features great voice acting talent beyond her in supporting roles.Though Sketchbook admittedly does not boast many outwardly appealing qualities that lend themselves to draw in a large audience, it has been something I have repeatedly returned to. It is my personal comfort, and something I am always willing to watch in order to take my mind off work. I would particularly recommend it if you have enjoyed shows like Yuru Camp or Super Cub. Even if I was not able to convince you to give the show a chance, I certainly hope that you will find a show that gives you as much comfort as Sketchbook was able to give me throughout these years. connect with the audience.

This is my first review, so please, don't be too harsh on me.So, what do we have here? Sketchbook ~full color's~ is a typical slice-of-life show. Nothing more, nothing less. If you are a fan of this genre then you can skip the following text and just watch it. If you are not so sure about whether or whether not watching this, go ahead.Story - 5/10Yep, many people will think: Wow, 5 points is not that great, right? I think 5 points are very appropriate because, well, the story is almost non-existent. The main protagonist is Kajiwara...Sora, a rather shy student, who is a member of her school's artclub and has an affection for cats. We follow her through her every-day 'adventures', like going shopping, having a cold or stuff like that. That's about it. Tihe view sometimes changes from Sora to one of her friends or to the cats (yes, the cats) but neither of them helps developing a clear storyline. Even if it's common for slice-of-life shows not to have a real story, it's still a minus-point.Character - 9/10Let's commence from the shows weakest point to its biggest strength: The character design. It's simply awesome. Each of the characters has their own strange and funny traits, which make them unique. There is Hazuki, who is crazy for every big deal at the local convenience store, Aso, who uses her hand-puppets to speak or Kasugano, the crazy teacher of the art-club who has a thing for chicken. There are some Archetypes, though. The reliable president of the art-club or the outspacing senpai made me feel like I have seen them somewhere before. Same goes for Kate, the foreign transfer-student, although it doesn't make her less funny. She is great and her trying to use Kanji in almost every situation possible ended up in some of the funniest gags in this show.Last but not least, there are the cats. The cats can speak (among themselves of course) and their conversations are the highlights of the show.There is also some nice character development (especially for Sora, who changes throughout the series), but the other characters feel a bit left out.Overall, 9 of 10 points. The character design is one of the main reasons to watch this show.Art - 8/10The art of Sketchbook was really nice. Since most of the show is somehow related to the art-club there were lots of situations, where you can see the sketches or pictures the characters are drawing or you witness together with Sora some beautiful animated things like the blooming of the cherry blossoms, a firework or a sunny autumn afternoon. Those nature impressions are the strong points of this shows style. The animation is on a constant level throughout the course of the series, the quality isn't dropping anywhere.The animation quality isn't outstanding but it's solid and it fits the show pretty well. The characters look nice and that's about all. Nothing more, nothing less. Sketchbook ~full color'S~ isn't the most beautiful show out there but the combination of the art-club theme and the steady animation quality makes me give this show 8 out of 10 pointsSound - 7/10Like the whole show, the soundtrack is rather slow paced. The Opening and Ending are sung by Kyoura Natsumi (OP) and Makino Yui (ED) accompanied by a acoustic guitar. The songs are very fitting. There is a different opening in one of the later episodes, as well as a different ending.The BGM is nothing special, just some piano-chords here, some acoustic guitar there, nothing outstanding after all. A calm soundtrack, just like the rest of the series.Apart from the music, the chosen Seiyuu were great. Every character had a voice matching it's character traits. Personally, I liked Hanazawa Kana (as Sora) and Goto Yuko best. Goto isn't one of my favorite Seiyuu (I've found her annoying as Hikari in Special A) but she is awesome as Kate with her overpronounced Japanese. Hanazawa Kana has a very unique voice and everytime I heard her voice somewhere, I was reminded of Sora.Enjoyment - 7/10The series was fun after all. I've often found myself watching it after coming home from a long work-day. You won't be enjoying it, if you looking for something with lots of action in it. Sketchbook is very, very slow-paced. Sometimes a bit too slow-paced in my opinion. There were some parts, where I had to try hard not to fall asleep but most of the time the series was interesting enough to keep me from closing my eyes. If you are looking for a relaxing show, Sketchbook will be your choice.Overall - 7/10The show wasn't bad but it wasn't outstanding either. Sketchbook ~full color'S~ is a nice, slow-paced slice-of-life show with nice animation, awesome characters almost everyone can relate to and a good soundtrack. You are searching for a complex story? Skip this anime. You are looking for some crazy action? Skip this anime. You want to watch likeable characters living their own little lives? Watch Sketchbook right now! Sora, a rather shy student, who is a member of her school's artclub and has an affection for cats. We follow her through her every-day 'adventures', like going shopping, having a cold or stuff like that. That's about it. Tihe view sometimes changes from Sora to one of her friends or to the cats (yes, the cats) but neither of them helps developing a clear storyline. Even if it's common for slice-of-life shows not to have a real story, it's still a minus-point.Character - 9/10Let's commence from the shows weakest point to its biggest strength: The character design. It's simply awesome. Each of the characters has their own strange and funny traits, which make them unique. There is Hazuki, who is crazy for every big deal at the local convenience store, Aso, who uses her hand-puppets to speak or Kasugano, the crazy teacher of the art-club who has a thing for chicken. There are some Archetypes, though. The reliable president of the art-club or the outspacing senpai made me feel like I have seen them somewhere before.

It\'s like trying to write a review of the sunset over the ocean or the wind through the trees. They make you feel great just by being there, but \'being there\' is all they do.And that\'s Sketchbook. It is the leaves changing colors in autumn, the snow falling, new growth in spring and a warm sun in the summer. Watching it fills you with a sense of calm and innocence that brings you back to your childhood (assuming you\'ve left it).It presents the sort of soft, gentle, dream-like atmosphere that will make you feel...like you\'re on a bed full of pillows and kittens, even if you\'re watching it on a wicker chair. The music is made up of soft guitar riffs and sentimental piano pieces and is a great compliment to the innocence of the anime.Atmosphere.But what would an atmosphere be without a great cast of characters? This is where Sketchbook becomes a masterpiece. The lead, Sora, will turn your heart to mush with her free-spirited innocence and adorable facial expressions. Even though she is lost in her own world and shy, she ends up joining an art club and gradually opening up. The art club is full of completely crazy (in an innocent way) students that, like Sora, have their own little loveable quirks. I especially liked Kuga-senpai and her curtain, and those two delightfully creepy girls that have their own theme song.The cats in the neighborhood are just plain awesome, and when I learned that kitty introductions include their charm points I actually said ""kawaii~"" out loud.There are many supporting characters, none of which feel like side characters at all. The majority get their own episode and they are all well-developed. To top it all off, the voice acting (Japanese) is top-notch. This all makes for quite a high replay value. I can\'t tell you how many times i\'ve watched the first episode over and over again just to see those two girls\' nursery rhyme about catgrass!I\'ll admit that i\'m a bit biased. This anime matches my tastes perfectly and pulls all my strings. I\'d imagine some might find the slow pacing hard to deal with and view it as a sleep inducer. If you watch anime for fights and explosions, this isn\'t the anime for you!If that wasn\'t enough, this anime has zero fanservice or ecchi! It is completely innocent.Although I feel like this anime\'s appeal is highly subjective, I give it a rare 10. Could it be any better? It doesn\'t have to be.

The true story of this manga is of the feelings that come and go, Sora's and the other characters', as they go through the most sensitive period of their lives.In other words, this is a slice of life manga of the most sweet and delicate kind.

An anime about nothing specific, just your normal slice of life anime with every episode telling you a new story. It focuses a lot on the natural aesthetics of nature, and also something that I found fairly interesting, and that is the slight hints of austism found in the main character, Sora Kajiwara.Let's start with the basics. As mentioned before, every episode provides you with a brand new story to tell you about a new day. With that being said, as a slice of...life anime it comes with little to no progression in the story as the episodes rarely depends on each other for new storytelling. You don't expect the characters to develop too much and you don't expect any unpredicted things to happen.Here's the thing with this series: It's not predictable at all. And here's the other thing: There IS some character development.This review is going to be spoiler free, so I won't talk about exactly HOW the characters develop in such a short slice of life anime, but it isn't really noticable until the last few episodes. Especially the last one. The first few episodes were relatively slow for me and I really had to strain myself to find relevant keypoints in the series and note them down. Then, around episode 4, this series really started to really catch my full attention. For what purpose? It's something that I mentioned before that I could probably dedicate an entire essay to, but I will keep it fairly short. That is the hints and play och autism found in Sora. How?The name of the anime makes is relatively obvious that it is mainly centered around the element of art and drawing. Sora Kajiwara carries a sketchbook around with her in every episode, making it a very meaningful keypoint worth noting in the series as it appears more than twice. In episode 4, a firework festival (Hanabi) is taking place and while the main character and her friends stop to watch the fireworks, you'll notice that she takes out her sketchbook to draw. She plans to draw the fireworks. But fireworks are temporary and only lasts for a few seconds at most. We see the building distress in the main character as she isn't able to memorize any of the fireworks to sketch.This is a very common trait among those with light to severe autism. They have an interest that is like a burning passion, and become distressed and anxious when it doesn't work out. We see a similar situation, although not as strong, in episode 1 where the main character is drawing a portrait of a cat laying in front of her. She doesn't show the same amount of distress when it's not working out as with the fireworks, but it's still present.Another thing I found very interesting on a positive note was the very realistic portrayal of social anxiety. The animation of the expressions may fool the concept of it being realisticly portrayed, but this is coming from someone who actually suffers from social anxiety and the expressions in the series is actually a very good visual of how one may feel in certain situations. The main character is intended to show traits of being extremly shy, but I personally feel that she express so much more than just plain shyness. She shows clear signs of not being able to talk to a stranger at all. She shows how one may feel in certain situations (for example, how many of you wants to dive down in a hole when a store clerk decides to make your shopping a little more uncomfortable?).Let's go over the art. The art is average in my personal opinion, but still so very fitting to the story, not to talk about the whole genre itself. It's nothing too special, but it doesn't have to be. The freshness of the colours give the perfect vibe that describes the series itself. The design of the characters are so very fitting for the story and sometimes can even be seen as very cute.The opening is by far one of the best keypoints in the anime. The song is nothing special by itself, but combine it with the elements of the series and you'll get a combined masterpiece. It gives out the perfect vibe for what to expect. But for the soundtrack by itself that is played out through the series? Nothing special. Many of the scores were replayed too many times in one episode and it was something that bored me. If you're a fan of simplified piano octaves being replayed then you might think of the music differently, though.So overall:Story - 6Art - 6Sound - 5Character - 7Enjoyment - 7In conclusion, it was definitely not a waste of time. life anime it comes with little to no progression in the story as the episodes rarely depends on each other for new storytelling.

I feel that many of the usual tropes didn\'t get used, and it felt a bit refreshing.Something I adored was the MC´s (Kajiwara, Sora) Development, and that a lot of the time she has an...internal monologue for us. Probably the strongest point of the writing and sound design. The other characters succeed in being funny and not too tropey. But one character seems to have been left out till the last episode though and was just there for a scene, maybe this was intended to have a sequel or to hook you into reading the 4-koma.The sound is saved by this and good music choices. BUT several times in the anime the recording environment must have been off, and the VA´s sound like they are talking into cans. this should not put you off, but is a saddening mistake as its mostly fine otherwise.The art, for an anime released 2007, is pretty good and it gets you in the cute laid-back mood of the anime, but it doesn\'t do anything special that the ""moeblob"" style hasn\'t done before.

Personally, I found that it gave an older vibe with its animation, perhaps a style in the early 2000s.

Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - Exodus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17080/Soukyuu_no_Fafner__Dead_Aggressor_-_Exodus,"[""Made for mecha fans. Made for the old Fafner anime fans.For newbies do watch the old prequels before watching this or you'll have a hard time Google-ing for details.*the EXTENDED episode 1 is a must watch,further explanation makes everything in the first half more reasonable.Basically it's about mecha fighting. The plot is a continuation of last season(the old sequel and the movie) , sacrifice and peace.In the new season more people of the D Island have joined the pilot squad. They become stronger and gain new abilities to make them stand against the now-stronger silicon-liked monsters: Festum.The duo are back on their Fafners to...join the fight. And the old squad.The main point of the plot is still the interaction with the outside world-the remnants of humanity. And all the tragedies happen during the interaction.Just good-ol Fafner, if that's all you ask.The start-up of the show is kind of slow. Too much introduction is spent on the new guys. But the new guys are bland, compare to the still awesome and kicking-ass old squad.Little reference is made towards the prequels. Which is kind of good as it won't further stretch the thin and boring first half.But the magnificent ending of the first half overturns everything. The awesomeness of Kazuki and Soushi/Mark Sein and Mark Nicht overwhelmingly saves the series.The new Fafners are quite interesting on their own too. But what's more interesting is the price the new crew need to pay to pilot their uber-powerful Fafners to protect their Island.Honestly the graphics looks dated. When compare to the old prequel, the HD-remake-feeling is real, but below than average when compare to the new series. The character design is kind of ugly when something in Aldnoah.Zero comes into mind.The Fafners are still rocking well, it's just feeling old.Guess that what you will get when try to continue something from ten years ago, or budget?The soundtracks are awesome. Angela give their best again.Is it better than the epic Shangri-La and Separation? Never.Exist,the OP is typical Angela scream-Rock-and roll. Works everytime when the main guys are in action to kick some silicon arses. Just pure aweesomeness.The ED is average. Sad and emotional.Exodus is meant for fans of the original prequels.I see no point in making a sequel after so long but Xebec made it. And it's brilliant when Kazuki uses Mark Sein again. So kudos to them.And I don't think one should watch this before watching the old season 1 and Heaven and Earth movie. It's pointless as Exodus doesn't spend much time to explain the terminology and stuffs. Have fun Google-ing if you want to.Anyway it is an enjoyful season. Hope for more awesomeness on the second part of Exodus. join the fight. And the old squad.The main point of the plot is still the interaction with the outside world-the remnants of humanity.

Sad and emotional.Exodus is meant for fans of the original prequels.I see no point in making a sequel after so long but Xebec made it. And it's brilliant when Kazuki uses Mark Sein again. So kudos to them.And I don't think one should watch this before watching the old season 1 and Heaven and Earth movie.

As a result, your brain couldn't stand this. But fans certainly will be satisfied, because the intricate story is one of the main features of Fafner series.Art: The graphic has become much more detailed and technological comparing with the first season. The difference is enormous. Animators have tried to make the movie looks fantastic. But if you look at objects in the background, you will see the lack of details. The general style remains the same as in the first season.Characters:The focus is on the relationship between Kazuki and Misao.

There is a stronger thematic structure and a more focused plot.The story picks up two years after the end of the main series and while it doesn't take full advantage of this change to grow the characters, it still feels like they have settled into a new status quo. That said Heaven and Earth doesn't bother to properly reintroduce the returning characters. If you haven't seen the original series then this show won't make any sense. It doesn't bother re-explaining anything, from Fafners to Festums to Mirs. It's all...assuming you're already familiar with these concepts.The animation was a massive step up from the original series. The fights are incredibly dynamic and fluid. The overall quality massively improves upon everything. This movie still holds up today. None of the CG feels dated (if you were even able to spot it). That said it still has the same issue from the main series where all the character designs look very similar. That combined with the introduction of a few new characters and further focus on some lesser side characters from the original series meant there were a lot of new (but similar) faces to differentiate from.The characters were good, but nothing incredible. However the standout here was Kurusu, the new addition. His personal struggle is the heart of the movie, and it's well tied in to the themes and concepts the film focused on. A lot of the side characters had multiple separate arcs that arguably shouldn't have worked, but they were all tied together through the main theme of the cost of war, and it helped to paint the picture of war being a grand but ultimately futile struggle with a terrible toll - something that may not have had the same impact if it had focused on only a few main characters.Overall I'd say this is a must watch if you have seen the original series. If you haven't then this is hard to recommend. It comes with the price tag of having to watch through over a dozen episodes of mediocre garbage in the original series to get to this.

It is my second favorite genre of manga (office manga is still the best, though), especially if they also involve kids. Now, there is an anime within this genre!!

It's worth mentioning that this series delves into omegaverse themes, so if that's not your cup of tea, feel free to stop reading this review.

If you're open to seeing a BL manga being adapted into an animated show and intrigued by the concept, keep reading! A friend recommended it to me, sparking my interest. Yes, I'm not lying about that—I genuinely didn't know there was going to be an omegaverse anime and I am ashamed of that because like I said, it's one of my favorite genres. Admittedly, the first episode made me feel a bit awkward, perhaps because I'm more accustomed to reading manga with similar themes rather than watching them animated. Nonetheless, the addition of the baby character adds a nice touch to the series (as always). Overall, I'd rate it a 7 for now. While it's enjoyable, it's not the best of the best; I've encountered better BL stories with children that I would have rather seen animated instead.

There will always be a place in my heart for anime toddlers\U0001f979. Still, this show is such a sweet family story about raising your kid in the Omegaverse.The context: For people who don't know, the Omegaverse genre is basically an alternative universe with second gender called Alpha, Beta, and Omega. Basically, Alpha are top of the food chain, superior individuals; generally both male and female Alpha can impregnate. The opposite is true for omega who are considered inferior in society eyes & seen as sex objects because they have strong pheromones. Both male and female omega can get pregnant. They can...be paired with an Alpha by the act of nape biting, which help suppressed their pheromones. Betas are just stuck in the middle. In Omegaverse, most things are determined by this social hierarchy. Although, there exist the rare fated pair of Alpha and Omega who are basically each other's half. This chemistry transcends logic. It is a wild setting, but one that actually explores a lot of social prejudice and allow same sex couple the fantasy of pregnancy.The story: With that out of the way, I find Tadaima, Okaeri to be such a refreshing story. This genre is usually a bit twisted due to its premise, so seeing Alpha and Omega parent just happily raising their child was beautiful. The prejudice here is something our MCs face daily, but it felt closer to real life in how passive aggressive these interactions are. Yet there's also hope. The children are so cute and positive you just feel healed from watching the interactions.

It just exists. The first thing you’ll notice after watching this is that it\'s set in an omegaverse. This trope first came around as a trope for sexy times - which is non-existent in this anime as it appears to be a slice of life cutesy type. That’s fine, fluffy abo can exist. But tossing all the politics behind, there’s nothing revolutionary about this anime nor does it even do abo much justice. If you are here for the cute times and happy vibes, read no more of...this review, advert your eyes to a better paradise.There’s an inherently suffocating outdated Eastern idealism weaved through the entire plot, and it’s very hard to ignore. If you detached yourself from the abo, this is a Prince Charming and Cinderella story at its core. Hiromu comes from a rich well-off family who is the standard all well loving husband to his partner. Masaki is the poor (omega) looked down upon “Cinderella” who found a husband who is all accepting of his identity, in which he happily becomes a house husband for.

Your honour, is this just nuclear family value to get people to birth more babies in this declining baby birth rate economy? There isn’t much of this type of anime in the hetero setting nowadays because women would not eat this shit anymore, unless they are riddled with systematic housewife dreams, which there is nothing wrong with it by the way, but the predicament of being a housewife is very clear if you ever interacted with one.Masaki cannot escape this traditional concept either. He’s a good house husband and have doubts about his gender. Did he have a job before he met the rich husband? Does he have hobbies outside of looking after the baby? It’s all very surface level, they introduce the gender discrimination but never talk about it, as if they needed a “villain” aspect and that was the pick. It just sits there awkwardly like a pity factor.The anime is like backwards and forward at the same time. What’s worst is that Masaki’s own baby, who he birthed does not even call him dad! Baby keeps on calling him Ma-chan, is that because it sounds like mama? Are you afraid that if the baby called him “mom” it’ll be too stereotyping? But calling him “dad” will be too avant-garde, so you chose an option that even a normal family will find weird by addressing your parent by their name directly. (If Ma-chan is a real Japanese term kids call their mom, I apologise and take my ""addressing parent by their name"" comment back but my hetero point still stands). Masaki gets referenced as “yome”, “okusan” which is “wife” in Japanese, which by default assuming the omega gender is the women, can we ever escape the hetero nouns. The whole gender situation is also unclear in this universe, as alpha x alpha seems to be the norm, which means alphas will also have the ability to carry babies and do they refer to the alpha carrying the baby as the “wife”? Does that mean Hiromu could carry babies too?? I do find it amusing that Masaki considered committing eugenics in his second pregnancy for a split second, I didn’t know the feudal ideology “son(alpha) preference” they couldn’t kill in China is transferred over to omegaverse Japan.

I supposed a piece of omegaverse media that don\'t contain intercourse will have to advert the people\'s attention to logic.', '""Omegaverse, also known as A/B/O (an abbreviation for ""alpha/beta/omega""), is a subgenre of speculative erotic fiction, and originally a subgenre of erotic [homosexual] fan fiction. Its premise is that a dominance hierarchy exists in humans, which are divided into dominant ""alphas"", neutral ""betas"", and submissive ""omegas"". This hierarchy determines how people interact with one another in romantic, erotic and sexual contexts...Its main peculiarity is that characters have two sexes: a main one (male or female), decided by their external sexual organs, and a secondary one, that manifests during puberty, determined by their internal reproductive system...Between Alphas and Betas, only females can carry on a pregnancy,...but male Omegas are often envisaged as being able to become pregnant via a uterus connected to the rectum, and Alphas can impregnate regardless of their main gender.""- WikipediaI know, absolutely buck wild paragraph to open with, but this is absolutely necessary information if you are not in the know. If you happen to already know what the omegaverse is (like myself) I presume you skipped it to save you some time. Either way, welcome!Tadaima, Okaeri is, officially, the first omegaverse anime. The Omegaverse, despite being conceptualized and most popular in the west, has been a quite popular setting for manga for quite some time, and one has finally been adapted into an anime. Finally this subgenre of homosexual pregnancy kink erotica based on outdated wolf science has hit the silver screen!Except it hasn\'t, really. I would hardly call Tadaima, Okaeri ""omegaverse.""I may be being snide, but don\'t take this as a bashing of the omegaverse genre. Just the opposite, in fact. Though I found it strange at first, being as immersed in fandom culture as I am meant I soon found myself appreciating it beyond strange kinky erotica and into a perspective of worldbuilding, which Tadaima, Okaeri really does not seem all too concerned with. The social dynamics of alphas, betas, and omegas gets some screentime, however the biological aspects relating to the male pregnancy (and often female siring) are not present at all. It\'s mostly just a story about a young couple raising a family with omegaverse in the background.Weirdly enough, however, if an omegaverse work doesn\'t focus on worldbuilding, it\'s just there to be kinky, and that\'s not what Tadaima, Okaeri is either. Tadaima, Okaeri is actually *negative* kinky. It is one of the most wholesome, g-rated things I have ever seen.So what gives? Why include the omegaverse at all if not for the kink or for the worldbuilding? Maybe I could buy that it *was* for wolrdbuilding purposes, however the omegaverse aspects tend to be rather irrelevant, leaving me unsatisfied. It is such a unique genre of speculative fiction, barely including the elements of it is frustrating.And Tadaima, Okaeri isn\'t even a ""true"" omegaverse story, by the common definition.Now, omegaverse is a folksonomy, so there is no one way to do the omegaverse. Every omegaverse writer will have their own take on it, some sticking to the very traditional ideas of it, and some not. This is one of those that does not. In fact, it\'s so far removed from omegaverse tradition that omega males aren\'t defined by their ability to carry children (and usually alpha females by their ability to sire them), but rather everyone appears to be some degree of intersex and can both carry and sire children---if I had to wager a guess, anyways; they don\'t really explain it. I say this because it also lacks the *other* key factor of the omegaverse: omega/alpha relationships. Or, rather, the main couple is an omega and an alpha, however that is not the norm.

And it does not embrace its bizarre genre enough. but male Omegas are often envisaged as being able to become pregnant via a uterus connected to the rectum, and Alphas can impregnate regardless of their main gender.""- WikipediaI know, absolutely buck wild paragraph to open with, but this is absolutely necessary information if you are not in the know. If you happen to already know what the omegaverse is (like myself) I presume you skipped it to save you some time. Either way, welcome!Tadaima, Okaeri is, officially, the first omegaverse anime. The Omegaverse, despite being conceptualized and most popular in the west, has been a quite popular setting for manga for quite some time, and one has finally been adapted into an anime. Finally this subgenre of homosexual pregnancy kink erotica based on outdated wolf science has hit the silver screen!Except it hasn\'t, really. I would hardly call Tadaima, Okaeri ""omegaverse.""I may be being snide, but don\'t take this as a bashing of the omegaverse genre. Just the opposite, in fact. Though I found it strange at first, being as immersed in fandom culture as I am meant I soon found myself appreciating it beyond strange kinky erotica and into a perspective of worldbuilding, which Tadaima, Okaeri really does not seem all too concerned with. The social dynamics of alphas, betas, and omegas gets some screentime, however the biological aspects relating to the male pregnancy (and often female siring) are not present at all. It\'s mostly just a story about a young couple raising a family with omegaverse in the background.Weirdly enough, however, if an omegaverse work doesn\'t focus on worldbuilding, it\'s just there to be kinky, and that\'s not what Tadaima, Okaeri is either. Tadaima, Okaeri is actually *negative* kinky. It is one of the most wholesome, g-rated things I have ever seen.So what gives? Why include the omegaverse at all if not for the kink or for the worldbuilding? Maybe I could buy that it *was* for wolrdbuilding purposes, however the omegaverse aspects tend to be rather irrelevant, leaving me unsatisfied. It is such a unique genre of speculative fiction, barely including the elements of it is frustrating.And Tadaima, Okaeri isn\'t even a ""true"" omegaverse story, by the common definition.Now, omegaverse is a folksonomy, so there is no one way to do the omegaverse. Every omegaverse writer will have their own take on it, some sticking to the very traditional ideas of it, and some not. This is one of those that does not. In fact, it\'s so far removed from omegaverse tradition that omega males aren\'t defined by their ability to carry children (and usually alpha females by their ability to sire them), but rather everyone appears to be some degree of intersex and can both carry and sire children---if I had to wager a guess, anyways; they don\'t really explain it. I say this because it also lacks the *other* key factor of the omegaverse: omega/alpha relationships. Or, rather, the main couple is an omega and an alpha, however that is not the norm. Rather, alphas are expected to marry other alphas, omegas other omegas, and betas other betas.I...hesitate to even call Tadaima, Okaeri an omegaverse story, as it lacks the two things that define omegaverse: omega males possessing the unique ability to carry children by alphas, thus leading to alpha/omega relationships.However, I\'m not the president of omegaverse so I can\'t define it.

Tottemo! Luckyman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3672/Tottemo_Luckyman,"[""a very old school anime; definitely a classic, grew up watching this anime when i was little ( which i do not recommend to younger audiences as the humour may not be appropriate ) The sound track for this anime is probably its best feat in my opinion, it has that old school japanese pop/rock to it. Personally my favourite character is Superstar Man, hes a character who is pretty much useless but hes there to fill in a few laughs. Overall i'd say this anime is worth checking out if you want to know what anime was like in the mid 90's and the...type of humour they had is quite different compared to anime now, only 50 episodes so its pretty easy to binge watch. type of humour they had is quite different compared to anime now, only 50 episodes so its pretty easy to binge watch."", 'Not for everyone, but definitely for me. love this anime <3Always found various gags throughout the show very funny and entertaining.

It can keep ya hooked throughout all the way to the end.

Sunabouzu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25/Sunabouzu,"['First, let me point out the fact that if you don\'t like crude humor, don\'t bother watching Suna Bouzu (Desert Punk). This anime is filled with perverted, ecchi, and all around hilariously funny jokes (which may or may not offend some people). Don\'t let the comedy be the deciding factor though, as this show has some great action scenes. Kanta seems like an original Joe Blow, and quite the idiot at times, but when the going gets tough, he pulls through with some miraculous skills and finesse.The story lacks a little somewhat through the middle of the series, but picks up a lot towards the...end. Animation isn\'t top notch but it\'s plenty good to enjoy. The music is fun and suits the action sequences well (though it isn\'t anything memorable).The characters are by far the biggest attraction to Suna Bouzu. Kanta is the most perverted guy on the planet and it\'s rolling on the floor funny. Kosuna (his apprentice girl) has quite a few great moments too.For the most part, this is a happy ""feel good"" series. You\'ll enjoy the time you spend with it, and you\'ll enjoy the laughter it brings you. Giving this series a 9 is without a doubt warranted on my part.So, in conclusion, if you\'re not put off by insanely crude humor and ecchi jokes/scenes (the scenes aren\'t too terrible, nothing more than underwear at times), definitely give Desert Punk a try. The Japanese voice cast is amazing, so don\'t settle for English dubbed. end. Animation isn\'t top notch but it\'s plenty good to enjoy.

Here is my review about this flawed greatness.StoryI liked the story because it reminded me of our society, people taking advantage of others, people helping others and end up being betrayed by them. The story was about this selfish, pervert, bad person Mizuno Kanta and you may or may not like him because of how he is, but he followed his own desicions, he is a mercenary that...only helped if there was money involved, if not he could let a kid die in the desert without feeling guilty, is not the typical white knigth MC he is ''Sunabouzu'' and there is more to the story than that, it was outstanding.Art & AnimationEven if i saw this anime back in 2005 i would think that they could have done a better job with the art style, and a lot of character looks the same like all the girls had the same face but they just changed the hair style and that confused me thinking they were the same but the animation was good.SoundAt first i didn't like the OP but after listening to it in each episode i was liking it more and more, it was goofy and different, same with the ending but i didn't like that much the 2nd OP and ED, the OST was great in every scene.CharacterKanta or ''Sunabouzu'' is remarkable, he is a pervert, selfis prick, immoral douche, but he is following his ideals, he hates people that wants to help other people or the world change for the good, he wants it to stay like it is, because he thinks that way is balanced, he doesn't change a bit, like the typical guy that is tough outside but good on the inside, he stays like he is, but goes further more to follow his ideals, he can't say no to Junko because boobs, you will like him, hete him, despise him, like him again, maybe cry for him.-Asagiri Junko is a big breasted woman that always use Kanta to do her job, she always betrays him after he does her job, you may like her or hate her.-Amagumo this guy was always funny, everytime he appeared was funny and make you laugh, he was unique.-Taiko is someone i liked since her first appearence for some reason, and i tought she was going to be a good part of the anime, and i was correct and even bigger than i expected at the end, you will see why.There's a lot of good character like the Kagamuchi Brothers, Natsuko and why she followed the life she has and whose fault it is, outstanding characters.EnjoymentI enjoyed how funny this was, the adventure they had, the contracts he tooked, the characters, and how it makes you feel that there is not bad guys vs good guys at the end so for me the enjoyment was outstanding. only helped if there was money involved, if not he could let a kid die in the desert without feeling guilty, is not the typical white knigth MC he is ''Sunabouzu'' and there is more to the story than that, it was outstanding.Art & AnimationEven if i saw this anime back in 2005 i would think that they could have done a better job with the art style, and a lot of character looks the same like all the girls had the same face but they just changed the hair style and that confused me thinking they were the same but the animation was good.SoundAt first i didn't like the OP but after listening to it in each episode i was liking it more and more, it was goofy and different, same with the ending but i didn't like that much the 2nd OP and ED, the OST was great in every scene.CharacterKanta or ''Sunabouzu'' is remarkable, he is a pervert, selfis prick, immoral douche, but he is following his ideals, he hates people that wants to help other people or the world change for the good, he wants it to stay like it is, because he thinks that way is balanced, he doesn't change a bit, like the typical guy that is tough outside but good on the inside, he stays like he is, but goes further more to follow his ideals, he can't say no to Junko because boobs, you will like him, hete him, despise him, like him again, maybe cry for him.-Asagiri Junko is a big breasted woman that always use Kanta to do her job, she always betrays him after he does her job, you may like her or hate her.-Amagumo this guy was always funny, everytime he appeared was funny and make you laugh, he was unique.-Taiko is someone i liked since her first appearence for some reason, and i tought she was going to be a good part of the anime, and i was correct and even bigger than i expected at the end, you will see why.There's a lot of good character like the Kagamuchi Brothers, Natsuko and why she followed the life she has and whose fault it is, outstanding characters.EnjoymentI enjoyed how funny this was, the adventure they had, the contracts he tooked, the characters, and how it makes you feel that there is not bad guys vs good guys at the end so for me the enjoyment was outstanding."", ""Sunabouzu is an ongoing manga started in the late 90s and written by Masatoshi Usune. In 2004 it was adapted into an anime by Gonzo, a Studio we've looked at quite a bit with series like Bakuretsu Tenshi, Basilisk, Gantz, Brave Story &, most recently, Strike Witches. Let's look at Sunabouzu and see how well it compares.Story:In a post apocalyptic future the vestiges of civilisation subsist in various cities throughout a great desert. It's relatively lawless with might and money deciding things. In that desert, there's a group of handymen who take mercenary jobs and our protagonist, the titular Sunabouzu, is considered one...of the greatest of them. The series follows him as he takes a variety of jobs and shenanigans ensue.What little story there is is beyond weak. It's cliched, full of contrivances and ends on a really stupid note. It's a lot like a Michael Bay film, with over the top action sequences replacing anything of substance. But, this is largely a comedy. So, we can forgive the terrible over-arcing story if it's funny, right? So, let's examine the humour a bit, shall we? The “comedy” of this series hits pretty much every single lowest, most base, mean-spirited point it possibly can. It uses a lot of rape jokes, usually with our protagonist threatening someone with rape and the joke being his pursuit of her and how she tries to escape. It also has a few gay jokes, because every horrible comedy feels that it's hilarious to point out that gay people exist. Those jokes that aren't horrible are just supposed to be funny because the characters are acting like idiots or because something over the top happens. If there's a single “joke” that works in this, then the sheer stupidity of the series must have caused me to drone it out because I didn't notice. I watched through all twenty four episodes without so much as a brief smile.Characters:The characters aren't so much one-dimensional stereotypes as they are over the top presentations of one-dimensional stereotypes. Because making characters who are just one-dimensional stereotypes is too subtle for this series. So it decided to make them more annoying. The only character who even develops in some small way is Taiko, who has a pretty typical character arc of going from a student to standing on her own. It isn't much and her personality stays pretty stagnant throughout, but it's more than anyone else gets.Art:The art is the best part of the series. It's not good, it would be pretty mediocre if not for the rather poorly done action sequences and the ridiculous boob physics that even Team Ninja would consider excessive.Sound:The actors give performances that are absurdly over the top to the point of being really obnoxious. Saito Chiwa is normally very skilled, but she's one of the worst offenders and that ridiculous, overly squeaky laugh she does is just ear-bleedingly painful to listen to. The music is over the top as well, but not quite as bad.Ho-yay:There's a gay side character who shows up in one episode and in some flashbacks later, because the series wanted to do some gay jokes. They just thought it was very important for building this bland post-apocalyptic world with its single type of terrain. Clearly, the whole thing would have just fallen apart if they hadn't made fun of gay people for daring to exist.Final Thoughts:Sunabouzu is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. It's a bunch of overblown, loud, flashy spectacle with a sense of humour that ranges from downright nasty to just unfunny, poorly done action sequences and nothing passable in terms of either story or characters. It's tripe that tries to appeal on the grounds of being flashy and exaggerated. My final rating for it is a well deserved 1/10. My next requested review is Glass no Kamen, but it's going to be a while before I can finish it. So, next week I'll look at the second series of Yuru Yuri. of the greatest of them.

Also,...it is a very light-hearted show ( for the most part, more on this below ), and it's quite funny.My personal favorite among the supporting characters remains Amagumo, this guy makes me chuckle every time he pops up on screen :)However, what got me completely by surprise is the fact that a series that started in such a simplistic way presented me with one of the most profound and satisfying endings I've seen in anime.Without spoiling it, I can just say that it is about freedom: not necessarily the freedom of making the RIGHT choice, but the freedom of making A choice.Your choice and no one else's.And have the strength to face the consequences of that choice without lying to yourself.For Sunabozu is not presented as an ideal, but as a real person, with real strengths and flaws, who till the very end remains true to himself. This is more than can be said about many of the other characters, which throughout the series seem to have indisputable moral superiority over Kanta.Desert Punk is also one of the few animes where there is no distinction WHATSOEVER between good guys and bad guys.It's all about different groups of people in the middle of the desert, fending for themselves.I felt very realistic.That's pretty much all I'd like to say about the show.I won't comment on the technical aspects , I think you'll get a better idea of them by simply watching 5 mins of an episode.So, to wrap it up, give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed. it is a very light-hearted show ( for the most part, more on this below ), and it's quite funny.My personal favorite among the supporting characters remains Amagumo, this guy makes me chuckle every time he pops up on screen :)However, what got me completely by surprise is the fact that a series that started in such a simplistic way presented me with one of the most profound and satisfying endings I've seen in anime.Without spoiling it, I can just say that it is about freedom: not necessarily the freedom of making the RIGHT choice, but the freedom of making A choice.Your choice and no one else's.And have the strength to face the consequences of that choice without lying to yourself.For Sunabozu is not presented as an ideal, but as a real person, with real strengths and flaws, who till the very end remains true to himself.

My latest review.Just recently I finished watching Suna Bouzu, and I really have to say that I have some mixed feelings about it. I think the show had a great deal of potential which remained unused for the most part, due to a few unfortunate lapses in the show.Story: 6The story was for the most part decent, if a little unoriginal. The setting is a post - apocalyptic desert where people must use whatever they can to survive the harsh conditions (Road Warrior, anyone?) However, the structure of the show is slightly odd, in that it is very episodic right...up until about episode 15 or 16, then it switches to have an overall story arc, where there was really nothing tying the previous episodes together before. Like I said though, the story is fairly unorginal - a conspiracy laden government....mysterious ruins from the past containing legendary super - weapons. You get the picture.Art: 7The art is pretty good, if a little dated and undetailed. The character design is quite good, as all the characters have their own distinct look and personality to go with that look. Sadly, the setting does not lend itself to panoramic vistas (jt's a boring desert) so the background suffers at times, looking far to bland. Other than that, the art is very standard.Sound: 7I can't say I noticed the music for the most part, except for the first opening theme, which is a jazz - inspired piece over live action clips of a guy dressed as the eponymous Sunabouzu. It's a fun introduction to the show which sets up the tone of the show quite well. Other than that though, I'm assuming that the music is pretty standard fare is it was so unnoticeable. In terms of voice acting there was some solid talent up there, with some good voices for each character, however dislikeable they may be. I did appreciate Wakamoto Norio (AAAAMMMEEN!) as 'the Repo Man of Souls'Character: 5The characters are the biggest stumbling block that there are in this show, at least to my mind. The lead, Kanta (the Sunabouzu) is just a terrible person. He's stupid, greedy, arrogant, incredibly perverted...you name it, he's got it. I would say he's one part Vash the Stampede, and a about nine parts Borat. Ordinarly these traits in a character just provide a bit of variety, but Kanta displays them to such an extent that it detracts from the rest of the show. Many of the other characters are quite difficult to like as well...Asagiri Junko, one of the major characters is manipulative where Kanta is stupid to the extent where she is no longer possible to empathize with. Kosuna, the main character's sidekick, is not an unlikeable character, but her voice and squeaky laughter pretty much achieve the same thing. That said, some characters are great, but sadly most of these are the supporting cast, such as the Repo Man of Souls I mentioned earlier, who is positively hilarious and pretty much saved the show for me.Enjoyment: 6Now that's a tough one. The problem I had with this show, apart from the characters, was the inconsitancy of it, in the quality of the episodes, no less. Essentially, it's like every other episode must be rolling on the floor funny, or cringe - inducingly painful. There's one scene in the second episode which still makes me laugh (I won't give away any details) but on the other hand I've had to block Kanta's behaviour from my mind.Overall: 6This show is packed with Ecchi. The title of the first episode (The Demon and the Double Ds) pretty much says it all. If you think you'll be offended by it or the huge amount of pervertedness that accompanies it than please do not watch this.I would reccomend watching this only if you like mindless humor and pantsu, or if you really need a break from a string of dark, psychological shows (as I did).

The potential for fanservice and action is apparent from the get-go. What might not be as evident is the depth of the characters: in particular that of Punk's sidekick, Kosuna. She proves the perfect foil to both Punk and Junko (the show's primary source of /e/). Another character perk is the show's superb english dub and localization, which I'd actually recommend over the origional Japanese audio. For all the show's other shortcomings (underwhelming animation at times/ derivative plot tangents), the interplay between characters is enough to watch it to the end; which is, I...must say, one of the most appropriate and satisfying endings to any anime I've ever seen. must say, one of the most appropriate and satisfying endings to any anime I've ever seen."", ""Desert Punk is the most realistic reputation of human behavior (In parts) and realistic decisions people would make in a given circumstance.  A lot of people will not past the ecchiness and downright jerkass main character, those people are missing out on an incredible anime.  Watch the DUB, believe me the dub brings out the fullest of this anime, all the characters are voiced to perfection.The first about 6-8 episodes are a build up of the story, not to much action and there is some ridiculous aspects to it; however after that the story gets rolling and every episode is absolutely awesome....The story is about a post apocalyptic Japan where everything is Desert and water in some parts are scarce and hard to come by.  The series which has a lot of ecchiness to it has a very serious and well developed plot, it posses a lot of complex questions and decisions (for example the main characters run into a couple of orphans in the desert and have to make a tough decision on whether to take the orphans with them or not).  The series is one the funniest that i have watched, and not that guy slips and pulls down a girls skirt highschool comedy/drama nonsense.  The main character Kanta is an absolute riot, he is guarantee to make you laugh.Speaking of characters this show has them in droves.  The main character in my opinion is one the best an most realistic characters in anime history.  KANTA is the real deal, no bullshit, no lets make this a nice guy nonsense.  Kanta is a jerk and makes no qualms about it, he wants to bang Junko (even though she never lets him....TEASE) and he even makes a deal with 14yr-old Koizumi that if he trains her she will be his when she is of age.  Kanta makes rational and cold decisions he doesn't any job unless there is a profit to be had.  One the only series I can think of where the majority of people who come in contact with the main character hate him.The bottom line is that Desert Punk (Again watch the dub it's way better) Is an Anime that has a great story, and if your looking for an Anime that progresses and stays true to the characters till the end then you have to watch this.  This anime is one the rare animes that keeps on getting better as it goes on; One of GONZO's best works in my opinion.

Kanta starts out as a desert handyman: not completely honest but not heartless as he appears at the end of the series. Conversely, Kasuna starts out as more of a heartless fighter (albeit a bit weak, and with no training to speak of), but becomes more of a kind hearted individual as the story progresses. The divide between herself and Kanta widens as he becomes more concerned with his own successes and less for her wellbeing or the wellbeing of others, and this is what strikes me as...the major underlying moral throughout the story. To him, others are there to be cheated and robbed, and become less and less of actual people to him. In the end, he becomes hated by his childhood friends (the machine gun brothers, who, in actuality, didn't like him from the beginning but did not hate him), and his own apprentice chooses to leave him behind just like he had left them behind. the major underlying moral throughout the story.

I fully admit I wrote some short and shitty reviews when I was first starting out. I was at a very busy point in my life and could usually only spare 30 minutes to write a review. This was one those I wrote to vent stress when I was in medical school. I\'m bringing this one back because it holds perhaps my favorite reason for being removed. It was too mean spirited and hurt the feelings of the Desert Punk fandom. There is just SO much wrong with this. Firstly, the Desert Punk ""fandom"" is about 5...people. Even if you found Desert Punk amusing, nobody considers this a masterpiece or should feel personally insulted that some random guy didn\'t find it funny. Highly rated reviews that insult popular anime far more brutally and directly insult fans are allowed to stay.

I fell inlove with it after the first pair of juggs I saw in it. It basiclly has no story line til the second half of the series but you'd wouldnt really give a crap if it didn't have a story line, you'll be wishing for the character to get himself into more trouble and pair of Juggs. The art and sound were amazing and the characters are very likeable. "", 'Yeah, I get it. Sunabozu is supposed to be a very funny, action-y and very sexually humorous anime and it’s pretty well known; a lot of people like this one. For goodness’s sakes, I don’t get it. This anime is nothing more than a crappy, unwatchable snooze fest. Part of me wishes I never picked this up. Part of me HATES me for being curious and deciding to buy this anime for keeps. I was actually looking forward to an enjoyable comedy anime, but unfortunately, this wasn’t what I thought it would be.Not much can be said about the story of Sunabozu, at first...glance anyways. It’s a standard one-season anime series with episodic structure, but with few if any, plot holes relevant enough to make a difference. But this story is also a poor man’s version of an anime-style manzai comedy show. For the most part it seemed like this anime was going out of its way to not be funny. I don’t get that. Most other comedies try hard to make you feel for the gags. I mean, look no further than BoBoBo, but honestly, at least Sunabozu has some sort of a plot—a dreadful, stupid and uninteresting one to me, but a plot nonetheless.So you have a weird, perverted desert rat acting completely self-centered and doing whatever he can to fulfill his own needs and survive his bounty hunter duties on the side, and a woman, with breasts that probably make it into the top tier of list of the largest breasts in anime, who tries to foil every scheme he comes up with, seemingly for no other reason than because she can. Numerous random plots follow suit, and every episode usually involves the Sunabozu forming a plan to complete his objective- whether it be retrieve a treasure or protect an annoying spoiled rich bratty girl. Then that plan is rendered completely useless midway through his mission, leaving the Sunabozu to rely on clever (not that clever, really) tricks in order to escape/take out/mostly run from a random group of desert thugs. Many episodes were almost dreadful to watch, and handfuls were painful to watch, because nothing really happened that wowed me. The first few episodes really suck, because they do nothing but repeat the above formula and add in a bunch of crude, sexual humor that is either unfunny or out of place for the scene. Now, it’s not that I don’t appreciate somewhat dark, crude sexual humor, but who’d say that they do appreciate such things proudly? Sickos. Then again, I tolerated Panty and Stocking, and then I grew to love it. Therefore, I’m with you sickos after all. But the anime Sunabozu is where I draw the line between my sicko self and you other sickos. This anime could never be any good. None of the jokes are clever, at all, and that’s a BIG problem, since this is supposed to be… a freaking comedy. Or at least that’s what I expected.  I know I’m starting to beat a dead horse here, but I’ll say this much: for a comedy anime, I rarely found myself chuckling at any situation involving the boob jokes, or any of the other off-color jokes that plague his horrendous snooze fest. Yes, that’s another problem with this anime. It’s boring. It’s fracking boring! I don’t care if it is somewhat original, it is unfunny and unappealing and boring. I’m starting to sound redundant myself just mentioning how bad the flow of this anime is. I can only take watching the main characters walking through the desert for so long. I’d rather watch the DESERT ITSELF MOVE SAND PARTICLES AT ONE HALF A MILE AN HOUR than pick up this series ever again.I should’ve said this outright. I don’t rate anime on what other people think, or how popular it is, I rate anime based on my views about what the show gives me, and every anime has to start from the ground up and earn a number rating. Right now, Sunabozu’s characters aren’t giving me much to work with.Looking at the characters, they are all generic. All the desert thugs and groups are the same; they want money, women, and water and want Sunabozu dead and out of the picture.  Yes, I’ll admit the kid really does have a knack for pulling out the stops on some really stupid criminals. He also has a crowning moment of awesomeness in the first few episodes, and the guy is pretty resourceful, but then he turns into a ridiculous perv.  I dislike him from then on.  Sunabozu himself is just a bad, unfunny and estranged character. Period. The only characters that stand out are the two female characters (shocking isn’t it), Kosuna the brat and Junko the sexy, tall, large chested one. Unfortunately, I don’t see women like Junko, fall in love with her body, (I’m sorry, other guys will call it “character” and give this anime or nine or ten). Seriously, I will give this show one thing: they made the personality of the secondary character more interesting and cooler than the main character. It was hard to keep watching this anime but Junko’s antics were clever. It was interesting to see how she’d screw with the punk kid over the course of the more episodic…uh, episodes in the storyline. But that’s it. Unless they have big boobs, characters are piss-poor and unappealing in this anime, apparently.To my dismay, there is nothing to complain about when it comes to the animation. The art style is fine here, well to be specific, it’s not bad but it’s not special or perfect, either. It suits the anime well and looks decent. Decent is a very forgiving word to use when talking about this anime series anyway.The sound is fine. The background music is… just background music. The opening is great, and the first ending theme is actually super-catchy. I wash my mouth out with soap when I catch myself singing those songs, due to the fact that this anime IS bad, not its music.Now then, if you don’t understand why I don’t like the Sunabozu already, I’ll simplify it for you:This anime was one of the biggest disappointments in my anime viewing history. I cringe at some episodes, close my eyes, and cover my ears at many scenes and most of the moments where others who like this thing would fine humorous and fun to watch. I find it hard to watch. Episode 12 is quite possibly my most hated anime episode of all time. Just watch it to find out. I initially dropped this anime after 12 episodes, but picked it back up a while ago, AND watched it again all the way through in a week just to review it. I forced myself to watch this and I regret doing so.Creator-kun’s Score:Story: Once again, I dissect the innards of an anime just to see what the story truly has to offer. This story offers a good nap, because this show isn’t funny and bores me with its story—which is rife with unfunny ecchi humor. The story of Sunabozu didn’t appeal to me. (3)Art: Just fine, actually. (6)Sound: Fine again. Great theme songs and a decent but far from outstanding soundtrack. However, The English dub is where I start to cringe at the poorly delivered and crude jokes. This came as a surprise to me, because FUNimation dubbed this and it is average at best, and they take a few liberties with swearing as well. (6)Characters: Dreadful (2)Enjoyment: You’re kidding, right? (2)OVERALL: 3- Very Bad. This is all I have left to say: Sunabozu isn’t for everyone, and if you agree with me, it ain’t for you either. Gosh, it disappoints, it fails to impress, it sucks hard, I don’t recommend it to those who like good storylines and decent humor, it’s pathetic, it’s despairing… And I don’t like it.  I seriously say try something else. And yes, I just panned Desert Punk! All joking and harshness aside now, I’m not criticizing anyone or anybody’s personal preferences. But I’m being straight with you all when I say that if something is screwed up, it’s screwed up. .. If you really like this kind of humor and fanservice and uninteresting storytelling, Sunabozu is right up your alley. I prefer it stay out of mine.  I’m still gonna say this: Please people, go find a good action anime, and please go watch a better ecchi-like comedy (and no, I don’t mean Futari Ecchi). glance anyways.

With rumors of a fearsome demon roaming the sands. Turns out he's just a punk. Just some sex-depraved, control-hungry punk. Did I mention they're in the desert?Because that's what all the commotion is about; a desert formerly known as Japan and the enigmatic titular character who is anything but. It's shallow, hedonistic, and immature. But in doing so, subtly reflects how low people can go in the most casual way possible.STORY - 8Japan, once a sprawling mecca of quirky culture and steadfast ethics, has been reduced to the Kantou desert; an unforgiving wasteland of extreme temperature changes, scarce resources, and roaming...guns-for-hire. Resulting from years of deterioration after a presumed nuclear holocaust, only scattered villages, a government stronghold and buried ruins of yesterday's civilization remain. Pre-war technology is steadily recovered and reverse engineered as the current standard for firearms and armor. All the more for mercenaries and marauders, who don special environmental suits with built-in air conditioning units and targeting systems to combat both the intense heat and competition.Starting to sound familiar? The premise falls so close to the Fallout series with the inclusion of mutants, splinter factions, and mercenary companies offering jobs from simple waste disposal to high-priority escort missions. The only thing missing is a Pip-Boy. And along the lines of an open-world survival, anything can go wrong for anyone. Guns jam, equipment fails, water is a godsend, terrain is unpredictable, and everyone is racking up on karma.Story-wise, Desert Punk is episodic with the main plot centered on the various jobs of the punk and his companions. Oftentimes, the show pulls off a schmuck-ton of bitching and bickering, which it exercises to great effect to create an accessibly immoral atmosphere. With a show dealing with acts from human trade, arson, and mass murder to masturbation, crap-slinging, and bare bottom stripping, I appreciate Desert Punk for being so playful in its delivery. Combined with an obnoxious sense of high-school and toilet humor, the show's execution proves that the post-apocalypse isn't necessarily filled with hardened badasses. In fact, most of them are garden-variety thugs and scroungers with enough experience invested in endurance, charisma, and especially luck.When they aren't shoving sh*t, piss, and boobs down our senses, sparse interludes of action and sci-fi intrigue get our minds out of the gutter and back into the fray. When the plot gets down to it, there is no great mastermind to face. No big adventure awaits. Nothing but the monotonous desert and its effects on the populace are explored until it comes full circle on how life pretty much sucks yet goes on in a dog-eat-dog world.ART - 7Character designs are honestly nothing special. The punk's unmasked face is reminiscent of your typical delinquent's and the same goes for 80% of the cast. Everyone is a plain jane, save for Kosuna and Stryker who look more like main characters than the punk himself. Kosuna's all-out moe cuteness and Stryker's heart-of-gold shounen persona contrasts the desert pigsty in such a way that they feel like they starred in the wrong show; adding to the humor.But if there's one thing the design team should be proud of, it's the environmental suits that draw influences from oriental, Middle Eastern, and military apparel. The famous getup of the punk consists of an Asian conical flap hat, a fatigue jacket with matching cargo pants, combat boots, a tan cape and a gasmask-like apparatus for speaking and breathing.Since most people are in their suits or masks, that lessens the burden for mouth movement. Add a hefty amount of panning shots and the result is animation you can get away with. I don't mind because the detail and consistency compensates. Action is smooth and clear where it needs to be. Smart placement of motion blurs as well as mirage effects are a plus. Even the set pieces are always changing to achieve a sense of world despite how desolate the premise appears on paper. The occasional towns and weathered rock formations have a lot of texture going on and the same can be said with the drab indoor scenes. Attention to shadows also follow suit with the amount of lighting the desert sun poses. Neither exemplary, nor pitiful, just being one of Gonzo's more consistent releases in animation quality is a cause for celebration.SOUND - 7The music, like the show, doesn’t take itself seriously. Openings and endings are intentionally tacky and cliche superhero themes sounding completely indifferent to the premise. The BGM is varied but for the purpose of fitting the mood, all right. The voice acting though…I was recommended the dub. And now I recommend it to you because of the more tangible sense of immature vulgarity and the Westernized approach to the series despite its Japanese setting. The script is dirty and cheap, yet liberal and fun. It's nuckin' futs. And at rare moments, even manages to grip you, especially the punk's monologues about desert survival. Then the narrator reminds you time and time again how pathetic everyone is for your entertainment.While everybody is appropriately casted, I cannot properly express my love for Eric Vale and Luci Christian breathing crazy life to the show's main duo. You just know the voice actors had a hell of a time with their roles and Vale's script.That's right, Desert Punk (Eric Vale) wrote the script for his own anime. So you see, HE IS THE BALLS.CHARACTERS - 8Who knew the biggest, baddest demon of the now-called Kanto desert was just some punk? Nevertheless, the iconic shrimp in the desert suit wielding an array of traps and an outdated buckshot handed down by his old man is an unexpected core to the show.He's the guy everyone loves to hate and for good reasons. Being annoying, reckless, rude, selfish, manipulative, and ridiculously horny, even his own friends are willing to gun him down should he get out of line. But underneath that stereotypically chauvinist exterior, lies a seasoned, persistent, and down-to-earth byproduct of the fallout who knows how to get real; doing anything to turn a situation to his favor despite the repercussions (even if it means killing himself just to do the deed).His apprentice, Kosuna, serves as an excellent foil with her cheerful and spunky disposition. Under the tutelage of the punk (regardless of his perverse ulterior motives), she receives the most development; starting from a stubborn idealist to an independent realist who is every bit as capable as her peers. The chemistry the unlikely pair share shines in their hilarious back-and-forth, unorthodox teamwork, and deep-seated respect they have for one another.The recurring characters that join the arid frenzy are mostly supplementary but nonetheless memorable just by getting screwed up in the punk's plans. The highlights are Junko as the fickle femme fatale, Rain Spider as the seemingly menacing yet cowardly troll, the Machine Gun brothers as the rowdy comic relief, and Stryker as the token paragon of justice who, in a cruel twist of fate, was even sold to a homosexual at some point just because the show can.ENJOYMENT - 9Desert Punk is a self-indulgent but self-aware sci-fi gag with hints of the human condition presented in a toony light. In an action-filled premise, we'd feel excited because the anime would show something flashy or fast-paced to suck us in. Desert Punk presents itself as crude and banal because survival isn't anything new and desirable in the show's perspective. Desperation devoids man of rationality and ethics so survival actually brings more contempt than relief. The light execution is just the show making the best out of a worst case scenario because even a mushroom cloud can have a sliver of silver somewhere.Neither overglorifying violence nor downplaying morals, the series plays like a messed up Saturday morning cartoon that makes the profane watchable to portray that there is no good or evil; only people choosing the side that pays more.You can also see it as a crass course of blatant fun where the joke is on the hopeless bunch stranded in the Kantou desert. Watch it for the sh*ts and giggles. And maybe you might feel something oddly real about it as you go on.OVERALL - 8Whimsical animation and music come together with an unrestrained dub and bipolar plot to make a show that wallows in mediocrity to give us a f*cking good time and to prove a good point.“It’s a vicious cycle but… oh well. That’s the way it goes, I guess. And these people sure aren’t changing. Dumbasses…” - Narrator guns-for-hire. Resulting from years of deterioration after a presumed nuclear holocaust, only scattered villages, a government stronghold and buried ruins of yesterday's civilization remain. Pre-war technology is steadily recovered and reverse engineered as the current standard for firearms and armor. All the more for mercenaries and marauders, who don special environmental suits with built-in air conditioning units and targeting systems to combat both the intense heat and competition.Starting to sound familiar? The premise falls so close to the Fallout series with the inclusion of mutants, splinter factions, and mercenary companies offering jobs from simple waste disposal to high-priority escort missions. The only thing missing is a Pip-Boy. And along the lines of an open-world survival, anything can go wrong for anyone. Guns jam, equipment fails, water is a godsend, terrain is unpredictable, and everyone is racking up on karma.Story-wise, Desert Punk is episodic with the main plot centered on the various jobs of the punk and his companions. Oftentimes, the show pulls off a schmuck-ton of bitching and bickering, which it exercises to great effect to create an accessibly immoral atmosphere. With a show dealing with acts from human trade, arson, and mass murder to masturbation, crap-slinging, and bare bottom stripping, I appreciate Desert Punk for being so playful in its delivery. Combined with an obnoxious sense of high-school and toilet humor, the show's execution proves that the post-apocalypse isn't necessarily filled with hardened badasses. In fact, most of them are garden-variety thugs and scroungers with enough experience invested in endurance, charisma, and especially luck.When they aren't shoving sh*t, piss, and boobs down our senses, sparse interludes of action and sci-fi intrigue get our minds out of the gutter and back into the fray. When the plot gets down to it, there is no great mastermind to face. No big adventure awaits. Nothing but the monotonous desert and its effects on the populace are explored until it comes full circle on how life pretty much sucks yet goes on in a dog-eat-dog world.ART - 7Character designs are honestly nothing special. The punk's unmasked face is reminiscent of your typical delinquent's and the same goes for 80% of the cast. Everyone is a plain jane, save for Kosuna and Stryker who look more like main characters than the punk himself. Kosuna's all-out moe cuteness and Stryker's heart-of-gold shounen persona contrasts the desert pigsty in such a way that they feel like they starred in the wrong show; adding to the humor.But if there's one thing the design team should be proud of, it's the environmental suits that draw influences from oriental, Middle Eastern, and military apparel. The famous getup of the punk consists of an Asian conical flap hat, a fatigue jacket with matching cargo pants, combat boots, a tan cape and a gasmask-like apparatus for speaking and breathing.Since most people are in their suits or masks, that lessens the burden for mouth movement. Add a hefty amount of panning shots and the result is animation you can get away with. I don't mind because the detail and consistency compensates. Action is smooth and clear where it needs to be. Smart placement of motion blurs as well as mirage effects are a plus. Even the set pieces are always changing to achieve a sense of world despite how desolate the premise appears on paper. The occasional towns and weathered rock formations have a lot of texture going on and the same can be said with the drab indoor scenes. Attention to shadows also follow suit with the amount of lighting the desert sun poses. Neither exemplary, nor pitiful, just being one of Gonzo's more consistent releases in animation quality is a cause for celebration.SOUND - 7The music, like the show, doesn’t take itself seriously. Openings and endings are intentionally tacky and cliche superhero themes sounding completely indifferent to the premise. The BGM is varied but for the purpose of fitting the mood, all right. The voice acting though…I was recommended the dub. And now I recommend it to you because of the more tangible sense of immature vulgarity and the Westernized approach to the series despite its Japanese setting. The script is dirty and cheap, yet liberal and fun. It's nuckin' futs. And at rare moments, even manages to grip you, especially the punk's monologues about desert survival. Then the narrator reminds you time and time again how pathetic everyone is for your entertainment.While everybody is appropriately casted, I cannot properly express my love for Eric Vale and Luci Christian breathing crazy life to the show's main duo. You just know the voice actors had a hell of a time with their roles and Vale's script.That's right, Desert Punk (Eric Vale) wrote the script for his own anime. So you see, HE IS THE BALLS.CHARACTERS - 8Who knew the biggest, baddest demon of the now-called Kanto desert was just some punk? Nevertheless, the iconic shrimp in the desert suit wielding an array of traps and an outdated buckshot handed down by his old man is an unexpected core to the show.He's the guy everyone loves to hate and for good reasons. Being annoying, reckless, rude, selfish, manipulative, and ridiculously horny, even his own friends are willing to gun him down should he get out of line. But underneath that stereotypically chauvinist exterior, lies a seasoned, persistent, and down-to-earth byproduct of the fallout who knows how to get real; doing anything to turn a situation to his favor despite the repercussions (even if it means killing himself just to do the deed).His apprentice, Kosuna, serves as an excellent foil with her cheerful and spunky disposition. Under the tutelage of the punk (regardless of his perverse ulterior motives), she receives the most development; starting from a stubborn idealist to an independent realist who is every bit as capable as her peers. The chemistry the unlikely pair share shines in their hilarious back-and-forth, unorthodox teamwork, and deep-seated respect they have for one another.The recurring characters that join the arid frenzy are mostly supplementary but nonetheless memorable just by getting screwed up in the punk's plans. The highlights are Junko as the fickle femme fatale, Rain Spider as the seemingly menacing yet cowardly troll, the Machine Gun brothers as the rowdy comic relief, and Stryker as the token paragon of justice who, in a cruel twist of fate, was even sold to a homosexual at some point just because the show can.ENJOYMENT - 9Desert Punk is a self-indulgent but self-aware sci-fi gag with hints of the human condition presented in a toony light. In an action-filled premise, we'd feel excited because the anime would show something flashy or fast-paced to suck us in. Desert Punk presents itself as crude and banal because survival isn't anything new and desirable in the show's perspective.

That’s the way it goes, I guess. And these people sure aren’t changing. Dumbasses…” - Narrator"", 'This has got to be the strangest anime I have seen. It’s full if rather adult content and jokes. The storyline is really good, starting at the first point of Desert Punk’s downfall from being the most awesome for higher man to being almost comical. It makes the story hilarious as he pretty much fails each and every mission he takes, or ends up fully injured. From the start, its hilarious with rather old man jokes or perverted images going so far as to show the privet parts of men although blurred slightly. Basically, you can tell if you may like the show from the...first episode as long as the comical part is concerned.On the other side of the spectrum is the story line. Most of the story is a job of the week version where you don’t normally have to worry about if you miss one or two of the episodes though you may miss a fun reacquiring character like Rain Spider who is one of the best characters and delivered a wonderful line that has been used very often.I actually really like Kanta’s personality, he actually is not afraid to admit once in a while that he’s a complete pervert and shows that he actually really does care about some people. Sadly though, sometimes that takes a back seat to him getting his job done.Junko and Rain Spider are the perfect rivals for Kanta. Junko throwing her breasts around seems to get Kanta into a mess of trouble, normally by distracting him. Rain Spider is rather the same mindset as Kanta though his tactics aren’t really what I would call nice. He uses a lot of ‘sexual bondage’ items to scare his enemies. I don’t really care much for Kosuna. She just sounds like a wimpy little crybaby most of the time and sadly, Luci Christian makes her a bit… well, a bit too childish and whiny then I like.The artwork feels a lot like Saiyuki or Trigun, the background is rather nicely blurred and makes it look perfect with the heat of the Desert. It has a nice vintage feel and really adds to the feeling of post-apocalyptic world that he lives in. Buildings are either broken up or sandstone cut though I don’t understand why the older buildings are like that as well.  Some of the action seems to be the same images over and over again, with some action lines but it captures some of the action nicely. I have to smile at the opening though where they decided to add a live-action opening to it and they did rather nice making it fit with the cartoon version. Sadly, the character that plays Kanta does not have the right height and so some of that joke is lost. It’s really surprising that Gonzo made this because they were really good to this and makes me want them to do more of this more often. I think they really shined here. Unfortunately, the second opening and ending is much to be desired.Now music… it is something to be desired. There is a lot of ‘soft porn’ music pretty much everywhere and not much of the fun action music until right up to the point where he decides to actually go bad ass.  The second opening is much worse then the first, same for the ending. Not really sure why they changed it up like that. Most of the main cast has rather nice sounding in English, while the others are just placed around in bad taste but its fine because they didn’t stay for long. As I said before, Kosuna, played by Luci Christian seems way too childish and whinny. On the other side, I freaken love Rain Spider played by Kenny Green. His voice is perfect for a rather bad ass character and yet when he is funny, it doesn’t feel out of character. first episode as long as the comical part is concerned.On the other side of the spectrum is the story line.

Desert Punk takes that idea and cranks it so high your brain will shrivel up in a matter of seconds, and that\'s why the show is so good! Screw deep plots! We need more high speed shotgun and tit action!Story 7/10: Desert Punk\'s main theme is this, a midget mercenary known as the demon of the desert (aka, ""desert punk"" or just ""the punk"") goes around the post-apocalyptic great Kanto desert doing the...jobs no one else will do with a near perfect success rate (unless tit\'s get in the way). That however is the theme and background really since Desert Punk doesn\'t really have a plot, most the episodes are just random skits following those guidelines. And it works great, Desert Punk is nothing but crazy action, vulgar humour, and tit\'s, if you\'re looking for a deep show with a complex plot search elsewhere, but if you want something that will make you laugh so hard you\'ll cry you\'re in luck friend.Art 9/10: Lets get the boring stuff out the way first, the backgrounds. The show takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert and therefore all the backgrounds won\'t really vary all the much from your basic brown and other shades of brown. Now that that\'s out of the way lets move on to the good part, the character design! Most modern anime follows a basic template for characters where they all look the same, pointy chin tiny nose pretty boys. Desert Punk takes that template, whips its ass with it, and then sends the shit stained paper back to who gave it to them. Almost all the characters in Desert Punk are (for lack of a better term) ugly, Kanta (the punk) is a short little bastard with big eyebrows, massive ears, a fat round nose, and generally sporting a massive shit eater/psychopath smile, he looks kinda like a rapist monkey at times. And it don\'t stop with just the punk, everyone in this show looks like they\'ve been beaten to death with the ugly stick, and it fantastic! In a world where almost every anime character looks like the exact same pretty boy seeing characters like it is beyond refreshing.Sound 10/10: This show has one of the most memorable soundtracks I\'ve ever heard in anime. It\'s the kind of music where you hear the first half second of the song and suddenly jump up and yell ""that\'s the Desert Punk song!"" and then slowly slink back into your seat to avoid the confused glares you\'re getting from everyone around you. But does memorable necessarily mean good? No. Does it mean good in Desert Punk\'s case? Hell yes, this music is awesome. And now for the acting, good god the acting. Generally my opinion on dubs is this, the reason to watch a dub is so you don\'t have to read the subs and miss half the action. Is that the case with this show? Not at all. See most dubs will attempt to stay as true to the original script as possible, problem is Japanese jokes and sayings don\'t really translate well and as a result the dub just seems off. However the people dubbing Desert Punk decided ""here\'s the basic gist of what they\'re saying, now make it sound good in English!"" The finished product? A dub that might just be better then the sub (blasphemy!). Let me give you an example, in the original Japanese he says ""crap, better retreat for now"" and in the English dub he says ""remember kids, a smart man knows when it\'s time to RUN LIKE A LITTLE BITCH!"" Another problem is that English voice actors half ass like they aren\'t even being paid to do it, fandubs usually have more emotion. But with Desert Punk the actors really are giving it their all, and you can tell just from their performances that they\'re actually enjoying their work from once.Character 9/10: Dear god, the characters, I don\'t even know where to begin. The characters in Desert Punk... Well there are no good guy characters (except one, but he gets sold into slavery to a gay guy), every character in Desert Punk is more or less, a completely asshole. Kanta, the main protagonist of the show, is a bigger dick then most villains in anime. He is overly-horny, treats everyone like shit, acts like he\'s the greatest person in the world, he isn\'t just a jerk, he is the living incarnation of the word jerk, and that\'s what makes him so great! This is a character you\'re supposed to hate, the kind of character you\'re supposed to look at and say ""I want you to die!"" but in the end you just end up loving this fucking guy. The same goes for most the other characters, the odd part is the characters you generally end up hating the most are the ones that in any other anime you would consider the good guy, like Stryker (the dude who Kanta sells to a gay guy). Characters are definitely the strong point of Desert Punk.Enjoyment 10/10: This can really go both ways. Do you hate vulgar humour about sex, do you consider the thought of a bunch of goons getting covered in a massive trucks worth of shit and vomiting their guts out to be just plain disgusting? Then you will hate this show. But if you\'re like me and enjoy vulgar humour that has no real point then you will laugh to death watching this show.Overall 9/10: Desert Punk is a show that takes every cliche in anime, eats it, shits it out on to a plate, and then forces the modern romance anime market to eat it. Watch this show, it might just end up being one of your favourites. jobs no one else will do with a near perfect success rate (unless tit\'s get in the way).

Watch this show, it might just end up being one of your favourites.', 'When first knowing about this anime and reading/watching other reviews of the series, it’s a space western that much akin to Trigun and there are some major comparisons to that show, which we’ll get into later and believe it as looking into Desert Punk, you’ll recognize some similarities to it.In the future, Japan is a wasteland. In the Great Kanto Desert, scattered humans eke out a living in the hot sand. Among them, a short-statured man they call ""Sunabozu (Japanese version)"" or “Desert Punk (English Version)” – real name being Kanta Mizuno makes a living as a bounty hunter. Like a demon of the...sand, he seems unbeatable. Yet, like all men, he has a particular weakness for the opposite sex.For characters, Kanta is a selfish, arrogant, sex-addicting, boob-obsessed, crude short perverted asshole…….and that’s what I like about him. Yeah, most of the traits I sometimes loathe in most characters, whether in animation or live-action form within my heart and he’s the protagonist but at least he’s being straightforward with his intentions. He isn’t trying to be the hero of the wild west of Japan. He’s doing this to survive by any means necessary although sometimes he can mess it up by being his somewhat normal self. Then there’s Kosuna – real name being Taiko Koizumi, the later apprentice of Desert Punk as he defeated her old apprentice The Shimmer Sniper and she begged him to be his apprentice and he accepted her offer……mostly after she shown him a picture of her large-breasted mother….or some woman that she claims to be her mother. Yeah, she’s whiny and seems like she can’t handle being a mercenary but as the series progresses, her character strength and motivation grows.Speaking of big breasts, there’s Junko Asagiri, known as “The Vixen of the Desert” and the female rival and sexual desire to Desert Punk as she often uses her sex appeal to get her way and every other time, DP tries to cop a feel of her very large breasts and yes, he does get slapped and beaten for that. She does contribute the fan service part of the series but it never gets that risqué or close to a Hentai. It’s more eechi but not so annoying, you’ll get turned off. There is Rain Spider, who is equivalent to DP when it comes to combat and he is not to be fuck with when you tried to run away from him and he’s quite humorous in his scenes, especially that one particular scene. There are other supporting characters like the Machine Gun Brothers, who are childhood friends to Desert Punk but they even know that he’s an asshole and there is their sister Natsuko, who is also DP’s childhood friend and (you guess it!!) wants to fondle her breasts especially when they were young and you wonder why the Machine Gun Brothers would want to kick his ass.Now the show’s perverted humor and okay timing has been made a staple of this series and it did a decent job of delivering on that but halfway of the show, it completely does a 180 and the tone changes in some areas, just like Trigun. However, somewhat like that aforementioned series, the execution of changing the tone did a little hit or miss. For example, the first opening theme completely fits the first half of the series much like the opening theme for Trigun fits for the first half of the show but once the serious episodes begin, that theme feels so inappropriate and out of tune. The second opening theme of Desert Punk just got out of the way with showing “Tits and ass” at first and then “Shit gets real, y’all”. The animation was done by Gonzo and this was actually done with a budget that didn’t run out of money that fast. There might be small hiccups that are hardly noticeable and has the post-apocalyptic/western clash that looks like it came out of Mad Max minus the Thunderdome. The background music plays some orchestral sounds for the action & serious dramatic moments while most of the time it plays something that sounds like it’s coming from a soft core porn but it’s passable at best. The FUNimation dub was an earlier but satisfying effort with actors like Eric Vale as the title character. Luci Christian does sound a bit whiny as Kosuna but it feels more suited within the character and Kenny Green surpasses all expectations as Rain Spider. Other actors such as Callie (or Stephanie, I don’t know which) Young, Jamie Marchi & the other FUNimation extras are very acceptable in their parts.FINAL VERDICT: It’s rude, crude, unabashed, shameless, and yet it’s hilarious. Yeah, most of the characters (especially one in particular) you don’t know whether to like or question or loathe but it’s so unconventional that you wouldn’t really care less about it. For most people that would be fans of eechi titles, this one is something I would say to check out but I wouldn’t rush to get it just that quick. sand, he seems unbeatable.

This is the first in a trinity of anime I'm talking about where the three are the story I wish I could write. Sunabouzu or Desert Punk as it's know in the west is by far my favorite Studio Gonzo anime. Normally Studio Gonzo makes animes about either a strong noble hero, or the story of two star crossed lovers trying to be together. However Desert Punk couldn't be farther from those genres. Desert Punk is the story of Kanta AKA Desert Punk, whose a mercenary in The Great Kanto Desert, and...his many wacky misadventures trying to complete the jobs he's hired for. Now here's where the comment I made about this being the story I wish I could write comes from. This anime also has the same core plot as the legendary classic Hokuto no Ken or as it's known in the West as Fist of the North Star. However unlike a blatent rip off, the creator of this series takes the formula of Fist of the North Star, and adds his own unique way of doing things. Where Fist of the North Star was about a legendary Martial Artist in a post apocalyptic  world going from place to place helping those in need, Desert Punk was about a sly, sneaky, and cunning bastard in a similar setting only helping you if you have enough money, as he's not someone who's gonna help you for free. Next part I loved about this show was the humor. Again this is the kind of humor I wish I could write. While the gags in this anime center around boobs, sex jokes, and on rare occasions toilet humor, this show tells these jokes in a way we've never heard these jokes. There's also a lot of slapstick. The timing of the gags are done so well in this show, that I'm surprised Studio Gonzo of all people did this. I loved this anime. If I could ever find this on DVD you can bet I'd buy the complete series. his many wacky misadventures trying to complete the jobs he's hired for.

This gives the show a feel that is fitting for the time period and setting of the story.  By the way, did I mention that all the characters are fricken' ugly.  Yeah the character models could not have been worse, but instead of leaving my opinion there I decided that the ugliness of the characters had a purpose.  I believe...that the ugliness of the character reflects how bad the character is which is ironic since the main character is ugly as well.  I give a 7 for art because of how it projected the character's personalities to the viewer but still had very ugly characters.2.Sound - I'm not gonna waste your time on this one, the soundtrack was horrible.  You might as well watch the series subbed and leave the volume all the way down.  2, that's all I can say.3.Character - Each of the characters in Desert Punk had a unique personality unless they were a grunt or unimportant character like that.  Another fact that I would like to note is that there was a profound reoccurring theme in this anime; the theme that people are horrible.  Desert Punk was always getting double crossed and never got any help and I think the characters were depicted that way as a sort of cause for the post-apocalyptic setting.  I give a 9 for the characters because of how unique the depiction of them was.4.Story - The story for Desert Punk was pretty much about Desert Punk and his apprentice going around and finishing mercenary jobs.  The story was not very serious until the end of the anime and it gave a laid back feel to the show so when the story started to pick up I wasn't expecting anything special.  Some people might say that the ending was bad but if you think about it, it makes since how it ended since the story was about Desert Punk and his apprentice.  I give an 8 for the story because of how it was pretty good, but not the best.5.Enjoyment - I really enjoyed this anime.  The laid back feeling was nice and I never got tired of watching Desert Punk get screwed over: it was hilarious.  It didn't bother me that there wasn't a heavy story for this show and it kinda felt like a breath of fresh air when I watched this anime.  I give a 9 for enjoyment.This anime is a 7.*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.Caution:!Keep in mind this anime has nudity. that the ugliness of the character reflects how bad the character is which is ironic since the main character is ugly as well.

Set in the future where the lands have been reduced to harsh desert wastelands, we follow the adventures of Kanta the realist and his young apprentice Kosuna. This anime is definitely a must watch, it has qualities that set it apart from the rest.Kanta isn\'t your typical lead male character, I wouldn\'t even call him a ""good guy"", however I predict you\'ll find him likable none the less. He...simply does what it takes to stay alive, without any regard for the emotions or well being of others. He is a skilled and merciless mercenary who cares only for his job and large breasts.In fact Kanta\'s ability to form dynamic and adaptable strategies, to think quickly, and utilize unpredictable and confusing tactics has earned him the infamous title as ""Ghost of the Desert"". Whilst he may seem like a moron he\'s as sharp as a tack and the last mistake you\'ll ever make is to underestimate his ability to analyze a situation.I would also like to note that contrary to what the present top review for this anime would have you believe, this anime is far from being ""filled with perverted ecchi"", it does have a little bit though. I also doubt the dark and lowbrow comedy will be appreciated by all. Kanta is devious and exploitive, his sense of humor will offend some people.You wont find a happy land full of magical rainbows here, the Great Kantou Desert is a very harsh place where survival of the fittest comes into full play. If you let your emotions get the better of you it could very well mean your death, there\'s no time for mercy or forgiveness, and Kanta the self-proclaimed realist understands that reality.Overall I give the story an 8 simply because it has no trouble keeping me entertained - it\'s also a lot deeper than you might first think. It is a very casual watch for the most part but really picks up near the end. It\'s the type of anime where they slowly build it up to form a story of substance when you least expect it, however without giving any spoilers I must say I hated the ending.The art was average so I gave it a 7, nothing special, but nothing bad. I didn\'t really pay much attention to it to be honest, what more can I say. It\'s exactly what you would expect from a 2004 anime I guess. There is no special style or effect that sets it apart from the rest, but not many animes are set in deserts, so it was something new for me.I gave the sound/music an 8 because I found it to be above average. Some of the music was actually very likable and it managed to set the atmosphere perfectly most of the time. They definitely did a better job than a vast amount of other anime I\'ve seen - the music actually plays a large role in the immersion factor and without it, it just wouldn\'t be the same.The characters in this anime deserve a 9 or even a 10 because they have unique personalities that differ from the common unrealistic characters we see in a lot of animes (well except for the big breasted women - what was her name again? Oh, Junko!). People like Kanta are all too willing to sell children like they\'re objects, and seemingly innocent children are all too willing to commit the worste of crimes.My enjoyment factor for this anime was definitely a 9, but I only say that after watching the whole thing. Even in the slow paced episodes I didn\'t have to force myself to watch, it was simply enjoyable either way. However, I actually put this anime on hold after only a few episodes because it felt too casual and lacking a deep enough story. I later came back to watch the rest and within the next two days I had finished the series.Overall I give this anime a definite 9 and others may not agree with me on that but I think this is going to be one of those classics people look back on as a unique piece of work with qualities that can only be synthetically replicated. It\'s the type of anime I would like to see more of, because it\'s a refreshing change from all the stereotypical anime. simply does what it takes to stay alive, without any regard for the emotions or well being of others.

Some call these perverted moments as fanservice that disrupts flow of the show. Newsflash: Perversion and boobies are a major part of this anime. Unlike what many other reviewers say, it is not fanservice. It is the actual content of the show and reflects upon the innate nature of protagonist.  Consider Fairy Tail for example, the boobies shown in that anime/manga are fanservice, because they add nothing to the events around them. This...series however, revolves around boobies about quarter of the time.Despite what the name of the anime and image of protagonist wearing a weird helmet suggests, make no mistake, Sunabozu aka Desert Punk is one of the manliest anime there is. Truly it is one of the fewest masculine shows out there and when I say man, I mean an adult man, 20s and above. This is not to say that the younger ones wont appreciate it, but they wont empathize with the protagonist as much as somewhat older ones do. This is one of the manliest anime I have watched that does not include a Macho/Alpha male protagonist that powers up in the moments of distress and saves the world with his strength and idealism.Now I am not the kind of elite reviewer who rates anime based on the animation, soundtrack, plot etc. I hate breaking things down and its just not my style, even though I have done that a couple of times in the past and failed miserably. So I will get to the point and keep things simple.World: Desert Punk is set in a post apocalyptic world which comprises of deserts throughout the planet. Very similar to Trigun as far as the world goes. People now live with somewhat rudimentary technology and everything all the scientific breakthroughs before the apocalypse supposedly became inaccessible after the calamity. Currently there are one or several Governmental bodies who control majority of resources. Then you have the weak and poor desert folk who are scattered across the desert and barely survive. Our protagonist is a mercenary/freelancer that lives among poor desert people.Protagonist: Protagonist is a hybrid of Vash and Gintoki from Gintama. He is extremely perverted, in fact half of his ambition revolves around boobies and women, which is why I say somewhat older males can empathize with him. He is similar to Gintoki in that he appears as stupid in general, but is very pragmatic and witty. The desert is all about survival of the fittest and the protagonist\'s cunning ways help him out-duel his opponents more often than not. He has pragmatic view about the world where he accepts the cruel fate of environment and weakness as it is and does his best to survive while not generally caring much about others around him. This is where I believe regular Shonen lovers will not like the protagonist as much, but such a character is closer to reality. A bunch of interesting characters are introduced as the anime goes on.Plot: It starts out as having no plot and is episodic. The anime starts out very funny but somewhat weak in first two episodes, but becomes more and more entertaining as you progress. After 10 or so episodes you will realize that even though the anime to an extent is still episodic, there is some world building going on and greater things are about to come. The first half of the anime is different from the second half very much like Trigun where things get serious. Well in this one things do get serious, but there is still a lot of humor. Overall it has some elements of a coup at the very end which will keep the viewer very entertained.I was able to empathize with the characters and found the story very entertaining. But it falls short of greatness because of one major reason. There is a major master-student bond formed between the protagonist and a main character, but there are no scenes that make us appreciate their bond because the protagonist almost comes off like a jerk who considers his student as a servant, but not as a protege. That emotional aspect is what makes good anime GRREAT and it was missing in this one.I thoroughly enjoyed every second I spent on this anime, including the first few episodes as well which were inferior in comparison to rest of the series, but very entertaining in their own right. 8/10 series however, revolves around boobies about quarter of the time.Despite what the name of the anime and image of protagonist wearing a weird helmet suggests, make no mistake, Sunabozu aka Desert Punk is one of the manliest anime there is.

As the episodes continue they try to edgelord Sunabouzu and as they all do... he becomes deeply unlikable. A real shame.There are some absolute stand out episodes where Sunabouzu/Kanta is written correctly, and is great, played well for the fool he is, but also good natured and...good hearted. They missed a total beat and instead went with the edgelord and messed it all up. There are some surprisingly observant gender politics in amongst this tho - for instance where Taiko calls out Junko for being the crappy manipulative women she is. Makes a change from the normal rubbish of Holy Women that is often inflicted upon us.Animation and style are great.One of the few dust punk things to exist, so gets extra points.Great original OP and as seems to be traditional with anime they throw this away in the second half for an awful one.There's also a few moments where I'm pretty sure they've stolen the Monkey Island Scumm Bar music, which... well you get double monkey bonus points for having the brass monkey balls to steal a piratey theme from a bunch of pirates!I don't regret watching it, I didn't feel like giving up, but it's definitely flawed, and could have been a lot better. good hearted.

itching to shoot the F word like a mad apache helicopter\'s guns.As i was saying today is the turn of Desert Punk to get some love.Let me see..Yeah got the lube,got the batteries,got some duct tape..Yup all is well.So storywise DP(fucking lol) is a post apocalyptic anime that depicts the story of one kid,whose name i cannot bother to remember so from now on he is the horny MF.That horny MF as you\'d expect is a bounty hunter who does all...sorts of jobs for all sorts of people.Basically a whore but with a gun and with more money.But because he thinks more with his dick rather than his actual brain he gets in all sorts of trouble and ends up the one getting fucked over and over and over again.Sounds terrible?That\'s cause it is terrible.I mean yeah compared to your basic school setting this is heaven on earth..Yeah i thought so too.Don\'t get me wrong as a premise it\'s lovely and different-ish,but as for the execution?That where things go wrong.Cause ok at first the idea of-getting some crazy mercenary shit done,shit that nobody else can pull off and then for some reason some crazy ass bitch with tits the size of the sun appears,he falls for her ""charms"" and she takes advantage of that and leaves him penniless and tied up like a pig ready to be slaughtered-is funny at first but when you do the same thing over and over till your life is as miserable as your marriage....Then it becomes a huge problem.And i\'m sorry but repeating the same exact joke for 24 eps is fucking lazy,lame,ridiculous and pathetic.Honestly if you want to watch boobs and basic as fuck boobs humour then there\'s no shortage of animes out there that do a much better job and have way more in store as far as stories go.But that\'s not the only problem.The biggest of them all is the animation.I need you to keep in mind that this cancer was released in 2004.And if you don\'t remember all that well it was the same time animes like Elfen Lied were being also released,hell even Bleach and Fullmetal Alchemist.Compare those titles or any title for that matter with the animation of this piece of shit.The characters are like they were from 1950\'s and the whole scenery was just a desert and some houses..It beggars belief how much of a bad job they did with this one.Sure there were moments where DP was good enough to be clasified as watchable..And that lip sync...Oh my freaking god even in the sub version the lip sync was retarted.As for the characters themselves?Well there was the MC and a hugely boobed babe who always plays him for a fool,another kid girl who follows the MC around for some reason...And the baddies of the week.And again as a thought these characters had something interesting.But on screen those thoughts weren\'t delivered...Things like backstory or any sort of story?Nope not a damn thing....Oh and don\'t think that they grow as the series goes on cause they don\'t.Stale as a stale dead desert dog.The only way this anime can make sense,is if you\'re a 10 yr old cause it has at least some action scenes.But as a comedy-and a comedy that people praise like Jesus-this feels as funny as waking up in the night to find your parents shot in the head by some lunatic.It makes the same jokes,does the same basic plot,over and over again.It\'s value lies within the first 4 eps and i\'m being too generous here.Any episode after that is like groundhog\'s day.Good things about it?The opening song and that\'s it..4 eps worth of anime and a song.If you want an anime that plays the same thing like a broken record then by all means go ahead. sorts of jobs for all sorts of people.Basically a whore but with a gun and with more money.But because he thinks more with his dick rather than his actual brain he gets in all sorts of trouble

anime that is set in a world resulted in a major climate change that affects the very foundation of humanity. The world became a wasteland surrounded by endless desert making the environment hostile to live in. The world is in dystopia where only the strongest can live and only with those with power can ruled and control the world. Peace and order doesn’t exist in this new era.This is the first impression desert punk present in its premise that is very intriguing. The story follows the adventures of Mizuno, Kanta a mercenary popularly known by many names but he...was well known by the alias as the “Desert Punk”, the ghost of the desert and respected by other mercenaries alike.The anime provides action and adventure since the main character is moving around place to place completing his assign task to earn money and to survive the harsh living in the desert.(Overview)Plot (6/10) Above AverageThere are several other anime titles that have identical themes and some dated back from the 80’s and 90’s where global climate change dystopia is a common theme in ending human civilization. Usually this kind of themes focuses on its characters travelling and meeting new people along the way but desert punk is different for it focuses on the complex mission of mercenaries doing the job for money.The premise provides very good action and military combat tactics which pretty impressive. Mercenaries carry out their jobs using clever tricks and intellectual planning to outsmart their enemy. The anime also present the harsh condition living in the desert where only people with money can live a normal life and people who doesn’t is either be sold for prostitution or drive harder to be  become the dog the government or become a convict that survive by looting the weak.The negative aspects that desert punk has that will offend its audience are the boob fan service and the boob shot it has. It also had an episode dedicated for it, lots of sex jokes and bad humor. The fan service is not bad but actually it exceptional in this kind of premise it further increase how indecent the current society is. The problem of desert punk is that the fan service is presented in a comedic sense making it not serious and it’s also affects the mood for it will lessen the tension.Characters (5/10) AverageThe characters in desert punk are plain because they don’t have a single unique trait to remember them by. The only character that is very different and memorable from the cast is the main protagonist Kanta. I didn’t even like the protagonist for he is a big pervert, a cowardly loser, a government lap dog, a selfish bastard and all the negative words you can throw at him but his is without a doubt a highly intelligent person and experience soldier who win’s not because of plot armor but with shear tactics and combat experience and that is all. I only love his abilities but not his personality.As the story progresses we are introduce to another main character and that’s Kanta apprentice and only character that better understood our pitiful protagonist and her name is Koizumi, Taiko. Nothing much is known about her history but one thing is for sure and that she is the only develop character I seen throughout the series.As for the mercenaries that kanta hang along with are far from being likable for me. My reason is that they are just there to provide support fire while Kanta get the credits. I like the idea mercenaries wearing special suits to provide them with some combat advantages over it foes which why they can handle their jobs properly and can plan ahead.The only weak point is that because there is no personality that can stand out and most of the characters are undeveloped even with an episode span doubling to your regular 12 episode series it isn’t enough to see the characters changing. Only Koizumi I have seen changed.Sound and Music (6/10) FunI like the 1st opening for it gives the desert action atmosphere and it catchy sounds. The 2nd opening is just mediocre and by the way I heard the English and Japanese version so I can tell its lyrics properly. The 1st ending is funny and kiddy for most of the point but I still liked it.  The 2nd ending was beautiful for it presented the harsh living and the bloody war of the desert while sparking some hopes of peace and tranquility. And finally the background music, it’s ok and the background music from the action is good in bringing up some tension.Art style (6/10) GoodThe character design is just plain and simple. The gals have no distinct appearances except their boobs but yeah the art design is appropriate for its theme for you take in account the seriousness of the premise. It’s kind of awkward seeing characters in a dystopia setting with girls pink hair and rainbow color attires. I can say the clothing are realistic for the male’s wearing proper clothes in battle and the suits is logically smart for it provide as tactical advantage in fighting in the desert. No ridiculous cosplay outfits here that doesn’t make any sense.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodI like the action and especially how tactically smart the protagonist can be in terms of actual combat. I like Taiko’s character development. The Dub version is good for it really matches the character’s voices and it is funnier and cleverer in deliverance of speech. Watched this anime 3 times so far and that’s why even with the low factor from the elements I still give my personal score of 7.Overall (6/10) Above AverageDesert Punk is fun to watch anime but don’t expect too much because the story didn’t provide a satisfying ending. Story progression is close to minimal as the ending seems like it didn’t achieve anything and everything is still the way it is with little changes.Recommendation:The best anime I can recommend with a desert setting with big boys using big guns that deals with convicts and cool at the same is “Trigun” it’s the best of its kind.For a little similar story concerning with mercenaries hired for cash I highly recommend “Cowboy Bebop” the little difference here is that the characters are bounty hunters in a space theme genre but the coolness is in the air. was well known by the alias as the “Desert Punk”, the ghost of the desert and respected by other mercenaries alike.The anime provides action and adventure since the main character is moving around place to place completing his assign task to earn money and to survive the harsh living in the desert.(Overview)Plot (6/10) Above AverageThere are several other anime titles that have identical themes and some dated back from the 80’s and 90’s where global climate change dystopia is a common theme in ending human civilization. Usually this kind of themes focuses on its characters travelling and meeting new people along the way but desert punk is different for it focuses on the complex mission of mercenaries doing the job for money.The premise provides very good action and military combat tactics which pretty impressive. Mercenaries carry out their jobs using clever tricks and intellectual planning to outsmart their enemy. The anime also present the harsh condition living in the desert where only people with money can live a normal life and people who doesn’t is either be sold for prostitution or drive harder to be  become the dog the government or become a convict that survive by looting the weak.The negative aspects that desert punk has that will offend its audience are the boob fan service and the boob shot it has. It also had an episode dedicated for it, lots of sex jokes and bad humor. The fan service is not bad but actually it exceptional in this kind of premise it further increase how indecent the current society is. The problem of desert punk is that the fan service is presented in a comedic sense making it not serious and it’s also affects the mood for it will lessen the tension.Characters (5/10) AverageThe characters in desert punk are plain because they don’t have a single unique trait to remember them by. The only character that is very different and memorable from the cast is the main protagonist Kanta. I didn’t even like the protagonist for he is a big pervert, a cowardly loser, a government lap dog, a selfish bastard and all the negative words you can throw at him but his is without a doubt a highly intelligent person and experience soldier who win’s not because of plot armor but with shear tactics and combat experience and that is all.

The story of Desert Punk takes place in the Great Kanto Desert. It is about the adventures and shenanigans of famed mercenary, Kanta Mizuno, also known as Desert Punk.  He acquired his legendary reputation due to his seemingly-incredible feats while on the job. He never fails to complete a mission due to his good luck, practicality, sharp wit, and specialist equipment. Desert Punk is far from a hero, as a matter of fact, he is a scoundrel....As accomplished as he may be, he is widely thought of as a despicable person.  He is outwardly obsessed with sex, and he is an unapologetic narcissist. These glaring character flaws lead to a lot of hijinks and crude humor throughout the series.Why to watch:With the setting being in a post apocalyptic desert, this anime doesn't take itself seriously one bit. If you are looking for a light hearted, comedic adventure, Desert Punk is the show for you.  Are you a  fan of over the top, quirky and crude humor?  This show is definitely for you. Do you like bullet storms and explosions? This show is definitely for you.  While Kanta isn't a saintly example of morality by any stretch, you can't help but be entertained with his hilarious interactions and his grandiose self indulgent monologues. Not to mention, he is still a crack mercenary. Watching his mastery with a gun and his ace tactics is only slightly overshadowed by his great comedy. With a 26 episode run, this series can be easily and quickly  finished in a few sittings, but the short run time will definitely leave you wanting more. Desert Punk is most certainly an underrated gem. As accomplished as he may be, he is widely thought of as a despicable person.

Please be patient to read through all my efforts on describing why i gave these scores, as I feel like I\'ve given it a honest review!Story:The story started off very good, up until the final episodes where it kind of got messy. I personally disliked the few episodes starring Kosuna as she is not the main character in the story and I really hated her awkward laughter....The episodes before the final 5~ish resembled episodes from Keroro Gunso, where the episodes were telling a story per episode. I found this very amusing and it kept things fresh for me. I guess what brought the marks down are the final few as it really made me feel like this anime was kinda ruined.Art:Well aside from the land features, weapons, hot babes (Junko Asagiri), and awkward libido animations, the art was not THAT great. I disliked the facial features portrayed on the male characters, not that I\'m gay cuz clearly i was magnetized because of Junko~!. Anyways, the art wouldn\'t what I would call "" Subarashi"" but certainly its okay~.Sound:Not too many soundtracks were produced, therefore there was a constant lack of ""fresh"" music as it kept playing the same song over and over at certain times. The opening and closing themes were barely passable, but not horrendous. I guess this wasn\'t a strong part of the anime.Character:Great characters! Don\'t get misguided by that comment though...by great characters, I mean they had the POTENTIAL to be great characters with superb depth, but the series was cut short, therefore i never knew what happened to some of the them. Tsk tsk...what a waste...could\'ve been a legit 10/10Enjoyment:Despite the above average ratings in the past few sections, I felt this anime was highly enjoyable! It seemed like to me as it was one of those anime that could suck me into their world and made me want to be a part of it! This is definitely something one could use to relieve the stress as it had me laughing my butt off till near the end!Overall:Solid 8/10. Could have been better, but as usual, near the end of a series, producers speed things up and ruin the anime...Like Dragonaut-The Resonance-, I felt like this anime was made very well but could have been better. Although I\'m giving an honest review here, I definitely gave it a 10/10 on the ""add to list"" option~! You\'ll see why once you start watching~!

The story is intriguing with lots of twists, but the first few episodes are quite episodic, and relying a lot on ""boobs"" jokes, heck, even when there are no large boobs in the episode, Sunabozu would apologise for it.The middle part, especially those episodes with no ""boob"" woman, are really good and shows the various aspects of the big picture of the Kanto Desert, though still episodic.The ending part, particularly ep 18 onwards, is really deep, but the conclusion was quite disappointing and confusing, thus I would only give the story a 7.Overall for...the story, it was mostly interesting, but there were a lot of inconsistencies regarding how some characters disappear and reappear, how they manage to stay alive and so on. Sometimes, there is just so much inconsistency in the storyline and unexplained events (e.g. surviving explosions) that I was left wondering more and enjoying less of this anime.Art: 9The art was basically very good given how old this series is, so no complains about it, sometimes 3D seems to be involved too. Only issue is sometimes the animation is not so smooth.Sound: 9Great VA, distinctive voices for most characters, good OP and ED.Character: 5The character portion of this anime is probably the most confusing and inferior out of all the other grading categories. Aside from strange disappearances and reappearances of some characters, there were several inconsistencies in personalities with little or no explanation. And somehow the characters seem to laugh off some of the more important character mysteries, or simply act as if they were never a problem.Moreover, some of the main characters, esp Sunabouzu  and Junko, seem to carrying several character traits that sometimes contradict each other, and especially the character of Sunabouzu seems to be very inconsistent between the first and middle, and the last part of the anime.Enjoyment: 7Overall it\'s enjoyable, since the series focuses on lightening dark topics with jokes and ""laugh it off situations"". However, the last part of the storyline really killed a lot of enjoyment from the first and middle parts ( score 9).Overall: 7It is a great show overall, but try not to think too much about the topics covered since some of it is very dark but due to the poor presentation it is neither appropriately serious nor funny.

There's a lot of great action and characters, with some great humor that will have you rolling for hours. Along with that, you could say that this anime is ecchi, due to all the references to sex and breasts, but it doesn't get in the way.I give this one an 8/10.

A pleasant surprise risen from its initial disappointment. I purchased desert punk with absolutely no knowledge of what it was about. The box set looked cool, the title sounded cool, the screen shots on the back were cool. It seemed like a thrilling action, so I took a leap of faith and bought it. Within the first few seconds of the opening I felt a giant sweat drop drip down the back of my head. I was infuriated, but hey I had already paid for it so I decided to give it a shot. I loved it. Not at all what I...expected but a great find nonetheless.Finally a main character that takes every course of action that most of us probably would.

Indeed, several plot points are introduced and many seem to be still untied at the end. This is all assuming you get past the first few episodes.You see, Sunabozu is a nightmare to watch during the first ten episodes or so. The episodic stories are bland at best, but mostly they’re just horrific. I honestly considered dropping after the first episode. Ironically, if you can make it past these beginning episodes, you’ll find that the story begins to take a nice climb into good territory. Things start...to shape up quickly in episodes 11-19 and I was beginning to think that the show might end on a high note, a welcome treat to the suffering I endured. Kanta and Kosuna's relationship blossom into a pupil-student relationship worth watching, Junko Asagiri begins to show she is more than just tits and the plot becomes genuinely interesting. Then you’re treated to an incredible spiral of shit that just leads you to either confusion, frustration, anger or some combination of all three at the end.“But this ecchi,” you say. “It's not about the storyline.” I suppose. While ecchi isn’t my first choice of genre, I generally don’t mind dirty jokes. Furthermore, the deeper and more twisted the joke, the funnier it becomes to me. Yet, most of Sunabozu's “jokes” are what I spent my days thinking about at 11 years old. Truthfully, there are only so many times giant-tits-to-the-face is funny. Most of the jokes are over used in the front half of the show. You see, as the show goes on, they seem to tone down the ecchi and it just makes the first few episodes stick out like giant sore thumbs.Then there’s the art. Oh, dear God. The characters are drawn well enough for an early 2000s anime, but the background is so repetitive. Sure, it's a desert, so there should be some repetition. Yet, not so much that literally everything is identical. Honestly, at least in the first part of the series, every ghost city is the same building.Interestingly enough, I think the soundtrack is pretty awesome. This might legitimately be the only point that I have to praise. Most of it, especially early on, is a fusion of funk and jazz. It really works well for what's being depicted. I would go out of my way to listen to some of the music again. However, the voice acting (Japanese) is painful. If I have to listen to Kanta or Kosuna laugh one more time, I might drown myself in Junko's tits. Not laughing of course, because I’ve seen that joke before.Characters are mostly well developed, but their arcs don’t seem to lead anywhere. Sprinkle in some bullshittery at the end and you'll realize that except for Kanta, you were never given a reason to care about any of the characters. Actually, including Kanta, because any feelings you had for him will be stripped like a handyman in the desert. Yeah, all this leads to mediocre characters at best. Honestly, the show could have benefited from more Junko air time, even if it meant sitting through more tit-to-face jokes. I felt like she was one of the most well developed characters, no pun intended, and the lack of her use was wasted throughout the series.Sunabozu is a mediocre show, that gives you some enjoyment, has storyline that teases you more than Junko's tits, and has mediocre, over used sexual innuendos that I would've used as material when I was eleven. The only reason I would suggest Sonabozu is for Junko and you'll find that she’s absent much of the storyline, so it's probably not worth your time. to shape up quickly in episodes 11-19 and I was beginning to think that the show might end on a high note, a welcome treat to the suffering I endured.

The story takes place in a post apocalyptic earth in the year around 4000. Japan became a desert and the people live under very hard circumstances . Kanta is a so called handyman, which means he takes on any job (robbery, kidnapping, odd jobs, bodyguard, etc) to make money. But Kanta is not your everyday handyman, he is very successful and made a name for himself....He is called the legendary desert ghost sonabouzo. On one of his jobs he gets to know Taiko , who becomes his pupil, together they do various handyman-jobs.Unintentionally Kanta meets many more or less powerful ambitious people and gets into a conflict with the government, this all leads eventually into a rebellion.Art:The art was nice it fit the storySound:Was very chilling and gav ethe anime a nice vibe.Characters:Kanta Mizuno: He is  a villain who does anything for money. He is a psychopath who is obsessed with sex and he is ready to do almost anything to get it. He has  a bitter heart and believes the only way to live in the desert is to abuse the weak and kill the strong. There is not much character development, but his character is well definedKoizumi, Taiko: She is a 13 - 14 year old girl and Mizunos pupil. She is very talented and a quick learner. She is cheerful most of the time. She has some character development, but most of the time she remains in her role as pupil and later in the role as sensai.Asagiri, Junko: She is a handyman. She is skilled and uses sex-obsessed man like Kanta to get what she needs for her job. She is cold-hearted and money obsessed. No charcter developemntThe relations between the characters is nicely executed and it can be very funny which is a huge plus.Enjoyment:I found the show very enjoying. I would have given it a ten, it had real potential, the execution of story is good too considering that its another post-apocalyptic show..but........ first of all there was no real character development and you always wait that Kanta change, but it will never happen. There is another major disappointment and that\'s the ending, this is one of those shows where you get the feeling that they just stopped in the middle of the show because they ran out of funds. The end is very fast-paced compared to the  beginning, which si slowpaced, which make sit a bit unbalanced. The end is rushed and downgrades the whole experience.OverallI recommend you this because its something different you will see lots of villains interacting and you have  a somehow nice plot. But you still will be unsatisfied because the ending fails. He is called the legendary desert ghost sonabouzo.

She is skilled and uses sex-obsessed man like Kanta to get what she needs for her job. She is cold-hearted and money obsessed. No charcter developemntThe relations between the characters is nicely executed and it can be very funny which is a huge plus.Enjoyment:I found the show very enjoying. I would have given it a ten, it had real potential, the execution of story is good too considering that its another post-apocalyptic show..but........ first of all there was no real character development and you always wait that Kanta change, but it will never happen. There is another major disappointment and that\'s the ending, this is one of those shows where you get the feeling that they just stopped in the middle of the show because they ran out of funds. The end is very fast-paced compared to the  beginning, which si slowpaced, which make sit a bit unbalanced. The end is rushed and downgrades the whole experience.OverallI recommend you this because its something different you will see lots of villains interacting and you have  a somehow nice plot. But you still will be unsatisfied because the ending fails.', 'What a breath of fresh air!i know its an old anime, but the art style holds up, fantastic voice acting , i say that the voice acting that carries the entire show, all voices fit perfectly, its like gintama, the voice actors make the anime shine, highly recommendedIs the story unique?yesIf it was predictableNo, i did not know where the hell it is goingDo you think the art style is fitting for the story?...absolutelyWere the characters well-rounded?yes!Did they have flaws and strengthsIts a ruthless world and all are flowed, if you are nice you are screwed. absolutelyWere the characters well-rounded?yes!Did they have flaws and strengthsIts a ruthless world and all are flowed, if you are nice you are screwed.', 'The desert is a harsh place to live in, in this inhospitable environment where commodities are scarce and the only thing constant is the lawlessness of the land, who do you trust and who should you suspect? Your closest friend could also be your worst enemy tomorrow.From this dystopian setting of a world where malice, poverty and betrayal are common daily routine, comes a surprisingly VERY comedic lighthearted tale of a young man and his even younger apprentice. Watch as this comedic duo tackle the challenges of surviving the desert, through plots of deceit and betrayal, all to earn a quick buck to repay debts...they carelessly make. In a neverending cycle of earning money and losing money.But this show is more than just comedic sketches and plot twist jokes. The show has a surprisingly deep plotline and character development. Underneath the seemingly random odd jobs the characters do, the show secretly builds up a plot which engages the characters to make hard choices towards the end, something I can only describe as either the most bitter ending to a great series or the greatest unfinished love story ever told; Sunabouzu is a great watch for anyone looking for a lighthearted comedy which also has a good plot. they carelessly make.

The two are synonymous and if you do not wish to see or hear this kind of humor you should turn away now. If you can get past this, however, you will find that it is a thoroughly enjoyable show.The main character, Kanta ""Desert Punk"" Mizuno, is your usual bad ass mercenary who is on a constant quest to get laid throughout the show. Of course, he ends up failing in his quest but the things about his fails (and even some of his triumphs) is...that they are all so outrageously far fetched that you can\'t help but laugh at him when this happens. What only makes it funnier is the fact that Kanta is no dummy. When an enemy appears and the odds are against him he buckles down and turns into a strategically-minded killing machine.It is not just Kanta who is a memorable character but also the entire cast. There is Junko, the big breasted Femme Fatale who has him on a leash begging like a dog. Kosuna, the loyal apprentice of Kanta. The Machine Gun Brothers, Fuyuo Kawaguchi the oldest, Akio Kawaguchi the middle and Haruo Kawaguchi the youngest, who were childhood friends of Kanta.To conclude, Desert Punk (Sunabōzu) is a great show with a lot of awesome action scenes and humor.

Despite being flawed, the show has qualities that make it more than just the sum of its parts.The protagonist, Kanta, is a young man who often succumbs to his hormones, leading to some ecchi scenes that may not be everyone's cup of tea. Despite this, I appreciate that the show provides a window into the protagonist's mind.While the show's first half is episodic, it is not without merit. It serves to develop the main character and key supporting characters. During this time, we...learn that reputations and fortunes are fleeting in the Kanto Desert, and a fall from grace is constantly looming. The first half is also humorous.The second half begins in a similar fashion, but the missions become more interconnected, leading to an overarching narrative that culminates in a twist ending. Unfortunately, the ending feels rushed and leaves some loose ends. Although it's a good twist, the show would have benefited from a few more episodes to tie up loose ends.With its unique art style, the animation is generally good, although some of the buildings could be improved. The combat scenes are sharp, clear, and imaginative. The sound is also solid, with some standout opening and ending themes and decent combat sound effects. Both the Japanese and English dubs are well done, with the latter doing an excellent job of adapting the dialogue to sound natural and amusing.Although the main character, Desert Punk, doesn't undergo much growth, he remains a likable character. The supporting characters in the first half are well-developed, but the later ones are not fleshed out enough.

Much like its foul-mouthed protagonist, this show's a maverick that doesn't care what you think. Desert Punk was a nostalgic rediscovery for me, as I remember watching a fair bit of it on Toonami back in the day, and it's always a pleasure to dive back in to something like that. However, first I have to say this show joins those for which the...dub is just simply better than the sub. The dub is transformative, and there is a lot of wit and banter that the English dub brings to the table, as well as the flawless voice casting. Now, beginning with the story, it's pretty typical for a 2003 Shonen romp. Establish the world, go on adventures and get into trouble, introduce new characters that learn and grow, get some nice filler episodes in there, then come up with a finale that leaves people satisfied. However, given that Kanta, the Desert Punk, is an amoral protagonist, the show fails to deliver on that last part in my opinion, and ends with a weird menagerie of macguffins and ending exposition that doesn't explain or justify anything. But, despite that, I've got to say the ride was fun, and the ending was in character. The dialogue is hilarious, and there are so many golden moments throughout that just had me rolling, one-liners and quips are a dime a dozen in this show but each and every one was on some level funny.\xa0 Also, fair warning, this show is horny, very, very horny, and Kanta is a misogynist. For as much as terms like this are tired and overused today, in this instance I do not say this as a joke or from a place of moral outrage- He's one of the few characters I've seen that has that aspect deliberately written into him, and that is an interesting decision. However, even with this aspect of him front and center, a lot of the women aren't actually written how Kanta views them, so it becomes clear that the disconnect between his approach to them and the real world is meant to highlight who he is as a character- an amoral, and often immoral, protagonist. The art itself is typical for an early 2000s anime, but I'm into that sort of thing so I liked it. The art direction, however, is a real strength, and I find the way they decided to conceptually depict the world distinct, memorable, and engaging. Everything from character design to buildings and backgrounds, I found the world very well made and believable in the context of the show. Also, like I said, often very horny. The sound was above average for a show of its time, and it shines in the crunching of boots on sand and the whistle of bullets. The music is also catchy, while pretty limited, and the intro for the first 12 episodes is a total banger. Characterization is ok, but leaves something to be desired. Kanta is the most fleshed out, but is an unmitigated douche with no redeeming traits or qualities other than he knows how to survive in the desert and survive well, and occasionally look cool doing it. He throws his friends under the bus for a quick profit and exploits whoever he gets the opportunity to exploit. Having said all that, he is the perfect main character for this show. Everybody else comes off just a little flat, but not flat enough to be boring or to not make a difference. Their presence is important, it's just that this is all very clearly a show that is driven by the Desert Punk and his personality. Overall I enjoyed the show, not as much as I did back in the day when I first saw it on Toonami, but it's still a genuinely fun watch. Nothing groundbreaking here, just a solid show that makes a lot of forgivable mistakes, and if you can stomach the main character and appreciate the comedic value of his persona, then you're in for a good time. dub is just simply better than the sub.

He owns his perversions, he follows his instincts, then he gets slammed on the face and stomped into the ground afterwards due to it. The MC is crazy capable, crazy strong, almost like a one man army, but him having these big character flaws and frankly unlikable personality, makes you cheer for when he is a badass, while also cheer when he messes up and is put into a usually hilarious situation. The characters are a 10/10 for this anime. The female characters in this series are manipulative, sneaky and generally just bad people, just like all the other characters, which fits perfectly with the setting.The story itself is held up by the setting and characters, because without that it\'s pretty poor and most episodes turn out to be fillers which didn\'t change anything in the overall story. I\'d give it 7.5, because the characters, comedy and setting is just so good.Art is pretty unique, the male characters are often ugly, sleazy looking, while a lot of the women also look like that (other than the few pretties, who often mess with the MC).I will give the enjoyment of this anime a 8.5-9/10. I\'ll be honest, once you understand that the episode is a filler, then that does take the enjoyment down a notch, but the comedy, the characters and just the overall writing makes it a joy to watch.Sound - It has suitable soundtrack for the occasion, it didn\'t have anything you\'d listen to on your free time, other than the ED 8/10. I\'ll add in the English VA, which was easily a 10/10, soundtrack + VA = 9/10 for me.Overall score for me is a 9/10, it\'s an easy recommendation if you don\'t mind having main characters who are scum, but hilarious in whatever they do.

Before I started watching it, I thought it would be a decently good show that didnt get a lot of traction. However, upon finishing it, I am really surprised how such a great show has a rating lower than it deserves, and isnt popular at all, even for a 00s anime.Story - 9/10It's got a great stor in a desert dystopian setting, although the story takes half the show to develop (which I think is a common trait for most shows during this time...period; first half is episodic and filled with humour, while the second half gets to the solid plot, and probably has a sad/bittersweet ending). If you like dystopian stories, or plots about humanity regressing back in time, then this is perfect for you.Art - 10/10The thing that attracted me to the show initially was not just that it was similar to Trigun, but the artwork. The animation isnt the best, but the art and colour palette was satisfying for sure! Just showing the desert during the day, a bright yellow to represend sand, and a bright blue to represent the sky, was aesthetically pleasing. The art feels smooth, and not forced. The animation was also pretty decent, and as someone who loves 90s and 00s shows, this was all I asked for.Sound - 8/10The first half had one of the best OP and ED easily, while the second half wasn't good imo. The background music during the show was decent, not great, but it still added to the mood of the show.Characters - 10/10The characters made this show very enjoyable. You have Sunabouzu, the protagonist, who's extremely skilled, but equally perverted and moronic. His student, Taiko, shows a transition in character from a helpless child to a shrewd and cunning girl. Asagiri Junko is another cunning woman who uses people to make her ends meet. Amaguro is another legendary character who packs good action and humour. Overall, it's the characters that dominated the show.Enjoyment - 11/10Overall it was very enjoyable and always kept me wanting more, which is the best thing an anime can do.

However, it runs into the same problems that seem to plague the comedy genre in all media. the first 3/4 of this show are just plain good fun with no real overarching plot, and more focusing on the individual day to day adventures of Desert Punk, a mercenary of the Great Kanto Desert. But in the last five or so episodes, it seems that the writers felt they needed to throw a cohesive story in to end the series off, and it results...in a short story arc with no conclusion that feels like either should've been introduced much sooner in the season, or not at all. In the end however, Desert Punk was a fun time filled with hilarious characters and even better interactions, but the ending of the show seems to change the entire thing from a casual comedy to a generic post-apocalypse action show. in a short story arc with no conclusion that feels like either should've been introduced much sooner in the season, or not at all.

Ai no Wakakusa Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2548/Ai_no_Wakakusa_Monogatari,"[""I have been recently going through the old World Masterpiece Theater collection and this one is a very good adaptation of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The story is about the March family having to make ends meet in Newport (Concord), Massachusetts during the back drop of the American Civil War. The show also takes some liberties on the original story in a respectful way, mostly adding more back story to the March family and how they came to be at the beginning of the book.The characters are balanced, Amy tends to be very unlikeable in this show at first. But you begin...to understand her mindset as a child during the progression of the story. Jo is always assertive, but has an underling self doubt. Meg feels as though she has to help fill in a mother role for her sisters and not live out her life. And Beth is very quite and self sacrificing even if it is a detriment to her self. I think how each character is so different is what made me really enjoy them.I really enjoyed the style, from what I understand it had some Studio Ghibli people working on it. The animation is above average for the time period, which surprised me but I guess that is typical for WMT. The art direction/design is similar to that of My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service.The sound and music are very fitting, the dubbed version has new ending and opening English tracks. But oddly all of the other music is left in place, I do not see this very often from shows during the 1980s.I saw some of it subbed and all of it dubbed. The dub is fine for the 1980s period nothing embarrassing acting wise, and completely watchable. I would like to see it again subbed, but there does not appear to be any place at the moment to watch it completely. The dub however, is complete on Amazon Prime as I write this.Overall I would recommend this show to people that like the work of Studio Ghibli, Louisa May Alcott, and PBS dramas.

It is based on the classic autobiographical book ""Little Women"" by Louisa May Alcott.I admire the story of this anime, even though at a certain point it got a bit stale and uninteresting.There are many interesting things in this anime, and also many exciting things, like saving a slave who escaped from...the battlefield in the war (this happened in the author\'s lifetime).At the request of Frederic, father of all the girls in the anime, they move into the house of their aunt, Martha. Martha is a bit of a grumpy person, as she thinks that most people only want her money, this because of her nephew who is always trying to extort her. The March family is quite honest, and proves that this is not their goal; they really just needed a place to live.-When it comes to the characters, there is not much to complain about, because almost all of them are good. All the women in the March family are good characters.Josephine is the one with the most focus, but she is not my favorite character in the novel. I like Josephine, even more because of several attitudes that she took during the series. One example: She sold her hair when her mother needed money. Well, she looked more beautiful with short hair.Elisabeth is one of the characters I like the most. She has poor health, is a kind, thoughtful and rather shy girl who likes to play the piano.I really like it when she makes friends with Laurie\'s grandfather, as it is something quite natural.It was also a big impact when she witnessed something heavy that I won\'t mention. I really took pity on her.Amy:Amy, may be my favorite character. As much as she is spoiled and sometimes very naughty, she has a unique personality.I was very angry when she burned the story that Josephine was writing, just because Josephine didn\'t take her to a theater performance.Margaret:I don\'t know much to say about her, but I like the character.The conclusion at the end of her and Theodore\'s teacher\'s piece about her loving regardless of financial status is pretty good.Marmee, mother of the girls:I admire her a lot. She always advises her daughters to do the right things and is very kind. What touched me the most was when she donated her Christmas dinner to a poor family that needed food.I\'ve already talked a little bit about why I like the main characters, so I\'ll briefly talk about Laurie and her grandfather and Martha.Laurie:Laurie spends a lot of boredom studying at her grandfather\'s house, until he meets Josephine. He is a good guy and always helps others when he needs it.As the story goes on a relationship develops between him and Josephine, and everyone thinks they will be together, but unfortunately that didn\'t happen.Laurie\'s Grandfather:He is strict with his grandson, as he wants him to inherit his company.At first it seems that he is not so good, but he is gentle. He begins to admire the March family when he finds out that they donated their Christmas dinner to a family in need.He is kind enough to let Elisabeth come to his house to play the piano, and after a while he presents her with a piano, because hers was lost in her old house because of the war, and the one she has in her new house is old and has a bad sound.Martha:I already mentioned myself a little bit about her up there, so I\'ll just supplement a little bit.As much as she\'s kind of grouchy (with reasons that are cited in the anime), she\'s also good people. We see more of this as the anime goes on, with her relationship with the March family, specifically with Josephine.There comes a point where she wants to leave her inheritance to the girls of the March family, and this happens, reading the synopsis of the second season.-I talked more about the characters, because the focus of the anime is literally on the characters and their interactions. I didn\'t go into detail because I don\'t want to narrate the whole anime in this review.The technical part of the anime is ok.For those who want to see a Slice of Life with good characters and good interactions between them, I recommend this anime.For me, it declined a little in certain parts, but it is a good anime as a whole, this classic is worth checking out. the battlefield in the war (this happened in the author\'s lifetime).At the request of Frederic, father of all the girls in the anime, they move into the house of their aunt, Martha.

As much as she is spoiled and sometimes very naughty, she has a unique personality.I was very angry when she burned the story that Josephine was writing, just because Josephine didn\'t take her to a theater performance.Margaret:I don\'t know much to say about her, but I like the character.The conclusion at the end of her and Theodore\'s teacher\'s piece about her loving regardless of financial status is pretty good.Marmee, mother of the girls:I admire her a lot. She always advises her daughters to do the right things and is very kind. What touched me the most was when she donated her Christmas dinner to a poor family that needed food.I\'ve already talked a little bit about why I like the main characters, so I\'ll briefly talk about Laurie and her grandfather and Martha.Laurie:Laurie spends a lot of boredom studying at her grandfather\'s house, until he meets Josephine. He is a good guy and always helps others when he needs it.As the story goes on a relationship develops between him and Josephine, and everyone thinks they will be together, but unfortunately that didn\'t happen.Laurie\'s Grandfather:He is strict with his grandson, as he wants him to inherit his company.At first it seems that he is not so good, but he is gentle. He begins to admire the March family when he finds out that they donated their Christmas dinner to a family in need.He is kind enough to let Elisabeth come to his house to play the piano, and after a while he presents her with a piano, because hers was lost in her old house because of the war, and the one she has in her new house is old and has a bad sound.Martha:I already mentioned myself a little bit about her up there, so I\'ll just supplement a little bit.As much as she\'s kind of grouchy (with reasons that are cited in the anime), she\'s also good people. We see more of this as the anime goes on, with her relationship with the March family, specifically with Josephine.There comes a point where she wants to leave her inheritance to the girls of the March family, and this happens, reading the synopsis of the second season.-I talked more about the characters, because the focus of the anime is literally on the characters and their interactions. I didn\'t go into detail because I don\'t want to narrate the whole anime in this review.The technical part of the anime is ok.For those who want to see a Slice of Life with good characters and good interactions between them, I recommend this anime.For me, it declined a little in certain parts, but it is a good anime as a whole, this classic is worth checking out.']"

Doraemon Movie 25: Nobita no Wan Nyan Jikuuden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2656/Doraemon_Movie_25__Nobita_no_Wan_Nyan_Jikuuden,"['My overall take: Has hallmarks of a great Doraemon film, but story execution has room for improvement.In this movie, Nobita does something about the local stray problem by sending abandoned dogs and cats to a safe haven 300 million years ago. The stray animals then start their own civilization. This movie is a landmark, being the last film to come out of the classic Doraemon anime that started in 1979. Befitting the old anime series\' final cinematic hurrah, this film has an interesting art style that almost seems ""transitional"" between the visuals used for most of the classic series and those of the reboot series....There\'s no other Doraemon movie that looks quite like it.The storyline of Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey has many ingredients that could make a great Doraemon movie: there are time travel shenanigans, emotional connections between the protagonists and movie-exclusive characters, and decent action sequences with creative application of gadgets. However, I thought that the execution of the story was not as fluent as it could have been. There are times when the plot simply moves too fast, leaving little time for major developments to sink in, and the reveal that Sharmee, a cat idol singer who Doraemon falls in love with, was working with the villain would have been more impactful had it not been shown to the audience before being made known to Doraemon.In addition, the characters make a few strange decisions in the name of plot convenience. For example, at one point most of the protagonists and their allies escape from the villain\'s base while knowing that Doraemon is still imprisoned inside, but only decide to go rescue Doraemon after they\'ve already left the base. Luckily for them, the villain chooses that very moment to leave the base himself in his time machine, bringing the captive Doraemon with him, which saves the heroes the trouble of having to go back inside. What are the odds?Also, Doraemon\'s romantic subplot with Sharmee felt awkward considering that he was shown going on a date with his girlfriend in the beginning of the movie.On a different note, it was hard for me not to feel a sense of wistfulness as this movie ended, not so much because of the content of the film itself, but due to its status as one of the last works from the 1979 series, which was the Doraemon anime I grew up with. I think the main voice actors on the current Doraemon anime are excellent, but this movie made me realize how much I\'m going to miss the old voice cast. It\'s wild to think about how long this franchise has been going. A child who was the same age as Nobita and his classmates when the first Doraemon movie was released (Nobita\'s Dinosaur, 1980) would have been 34 by the time this one came around! And though there has been a changing of the guard, this remarkable robot cat and his friends show no signs of stopping anytime soon.

Nothing too far from the ordinary -- a classic Fujiko story. This movie, however, has quite a bit of original content that was not in the original manga/episode, making this worth a watch.Art: While some may wish for the cell animation that was the trademark of...the series before Windmasters (2003), in terms of animation this was the peak of the 1979 series. Beautiful backgrounds, fluid characters, and absolutely amazing colors, the art in this movie even beats many of the modern Doraemon movies in the Wasabi era. In fact, after watching this movie, you might even feel that there was a downgrade after the start of the Wasabi era ;).Sound: The very last time we would ever hear Nobuyo Oyama as Doraemon and Noriko Ohara as Nobita-kun. Excellent voice acting, as per the usual. Hitomi Shimatani provides a wonderful ED in Yume Biyori, in which would be one of the most memorable Doraemon EDs along with Shounenki from Little Star Wars (1985). This would also be the last time Doraemon no Uta would be used in a Doraemon movie as of current, so enjoy!Characters: The main 5 provided a great performance. While not as impactful as movies like Steel Troops (1986/2011), this was still quite a touching story from the 5. Nobita as per the usual touches the hearts of the viewers with his cute friendships. The movie-special characters were passable, although not the best of Doraemon. This movie has the cutest Shizuka moments of the whole 25 years before this movie, if that's your thing.Enjoyment: Really cute end to the original run of Doraemon, and one that'll make you feel good inside. the series before Windmasters (2003), in terms of animation this was the peak of the 1979 series.

Comic Girls,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35756/Comic_Girls,"[""Please note that this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Comic Girls and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.Cute Girls learning to overcome their problems and flourish as true manga artists by bonding, having fun and living the life of a high school girl as they confront their struggles together as friends and fellow professionals.Based off a popular 4 panel manga of the same name Comic Girls is a comedy and slice of life anime that gives us the rare opportunity...to see what the life of an aspiring manga artist is like and the kind of struggles that they have to face as they try to balance their personal lives with their professional careers. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me and did a great job of hooking me as I was curious to see whether Kao’s would be able to fit in a dorm and live alongside fellow manga artists her age and learn from them to save her career as a manga artist over a period of just one year. I'm glad that I decided to watch the series right to the end as it was a series that I really enjoyed watching.Taking place in modern day Japan the overall story of Comic Girls follows the life of Kaoruko Moeta a shy and timid high school girl and aspiring manga artist that thanks to a series of disastrous manga sales is forced to attend a well-known manga dorm for female manga artists in an effort to improve her manga drawing skills. At the dorm, she meets a number of fellow manga artists who while working in different genres of manga all share a passion for manga that Kao’s can relate too. These include the kind and older sister like Ruki, the energetic and positive Koyume, the tomboyish but confident Tsubasa and the quiet and eccentric but surprisingly understanding Fura. As Kaoruko lives and interacts with this colourful cast at the dorm and at school Kaoruko would soon learn that being a manga artist is not just about trying to imagine an idea that you have never encountered or experienced before but rather its about drawing in ideas that you yourself have enjoyed doing with the friends that you have befriended and bonded with. One cannot draw a manga until they have experienced the scenes that they want to draw with their friends.KaorukoKaoruko played by new seiyuu Hikaru Akao in her first main role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main protagonist. A high school girl and an aspiring manga artist at the beginning of the series Kaoruko better known as her pen name Kaos was a nervous and mentally fragile girl that had very low self-esteem and was very weak to any form of pressure. While passionate towards manga and a relatively hard worker Kaos was hampered greatly by the fact that she has yet to experience the scenes that she draws in her manga panels which ended up causing quite the negative feedback from her readers as to them her scenes were unrealistic. As a result of this Kaos was given the opportunity to move to a female dorm designed specifically to allow female manga artists to focus and improve their skills. As a result of her low self-esteem and nervousness, Kaos at the beginning of the series had some trouble fitting in at the dorm and had great trouble in befriending her fellow manga artists who were the same age as she was due to the fact that until now few people had been nice to her. In line with this fear is Kao’s belief that she is merely a background character when compared to the results that have been secured by others the same age as her.As the series goes on, however, Kao's personality gradually changes as a result of her new-found friendships and bonds with her fellow manga artists and dorm mates. As a result of being able to not just form friendships but also experience the very actions that she will need to draw within her manga panels Kaos was able to realise that no manga artist is ever alone and that the best way to improve your skills as a manga artist is to first improve yourself and secondly experience the very events that you are drawing into your manga by living a life as an actual high school girl. While still nervous and timid to a degree Kaos becomes determined to change herself and live the life that she had been missing and draw what she experiences into her manga. While Kaos in the beginning of the series was hesitant about helping her seniors within the dorm as a result of her determination to improve herself this fear of the unknown gradually vanishes and she becomes more earnest and willing to help others as well as developing an interest into finding out why someone is acting the way that they are with this latter one being more prevalent in her interactions with the dorms resident horror manga artist Fura. The character of Kaos I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Seeing Kaos transform from a quiet and meek girl that knew nothing about what an actual high school girl’s life is like to one that was determined to live the life of one and use the memories that she makes with her friends to improve her skills as a manga artist I thought was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Hikaru Akao really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kaos.RukiRuki voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Clockwork planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and classmate of Kaos Ruki, unlike Kaos, is an established manga artist with her genre being teens love. A confident, imaginative and positive young woman Ruki is someone that easily fits the image of an older sister being not just kind and considerate towards her juniors but also perceptive enough to notice when something is bothering them. As an experienced manga artist Ruki knows very well the types of challenges that aspiring manga artists face as they try to break into the industry and make their mark on it and as a result while hardworking and earnest tries hard to create the perfect balance between her personal life and her pro career all the while watching over and encouraging her kohai’s.As the series goes on and as Ruki’s character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Ruki also has a fair share of struggles that she has to deal with. While an experienced manga artist that has already established her place within the manga industry it can be seen that Ruki has mixed feelings about this. While happy that she has managed to establish a career in a field that she is interested in it can be seen that Ruki is somewhat embarrassed about the way people see her due to the fact that she’s an ero manga artist which isn’t helped by the fact that for whatever reason people often see her actions as being of the lewd nature even if she did not mean it to be so. A fact that I felt was hilarious as it contrasted with Ruki’s usually composed attitude. In line with this is Ruki’s complex in that she is conscious of the fact that her fans would imagine her as someone that is sexy and mature when she herself is not. As a result of this fear Ruki is shown to be wary of meeting new people and would go to great lengths to stop people from seeing her work on her manga due to both her embarrassment at having others see her work and at seeing the doubts that she has regarding whether this genre is really the one that she wants to be known for. As a result of these fears Ruki was shown to have a very deep fear of book signings as she was conscious of the reactions of her fans to her actual physical appearance an aspect of her that I really liked as it showed that no matter how skilled one was at writing and drawing the person behind that can be someone that’s far from what one can imagine their favourite author to be. As a character, I felt that Ruki was one that was well designed and developed with her many fears and embarrassments contrasting well with her usual calm and mature self. The older sister like personality that she exhibited I felt helped greatly in allowing her juniors to overcome the fear and struggles that they faced in making their first marks on their careers. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ruki.TsubasaTsubasa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Konosuba fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and a classmate of Kaos Tsubasa is unlike Kaos and Koyume an established manga artist with her speciality being a Shonen manga artist. A hardworking, positive and kind person by nature Tsubasa is someone that while quiet is someone that is friendly and kind to everyone that she meets whether they are juniors or adults. A confident and steadfast person by nature Tsubasa on initial appearance can easily be mistaken for a boy due to the fact that she insists on adapting the guise of a tomboy to hide her true identity from her friends and schoolmates. As a result of this Tsubasa is seen by many of her fellow schoolmates as someone that is cool, focused and calm something that she really appreciates as she feels that her normal self does not fit the image of her chosen speciality. While being less skilled with words than her fellow manga artist Ruki Tsubasa is shown to be someone that doesn’t mince words and is someone that can be quite direct with her praise and is always willing to offer her honest opinion on something when asked for advice by others. Despite being only a high school girl Tsubasa is shown to be someone that’s mature for her age and can easily take control of situations easily someone that I really like about her character.As the series goes on Tsubasa’s personality and character starts to gradually change as she interacts with her friends and fellow manga artists. While a quiet person by nature as the series goes on it can be seen that Tsubasa is someone that can get really focused into her work to the point where she can actually transform into the main character of her manga via the use of cosplay a fact that I found to be really hilarious. While having a well known and popular series can often make people arrogant this is not true for Tsubasa who seems to be fine with just being able to draw manga to her heart's content showing how humble she is regarding her profession. This aspect of her goes well with Tsubasa’s core belief that only by drawing the best you can, can you get closer to the idea that you want. A prominent trait of Tsubasa’s character is her insistence on adopting a tomboy persona that stems from the belief that her true appearance and the one that she adapts when going back home is unsuitable and not fitting the image of her speciality. While very determined to maintain her cool and mature tomboyish side to her fans and friends this feeling gradually changes as a result of Koyume’s actions that cause her to regain some of her girly spirit.  The character of Tsubasa I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the constant transformation into her manga’s main character via the use of cosplay and the hilarity that this ensures being one of the best aspects of her character. Additionally, the struggle that Tsubasa has with her family and the decision to adopt an entirely new persona to allow her to better fit in her manga speciality I felt was well done and showed how determined Tsubasa was to make a name for herself in the manga world with or without her family’s support. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Tsubasa.KoyumeKoyume voiced by veteran seiyuu Kaede Hondo of Battle Girls High school and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and schoolmate of Kaos Koyume like Kaos is an aspiring manga artist that while new already has a lot of experience in the industry due to her willingness to learn. A carefree, confident and positive girl by nature Koyume is someone that can freely fit into any environment that she enters whether it’s a new school or a new dorm due to her positive, friendly and caring nature. An intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Koyume though still a new artist approaches her work as a shojo manga artist with both determination and passion aspiring to be a successful manga artist within the field like her fellow dorm mates. While having a vivid imagination Koyume at the beginning of the series had great trouble drawing material for her manga due to a lack of knowledge on romance matters. As a result of this at the beginning of the series, she like Kaos were in a state where they were forced to find new inspiration to improve their skills.As the series goes on and Koyume’s character and personality gets expanded upon it can be seen that while confident and positive Koyume is someone that can easily get embarrassed and lose her normal composure which is best shown when discussing matters related to romance and her relationship and admiration of her fellow manga artist and friend Tsubasa. This latter interest in Tsubasa as a romantic partner is also used as a running gag within the series as Koyume has a habit of picturing her as the male in her manga stories to her embarrassment and the amusement of her friends. While possessing boundless optimism and faith in her skills as a manga artist Koyume can become discouraged if people don’t like her work but this latter part is offset by the fact that her happy and go lucky attitude always enables her to return back from the brink more energised and determined than before. The character of Koyume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her ability to stay positive and energetic at all times to offset Kao's sudden mood swings being the best aspects of her character. Additionally, her ability to come up with random ideas and expand them into crazy scenarios I thought was something that matched well with her personality. Her romantic interest into Tsubasa was also an aspect that I liked as it allowed us to see Koyume in a rare sight of panicking in embarrassment of having a secret found out. I felt that her seiyuu Kaede Hondo did an excellent job at portraying the character of Koyume.Suzu FuraSuzu Fura voiced by veteran seiyuu Reina Ueda of Relife fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A fellow manga artist and dorm mate of the girls Suzu Fura who is often called Fura sensei by the girls due to her experience is a quiet, isolated and awkward person by nature that seemingly prefers to stay within her room instead of socialising with her fellow dorm mates. A horror manga artist by trade Fura due to her awkwardness and lack of social skills is someone that has few friends in her life due to her scary nature that causes people to avoid her. As a result of this Fura often spends long periods of time in isolation creating material for her manga. As a result of this isolation, her first meeting with Kaos was about as much as a shock for her as it was for Kaos. In line with her isolation and her speciality as a horror manga artist Fura adapts a very distinctive physical appearance of white clothing that contrasts well with her dark hair that covers her eyes. An outfit that I thought suits both her chosen field and her personality of loving to hear others scream in terror really well.As the series goes on and Fura’s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Fura while a scary and somewhat unsettling person to be near is actually someone that is incredibly lonely due to her lack of friends. As a result of this loneliness Fura often compensates by acting overly friendly with people that she knows trying hard to savour the warmth that comes from being near people that she’s familiar with which is best shown in the strong bonds that she manages to establish with Kaos despite the latter’s initial fear of her. As a result of her awkwardness around people, it can be seen that Fura has a great deal of difficulty interacting with people that she’s not familiar with and as a result can easily misunderstand their actions. Because of this personality, Fura is someone that is unused to people being kind to her and as a result, she holds people that do so in very high regard counting them as one of her dear friends. When relaxed and in an environment that suits her though it can be seen that Fura reverts back to her normal personality that she keeps hidden behind her scary one a personality that contrasts a great deal with her usual one. Instead of being scary and awkward around people in this personality Fura is instead a kind, attentive and patient person that can be surprisingly talkative and is a very capable teacher that uses both jokes and scares to allow her students to concentrate more on their work a far cry from her default persona. As a character, I felt that the character of Fura was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her two personalities and her gradual opening of her heart to others as she bonds with and befriends her fellow manga artists and dorm mates being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Reina Ueda really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Fura.AMVAnimation wise I thought that the dorm that the main cast live and work at and the school that they attend as students were very well designed and did a great job of showing that a manga artist is able to work from anywhere as long as they have the creative resources that they need to create their work. The character designs for the characters whether for the main cast or the supporting cast I felt was well designed and matched well with the personalities of each character. The inclusion of manga setting scenes to illustrate individual scenes within the anime I thought was also well designed and matched well with the theme of manga creation. In terms of music, I really liked the series OST as it matched well with the many different emotions and feelings that the cast experience in each scene. The opening and ending themes for the series which was Memories and Namida wa Misenai which was sung by the series main cast I felt was pretty good with both conveying a cheerful and positive mood to the listener and matching well with the series main theme. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Hikaru Akao, Saori Oonishi, Rie Takahashi, Kaede Hondo and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Kaos, Ruki, Tsubasa, Koyume and Fura all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did a fantastic job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, though I didn’t cover the members of the supporting cast I also felt that Aya Endo, Minami Tsuda and Ayaka Nanase who portrayed the characters of Ririka the dorms matron, Mayu Kao's editor and Miharu who was the homeroom teacher of Kao's class all deserve special mention as I felt that they did an excellent job of supporting the main cast in this series.Overall conclusionOverall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story, interesting and well-developed characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of real-world issues into the professional lives of the girls.The premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as unlike seiyuu’s and the making of anime the creation of manga and what the life of a manga artist actually is like is something that is largely unknown to us. Unlike anime and seiyuu’s the age of a manga artist is hard to ascertain because as human beings our skills and our innate talents at a particular action manifest at different times and as a result it’s perhaps not unusual to have talented manga artists to actually be high school freshman instead of say young adults that had just entered society. However, as a result of this unique premise of having the main cast as high school girls, we are also presented with an opportunity to see the types of problems that both manga artists and teenagers such as the members of the main cast face. This combination of having the main cast experience not just the problems that they face in their professional lives such as the dreaded slump that many a manga artist and light novel author has felt as well as more personal problems like being afraid of attending book signings for your work due to being afraid of what your fans would feel at seeing your actual physical appearance I felt was well done as it allowed us to see the kind of problems both personal and professional that manga artists can feel as they both start and maintain their careers in the field of manga.The overall story of the show I felt was also a strong point of the series as not only did it allow us to see the members of the main cast develop both as individuals and as manga artists but also allow us to see them doing so as they work alongside each other, bond with each other, have fun together and overcome problems together while at the same time not forgetting that at the end of the day they while professionals in their own right are still high school girls that are just at the beginning of their lives. Paired with this story is the strong chemistry that is established between Kaos and not just with her fellow manga artists but also with the many support staff that helps them in their everyday lives whether as high school students or as manga professionals. This chemistry when paired with the story is what really makes the story stand out as this allows us to see Kaos and the girls gradually mature as the series goes on both as individuals and as manga artists as they incorporate what they had learned from bonding with their friends into their work and improve not only themselves but also the work that they so cherish. One of the main themes of the series is, of course, the act of overcoming doubts and improving yourself to break your limits a theme that I felt was really appropriate for the series and handled really well within the series through the evolution of Kaos and the girls not just as manga artists but as individuals as well. Overall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed with its premise, story and the chemistry between its cast being the highlight of the series. As a final score, I would say that Comic girls would easily deserve a final score of 10/10 and is easily one of the best animes i seen this season. to see what the life of an aspiring manga artist is like and the kind of struggles that they have to face as they try to balance their personal lives with their professional careers. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me and did a great job of hooking me as I was curious to see whether Kao’s would be able to fit in a dorm and live alongside fellow manga artists her age and learn from them to save her career as a manga artist over a period of just one year.

In line with this fear is Kao’s belief that she is merely a background character when compared to the results that have been secured by others the same age as her.As the series goes on, however, Kao's personality gradually changes as a result of her new-found friendships and bonds with her fellow manga artists and dorm mates. As a result of being able to not just form friendships but also experience the very actions that she will need to draw within her manga panels Kaos was able to realise that no manga artist is ever alone and that the best way to improve your skills as a manga artist is to first improve yourself and secondly experience the very events that you are drawing into your manga by living a life as an actual high school girl. While still nervous and timid to a degree Kaos becomes determined to change herself and live the life that she had been missing and draw what she experiences into her manga. While Kaos in the beginning of the series was hesitant about helping her seniors within the dorm as a result of her determination to improve herself this fear of the unknown gradually vanishes and she becomes more earnest and willing to help others as well as developing an interest into finding out why someone is acting the way that they are with this latter one being more prevalent in her interactions with the dorms resident horror manga artist Fura. The character of Kaos I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Seeing Kaos transform from a quiet and meek girl that knew nothing about what an actual high school girl’s life is like to one that was determined to live the life of one and use the memories that she makes with her friends to improve her skills as a manga artist I thought was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Hikaru Akao really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kaos.RukiRuki voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Clockwork planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and classmate of Kaos Ruki, unlike Kaos, is an established manga artist with her genre being teens love. A confident, imaginative and positive young woman Ruki is someone that easily fits the image of an older sister being not just kind and considerate towards her juniors but also perceptive enough to notice when something is bothering them. As an experienced manga artist Ruki knows very well the types of challenges that aspiring manga artists face as they try to break into the industry and make their mark on it and as a result while hardworking and earnest tries hard to create the perfect balance between her personal life and her pro career all the while watching over and encouraging her kohai’s.As the series goes on and as Ruki’s character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Ruki also has a fair share of struggles that she has to deal with. While an experienced manga artist that has already established her place within the manga industry it can be seen that Ruki has mixed feelings about this. While happy that she has managed to establish a career in a field that she is interested in it can be seen that Ruki is somewhat embarrassed about the way people see her due to the fact that she’s an ero manga artist which isn’t helped by the fact that for whatever reason people often see her actions as being of the lewd nature even if she did not mean it to be so. A fact that I felt was hilarious as it contrasted with Ruki’s usually composed attitude. In line with this is Ruki’s complex in that she is conscious of the fact that her fans would imagine her as someone that is sexy and mature when she herself is not. As a result of this fear Ruki is shown to be wary of meeting new people and would go to great lengths to stop people from seeing her work on her manga due to both her embarrassment at having others see her work and at seeing the doubts that she has regarding whether this genre is really the one that she wants to be known for. As a result of these fears Ruki was shown to have a very deep fear of book signings as she was conscious of the reactions of her fans to her actual physical appearance an aspect of her that I really liked as it showed that no matter how skilled one was at writing and drawing the person behind that can be someone that’s far from what one can imagine their favourite author to be. As a character, I felt that Ruki was one that was well designed and developed with her many fears and embarrassments contrasting well with her usual calm and mature self. The older sister like personality that she exhibited I felt helped greatly in allowing her juniors to overcome the fear and struggles that they faced in making their first marks on their careers. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ruki.TsubasaTsubasa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Konosuba fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and a classmate of Kaos Tsubasa is unlike Kaos and Koyume an established manga artist with her speciality being a Shonen manga artist. A hardworking, positive and kind person by nature Tsubasa is someone that while quiet is someone that is friendly and kind to everyone that she meets whether they are juniors or adults. A confident and steadfast person by nature Tsubasa on initial appearance can easily be mistaken for a boy due to the fact that she insists on adapting the guise of a tomboy to hide her true identity from her friends and schoolmates. As a result of this Tsubasa is seen by many of her fellow schoolmates as someone that is cool, focused and calm something that she really appreciates as she feels that her normal self does not fit the image of her chosen speciality. While being less skilled with words than her fellow manga artist Ruki Tsubasa is shown to be someone that doesn’t mince words and is someone that can be quite direct with her praise and is always willing to offer her honest opinion on something when asked for advice by others. Despite being only a high school girl Tsubasa is shown to be someone that’s mature for her age and can easily take control of situations easily someone that I really like about her character.As the series goes on Tsubasa’s personality and character starts to gradually change as she interacts with her friends and fellow manga artists. While a quiet person by nature as the series goes on it can be seen that Tsubasa is someone that can get really focused into her work to the point where she can actually transform into the main character of her manga via the use of cosplay a fact that I found to be really hilarious. While having a well known and popular series can often make people arrogant this is not true for Tsubasa who seems to be fine with just being able to draw manga to her heart's content showing how humble she is regarding her profession. This aspect of her goes well with Tsubasa’s core belief that only by drawing the best you can, can you get closer to the idea that you want. A prominent trait of Tsubasa’s character is her insistence on adopting a tomboy persona that stems from the belief that her true appearance and the one that she adapts when going back home is unsuitable and not fitting the image of her speciality. While very determined to maintain her cool and mature tomboyish side to her fans and friends this feeling gradually changes as a result of Koyume’s actions that cause her to regain some of her girly spirit.  The character of Tsubasa I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the constant transformation into her manga’s main character via the use of cosplay and the hilarity that this ensures being one of the best aspects of her character. Additionally, the struggle that Tsubasa has with her family and the decision to adopt an entirely new persona to allow her to better fit in her manga speciality I felt was well done and showed how determined Tsubasa was to make a name for herself in the manga world with or without her family’s support. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Tsubasa.KoyumeKoyume voiced by veteran seiyuu Kaede Hondo of Battle Girls High school and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao’s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and schoolmate of Kaos Koyume like Kaos is an aspiring manga artist that while new already has a lot of experience in the industry due to her willingness to learn. A carefree, confident and positive girl by nature Koyume is someone that can freely fit into any environment that she enters whether it’s a new school or a new dorm due to her positive, friendly and caring nature. An intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Koyume though still a new artist approaches her work as a shojo manga artist with both determination and passion aspiring to be a successful manga artist within the field like her fellow dorm mates. While having a vivid imagination Koyume at the beginning of the series had great trouble drawing material for her manga due to a lack of knowledge on romance matters. As a result of this at the beginning of the series, she like Kaos were in a state where they were forced to find new inspiration to improve their skills.As the series goes on and Koyume’s character and personality gets expanded upon it can be seen that while confident and positive Koyume is someone that can easily get embarrassed and lose her normal composure which is best shown when discussing matters related to romance and her relationship and admiration of her fellow manga artist and friend Tsubasa. This latter interest in Tsubasa as a romantic partner is also used as a running gag within the series as Koyume has a habit of picturing her as the male in her manga stories to her embarrassment and the amusement of her friends. While possessing boundless optimism and faith in her skills as a manga artist Koyume can become discouraged if people don’t like her work but this latter part is offset by the fact that her happy and go lucky attitude always enables her to return back from the brink more energised and determined than before. The character of Koyume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her ability to stay positive and energetic at all times to offset Kao's sudden mood swings being the best aspects of her character. Additionally, her ability to come up with random ideas and expand them into crazy scenarios I thought was something that matched well with her personality. Her romantic interest into Tsubasa was also an aspect that I liked as it allowed us to see Koyume in a rare sight of panicking in embarrassment of having a secret found out. I felt that her seiyuu Kaede Hondo did an excellent job at portraying the character of Koyume.Suzu FuraSuzu Fura voiced by veteran seiyuu Reina Ueda of Relife fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A fellow manga artist and dorm mate of the girls Suzu Fura who is often called Fura sensei by the girls due to her experience is a quiet, isolated and awkward person by nature that seemingly prefers to stay within her room instead of socialising with her fellow dorm mates. A horror manga artist by trade Fura due to her awkwardness and lack of social skills is someone that has few friends in her life due to her scary nature that causes people to avoid her. As a result of this Fura often spends long periods of time in isolation creating material for her manga. As a result of this isolation, her first meeting with Kaos was about as much as a shock for her as it was for Kaos. In line with her isolation and her speciality as a horror manga artist Fura adapts a very distinctive physical appearance of white clothing that contrasts well with her dark hair that covers her eyes. An outfit that I thought suits both her chosen field and her personality of loving to hear others scream in terror really well.As the series goes on and Fura’s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Fura while a scary and somewhat unsettling person to be near is actually someone that is incredibly lonely due to her lack of friends. As a result of this loneliness Fura often compensates by acting overly friendly with people that she knows trying hard to savour the warmth that comes from being near people that she’s familiar with which is best shown in the strong bonds that she manages to establish with Kaos despite the latter’s initial fear of her. As a result of her awkwardness around people, it can be seen that Fura has a great deal of difficulty interacting with people that she’s not familiar with and as a result can easily misunderstand their actions. Because of this personality, Fura is someone that is unused to people being kind to her and as a result, she holds people that do so in very high regard counting them as one of her dear friends. When relaxed and in an environment that suits her though it can be seen that Fura reverts back to her normal personality that she keeps hidden behind her scary one a personality that contrasts a great deal with her usual one. Instead of being scary and awkward around people in this personality Fura is instead a kind, attentive and patient person that can be surprisingly talkative and is a very capable teacher that uses both jokes and scares to allow her students to concentrate more on their work a far cry from her default persona. As a character, I felt that the character of Fura was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her two personalities and her gradual opening of her heart to others as she bonds with and befriends her fellow manga artists and dorm mates being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Reina Ueda really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Fura.AMVAnimation wise I thought that the dorm that the main cast live and work at and the school that they attend as students were very well designed and did a great job of showing that a manga artist is able to work from anywhere as long as they have the creative resources that they need to create their work. The character designs for the characters whether for the main cast or the supporting cast I felt was well designed and matched well with the personalities of each character. The inclusion of manga setting scenes to illustrate individual scenes within the anime I thought was also well designed and matched well with the theme of manga creation. In terms of music, I really liked the series OST as it matched well with the many different emotions and feelings that the cast experience in each scene. The opening and ending themes for the series which was Memories and Namida wa Misenai which was sung by the series main cast I felt was pretty good with both conveying a cheerful and positive mood to the listener and matching well with the series main theme. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Hikaru Akao, Saori Oonishi, Rie Takahashi, Kaede Hondo and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Kaos, Ruki, Tsubasa, Koyume and Fura all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did a fantastic job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, though I didn’t cover the members of the supporting cast I also felt that Aya Endo, Minami Tsuda and Ayaka Nanase who portrayed the characters of Ririka the dorms matron, Mayu Kao's editor and Miharu who was the homeroom teacher of Kao's class all deserve special mention as I felt that they did an excellent job of supporting the main cast in this series.Overall conclusionOverall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story, interesting and well-developed characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of real-world issues into the professional lives of the girls.The premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as unlike seiyuu’s and the making of anime the creation of manga and what the life of a manga artist actually is like is something that is largely unknown to us. Unlike anime and seiyuu’s the age of a manga artist is hard to ascertain because as human beings our skills and our innate talents at a particular action manifest at different times and as a result it’s perhaps not unusual to have talented manga artists to actually be high school freshman instead of say young adults that had just entered society. However, as a result of this unique premise of having the main cast as high school girls, we are also presented with an opportunity to see the types of problems that both manga artists and teenagers such as the members of the main cast face. This combination of having the main cast experience not just the problems that they face in their professional lives such as the dreaded slump that many a manga artist and light novel author has felt as well as more personal problems like being afraid of attending book signings for your work due to being afraid of what your fans would feel at seeing your actual physical appearance I felt was well done as it allowed us to see the kind of problems both personal and professional that manga artists can feel as they both start and maintain their careers in the field of manga.The overall story of the show I felt was also a strong point of the series as not only did it allow us to see the members of the main cast develop both as individuals and as manga artists but also allow us to see them doing so as they work alongside each other, bond with each other, have fun together and overcome problems together while at the same time not forgetting that at the end of the day they while professionals in their own right are still high school girls that are just at the beginning of their lives. Paired with this story is the strong chemistry that is established between Kaos and not just with her fellow manga artists but also with the many support staff that helps them in their everyday lives whether as high school students or as manga professionals. This chemistry when paired with the story is what really makes the story stand out as this allows us to see Kaos and the girls gradually mature as the series goes on both as individuals and as manga artists as they incorporate what they had learned from bonding with their friends into their work and improve not only themselves but also the work that they so cherish. One of the main themes of the series is, of course, the act of overcoming doubts and improving yourself to break your limits a theme that I felt was really appropriate for the series and handled really well within the series through the evolution of Kaos and the girls not just as manga artists but as individuals as well. Overall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed with its premise, story and the chemistry between its cast being the highlight of the series. As a final score, I would say that Comic girls would easily deserve a final score of 10/10 and is easily one of the best animes i seen this season."", 'A few years ago, I asked myself if we’ll ever get another series about characters making manga. Series like Bakuman and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun are among some of the most entertaining anime I’ve seen that explored such ideas. In recent years, we had series about cute girls making games like New Game! or even characters working in the anime industry like Shirobako. Now it’s 2018 and we got Comic Girls.I’ll say right off the bat that the series is about as simple as it sounds. It’s an anime that explores the daily life misadventures of a group of female mangaka. For a series that...deals with such a simple premise, the way it executes its storytelling is just as effective. At its core, the show uses its character cast to do the storytelling. Every day is an adventure of its own as we see how these characters interact and behave. In essence, the series provides the opportunity to showcase manga making in a very casual, everyday life environment.Our main characters consists of a group of young girls of similar age. They have nicknames and all have them different preferences in their manga tastes. For instance, Koyume prefer shoujo manga compared to other genres. Ruki loves ecchi and fan service in her work. Tsubasa’s passion for shounen manga is also reflected in personality. Then, there’s Kaoruko Moeta (Kaos) who just wants to improve herself as a manga artist after having her work met with overwhelming negative reception. The main selling point is how these characters are motivated to do what they love through their connections with each other.As a fan of the manga, the adaptation is relatively faithful and brings the mood of the series to life. The lighthearted tone of every episode is what you can expect from most “cute girls doing cute things” shows. Now I’ll be honest with you. If this type of show isn’t what you’re familiar with or a fan of, then it may be hard to enjoy this. There’s not much character development despite the series exploring a life journey of these young mangaka. Storytelling on most parts is very simple and doesn’t get any complicated as time goes on. Every episode has a repetitive nature and it feels like if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. There are some characters the series brings in that occasionally spark more popcorn entertainment such as horror mangaka Suzu Fuura, Tsubasa’s shounen style cosplays, and various misunderstandings. However, don’t expect this series to be one that’s dramatic or even competitive. In fact, the show is hardly about competition when it comes to manga craft but instead about characters working to improve themselves. The comedy is presented through reactions, character interactions, characters’ behaviors. There’s not much characterization although we do see some of the family backgrounds of the cast. In retrospect, these characters are pretty easy to understand along with the show itself.Nexus is a studio that’s probably known for its 2015’s anime adaptation, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. While this series is nowhere near on that level of fan service, it still contains fan service and skinship. It’s mainly mild and nothing too distracting. In some places, it’s necessary as one of the mangaka wants to improve her skill of making “teenage love” manga. On a technical level, the series looks crisp with colorful quality and cute character designs. The series never hides Kao’s shyness or Tsubasa’s tomboy tendencies. Suzu Fuura and her mischievous personality is also animated with such intention. The series’ character designs may also be misleading at times as such characters look older than they seem. Luckily, it doesn’t hold them back as every characters’ voice fits well with their persona. The theme songs for the show overall also contains the style of what slice of life should be with mangaka theatrics.Comic Girls, the series about mangaka striving to improve their craft did what it needed to do and I didn’t expect anything more. It’s a simple series that capitalized on the chance to explore mangaka lifestyle. It succeeds doing that through the storytelling and can even occasionally surprise you. But if you’re not a fan of this type of series, then it may be hard to look back and enjoy what it is. Still, give the show a chance and see what awaits you on the other side. deals with such a simple premise, the way it executes its storytelling is just as effective.

This proves to be difficult for our lovable protagonist, Kaos, who honestly is just awful at it, and goes to live in a dormitory for female manga artists where she meets the other main characters of the series, hopefully getting inspiration from them.Comic Girls uses the setting really well to provide a fantastic comedy both...via the characters and the use of the manga elements. This anime doesn't focus on the profession like series as Bakuman or Shirobako do, but it's still quite informative and, most importantly, succeeds at using it for the comedic value it wants.There are four main characters in this story: our protagonist, Kaoruko Moeta (pen-name Kaos), who is an absurdly likeable and quite relatable girl who seems to be in constant state of panic, but is also a hard worker that you will want to adopt and protect, Tsubasa, a tomboyish girl who draws shounen manga and puts herself really seriously in the mind of the characters she creates, Ruki, who loves drawing cute things but ended up discovering her true skills at drawing lewd stuff instead to her embarassment, and Koyume, a cheerful shoujo manga artist and doughnut devourer who can't draw guys. Their personalities balance well and make for a lot of entertaining situations, and together with fantastic (and also quite touching at times) episodes focused on each character I ended up very attached to them. The number of secondary characters is pretty short but they do well when they appear and add to the fun that comes from this anime.The art style and character designs of the series are very visually appealing, with lots of nice character reactions and well done use of the camera angles, studio Nexus hasn't done many things yet but I would be totally in for them doing more series in the future because they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. The music on the other side is nothing memorable but fits well for the tone of the scenes, the opening and ending themes are two good songs by the VAs of the four protagonists, with the later having some really nice transitions into it at the end of some episodes.Comic Girls is a fantastic series I enjoyed a lot and I really recommend to watch to any fan of the cute girls genre, or for anyone looking for a comedy series to watch, because this one delivers hard. via the characters and the use of the manga elements.

While there is an abundance of CGDCT that manage to have nice light fluffy interactions but with little depth, it s rare to see a show like Comic Girls where the depth of the show is the highlight. With Comic Girls there is a lot of depth given to the characters, who they are, what they're aiming for, and the growth that they have as comic artists. While the characters do have their gimmicks and can seem a bit cliche at the start. There is much more to them than that. One thing I appreciate...is that they all seem to be modeled off the genre of manga that they are writing. Koyume acts like a shoujo protagonist. Tsubasa acts like a shounen protagonist. Moeta acts like a combination between the typical CGDCT protagonist and its audience. While it does lead them to be more prototypical than they could be it also creates and interesting and humorous meta joke.By itself that is nice but nothing special, but what is great is how it's used for their development and how their depth gets explored due to that. With Koyume, the shoujo mangaka, an empathsis on love is brought into her character arc, including her learning how it feels to actually be in love and the feelings that she has. With Ruki, a josei ecchi mangaka, she learns how to love herself and what she does even those it may seem shameful or something not to be proud of. With Moeta, the CGDCT mangaka, she learns how to have friends and be accepted by them as well as how to deal with all of her self-esteem issues. They all have issues that bring them to be more than just the meta archetypes that they start with. It makes them compelling as characters and their successes that much more satisfying.Another interesting point in Comic Girls' depth is its yuri. While a lot of CGDCT like to do hints at yuri and make soft yuri ships, Comic Girls goes beyond that. There are explicit statements of love towards other girls as well as focus on those feelings. They aren't treated as a joke but rather with power and focus. Not only that but they're not content to just show it and have the fandom supply the rest. Comic Girls actually shows reasons why the two characters would fit together well, why they like each other, and how each other improves each other's lives. With a lot of romances it often feels like the main point is a statement of the characters being in love with each other rather than a focus on what makes them so good together. Comic Girls' eschews that by showing how the two help each other, and why they like each other. It makes for a very satisfying romance, when many other CGDCT only teased at one.Interestingly while Comic Girls manages to handle its depth well it does have an issue with it's more SOL moments. While these are usually the bread and butter of CGDCT shows, and is the easier parts for a show to do Comic Girls' SOL moments are pretty generic and standard. While the chemistry that the cast has goes a long way, the gimmicks are relied on a lot, and in general the jokes are nothing special, especially when compared to the large library of CGDCT works. Too often overused jokes are made, or the same material is riffed on over and over again.That said I feel like the characters, and the great depthful moments more than make up for that. The art is also quite nice and the general finished product is a good one although not a spectacular one.At the end of the day I'd say Comic Girls is a really good CGDCT and one that any fan of CGDCT should happily pick up. It may not have the strongest jokes or fluff, but the overall combination of material is great. is that they all seem to be modeled off the genre of manga that they are writing. Koyume acts like a shoujo protagonist. Tsubasa acts like a shounen protagonist. Moeta acts like a combination between the typical CGDCT protagonist and its audience.

It makes for a very satisfying romance, when many other CGDCT only teased at one.Interestingly while Comic Girls manages to handle its depth well it does have an issue with it's more SOL moments. While these are usually the bread and butter of CGDCT shows, and is the easier parts for a show to do Comic Girls' SOL moments are pretty generic and standard. While the chemistry that the cast has goes a long way, the gimmicks are relied on a lot, and in general the jokes are nothing special, especially when compared to the large library of CGDCT works. Too often overused jokes are made, or the same material is riffed on over and over again.That said I feel like the characters, and the great depthful moments more than make up for that. The art is also quite nice and the general finished product is a good one although not a spectacular one.At the end of the day I'd say Comic Girls is a really good CGDCT and one that any fan of CGDCT should happily pick up. It may not have the strongest jokes or fluff, but the overall combination of material is great."", ""*Sorry for my bad englishI doubt why this anime's reviews have people give so much score? My personal opinions I think this anime overrated.Story is simple, about four girl in manga's dormitory. If you expect this anime will be like bakuman or about manga's industry, I said nope. This anime will be like generic cute girl do cute things with content there can find in other that in same genres. For short this anime is only about 4 girls manga writer's life in dormitory.Art and Music is good. I'm enjoy with them.Every characters in this anime will be different stereotype live together, If this...can make charm from these stereotype will be okay, but result is every character is very annoying. Like they hired to make every action to match their stereotype. So much is Moeta and Katsuki. Moeta is one character is same since episode 1 to episode 12, I know she has develop in the end and that is very slowwwwwwww I think I will be annoy her for first, She should be like in the end episode since episode 5 or 6. But thing this anime make well is distributing characters' story. If I'm not interested in personality I think they have interesting background's story. Unfortunately If this anime more emphasize with this, I think I will like this anime.Thing I feel annoying from this anime is drama that swtich with comedy in every episode in level make tone in watching broken. For Example.(Every Character do something and make we laugh)One Character: Oh I have bad past bla bla ba(Sad Music come)Overall, This anime are not too bad, If you like cute girl do cute things or kira kira girls you may be like this anime. But It's bad and boring for me.Score:3 two from art/music and one from background stroy of every character. can make charm from these stereotype will be okay, but result is every character is very annoying.

I was a bit worried at the beginning of episode one when the show cut between a manga author and editor. I assumed it would be similar to Bakuman, a show I wasn't very fond of. Luckily, the show takes a unique turn in showing the daily lives of well-known manga author roommates instead of aspiring manga authors still living with their parents. The show is well designed, with care put into the backgrounds as well as the character designs. Each girl has a unique and rounded personality, separating them from tropes associated with the slice of life genre....Situations these characters are put into for humor are far different from most comedy anime, making for great some jokes. These girls also love their jobs more than anything, and are as much fans of the manga medium as they authors and artists. You can see the characters bond over this common interest, despite each girl's writing style being completely different and being at different stages in their careers. My only real gripe with this show other than the start of the first episode is putting all of these girls in school. Fortunately, the characters don't stay there long and both the girl's preparation for school and the school's design are very creative. I'm just a bit frustrated that this show couldn't just be about the lives of adults working creative jobs. Other than those very minor problems, this show was surprisingly entertaining. I'd recommend this to any manga fan or anyone looking for a slice of life comedy to fill their time.

As an artist in high school myself, I feel I have some girls to relate to. I\'ve wanted to try making my own manga, and now this anime seems to be teaching me some techniques that I will use.Story 6/10:The story overall isn\'t fantastic, but that kind of is the point! Kaoroku Moeta (or Kaos-chan) is a high school student who is a struggling artist. She moves into a dormitory for other female mangaka to get inspiration and learn new techniques and get a serialized manga. The anime follows Kaos and her new...friends Konome (a shoujo artist who can\'t draw male characters), Tsubasa (a shonen mangaka who got her first series published and has a bit of a tendency to imitate her characters), and Rukki (a hentai artist who wants to draw kids manga) on their daily lives juggling school, serialized manga, fans, self-esteem issues, and improving drawing skills. It\'s meant to focus on the little things, as this is also a comedy anime.Art: 9/10The art is important in a show on this topic, and Comic Girls delivers in that. Characters look distinct, have various facial expressions, and personality shown in their movements. Some side characters like animals even have this established (Nyaos is a prime example). All drawings shown that are created by the girls are well done (even the intentionally bad ones, as they are used for comedy making them good for their job), and some of the techniques used can easily be replicated. (DM me with some tips as I am trying to make my own manga too lol)Sound: 10/10All characters have fitting voices. The actors all do a really good job. Shoutouts to Takahashi Rie, the actor of Tsubasa, as this tone she uses is different to how I last heard her voice in a anime (Takagi San). The OPs and EDs also have good musical composition. Every time a character appears on screen in the OP or ED, their voice is heard singing (I\'m imagining this with JOJO as Ono Daisuke tried to sing the OP and failed hilariously.) All these actresses are amazing at their job in singing and acting. It is so weird tho hearing Takahashi sing in character as she usually doesn\'t sing in the more monotone voice. Also the action music that plays with Tsubasa\'s impersonations is hilarious.Characters: 10/10These characters are so relatable to me.Kaos: Young struggling mangaka who can\'t draw well. She is also shy and easily scared. Also she openly is a bit homosexual lmao. (Reminds me of a younger me)Konome: Kaos\' best friend. She is energetic and this bounces off well with Kaos. A sort of Ryuji-Akira sort of vibe, in where they are so different but they like each other and support each other type of thing. Konome draws shoujo manga, but can\'t draw male characters. (Tbh i have a similar problem due to my art style). Her bubbly personality reminds me of myself.Tsubasa: MY WAIFU. SHE IS MINE! (second to Sheska) Tsubasa is a shonen mangaka (hmmmm that\'s what I\'m doing) who impersonates characters (kinda like I DO), and is a bit cold but loving (like when i had crippling depression). Tsubasa is more experienced than Kaos and Konome, and is willing to help them out and teach them new techniques, and even help out with finances (^o^). 10/10 waifu for me! Just need her to Jojo pose once and then she\'d be number 1.Rukki ""Big Boobies♥Himeko Chan"": The master of hentai herself. Rukki is really perverted (she draws hardcore porno), imagines her friends doing it, and ends up looking like she is having sex on multiple occasions. She claims to have big titties as a mangaka, but she is depressed that she is actually flat. She also writes teen romances, but mostly P O R N.  Rukki wants to draw a kids manga, but is too perverse to do so. (TBH she reminds me of my addiction with this pervy stuff) She is a nice girl and is understanding and a bit of a mentor to Kaos. KaoRukki I ship it! Her pen name is Big Boobies♥Himeko Chan.Overall I am enjoying this series a lot! After the anime finishes, I will read the manga, and pray for season 2, and a dub so I can get a Blu Ray release in my local tech store. I\'m going to also take the tips I\'ve learned and build up the courage to release my own manga.

The story is telling us about shoujo mangakas (girls making manga) daily live. For someone loves shoujo manga can already imagine core of this anime, girl's life.Story 7/10I know shoujo manga/anime sometime can be so bored cuz many of them only focus on 'moe-moe' and do any plot to make character more 'moe-moe'. In this anime, yes still moe is important dishes, but the story, shoujo mangaka is a good one. Not so tasteless, but there's some crisp on it.Art 8/10Yes, this about moe. Shoujo anime must be moe! Definitely! And...the background effect is pretty good I think. Animation just soso, no battle scene, nothing must be noticeable.Sound (8/10)Moe voice? Yes please! Some of seiyuu (voice actor) already popular. But one of the main characters is a fresh one. But still, very nice.Character (8/10)Unique personality for each character is very good! And it makes a daily life joke which very enjoyable and crisp.Enjoyment (9/10)Actually I want to give it 10/10. But I'm a big fan of shoujo manga/anime, so let's just minus one it. If you love moe character, scene full of woman, just dive in! If you want some lite story and enjoyable, just put your ass down and start watching.Overall (8/10)It's a good anime to relax with. If you still consider it, just imagine a world of moe where you can watch all of moe interact with each other with a different moe personality.

It's about MOE!"", 'Comic Girls is one of the most overlooked shows of the Spring 2018 season. At the time of this writing, it ranks in as the #16 new TV series of the season on MAL based on the number of members attached to it. I’m sure that a large part of this is due to many “serious” anime fans dismissing moe, slice of life, cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT) shows on reflex. But I feel that this show deserves much more recognition than its getting, not just from slice of life fans, but from anime fans in general.Comic Girls is part of the “cute girls...+ activity” sub-genre of CGDCT shows which K-ON! largely brought into style. In this show, the activity that these cute girls are taking part in is creating manga. While the series doesn’t go as deep into manga production as a series like Bakuman, drawing manga is definitely a more significant part of the story than the music in K-ON! and the activities of many other shows of this type. If you are interested in how manga is made but felt that Bakuman was a little too dry (and if you think it could be improved by cute girls), then this might be a great alternative for you.So let’s go ahead and get into my category breakouts:-----Story - 9 out of 10-----The story centers around four girls as they work on their respective (individual) manga careers in a dormitory specifically set up for young manga artists. The story mainly focuses on Kaos-sensei, a very small high school girl who gets sent to the dorm by her editor when she’s having trouble producing anything good. She had a debut one-shot manga published which wasn’t particularly well received. She joins two established manga artists who both have ongoing series in serialization as well as a fellow newcomer. Being that this is largely a true slice of life series in form, not much in the way of actual “plot” goes on. Most of the story revolves around Kaos sucking, the other girls working and dealing with their production schedules, or just regular old everyday life stuff. However, in the context of the kind of story that is being told, it’s all rather well done. The comedy is well-paced with tight delivery and there is a steady stream of heartfelt moments. There are a few spots that are a little slower than they really needed to be (the final episode or two comes to mind), but the payoff was almost always worth it.-----Art - 9 out of 10-----True slice of life shows tend to be some of the least demanding in the art department. There are usually no grand landscapes or crazy effects or action sequences. However, Comic Girls still does a rather exceptional job in this regard. To go along with the manga theme, the art direction of the series tends to have a heavily manga-inspired look with cool cuts and panel-windows inserted on the screen. It works very well and the overall look of the series is fun and clean. They also don’t cut any corners when it comes to the presentation of the different girls’ manga art as they all have their own distinct styles. The animation of their manga production is also very good, showing both traditional and digital production in natural and believable ways. The cuts to drawing manga never looks bad and never breaks immersion.-----Sound - 9 out of 10-----The sound direction for Comic Girls is rather solid. The opening and ending theme songs are good and the score is nice. But where these kinds of shows really need to shine is in the voice acting and Comic Girls does not disappoint. All of the characters are voiced with feeling and they all seem to fit the characters well. You really sense the excitement when the girls are talking about their passions as well as how down they feel when something isn’t going quite right. It is all just very well done.-----Characters - 10 out of 10-----The success of slice of life and especially CGDCT shows absolutely hinges on their characters. Luckily, the characters in this series and their interactions with each other are all just wonderful! From the moment that we see Kaos, her weird small cuteness is evident, emphasized with her almost comical ability to attract animals. Koyume’s peppy airheaded nature is a lot of fun to watch as is her love for another character.... Tsubasa’s passion for her long-running shounen manga is exciting and funny to watch at the same time and it makes her sparse moments of distress all the more amusing. Then Ruki’s concern over making a series in a genre that she is embarrassed by (smut) and not really fitting the image of someone you’d expect to write such things (being an inexperienced high school girl with an unimpressive figure) causes her much more stress than it should while she is still able to maintain the status of being the most mature and well-put-together of the main four. The series also has a great supporting cast with very fun adults and a fifth girl who is one year older than the rest and not seen much because of “reasons”. The characters are truly all great fun and if you connect with them, it will make the series for you.-----Enjoyment - 10 out of 10-----I loved this series. Despite some minor pacing issues and maybe not going into enough detail with some of the story elements than it could have, everything just worked for me in the end. As I score based purely on enjoyment, this did end up getting a 10 from me on my personal list. Other than just getting immersed in the lives of these girls, I was also able to relate to a lot of the art elements as someone who did draw regularly in the past (especially in high school). While they don’t go particularly deep into the production of manga, I feel that there is enough here for anyone who has ever attempted to draw in any serious or semi-serious fashion to relate to. Early on the girls talk about things that they are just not very good at drawing and there are also instances of procrastination and just not knowing what to draw. While there are a lot of funny moments in the series, it also feels genuine, coming from a place of love and not just being some cash-in or purely an advertisement for the source manga.-----Overall - 9 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----Well, in case it isn’t clear already, I think this series is great. While it does stumble at times, I feel that everything else in the series makes up for it. If you enjoy this kind of show, it is definitely worth seeing. Let yourself get taken in by the characters and laugh and cry and smile ear-to-ear like an idiot. Now, would this be enough to convert the “serious” anime fans to the joys of CGDCT? Eh, probably not; they’ll most likely have their minds made up going in and not be able to see this as anything but the pointless moe dribble that is RUINING ANIME!! But for anyone else who can just let themselves watch something nice without any kind of earth-shattering plot, keep an open mind, and enjoy the lives of some cute girls, then you shouldn’t be disappointed, especially if you’ve ever enjoyed creating art of your own. + activity” sub-genre of CGDCT shows which K-ON! largely brought into style.

So I ended up usually calling them by their most unique characteristicI like Kaos. She is probably the MC of the MC's. Although she usually isn't as focused on. I like her really pervy side while also being really innocent. She will always be filled with joy when being hugged by the other girls. I do end up feeling kind of bad for her that she is so small. I like imagining that off-screen she has a massive growth spurt and at least becomes as tall as the other girls. I'd love if they went away for summer and when they come back, Kaos Is a giant girl with big boobs and what not, Just so I could see their reaction, I'd imagine that Ruki would get a ton of... Material for her manga work.Ruki Is probably my favorite if not then 2nd favorite right next to Kaos. I like her character and personality. I also love how she only really exceeds in drawing Porn even though she's more of what you'd call the level-headed one. There are plenty of Yuri themes in this. But I do think both Ruki and Kaos are the best together.Koyume Isn't a bad character. But I have seen her character before in other anime. So I don't have too much to say. She's the airhead of the group and has a crush on Katsuki.  She also loves food, That's mostly her character. She's still fun to have on screen. But boiled down and she seems kind of basic.Fuura Is probably my 3rd favorite even with her having the least amount of screen time. Her character fits her genre of music (Horror) I'd say that both her and Ruki are probably the most attractive of the group. I do think both Ruki and Fuura would also be a good couple tbh. I have trouble deciding if I like Ruki and Kaos more or if I like Furra and Ruki more. So I decided to just settle it and say fuck it, We're going the Harem route.Katsuki Is probably my least favorite of the group. I do find things I like about her. But she didn't interest me from the start. So with the story focusing so much on her tell around episode 7. My dislike seems to have grown more. When I look back, She's bad. She has funny moments. It's just during the time with having stuff shoved down my throat. I eventually got annoyed. I always like Tomboy characters. But she just doesn't do it well. I think her character would be more interesting If she was a very girlish girl but she tries to act like a Tomboy for her stories or whatever. When she was acting girly, I think she was actually pretty interesting.I noticed from around episode 10 or 11 tell the end, That the creators got really creative with the animation. It was honestly a nice sudden change from the usual calm animation you'd expect from a show of this genre.I do find episode 11 and 12 to be kind of depressing with them moving out and them seeing all the other Manga artist that have already grown up. I felt that was a little down but then we got to the very end of episode 12.Overall, This show is pretty good and much more then what I'd expect with such a premise. Pink-Hair-Girl < KaosThe names besides Kaos's name weren't really that rememberable. So I ended up usually calling them by their most unique characteristicI like Kaos. She is probably the MC of the MC's. Although she usually isn't as focused on. I like her really pervy side while also being really innocent. She will always be filled with joy when being hugged by the other girls. I do end up feeling kind of bad for her that she is so small.

The characters are cute and their interactions were also cute and sometimes funny to me to what they were doing, well one of its genre was comedy. I liked the character that Moeta Kaoruko had at learning more about how to improve her art and how to have confidence in my opinion. This is just part of my taste in anime so you dont have to agree with me if you dont like my opinion. So i will recommend this anime to people that like cute things and slice of life. ', 'Now this was a surprising anime. I went in expecting your typical “cute girls doing cute things” moe slice of life comedy that we seem to get at least every season. And it was in fact a “cute girls doing cute things” moe slice of life comedy. I’m already extremely partial to these type of shows and it’s really hard to make them not enjoyable (With the exception Hinako Note. I’m falling asleep just thinking about that one.) Comic Girls follows 4 manga artists who all move into a dormitory to work on their original stories and attend school. Surprisingly, the whole school aspect of...Comic Girls isn’t really embraced that much. There are a few scenes to be had in this environment, but most of the fun happens in the dorms or out in the city. From the get go, Comic Girls lets you know that you will love each and every character in this anime. All four of them manage to be so lovable and fun to see interact with one another. Kaos (The definite main character) should be protected and kept happy at all costs because she deserves to be loved and cherished. She’s a 4-koma manga artist who struggles being... Well, good at manga. Tsubasa is an athletic tomboy who really only cares about her popular Shounen manga series. When she gets into writing, she dons the outfit of the hero of her manga to hype herself up. Ruki is s rather innocent and serious manga artist who despite wanting to stick with children stories, somehow ended up writing more erotic ones, much to her disappointment. Koyume is another up and coming manga artist who’s always energized, peppy, and writes romance manga (She also has a crush on Tsubasa, so that’s a plus.)All the characters have different methods when it comes to writing their stories, how they prepare, how they relax, and how they help one another. All four look out for one another and become genuine friends quickly.The comedy always hits its mark. There’s never a joke that goes by that isn’t at least worth an inner laugh. Yet the anime also manages to add in very touching moments. It finds the perfect balance of when to be funny and when to get emotional. While the animation isn’t anything too special, Comic Girls does this thing where it’ll suddenly appear like a manga panel on screen which can add to the charm and humor in some cases.While it doesn’t have the biggest focus on what goes into making a manga itself, it still shows how time consuming and stressful it can be, especially since the c at are all high schoolers. By the end of the anime, they all have grown in their own way in order to make their manga better than ever. You get to see how they improve and the strides they make as manga artists. It was filled with lovable characters, had great humor, great chemistry among the cast, and surprisingly touching moments. This is an anime I will genuinely miss seeing each week. I haven’t heard much about the source material, but if there’s enough to work with, I would be so damn happy to see Comic Girls make a return someday. We need more Adventures of Kaos-chan.

This anime even made me want to pursue my childhood dream again, which is to be a manga artist.StoryIf I told you that the plot was 'four high school girls living in a dorm and making manga', you would automatically think that it was very, very boring. But OH BOY. This show's plot is so simple and so mundane, when you get on to watching it, something is just so charming about it! I really don't...know how to describe it-its making the most normal thing and turning it into something that just makes you happy, like you are rooting for the protagonist's dream.ArtThe art style and animation are really good! It's colourful and feels so chill. I don't know how to critic it, The characters are so lively and colourful! Their designs are also really simple yet charming, my favourites being Kaos and Fuura.SoundI don't really care for the sound, for me, it's more about the story and art. But its Opening and Ending are both nice songs, that's all I can say.CharacterThe characters are so charming and relatable, you really connect with the characters and route for them, There is no character I dislike in this anime. For a start, we have Kaos. She cries most of the time but she has a dream of being a mangaka, and I relate to her a lot. Then its Koyume, she acts just like a shoujo protagonist. She's bubbly and airheaded and is just lively all around. Then its Ruki, I love her a lot! She's mature-looking and cool but in this one episode, she states that she is insecure about her small breasts and about the type of manga she writes, ecchi. Tsubasa is next, she is really, really cool! She writes Shonen manga and she cosplays as her characters to motivate herself. And last but not least, My favourite character, Fuuka Suzu. Oh my. She writes horror manga and she likes scaring other people but she's also a kind but awkward person I relate to the most. Her personality is great BUT HER DESIGN. SHE IS SO PRETTY.

The story takes you on a road trip around the daily lives of the mangakas with perfectly timed comedy and beautifully portrayed and well timed emotional scenes. Overall, I really loved the story but I felt as a slice of life anime it should have been more realistic (the amount of kindness shown towards main character is absurd and unrealistic!! but of-course this is just my opinions :P). But other than that its a well deserved 9/10 for the story.Art: 10/10This is by far the most captivating part of the anime,the art style is moe with bright and delicately colored backgrounds which perfectly blends with the anime itself. The animation is smooth,colorful and realistic which makes you feel like you right beside the characters experiencing the moment. After a very long time I got the thought :- ""the art can\'t get any better than this."". Easily a 10/10 for me.(Studio Nexus nailed it here)Sound: 9/10The opening and ending themes perfectly match the feels from the anime. And the ost and voices of the characters were splendidly done and well placed. 9/10 here.Character: 9/10I never thought I would say this but the character were well developed and well portrayed for a 12-episode anime ,even the support characters were used exceptionally well. Each character had their own individual traits and very interesting backgrounds.A very well deserved 9/10 here.Enjoyment: 10/10At no point of the episodes was i bored or even looked away from the screen. I was completely immersed into the show so again 10/10 here.(The fresh art style,story and character completely immersed me into the show)Overall : 9/10If you have ever felt you needed to take a break/escape from common psychological,horror,...etc genre of anime, I recommend you watch this series because it will leave you with a refreshed and calm mindset with a warm and cozy feeling in your heart. But I felt that it follows the usual high school girl path which disappointed a little since I wanted an adult perspective of being a mangaka but other than that the anime nailed it and hence the score.*(By the way if you are interested in knowing how a manga is made and what type of dedication it requires i highly recommend you watch this anime)*Overall, this is definitely on my ""recommended"" list.PROS:1) Interesting story2) Well-timed comedy moments3) Characters were well voiced and portrayed4) Art/Animation is beautiful5) Ending was satisfactory6) MoeCONS:1) Moe (Yes, both negative and positive of the show)2) Same old High Schooler\'s perspective (though we do get adult-perspectives of being a mangaka at the end)P.S  (""May contain a lot of grammatical errors and still a beginner at reviews"")***************************************************************************** Kaoruko Moeta who moves into a dormitory to improve her manga where she meets other female mangaka of the same age.

But I felt that it follows the usual high school girl path which disappointed a little since I wanted an adult perspective of being a mangaka but other than that the anime nailed it and hence the score.*(By the way if you are interested in knowing how a manga is made and what type of dedication it requires i highly recommend you watch this anime)*Overall, this is definitely on my ""recommended"" list.PROS:1) Interesting story2) Well-timed comedy moments3) Characters were well voiced and portrayed4) Art/Animation is beautiful5) Ending was satisfactory6) MoeCONS:1) Moe (Yes, both negative and positive of the show)2) Same old High Schooler\'s perspective (though we do get adult-perspectives of being a mangaka at the end)P.S  (""May contain a lot of grammatical errors and still a beginner at reviews"")*****************************************************************************', ""I might spoil the show when analyzing the characters. So don't read if you haven't watched the show! Unless you don't care...I am an artist. It may seem like I'm bragging, sorry if it does, but it is pretty important to my enjoyment for this show. Cause even though every artist doesn't have the same experiences, there are things that many artists do feel.Being ashamed of oneself work, not feeling deserving of food and other self-destructive thoughts.I have never really seen an anime about art that shows this side of how artists feel. There are probably other shows that do this. Maybe even...shows I have seen that do this. But this is the show that has made me remember that part the most. Cause the artist part in many anime characters is irrelevant in most cases. The character might be memorable, but the fact that they're an artist isn't. It isn't important for the character that they are an artist.I'm not saying that a character should change because of a hobby they have. But that's kind of what it is. To most artist characters I have seen, it is just a hobby. Again, this is fine. But for me to really resonate with an artist character, the art part should be their personality. They're hobby effects them as a person. That might sound weird. But it is the one thing that makes me like Comic girls so much.In the show, Moeta moves into a dorm with exclusively artist. This was a way for her to gain experience from these artists. To find inspiration. But as I see it, I wouldn't say that living there was particularly good for her. Yes, she finds very good friends and the ending might have been different if she didn't live there. But, Moeta doesn't really feel good living there, even though the friend she makes, makes her happy. Cause as I said before, there are things that artist do when they're not happy with their work. And living with two artists that already have serialized works, this feeling is only amplified. As Moeta lives in the dorm, she does a lot of self-destructive things. She stays up all night to finish her comic ideas, that she knows will inevitably be trashed. She rejects food since she doesn't feel deserving of it. Of course, she doesn't even have a serialized comic yet.And as an artist, I resonated with her a lot. All of the feelings she gets around her art is something me and a lot of artists feel. I can tell that an artist wrote the story.And she wasn't the only artist that was written so well. We also have Ruki and Tsubasa. While they weren't as relatable, they were still really good. While Tsubasa doesn't have any particularly bad feelings against her art (At least from what we know), her parents do. They are very much against her drawing. That's why she moves to the dorm so that her parents wouldn't shame her.Ruki also experiences something a lot of artists do. When becoming an artist, her agent sees how attractive her art style. She advises her to draw more attractive manga since her art style compliments this genre. This leads to her being successful as a hentai artist. And while she tries to implement a romance aspect into the comics, that doesn't help her self-image. The fact that she's a hentai artist kills her. It's only when she meets her fans and she sees how much they care for her story that her self-respect gets better.Sadly, this was only how I felt in the beginning When we stopped learning about their insecurities, the story gets a lot more boring. We keep seeing Moeta's self-destructive nature from time to time. But it wasn't as interesting as before.But because of my bias, I will give this show an 8. I would have given it a 7 before. But the very accurate depiction of artists was just so interesting to see.Weak 8/10 shows I have seen that do this. But this is the show that has made me remember that part the most.

She actually has lots of character development and has her shining moments. The 3 other supporting characters each fill some sort of character troupe, and even though there is many contrasting character traits, they all feel like a very well written friend group. There is the classic Tomboy, Tubsasa, who writes shonen manga. Koyume, a bubbly girl who loves sweets and writes...shojo manga. And Ruki, A self-conscious girl who is very loveable and writes... adult... manga. The girls all mesh together well and create a positive enviroment that is fun to watch. I would also like to mention that there was almost no male characters whatsoever, so use that information as you wish.Sound: 9/10The voice acting is very well done, You can tell that the voice actors fit their characters very well and put lots of passion into their roles. especially the voice actor of Kaos, Hikaru Akao, the voice actor for Tsubasa, Rie Takahashi, and the voice actor for Fuura (a supporting character with a ghostly personality) Reina Ueda. The music is also very high quality and the intro mv very accurately describes the vibe of the showArt: 7/10The art is very good, nothing special, but it is a very classic moe style, with cute anime girls in every scene.

There is also a few ""flashy screens"" but no significant moments that I can remember. And there is not really any jumpscares. This anime is not dubbed in english. So you will have to read subtitles to understand without speaking japanese. There is also a fair amount of fan-service, but what did you expect, This is yuri.Overall: 9/10This anime isnt anything special, but it dose nail what it was intended for. To be a happy, moe anime with a light hearted story with unique characters and moments that catch you off guard with how funny they are.

There were 3 stellar episodes, 2-3 idiotic ones and 3-4 passables, not a bad ratio considering the sorry state of contemporary anime. Pinkhead protagonist is extremely annoying but the character interactions are interesting and often funny and occasionally scary, despite the overuse of stereotypes. We just look forward to new episodes of Comic Girls every week and can\'t explain why, the Jappari Park of 2018?With a bit more thought given to the script, though that\'s a contradiction for this...kind of near-zero IQ series, C.G. could have become a truly memorable franchise, especially if the animation budget also got a boost so as not to use blurred photos here and there. Anyhow, C. G., supported by good OP and ED, is still worthy of an ""idle-minded"" colourful and loud marathon watch for the summer. kind of near-zero IQ series, C.G. could have become a truly memorable franchise, especially if the animation budget also got a boost so as not to use blurred photos here and there.

The comparisons towards Bakuman is probably just at the surface level of  making manga and all the trials and tribulations"", seeing that Comic Girls is a Manga Kirara Time work, the competition aspect is barely there, instead more about friendship and camaraderie of helping bring manga\'s to life in this anime.Kaoruko ""Kaos"" Moeta voiced by Hikaru Akae is our resident narrative focus of the anime and we do get a plotline of her growing as a mangaka and learning it from her dorm friends....She is also the typically shy and extremely nervous character of the core cast and has a REAL habit of crying whenever she does something bad (or even a jabby compliment gets to her) though LA can relate to her through her shyness. Koyume Koizuka voiced by Kaede Hondo is a fledging shoujo mangaka and is your genki character of the core cast, she has a crush on Tsubasa that also helps with her shoujo romance manga and even uses this as reference for her manga as a result as well. Tsubasa Katsuki voiced by Rie Takahashi is your tomboyish-chunni character that makes shounen manga and even has her manga in publication already but she has to hide her identity to the public because of it. Lastly and LA\'s favorite character is Ruki Irokawa voiced by Saori Oonishi an ecchi romance mangaka and is your ojou and the voice of reason out of the main cast. All four of them gets some sort of development, whether it be about their home life, manga woes throughout the anime and mostly the development is spread pretty evenly in LA\'s eyes.Heck even the minor characters gets some limelight episodes, like the fifth member of the dorm being Suzu Fuura voiced by Reina Ueda, a horror mangaka, the dorm matron Ririka Hanazono voiced by Aya Endou and Mayu Amisawa voiced by Minami Tsuda, Kaos\' editor.This being a Manga Time Kirara work, yes, this is moe as hell, the yuri subtexts between the core cast are blatant and mostly a slice of life perspective towards seeing the day to day life of mangaka (and to be precise, a Manga Time Kirara one at that), but coming from the experiences of a once Manga Time Kirara mangaka (Kaori Hanzawa), that would make sense to draw (and write) what you know.Though this is a moe slice of life anime, typically it\'ll be all fluff and comedy, but throughout the anime with it\'s characters, they do go through some form of trials and tribulations as being a mangaka, such as Kaos trying to get her storyboard approved, Koyume needing to experience romance for herself for her romance manga, Ruki and her self-esteem towards her fans and Tsubasa and her family issues. yeah it\'s light stuff but nonetheless helps the cast grow and see WHY they draw manga in the first place and heck due to the four helping each other with their problems, their friendship and their character chemistry grow and easily makes the experience of watching the anime more enjoyable as you get invested (sure it\'s small potatoes but nonetheless it has an effect).The animation done by Nexus...is REALLY REALLY REALLY MOE, no joke, with it\'s vibrant and strikingly bloom towards nearly everything, makes the animation really pop. With such moe characters, of course the character designs are really moe yet detailed as well (everything from their irises and the strain of hair are emphasized at times), though this also being a comedy, Comic Girls also goes full chibi during it\'s more comedic moments for emphasis as well and LA doesn\'t mind that one bit as it completely helps with it\'s atmosphere of a slice of life comedy.As for voice acting, LA thought LA would get tried of Hikaru Akae\'s squeaky cadence, yet actually no, it was the right balance of non-squeak and oddly charming especially her ""Ababababa"". Rie Takahashi voicing an eccentric sometimes chunni character...did Megumin turn into a mangaka!?!?. No but seriously, Rie Takahashi did great as Tsubasa and did one of her more niche type roles as well. Saori Oonishi was great as the foil and straight man scthick for the more comedic moments as Ruki. Kaede Hondo was pretty much typecasted as the genki character but nonetheless did well. The rest of the minor cast were great, from Aya Endou as Ririka and Minami Tsuda as Mayu but LA definitely enjoyed Reina Ueda\'s ""creepy moe"" cadence. If LA did have a favorite voice actor....then it\'ll be a tie between Rie Takahashi and Saori Oonishi.Comic Girls is no Bakuman, but Comic Girls is to say the least the laxxed and less competitive look at becoming a mangaka. LA knows this will come off cheesy but Comic Girls is if anything but the bonds you make and how they can help you achieve your dream and is manifested easily with the core cast and their love of manga. Comic Girls was a moe and comedic ride in looking at the day to day life of mangaka with a great yet minimal core cast at it\'s back as you journey with their trials and tribulations along with them.Ababababa...

Brevity is the soul of of wit, as old Shakey said. Comic Girls manages to carve an identity for itself within the oversaturated market of ‘CGDCT’ shows by being a very genuine portrayal of what it means to be a struggling creative up and coming in a brutal and unforgiving industry, which will definitely be relatable to many people, myself included. With a unique artstyle and design sense, Comic Girls sets itself apart from the pack by giving weight to it’s characters and environments. Like such past shows as K-on, the locales and...backgrounds of Comic Girls feel like real lived in environs, which only furthers to enhance the atmosphere. The animation is impressive for what it is too, providing excellent comedic timing and some great creative gimmicks like the use of comic panel like cutaways to enhance gags and emotional moments.A lot of shows like this would push the technical and practical elements of its conceit to the background to focus on cute antics, but Comic Girls faces it head on, deadlines are always looming, improving and getting inspiration is always in the back of the characters’ minds. Even when allowed to relax, the characters’ creatives sensibilities are still at play, because they have to be, and this lead to some of the show’s best moments and gags. At it’s heart, this is a show about drawing manga, and doesn’t let you forget it, while still being able to have funny and cute hijinks along the way.The characters are definitely not original in concept, but are set apart from the usual cast of this type show by being more down to Earth, understandable people. Kaos is a delicate, self conscious, anxious wreck and I love it because the show is not afraid to show her as kind of pathetic and relatable as opposed to just presenting these traits as adorable quirks, which was refreshing. Tsubasa is a tomboy with trouble connecting emotionally but has her moments of weakness, struggles with upholding the lifestyle that she’s chosen, and has issues with reconciling her current self with how she was raised. Koyume, while seeming like the most simple character, has her own struggles with keeping up and her own self image. All of the residents of the dorm seem like people with real problems despite being professionals, or at least as accurately as you can represent this in a primarily comedic series. The plot progresses as you would expect, with mainly episodic stories of various issues that the girls face in lives as manga artists, with them learning things about themselves in a way that’s not too in your face as to be irritating.I have to mention the voice acting purely because it’s some of the best i’ve heard in the last few years, with plenty of hilarious nuance in the jokes and in giving each character a unique voice not just in the literal sense, but in the more personal sense, which goes a long way in a character focused series. Music is nice but not worth much discussion, and overall sound design is pretty standard. The show ended in a place that left things fairly open, while still finding a satisfying conclusion enough to leave me in good-ish spirits. Overall an entertaining series and proof that there still is potential left in creating quality shows in this genre. backgrounds of Comic Girls feel like real lived in environs, which only furthers to enhance the atmosphere.

I thought it was interesting how the adults were connected with one another in parallel to the next generation.It was pleasant to see how each of their characters matched what genre of manga they work on.I wish they gave more insight into the struggles they face such as trying to stay motivated or when they run out of steam while working. It was shown but I was still curious on the process of how they find motivation once more. Other things I would've hoped...to see would've been the differences between drawing traditionally and digitally, and what editors search for while reviewing the final drafts. I would've liked seeing them explain some manga jargon and perhaps them drawing in different art styles that they haven't tried before.The story has snippets of daily life, the art's adorable, the voice actors did amazing, and overall I enjoyed watching this series. to see would've been the differences between drawing traditionally and digitally, and what editors search for while reviewing the final drafts.

However, the rest of it is very dull.

This has potential. I had hopes of it being entertaining, but something has to be done about completely rewriting her. I know I'm driving this point home with great exaggeration, but she totally ruined this anime for me. Maybe sometime in the next 10 years she might reach tolerable level as a character, but I certainly would not stick around to find out. the type of girl that has the unbearable screeching voice of nails on a chalkboard in your ear all the time for at least half of each half episode, she's your girl.If you like the type of girl that's obsessed and quite possibly aroused in some way by mature/older women or those that appear older and/or has glasses (bonus points of she is being scolded by them), she's your girl.This really was a waste of my time and it really is unfortunate.

I'd have to nitpick the show to find anything worth dedicating a lot of complaining to as the show is good all around.I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible. The story overall is very simple, easy to follow and light-hearted. It's perfect...for the genre and it's purpose. The story doesn't involve any amount of unnecessary drama or chaos that would hinder the enjoyment of the show and gives a good amount of insight into the lives and work of the main cast of the show. The story contains some yuri elements (which are genuinely wholesome) and actually handles that theme pretty well without brushing things off or treating girls liking other girls as something weird, a phase or gross.The art is very cute and pleasant to look at. The characters are drawn in predominantly pastel colours, though in a way that doesn't make them sickeningly sweet to view. The proportions and art style make the characters appear adorable and soft. In terms of character design, one look at each of the characters can give you an idea of both their personality and the type of manga they create. Tsubasa, for example, is obviously a rather sporty/boyish character who likes to draw shounen manga, which makes the character design and art in this show effective.I don't have an exact judgement on the sound of this anime (I don't have the best hearing, so I'd use subtitles regardless of the language or quality) but I found it to be clear and not overwhelming. As far as I can remember there wasn't a crazy amount of sound effects and nothing was too loud or completely inaudible.I enjoyed watching all of the characters in this show. None of them are intensely annoying and they all have a good dynamic with each other. None of the characters clash or have regular arguments and there is no petty friendship drama in this show, something which I am glad about. The characters seem to genuinely care about each other and actually want to be friends, going so far as to help each other when they are sick or coming up to a deadline for their manga. I love these characters and they are easy to root for. They're also easy to relate to, depending on who you are.I found the show very enjoyable. There was a good amount of comedy without it being obnoxious and the humour was never offensive or cruel. The characters are fun, the art is adorable and the anime overall is great.As somebody who is a comic artist myself, or at least aspiring to be one, I found that this show is a really good source of inspiration and motivation. It makes you actually want to draw and work on your projects, even if you were losing hope in them before.I have rewatched this show, something I've only actually done with one(?) other anime, as this anime is something you can turn on when you need to relax or cheer up to just watch and improve your day. If you're ever feeling bored, stressed or sad, I recommend this anime.

And at first, Comic Girls seems to follow in the same vein.The four main girls are moved into a dormitory together with the expressed goal of it being helping them develop their skills as Mangaka. Two of them - Ruki and...Tsubasa - are already very much busy with the industry, keeping up with weekly chapters or developing new ideas, whereas the other two - Kaos and Koyume - may have debuted, but still have to get their work off the ground. And while I was watching, I kept wanting to see more of the manga-making process in the way a Bakuman for example did it. Instead we get the usual jokes of characters being worked to the bone with deadlines, the characters who volunteer to assist accidentally ruining the artists work... and most episodes honestly aren\'t about Manga at all. Instead they more heavily focus the girls going through small SoL-adventures together, going clothes shopping, hanging at the beach, crushing on each other... the usual. And I want to take the opportunity to praise the show on this front in particular - while the girls are high schoolers, maybe two or three of the episodes feature them in their school uniforms. More often than not, they are dressed in normal outfits - and damn, what a wealth of cute, fun and character-revealing outfits these girls sport! It was an honest-to-god joy to see, and really added to every moment feeling filled with life and color. Even on the basis of just looking at it, this show managed to be very entertaining and eye-pleasing - all without leery fanservice.Granted, the main character, Kaos, stand out right away by being a screaming, crying, weeb elementary-school-sized mess who loves watching girls being close with each other and whose storyboards are often rejected for being too unrealistic, not capturing the essence of what teenage girls are and do. Comic Girls is an ensemble show, yet Kaos is undeniably the focus and, for the most part, the POV character. She may have a lot of expressions edging close to cutesy, and the jokes about her putting herself and her art down start getting run into the ground almost immediately, but even so... she is the heart of the show and ends up what makes the whole experience very much worthwhile and unique to other 4-Girls-gag shows like this.However... as fun as life with her new friends is, Kaos is being told time and time again how bad her storyboards are, and it starts to get to her. She is really happy for her friends, but still wrestles with the feeling of being the one left behing, who is slower and not as good as everyone else. She beats herself up in a way that while usually portrayed as comedic, really shows her frustration in a relatable and endearing fashion. She just fails and fails again, and instead of getting annoyed, her editor takes pity on her to some degree, and advises her the following: ""Don\'t try too hard and instead make sure to enjoy life as a high school girl with your friends"".

It\'s a slice of life comedy that explores cute manga girls doing cute manga girl things. It\'s cute, it\'s filler, and it doesn\'t push the envelope. This is not a negative. Some might even call it a positive.Story:Comic Girls does nothing special with its story. It\'s a basic plot of girl moves to big city to pursue her dream, meets like minded people, improves skills, etc. There\'s no grand plot twist that the main character is a murderer, no time travel shenanigans, nothing that would make for the viewer to pause and go ""wait, wut?""It\'s...a good plot, and sets up conflict on an episode by episode basis, but it isn\'t innovative. It\'s not a movie and shaker. It\'s been done before. I can\'t recommend it for the story.Art:The art is beautiful. Plenty of vibrant and bright colors, good character design, and a surprising amount of detail. Personal high lights are Tsubasa\'s Cosplay outfits as she changes from high school girl to ""Hero"" and completely changes the level of animation.However, a point I\'d like to mark in his anime\'s favor is character outfits. It would\'ve been easy to make the girls stay in cute outfits all the time, but they sometimes go lounging around in outfits I\'d probably wear: sweatshirts and sweatpants, long sleeve shirts and pants, jackets and shorts. It\'s stuff I can actually see human beings wear while lounging around the house and that just put a smile on my face.Sound:There\'s nothing amazing about the OP and the ED. They suffice and do well enough. The voice acting, however, is on point. I confess, I\'m not familiar with the VA\'s, but they did an amazing job bringing every character to life. The only one I had a problem with was Kaos, as her screaming, crying, etc. was grating at times, but Tsubasa\'s mannerisms and the voice behind it more than made up for it.Characters:Finally, time to dig in to the meet of the show.Tsubasa is a tomboy who writes Shonen Manga. She cosplays as her characters while writing to get into the mood, she nerds out over manga, and she\'s a genuinely good person. She treats her skills as a product of hard work, and doesn\'t put anyone down for their lack of it. She\'s always willing to help anyone who needs it, whether it be with drawing, exercise, or, in one instance, a place to stay for a week.Fuura is a later character, and writes Horror. She surrounds herself with the most horrifying images she can, even going so far as to sleep in the haunted attic. Whenever she shows up, it\'s prefaced by seeing her in a reflection or some other way to creep a character out. She is, by far, the biggest teacher in the group, being the most knowledgeable and best able to teach others how to draw manga.Rukki is Tsubasa\'s roommate and draws porn. She\'s shamefaced over her manga, but she puts in genuine romance alongside the actual important bits. A skilled writer who just wants to find love, she is far less professional than Tsubasa in everyday encounters, but is far, far classier when meeting with fans.Kaos is the main character, a pink haired girl with confidence issues and an inability to draw decent manga. She\'s got a heart of gold, an enthusiasm that just don\'t quit, and even went so far as to attempt drawing porn. Needless to say, she\'s a joy to watch, when she\'s not crying or apologizing.The Supporting cast is decently sized, but we don\'t see much of them. The matron plays a very minor role in every episode, but the one episode that focused on her dealt more with other side characters. To put it simply, you won\'t have a fun large cast this time around.In case you couldn\'t tell, this was ordered in order of best to worst characters, and there\'s one character worse than even the supporting cast. Koyume is the worst character in the show, but that\'s not to say she\'s bad. She\'s simply one dimensional in almost every episode. She likes sweets and is a stereotypical high school girl from any anime you\'ve watched, albeit that part\'s lampshaded. It\'s just... I don\'t like her. She\'s not explored deeply, she doesn\'t change, except maybe being lesbian.Now, I wouldn\'t mind some yuri, but she goes about it in a bad way. Makes me feel bad and a touch creeped out.Enjoyment:I enjoyed it immensely. It\'s one of the anime\'s I\'ll be recommending for this season.Overall:A great cast of characters, beautiful animation, and comedy that leaves you entertained if not laughing.

So, if you don\'t want to be spoiled, please watch the anime before proceeding to read further.""Comic Girls"" - a show about cute girls doing cute things. Oh, and also drawing manga. Surprisingly, I thought it would be one of those generic cutesy anime that have been flooding the industry as of late but it turned out to be pretty funny and likeable. With that being said, there are certain elements that stood out as being rather weak, which leads me to give this anime a lower score than I want.Story - 6A high...school girl joins a mangaka-only dormitory in order to develop further and grow into a fine mangaka. Easier said than done, as this particular high school girl is rather bad at manga, receiving the worst possible reviews and having zero fans. To add salt to injury, her manga skill isn\'t the only thing that\'s underdeveloped. Still, she is determined to make it and with the help of her very colorful party of fellow dorm companions, her journey into the world of manga has just begun.Sounds good, right? It would have been even better, had there actually been any significant development/improvement in her skills. Or her character. Or anything for that matter. While the story does include her to a certain degree, it\'s pretty episodic and I felt that more attention was paid to the issues with the other tenants. In the final episode, she miraculously manages to, seemingly over a short period of time, draw a coherent manga - something she hasn\'t been able to do in years. Only to fall back down the path of rejected manuscripts during the outro.In short, the story starts somewhere and goes nowhere. It was nothing more than a sweet experience of a year in a manga dorm.Art - 8The art was pretty solid. I think anyone, who\'s in it for the visuals, will be left satisfied. It is very colorful, very pleasant to watch and it really brings out the characters to life. The choice of color for all the characters - from the cool-looking tomboyish Tsubasa with her dominant blue, to Ruki, with her purple image of a grown-up and mature woman, to Koyume, with her radiant yellow/orange signifying her playful and energetic persona, and Kaos with her pink childish style. I\'d say the art nailed the tone of the anime pretty good.Sound - 7Let\'s face it - the soundtrack in most of these cute anime is something not many people would listen to outside the actual anime itself. Still, it\'s pretty chill and relaxing. It sets the mood quite nicely and works well with the overall tone of the anime. Nothing mind-blowing but nothing bad either.Character - 6Another low score. But hear me out.All the characters go through some sort of development. Tsubasa was portrayed as this cool-looking tomboyish girl but she was also shown to have a girly and cute side to her, and also went through a bit of development. Koyume, who was, at first, the filler character for me, quickly got her spot in the show and had a pretty nice episode dedicated to her. Fuura-senpai, the creepy stalker girl also had a bit of spotlight, although only briefly. But, most of all, Ruki was, for me, the character with the most development. Going out from being extremely embarrassed about her *cough* work, to actually taking pride in it due to the support from her fans. It was truly beautiful.Did I miss someone? I think I mentioned everyone. I\' sure I did...Oh, Kaos-chan. Relegated to a side-character for the most of the anime. Truly a pitiful soul. I mean it - the amount of dirt thrown at her throughout the anime made my heart break. It was too much - such a pitiful creature cannot exist (if you don\'t believe me, just read her 2nd career choice). For me, this was overkill. Extreme overkill. This anime did NOT need to spit so much on poor Kaos-chan. In my mind, this was the worst part of this anime - the over-demoralization of this otherwise extremely pure and kind girl. I barely managed to sit through a few hours of her being shat on (pardon my french) by pretty much life itself, let alone actually being in her shoes. It was.. so sad. Couple that with her lack of development through the majority of the anime and you get the picture.Enjoyment - 9Still, I enjoyed this anime. Damn, did I enjoy it. It was pretty funny, pretty cute, sad at times, scary at times (Fuura-senpai). It was all. And it could have been even more. If only... IF ONLY!Overall - 7Sadly, the average from the above prohibits me from giving it a higher score. Please forgive me!Final words: Do give this anime a shot. It won\'t win the ""Anime of the Year"" award, nor will it blow your mind. It won\'t make you cry tears or laughter, nor tears of sadness. It won\'t leave you full, nor empty inside. But what it will do is give you a couple of hours well-spent, which you won\'t regret - something that a lot of anime fail at. school girl joins a mangaka-only dormitory in order to develop further and grow into a fine mangaka.

Still, it\'s pretty chill and relaxing. It sets the mood quite nicely and works well with the overall tone of the anime. Nothing mind-blowing but nothing bad either.Character - 6Another low score. But hear me out.All the characters go through some sort of development. Tsubasa was portrayed as this cool-looking tomboyish girl but she was also shown to have a girly and cute side to her, and also went through a bit of development. Koyume, who was, at first, the filler character for me, quickly got her spot in the show and had a pretty nice episode dedicated to her. Fuura-senpai, the creepy stalker girl also had a bit of spotlight, although only briefly. But, most of all, Ruki was, for me, the character with the most development. Going out from being extremely embarrassed about her *cough* work, to actually taking pride in it due to the support from her fans. It was truly beautiful.Did I miss someone? I think I mentioned everyone. I\' sure I did...Oh, Kaos-chan. Relegated to a side-character for the most of the anime. Truly a pitiful soul. I mean it - the amount of dirt thrown at her throughout the anime made my heart break. It was too much - such a pitiful creature cannot exist (if you don\'t believe me, just read her 2nd career choice). For me, this was overkill. Extreme overkill. This anime did NOT need to spit so much on poor Kaos-chan. In my mind, this was the worst part of this anime - the over-demoralization of this otherwise extremely pure and kind girl. I barely managed to sit through a few hours of her being shat on (pardon my french) by pretty much life itself, let alone actually being in her shoes. It was.. so sad. Couple that with her lack of development through the majority of the anime and you get the picture.Enjoyment - 9Still, I enjoyed this anime. Damn, did I enjoy it. It was pretty funny, pretty cute, sad at times, scary at times (Fuura-senpai). It was all. And it could have been even more. If only... IF ONLY!Overall - 7Sadly, the average from the above prohibits me from giving it a higher score. Please forgive me!Final words: Do give this anime a shot. It won\'t win the ""Anime of the Year"" award, nor will it blow your mind. It won\'t make you cry tears or laughter, nor tears of sadness. It won\'t leave you full, nor empty inside. But what it will do is give you a couple of hours well-spent, which you won\'t regret - something that a lot of anime fail at.', ""When I first heard about Comic Girls, I was excited because I thought it'd be nice to have an anime about manga artists. It's something that's not very common and it let's you see what it's like for manga artists.Story: 8/10Comic Girls is a slice of life anime, so it doesn't really have a proper story. However, I'm giving the story an 8/10 because it's a unique anime. It's basically an anime about a group of manga artists who live in a house and their day to day lives. It shows them develop and the kinds of manga they write. This has been done before...but it's rare. It's very nice to have a good anime that's not only cute and funny, but also shows what it's like for manga artists (particularly new ones) and how they write manga.Art: 8/10The animation was very nice and pleasant to look at. It's not absolutely amazing  but it's pretty good and what I expect to see in a 2018 anime. The characters were very cute too, particularly Kaos-chan.Sound: 7/10The opening song of the anime was pretty good, although the ending song, while not bad, was forgettable. The background music was nice too.Characters: 8/10The characters were all funny, very cute and I could even relate a bit with Kaos-chan and Fuura. I was nice to also see a lot of character development too, particularly with Kaos-chan.Enjoyment: 7/10This anime is another cute, moe, slice of life anime with cute girls doing cute things, but that doesn't mean it's bad. I still found it to be good and i enjoyed watching it. The characters were cute, funny and relatable and it was interesting seeing an anime about manga artists.Overall: 7/10I give this anime a 7/10 rating. While it is another cute girls doing cute things and slice of life anime, it was still fun and nice to watch. The characters were cute and relatable and the story was interesting. It has several funny moments too. If you're looking for an anime about manga artists then I definitely recommend this anime. If you're not bothered and you just want to relax and watch a nice slice of life anime, then I think you should go for it, although if you're new to this genre then I strongly recommend the anime 'New Game'. but it's rare.

In fact, it is one of the better examples of the CGDCT genre I've seen. That it is not the absolute best CGDCT show around is due to the existence of genuinely excellent shows like K-On!, but any fans of the genre should make a point to watch Comic Girls. They will not be disappointed.The cute things our cute girls are doing in this case all revolve around manga. All four main characters are young manga artists living and drawing in a dorm together....I'll get to the girls in a second, but it is worth pausing here a moment to make a point. One of the things that sets Comic Girls apart is that it takes this subject matter, the difficulties faced by young aspiring manga artists, seriously. Yes, it gets drowned out most of the time by the moe and the jokes and the incessant emotional outbursts. But it is there, and that is to the show's credit. Sometimes the main character is crying because some comedic trick has been played on her. But just as often it is because she is dealing with imposter syndrome from living with her talented and more accomplished friends, or because she has worked herself to exhaustion on her most recent storyboard, or because that storyboard was subsequently rejected out of hand. This lends Comic Girls a depth that CGDCT shows often lack.The girls. As in nearly all CGDCT shows, they are all cute and all fit some identifiable archetype.  Here those archetypes correspond to types of manga. One girl is an extremely feminine social butterfly. She draws shojo. Another is an athletic tomboy who is always ready with advice, a plan of action, and a helping hand. She draws shonen. You get the idea. The girls do a good job embodying their respective types of manga, even down to their flaws. The shonen artist can be overzealous and overly macho. The shojo artist is a bit self-indulgent. The horror artist can't stop trying to scare everyone.I personally found myself most fond of the tomboy. Maybe one's favorite Comic Girls character serves as a rudimentary Rorschach test of sorts? Shonen is probably my favorite type of manga, after all. I suspect, however, that this idea will be resisted by those whose favorite Comic Girls character is the young girl who draws hentai.The overarching plot of the series is the main character Kaos's attempt to break through and get her first story published. This is standard stuff, but done well. The main plot is typically in the background anyway. CGDCT thrives in the everyday incident, and so that is where most episodes of Comic Girls smartly focus. A trip to the art store, a looming deadline, and falling asleep in school after meeting that deadline all furnish enough plot to sustain entire episodes. Those episodes are uniformly good, packed to the brim with cuteness and jokes and the occasional bit of emotional depth. When all these features come together, as they sometimes do, Comic Girls is capable of surprising you with how good it is. It surprised me, at any rate, when a visit to the shonen artist's home provided laughs, a cute new design for the character, and a great deal of depth regarding the inspiration behind her work.For fans of the CGDCT genre, this show is an absolute must-watch. But this is a show that even those less fond of the genre might want to give a look. Yes everyone and everything is cute and unfailingly nice. And I will confess that the screaming and crying of Kaos wore on me quite a bit at times. But still, this is a show that has a lot going for it.

It's review time where we get to rate anime based on how good we felt the anime is. And I'm really happy to be reviewing probably one of if not the funniest anime this season, Comic Girls! It's the anime that made me LoL every Friday when I watched it, and the anime whose comedy cures depression after you've watched a depressing episode of another anime.Story: Pretty straightforward. It's about the MC Kaos-chan wanting to be a Manga artist but always fails her manuscript. However, with the help and support...of her friends, she finally manages to succeed and get her Manga featured! Of course, who can forget the Koyume X Tsubasa moments those are very cute and adorable xD. The story as a whole, is lacking story development. It just skims through very briefly on the important parts which is annoying, but come on, this anime isn't really about the story, it's about the comedic value. And w/o a doubt, the comedic value of this anime is 10/10Rating: 8.2/10Animation: The art is pretty decent, I mean you add Manga art to the anime it's ok.Rating: 8.3/10Sound/Music: Nothing much to say. It's on a whole decentRating: 8.3/10Characters: Now for the best scoring category: characters. Surprisingly for a 12 episode anime, the character development is quite detailed. The anime actually makes the effort to develop all of the main characters personality and character. Of course, my favorite character is Kaos-chan, cuz she's so freaking cute!!! From the always happy-go-lucky Koyume, to the caring but serious Ruki to the manga serious Tsubasa, the characters are perfect!Rating: 10/10In conclusion, funniest Spring anime 10/10. I just watch this for the comedy nothing else.

If anything, this formulaic structure means newer shows based off of a Kirara series, or something very similar are already in a disadvantage. So, some shows do make an effort to differentiate itself from the crowd to varying success.Comic Girls is unique not because of its theme on drawing manga (that theme ultimately has very little impact on the whole show), but because of Kaoruko. Kaoruko, or some say Kaos, is an...incredibly unique and bold choice for a protagonist, for she is the embodiment of the author herself. More than anything, Kaos\' personality and interactions with the rest of the cast is what makes the show. Everything from her self-loathing, to her endless infatuation with the girls, to her struggles in even drafting a storyboard all feel incredibly earnest, so much so that she is the author for all intents and purposes. In a way, you could also see the show as a kind of meta-Isekai.The rest of the show is pretty standard as far as CGDCT shows go, but Kaos\' existence provides a fresh perspective on an otherwise increasingly formulaic and bland (though enjoyable) genre. In a sense, she\'s more relatable and empathetic than if the series would have went with a standard ""otaku"" archetype as its MC.All in all, Comic Girls manages to stand out among most Kirara shows by virtue of its protagonist alone. And its a testament to the importance of having strong characters as the primary driving force behind a show\'s enjoyability.Oh and the music is pretty good too.7/10 incredibly unique and bold choice for a protagonist, for she is the embodiment of the author herself.

It's a lovely cute anime and that's all there really is to it.It's funny but not in the way that you would laugh out loud but more just a smile on your face and go awe that's cute... or silly...and stuff like that.

The characters of this anime are just fantastic. From the crybaby main character Kaos-chan, to the tomboyish Tsubasa, there’s someone in the anime to like between the high school quartet (i think that means 4 sorry if it doesn’t ;-;) I love how these characters develop so much, even if it doesn’t always show.What this anime lacks is a good story. Now, this anime’s story is kind of like K-on!! where each episode has one big looming problem, that lasts for...the duration of the episode. However, Comic Girls normally attempts to fit two into one. This isn’t much of a big deal, and isn’t my problem either. My problem is it falls into the Phineas and Ferb sort of series where each episode is more or less the same when you break it down. A character is presented with a scenario. Said character attempts to fix it. Shenanigans ensue. They fail. They begin to cry/feel sad. Their friends help. The solution is resolved. This, isn’t how some episodes go, but it is how most go. (Spoilers coming up, skip to next paragraph to avoid.) I do really like how Kaos-chan ends up gaining a lot of independence (albeit via friends text messages) and finishes her manuscript.Now, is it a problem that all episodes follow more or less the same formula? No, not at all, like how Phineas and Ferb is also a great show. Lastly, to touch on other points of the show:The art is what you would normally expect from an anime of this type, not anything too special.The opening and ending are alright, though I wouldn’t listen to them frequently.

Even so, he never gave up and learned from his friends around him. As the title suggests, this anime is about the daily life of a mangaka, but like an anime that contains girls in general, their feminine thoughts will be inserted.What I think is unique here is the Chaos character who looks...funny, and if I think about it, his behavior is like a male otaku who doesn't have any female friends (lol). But I quite like it because his behavior is funny and his words seem to describe a male audience lol.Visuals are not bad, quite refreshing to the eye. For the problem of fan service, it only exposes body curves, almost every episode there is but it doesn't come out often or is too intense. funny, and if I think about it, his behavior is like a male otaku who doesn't have any female friends (lol).

I think because it's Slice of Life and also from Seinen demographic, they must to be realistic but still with light plot and light jokes too.

And sure enough the Art and Animation was wonderful. I liked Nexus when they did Calvary and Wakaba Girl so I wasn't worried about how the animation would turn out overall.Sound and Voice Acting: I wasn't a fan...of the opening or ending.

Freedom,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1747/Freedom,"['You have probably already seen or, at least, heard about Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira. The movie was beautifully drawn, with complex characters and admired for its illustrations of technology. So, when Bandai Entertainment announced that Otomo was working on a new anime series, his fans were naturally excited.Disappointment came in when I learned that Otomo was only designing the characters and the technological look of the series rather than writing the stories. However, after watching this OVA series with 7 episodes, I can now say I was impressed, although it could have been so much better plot-wise.Freedom is set in 2267 in the moon colony Eden,...after the Earth has been left uninhabitable due to an ecological disaster.The world of the series really is impressive. There are no giant mechas or spaceships travelling at the speed of light. Instead of relying on useless fantasies, Freedom goes beyond your average anime series and presents us with a more realistic world, where people work and live in. And besides, you never see anything happening on the moon so that is definitely a plus.The biggest fault in Freedom lies, without a doubt, in the plot.Screaming Akira, this series follows a group of teenagers, led by Takeru, who spend their time racing and working on their “vehicle”, a three-wheeled motorcycle. Whenever they get in trouble, they are assigned to community service, or “volunteer work”, as the CAC calls it, which basically consists of walking along a tube on the lunar surface to check for leaks. It is during this tedious duty that Takeru witnesses a satellite smash into the Moon’s surface nearby and within discovers a photograph of a woman standing over a group of children on what looks like Earth. We will basically follow Takeru in his search for this woman.It takes two episodes (out of only 7) for the story to take that important twist that moves things forward and, even after that, things seem to progress rather slowly. There is, in fact, too much talk and not enough plot.Another negative aspect is that there was too much Cup Noodle product placement. Although Freedom was originally made as an advertising campaign, it doesn’t look good. If this was a TV-series, it would be alright, but not as an OVA.The artwork and animation are two of the strongest points of Freedom.The artwork is like an evolved form of Akira, since the style is basically the same.Animation is amazing, but it might require getting used to. Freedom is one of the very few anime (that I know of) to be made totally in 3D cell-shaded CG. Most people will probably need to get used to the style, but once you can look beyond this, you’ll be rewarded by a great series.The quality of art and motions is really well done. Their awkward motions are vividly portrayed. The racing scenes look like an upgraded version of the bike-chasing scenes in Akira, and they are also excellent.The opening is fantastic. I specially like how they associate things, like the vehicle with a kid’s tricycle. And the race sequence is like a manga brought to life and evolves as important events take place along the series. Truly amazing.If you’ve seen Ergo Proxy, you’ll probably detect resemblances in the soundtrack. Yes, the author is the same (Ike Yoshihiro) and the music style is also similar. I shouldn’t need to say anything else. The soundtrack is spectacular.The opening was one of the best ones I’ve seen. The song matches perfectly with the animated sequences. The singer’s name also speaks for itself (Utada Hikaru). As for the ending, despite being just instrumental, it strengthens the powerful climaxes on the first three episodes.As for the voice cast, it\'s not outstanding, but gets the job done (except maybe Sanae Kobayashi, who had a rather mediocre performance as Ao).The characters are the biggest strength of this series, although they’re just a group of hot-headed teenagers. Freedom is what a shounen anime should be. Shounen animes often forget that every teenage boy is an idiot. Freedom portrays that in a pretty realistic way, as their personality is consistent throughout, as opposed to the regular shounen with random idiotic ""filler"" scenes that are used not as part of the character, but simply as comedic relief. This is much better than your regular lead who just wants to become the best in the world, which just leads them to brainless directions without any real goal in mind… not really that interesting for me.Flaws in the character department mostly appear in the last episode because the creators decided to be too epic for their own good, and some characters become a bit unrealistic for the sake of a more ""epic"" ending.The enjoyment department is incredibly subjective but, personally, Freedom has its moments. Those moments are usually action scenes and the climaxes of the episode, which are, without a doubt, breath taking. Past those parts, most of it is average.Overall, Freedom is a very good sci-fi anime with great characters, a nice OST and a powerful animation and it\'s definitely a must watch for fans of the genre. after the Earth has been left uninhabitable due to an ecological disaster.The world of the series really is impressive.

I saw the first episode which then i was hooked from the street racing punks of the future. The story line was a little rushed with only being a few episodes. The main character driven by love that turn everything into an epic adventure and changing the world/moon. I really enjoyed FREEDOM and I'm sure everyone else will. Made my heart get all warm and fuzzy at the end. It is a good watch. "", 'I was drawn in at the first episode. Asking so many questions in my mind about what its about, where is it based, ect.. After finally completing it i can say this anime is making my top 5 favorites list. The story was outstanding, tons of suspense, i really enjoyed the whole post apocolyptic story of earth and how they made a moon base called eden for humans to live on. The art was amazing, what i would expect from the creator of Akira, everything was perfectly drawn and the technologic theme was amazing! This is def a must watch anime you will be at...the edge of your seat! the edge of your seat!', 'I find this anime really great and really complex for just 7 episodes. It gives you an idea of what humans would be like if earth was inhabitable or portrayed as inhabitable. Gives you an idea on what we could be on the moon if we want to colonize there. ', ""The story behind this series is really nice, the only thing that ruined it for me was the use of 3d characters which move in an overly robotic way especially when you pay attention to head movements, facial expressions and such. The scenery itself was okay with lots of details and grit reminding me at points of the comic book series Hard Boiled more than Akira itself. It's a nice series if you're into sci-fi and you cba to sit through clichet series with dull storylines. "", 'Freedom is really a bizarre project: it\'s an advertisement for the ""Noodles Cup"" (that you\'ll see quite often on the show) that became an OVA.It even goes stronger and deeper, as it was really big at that time in Japan, because the characters were drawn by the man itself, Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira, you know..), and Shuhei Morita was lead to the direction, with the touch of Yoshihiro Ike for the music.It was SO big, that the promotion and the success for this OVA and Nissin noodles was  already made way before its release!Besides, the fact it was made in 3D cell-shaded CG, was a...huge thing at that moment, as only few anime were already made using thins technology.What an invest and a project it was for just a publicity!But let\'s get straight to the point, and talk about the anime itself.Story (4/10):The story is really basic, and was probably made to be in similarity with previous Otomo works.It\'s about ppl leaving in a moon colony, in 2.267, while they left earth years ago, because nobody could leave there anymore.I have to admit that this story is really tied and focused about ""reality"", and how we could handle and leave in this king of world, and it works well at first. But that\'s it. The main plot is just about kids having dreams, and that suddenly wanted to go on earth to see a girl a character just fell in love about, after seeing a picture of her (yes).It could have been way deeper, and centered on the protagonists in a different way, but they didn\'t. That is obviously because of the 7 only episodes they had (even if the 7th last 40min), so they could not focus more on the universe, which is a bit of a shame (and i\'m talking a lot about the moon, or even earth itself)There are many many  scriptwriting facilities, that I will not tell to not spoil anything, but they are just wasting the taste of it\'s anime, making every challenges tasteless, and not even a doubt about the conclusion or what could happen to the characters.You already know everything, because it\'s poorly written.Even if I like the fact that it\'s just an ""easy"" script, about dreams, hopes and everything that you need in your real life, we\'re talking about an anime here. It was way too easy, and shows how easily they made the scripts and the plot of this story. You\'l never see something as deeper as Akira, for instance, in this OAV.However, it still has this ""real\' nice feeling while watching it, that\'s why I gave it a 4 instead of less.Art (06/10):Art is great in this movie. The 3D is really awesome for that time, and it\'s easy to go into it. Nevertheless, thet could have make way much more about the moon,earth, and even ships. I don\'t know, it just let a strange feeling while watching it, you know that they could have done way better!But it\'s still pretty decent, even nowadaysSound (08/10):The opening and ending are trully awesome, they fill nicely with the OAV, and the sound in general is really well written and transcribed in this serie. Even if we could have a best impression of space sometimes, I admit it\'s a nice OST. Well done Ike!Characters (05/10):Well, another weakness of this OVA. They obviously wrote them in like 5min, as they are easily recognisable from every character from every anime.Same kids as always, same bad guys, and same type of ennemy that became friends.Moreover, the ""hero"" is just a stupid kid that has big dreams,it works well here, for sure, but come oooooon... We\'re not kids anymore, you could\'ve just go a bit deeper, and try, at least?He just found a picture of a girl, leaving in earth, and suddenly decides he needs to go there to find her. I know, it\'s anime. But who does that?Even if it works well in this anime, it\'s hard to like a character, and devote to one of them, as they are all blank and without any imagination.You\'ll just follow them, without getting really into it. While they could just add a background for them, a story, for instance...Overall (05/10):At first, it was not easy to watch, as it starts with the classic scene of the race in an apo-world, and then the discover of a new civilisation... As always...But at the end, it was kinda ok to watch.The incursion of the noodles everywhere, for the adv, is not that annoying (even if they are forcing a bit with it). And at the end, I like the moral of the story.But it could have been way more than this, even with only 7 episodes.At the end, it just stays questions, and a bit of frustration, about how easily they just use the deus ex-machina mechanics, and plots eases.Nonetheless, I will highly recommend this to a child, or newcomer in anime, as it will be entertaining when you\'re not that much into it.But, objectively, this show deserves a 5. It\'s not bad, but it\'s not great either. Depends on how you\'ll like it, you could give it a 6, or a 4 if you were really not into it, but you have to admit that this show has good points, but also bad ones.Which makes it an easy watch, but a forgettable one.At the end, freedom is just an awesome advertisement, but an average OVA.I still recommend you to watch it, to have your own opinion about it! huge thing at that moment, as only few anime were already made using thins technology.What an invest and a project it was for just a publicity!But let\'s get straight to the point, and talk about the anime itself.Story (4/10):The story is really basic, and was probably made to be in similarity with previous Otomo works.It\'s about ppl leaving in a moon colony, in 2.267, while they left earth years ago, because nobody could leave there anymore.I have to admit that this story is really tied and focused about ""reality"", and how we could handle and leave in this king of world, and it works well at first.

Set on a human colony called Eden in the far future. But that is also what it comes across the writers started and ended with as they made this show. Minor spoilers ahead.I want to skip the first two episodes, while they are cool with the racing and all, these episodes are not really relevant to the rest of the show overall. So I focus my review on the big issue with the show, which...happens after episode 3.And at this point it feels like it devolves into a romanticized version a little kid might have of how these events could go down... All the interesting things talked about and shown up to this point gets thrown out. And it quickly feels like this was written for smaller kids. Don\'t get me wrong, the setup is still amazing (What if the human colony on the Moon deliberately lied to their citizens about the fact that earth recovered about a hundred years ago from being an irradiated wasteland?)Sadly, the show never really explores this concept to any satisfying degree and what we get instead is a very standard story of a boy exploring a foreign environment with everything else pushed to the side in favor of that and that alone. Be it the way the story unfolds, the character motivation, or how the new characters themselves act around the two ""aliens"".First the story:There is no way these kids would\'ve reached earth with the state their spacecraft was in. They also started without a space suit, and Takeru himself even landed without a helmet on to begin with.Next character motivations:Takeru\'s incessant obsession with a girl he only saw in a photo once and which for all he knew could\'ve been dead for hundreds of years already is not only weird, but also dumb as all hell. The two just happening upon her or even landing near her so closely.The way new characters act:Ao is the first big flaw with how she acts around Bismarck and Takeru, while the group picking them up in the desert initially made fun of both of them and their story - and rightfully so. Ao seems to just to buy into everything the two tell her. Their only proof is the photo they brought with them, and even the show itself has other characters asking them if they found these in other parts of 22nd century America? The show ignores it and the story continues, trying it\'s hardest to go into the tragic backstory of her and her family.Story development itself:Somehow all this time has gone by and nobody on Earth even thought about other humans being alive is also very strange. You would imagine they have telescopes, right? So the show honestly expects us to buy into the fact that 9 million humans live on Eden without noticing Earth citizens and vice versa for at least a hundred if not even hundreds of years...All of these little problems initially stacked up and shattered the suspension of disbelief the more it went on.If you want to recommend this to anybody honestly, it should be watched below the recommended age rating. That way it might end up being a fun waste of a few hours with the way this show goes down very obviously going with an idealized version of the events happening and which is not just told through the eyes of a teenage boy but also written like it.

Afro Samurai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1292/Afro_Samurai,"['I watched this series on Spike TV and i must insist this is one of the best dubbed animes i have ever watched!The voice over cast list start off with Samuel L Jackson (pulp fiction, Starwars) and Kelly Hu (X2: Xmen United) two A list actors very famous for their action movies. And their voices get put through the test as they  use their voices for multiple characters in the series. And the voices they portray are very believable in my opinion.As in terms of animation value, one only needs too look at their hair and their tattered clothing flowing in the wind...just like in a classic samurai showdown of the old days. Everything is very artistic and not to mention VERY gory (which is a plus for me).As expected of a 5 episode series, the story is not very detailed on character backgrounds and side stories except the main character (their website more than explains each character). But, they do throw you in the mix right away. The main character ""afro samurai"" is the second samurai in the world. And he is on a mission to become the number one samurai in the world. And thats where the story starts, his journey to his headquarters.the verdict? For those who want a quick pick me up action anime that you can finish in one sitting, by all means pick this up! but if youre looking for a super long anime, youre looking in the wrong place. just like in a classic samurai showdown of the old days.

It was recommended several times to me, but when I got round to watching it, I was appalled at the terrible, nonsensical story.First of all, the story as a whole is VERY mediocre: boy loses father, boy gets revenge on fathers killer, etc. It's like something from Daredevil. But the thing that really, REALLY pisses me of is this: he hardly ever fights humans. Seriously. He fights killer robots, humanoids and weird monks (one armed with a bazooka!), and finally a guy with 3 arms.That is why this series comes off as poor.However,...this is saved by the excellent animation with unique styling and excellent sounds. The artwork is great, and the voice acting by Samuel L Jackson adds the extra bad-assery that the show needs.The charaters were pretty bad. You know how I feel about the enemies, but even Afro-Samurai is badly portrayed. He's a 2D character, and the writers thought that if loads of bad stuff happened to someone, I'll automaticly feel sorry for him and be on his side. No, it doesn't work like that.Overall, not a series worth avoiding, but only because it's so short. There are plently of better anime to watch in the mean time. this is saved by the excellent animation with unique styling and excellent sounds.

Awesome!!So basically, the story goes around a futuristic feudal Japan where there are two headbands: Headband no.1 and Headband no.2. The fighter who holds the No.1 is considered god-like, the best of the best and can only be challenged by the one who holds the No.2 one. However, everyone, but literally everyone, can challenge the No.2 holder for the headband, meaning lots of trouble for that guy. Afro\'s father was the No.1 holder and died against a character named ""Justice"". Seeking revenge, Afro got the No.2 headband and is now heading to where ""Justice"" is waiting for him.He goes on as some people try to stop and kill him to get the No.2 title and at the same time we learn about Afro\'s past as he was training to be a great samurai. The fighting scenes are very enjoyable and the story is very simple but it is the typical good samurai revenge story. However, the characters are not that much deeply explored and explained, unlike Afro, but I personally think that it\'s not necessary in this case.A nice 5-episode anime to watch in a row.

It\'s not trying to be a masterpiece.Rather, it\'s a typical samurai-looking-to-avenge-his-father story, the only difference being that here our protagonist is black, and enjoys an icy glass of lemonade. The series does manage to succeed with its characters; while they\'re mostly cliches, they\'re also humorous and light-hearted enough that one enjoys their presence.But ultimately, this series is all about the action.And in that capacity, this anime succeeds; the fights between Afro and his enemies are visually stunning and well-choreographed. The movements are original, the enemies are...bizarre and detailed, and motion feels very fluid.As with ""Snakes on a Plane"", the title tells you all that you need to know; ""Afro Samurai"" is a fun, entertaining series, which is all it ever strove to be. bizarre and detailed, and motion feels very fluid.As with ""Snakes on a Plane"", the title tells you all that you need to know; ""Afro Samurai"" is a fun, entertaining series, which is all it ever strove to be.', 'When I first started watching Afro Samurai, I was blown away by the action scenes early on, as well as how contrived and generic the plot was. My early theory was that the plot was mostly around in order to set up more fights. As I got a few more episodes into the show, I was extremely disappointed to realize that the show creators didn\'t seem to realize how weak their own plot was, as flashbacks from Afro, and the main plot actually take up a very good chunk of the screen time, and those parts are pretty consistently boring.Afro\'s plot is just plain stupid...really. It starts off with the always reliable revenge story, but then it turns into a lot of stupid crap about trying to be #1 in the world. The character motivations to kill the hell out of each other never really make sense, so it\'s frustrating that so much time is spent on them.They try really hard to make Afro the coolest man ever, but well, he ends up not really standing out from any ""badass"" character I\'ve ever seen. Pretty much every other character in the show is basically annoying.Afro\'s main redeeming point is the fights, in which there are sadly not enough of them. All the fights in Afro are ridiculously gory, stylish, and satisfying. I might even say jaw-dropping. It\'s easy to look forward to the fights, but sadly, they don\'t occur nearly as often as they should. The amount of the fights on the show do start to increase a bit as the show goes on, but for the most part, they don\'t seem as good as the show goes on. I think that after the initial shock and awe of the blood and gore, the fight scenes kind of lose their effect, but they are still pretty fun.Afro Samurai\'s attempts to be stylish and cool really work when it comes to the fights. When it comes to the plot, the attempt to make a classic tale super cool and stylish end up falling completely flat. Afro Samurai was a shot with high potential to be an awesome guilty-pleasure. Instead, I just felt guilty that I devoted an hour and a half of my life to it. I wouldn\'t reccomend watching this, even if you are a total action freak. really.

Samurai blaxploitation revenge even. Not at all uncommon for anime. However, this anime is genre wise ALLl over the place. The main antagonist Afro seems to be pursuing through the anime is a gunslinger, so you think a bit of a samurai spaghetti western for a moment ( think Sukiyaki Western Django ), but then he\'s totally fighting cyborgs. Now, you ask yourself what the hell...just happened, but that\'s the thing it does it really well and fits into the Afro Samurai universe by itself that you really pay no mind.Art: For a nation that hasn\'t exactly been known for it\'s positive portrayal of people of color ( and use of black face among other things ), I honestly think the creator got Afro right for this. I have no complaints about the animation. It flows beautifully. I don\'t think I could like the anime nearly as much if the art wasn\'t as good as it is.Sound: The sound is very good in Afro Samurai also. The wind blowing scenes do very well, as you can hear their clothes blowing smoothly, not choppy crappy sound effects you get in a lot of anime or recycled sound effects used in some movies. The music is done by RZA, and if the name isn\'t familiar then you\'re probably not familiar with the Wu-Tang Clan. The soundtrack is dare I say it...and I think I do, ""dope"". It is amazing, it is a mixture of not only hip hop but some rock for some tunes. Not to mention the voice acting. Samuel L. Jackson is the icing on the cake for the voice. I could listen to this man\'s lines over and over again. ""DO THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN WHAT!?!""Character: Afro is pretty flat. He only has one objective: ""Get the headband.""I\'m honestly not sure what compelled me to like Afro, by all means he\'s kind of boring minus his awesome blade skills. The other characters aren\'t really developed upon much, but toward the end of the series we see a lot more into Afro\'s thoughts through flashbacks. However, Afro himself remains stoic, even though his previous incarnation was quite animated. Due to the events we witness through flashbacks, it\'s safe to assume when we find Afro now he\'s sealed himself off. He doesn\'t grow through out the series visibly, I\'d say he\'s not very round at all.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. There are good animes ( that win awards ), and there are AWESOME animes. The difference is, awesome animes aren\'t always good or thought provoking, and good animes are not always awesome ( think A Whisper of the Heart, good anime, but not awesome ). If you\'re the kind of person who watches movies lots of action movies and frequently says ""There weren\'t enough explosions."" chances are you\'ll like Afro Samurai for it\'s awesome factor.Overall. I give it an 8. just happened, but that\'s the thing it does it really well and fits into the Afro Samurai universe by itself that you really pay no mind.Art: For a nation that hasn\'t exactly been known for it\'s positive portrayal of people of color ( and use of black face among other things ), I honestly think the creator got Afro right for this.

I give it an 8.', ""I had read rave reviews about this in a couple of anime magazines. I mean an anime that features the voice of Samuel L Jackson in the lead role is got to be cool right? I had to check it out.I have to say I was very disappointed. The story is just a clich&eacute;, and there is virtually no character development. Had Samuel L Jackson not done some extra voices (like the annoying Ninja Ninja character, who is just a tad more tolerable than Jar Jar Binks) he would've had about 5 seconds of dialogue since the 'hero' isn't much of a talker.The only saving...grace for this is the quality of the animation, which is nothing short of superb. It would've been so much better if they ditched it as an anime and used it as a music video or something like that. grace for this is the quality of the animation, which is nothing short of superb.

I had heard it was pretty good so i wanted to check it out. To my surprise I noticed that the series was only five episodes long. They do in fact just through you into the story without a lot of backstory on any of the characters except for Afro Samurai.Story: The story was short, but it got straight to the point. Their are two rankings of Samurai in the world, The Number One, and The Number Two. The whole series is really about Afro Samurai, being the Number Two...samurai trying to become The Number One and Avenging his father who was killed for the number one spot. I liked the story because as it does follow the traditional style of anime, it is different in it's own right.Art: I found the animation to be really good, but that's just in my opinion. I thought the detail of everything in the settings was animated very well, and the characters themselves as well. The gore is brought out the best way it could be without being excessive.Sounds: The music for this anime was different being more of a rap song, with a sweet beat. It's not something you would expect in a normal anime, but compliments this show very well, and the music throughout is also very good.Overall I would give Afro Samurai an 8, because it was very good even thought it was only five episodes, it had the copasity to be so much longer, probably even as long as a traditional anime being 25 to 50 episodes. It's a good anime that I myself would recommend to others that are looking for a action filled anime that they can watch in one sitting.Thanks for reading, and this is my first review!! ^_^ samurai trying to become The Number One and Avenging his father who was killed for the number one spot.

Taking place in a world where the Strong\'s passion is to beat the even stronger and tougher; Afro (Who is named that because of his afro hairdo I guess,) is seeking the one who defeated his father in order to retain the title of #1.First of all, I would like to point out that the protagonist only motive for his blood-thirsty actions is to find the guy that killed his father that he could barely remember. Yes, revenge is the only excuse for the plot of Afro Samurai, and...it never goes any deeper than that, at the same time leaving no depth for any character personality. All of the character development is comprised of super macho men in stand-offs that ends in a gruesome scene; the premise of this story is fairly shallow and generic.I always love action that have a lot of gore, but this series just overdid it. With zero investment in the characters, a non-sensual storyline, even the fluid animations seemed boring after a few episodes. You know that the main character is not going to get even much of a scratch on him; every challenger is just going to get his butt-kicked with much to none of a chance to retaliate.Why is everybody aiming to beat Afro? Apparently only the one with the title of #2 can challenge the one with the #1 headband; what the series is telling me is that everybody wants to title of #2 so they can be targeted and attacked by murderers like themselves?Oh yeah! Did I mention we got Rpgs and guns vs swords? XDArt-8.5/10Weirdly enough, I really enjoyed the animations of this anime. The dark and vivid color palette really fit in with the atmosphere of the anime. The animation is wonderfully detailed and flashy, but hardly realistic at times. You can either find this animation super fake; as Afro blocks arrows and slices bullets with ease, or setting all realism aside and find the animations super cool (like me!) With the deep shadows and amazing effects mixed with a beautiful slash of red, all in a super fluid motion. I do find the character designs weird, as they kind of look abstract some of the times.Sound-7.5/10We have Samuel Jackson voicing Afro. Half of the people that watch this show probably came for his voice. But sadly, the rest of the cast\'s voices just seemed bland and tasteless for me. The Op and Ost are nothing special either.Character-5/10Afro is a super overpowered and cool character. He rather sets things straight with violence than reason, not giving a fuck to anything else. Afro is the definition of badass; he does what he wants, where he wants, when he wants while holding an imaginary middle-finger to everybody that looks at him the wrong way. All the men in this anime look fairly badass, while women on the other hand are just decorations in this anime for the fan-service factor.All villains are giant egomaniacs that engage in fights with opponents that are much more powerful, but are too dumb to realize that they cannot win. In the end, they all just end up as another blood stain on Afro’s sword.Overall- 6/10Afro samurai was a waste of time, but not a total waste of time. The characters had zero depth, and the plot was terribly bad. It did though; provide an excellent visual presentation and a great action atmosphere and lots of badass moments.

Now it is time for me to talk about an anime that I actually did not like: Afro Samurai. It's probably the most disappointing anime I have ever seen yet.Art:The art in this show is pretty bad. It suffers from the fact that it has no artistic value to it and what probably is the worst part is the fact that most of the time it is dark. REALLY REALLY DARK. So dark that you might as well be watching a black screen set to...dialogue and the only animation being sword slashes and blood. In fact, that is exactly what happened most of the time, every scene is just of blood and flashes of light. Character models were even lazy as all the characters just fell to standard design choices not making any effort to standout above the rest at all. The animation is the worst aspect of the show because honestly the supposed style that this anime wants to convey brings absolutely nothing new to the table and is just a big mess.Sound:Now moving on the best part of the show, but not enough to save it, the sound. If there was one reason to watch this show and the reason that I myself was interested in the first place, then that would have to be the most notable feature: Afro is dubbed by Samuel L. Jackson. What I can say, he's the only thing you are going to remember about this show as everything else is forgettable. If it weren't for the badassery that was Sam Jackson, then I honestly would have left this show alone. Thank god Sam Jackson delivers because the rest of the cast does not. Note to all the casting directors, never ever cast James Arnold Taylor in a serious role again because honestly the voice of Tidus from FFX is the last person I want to see do a serious role. The music is what it is, nothing special but not unlistenable.Story and Characters:Afro Samurai is boring. Just like that it is boring. The story doesn't come out across well and most of these characters are completely unmemorable. One could argue that the story isn't great because they were stuck with five episodes and a movie. That's stupid though because most anime fans know that FLCL is only six episodes and managed to actually see a plot in it despite all the random insanity that happens. I will tell you one thing though that I will give Afro Samurai points for. One of the characters. Ninja Ninja (the character where Sam Jackson does what he does best) who follows Afro around, is actually the one aspect of the show that I actually thought was interesting as we don't know whether he is real or Afro's conscious. It's a thing like that can actually make Afro Samurai more interesting to watch, however everything else is just makes the show not entertaining.Overall:Afro Samurai is a huge dissappointment. From the way it is presented, it would seem like that this would be a cool show especially when you get cinema badass Samuel L. Jackson. However, since the show lacks a lot and is so lazy I can't highly recommend it. If you are a Sam Jackson fan like me, then check it out and give it a try, for the rest of us, spend your time on an anime like Samurai Champloo.

We follow a revenge-driven man simply called Afro, learning more about him through flash-backs, as he strives to be the number one swordsman.There are several things that sets this apart from typical blaxploitation titles.  Most of it for the better. Firstly, it has high-quality animation that makes it look like it had a far higher budget than most titles in its genre. Its main characters are fleshed out to a greater degree than I had expected. In addition, it barely even touches upon racial stereotypes and ethnic differences. Why I think this all...works, is that now it stands out with amazing stylized art, more relatable main characters, and conflicts that are more personal to them, rather than just racist villains who'd want to fight Afro because he's black and nothing else.While Afro by all accounts is fleshed out in his backstory, he also suffers from being a silent protagonist. This makes Afro less interesting to watch by himself, but it fixes this problem by making his interactions with the world around him all the more contrasting and entertaining, especially with his ninja counter-part.While I do love battle royales and tournament-anime, Afro Samurai is a gauntlet-story, where the journey mainly consists of going through one minor villain after another in order to get to the boss at the top, video-game-logic. It falls into the same trappings as most other stories of its kind, which would be several villains that are just 1-dimensional throw-aways, and a very linear journey with no particular twists. Despite not usually being a fan of the format I think it did the best it could with its plot in how it told it.A simple plot with good music, visuals, and entertaining characters. works, is that now it stands out with amazing stylized art, more relatable main characters, and conflicts that are more personal to them, rather than just racist villains who'd want to fight Afro because he's black and nothing else.While Afro by all accounts is fleshed out in his backstory, he also suffers from being a silent protagonist.

But, seriously, who the hell cares? Because you're not supposed to watch this anime with a desire to see a complex plot, novel storytelling or deep characterisation.What you're supposed to expect when you decide to watch this series, is Samuel Jackson being a bad ass mother f*ck!ng samurai on a 5-episode-long quest for pure, bloody, decapitating revenge against the gloriously awesome Ron Pearlman. And that's...exactly what it is.The art is done in quite monotone and muted colour, with the exception of the bright red gushes of blood drenching almost every scene.

It makes for a visual treat.The presence of modern technology in places throws you for a loop at first, and I didn't quite get used to it, considering the environment the characters are in, but it's all part of what makes this show cool.And then there's RZA... is there anyone better out there to make a hip-hop soundtrack to a Samurai-bent-on-revenge-themed piece of visual media? I didn't think so.Afro Samurai is an excellent piece of bad-assery and entertainment.

I was a teenager when I saw Ninja Scroll. It gave what I wanted: fast paced action with lots of violence and tits. It wasn’t until years later when I re-watched Ninja Scroll that I realized no matter how good looking the action is, it’s shallow without the weight of good characters and story.Afro Samurai has the same issue. I loved it on my first viewing. Now years later, I re-watched it to see if it...still lives up, but the same lesson still holds. Action without meaningful characters and story is boring. Action isn’t actually about what’s happening on screen. It isn’t about the bullets flying, the cars exploding, the swords swinging; it’s the conflict between the characters and story.There will be - SPOILERS - but Afro Samurai has very thin story and characters anyway so you aren’t missing out. It’s worth analyzing why it could’ve been better because the material is already there for a great story, but it doesn’t execute well.The premise is that Afro, the main character, seeks revenge for the death of his father. He lives in a medieval Japanese fantasy setting mixed with some modern technology. His father’s killer wears the #1 headband, a symbol of power. Whether the power is real or not isn’t important. It’s that you need the #2 headband to challenge the #1. Afro sacrifices his friends and master for revenge. But the story isn’t about him obtaining the #2 headband. He already has it. It’s just one long walk to see #1; fighting along the way with flashbacks about his childhood.The theme of Afro Samurai is what will you sacrifice for revenge? Afro kills his master and lets his friends get butchered. He chose revenge over everything. The problem then is that Afro himself isn’t an interesting character. Afro is the strong, silent type. But he’s written so one-dimensionally that he ends up un-likeable. It’s hard to care about his quest for revenge. He speaks a few lines and has little personality.For us to care about someone who was willing to let his friends die so he could have his revenge, you NEED that character to be likeable. The show takes place after he’s already “cast aside his feelings” for revenge when it should’ve been about the process of it. We should’ve been seeing him give up his humanity for revenge. His childhood flashbacks don't help because they never paint Afro as anyone interesting. He's just as boring as a kid as he is now.So because he’s such a boring character, everything else about him is boring. He’s so overpowered that it makes the fights dull. We should’ve had a character that was strong, but still struggled along the way. They try to keep things engaging by giving him a sidekick, but it should’ve been him that was the engaging character.Add that with the fantasy physics then everything becomes a Saturday morning cartoon. They even try to make Afro look cool by having him smoke a cigarette after every fight, but it came off as lame.The only good character is Jinno, his best friend. He was one of the survivors from Afro’s childhood friends so he has plenty of good reason to seek revenge. It’s ironic the person that’s most deserving of revenge and you end up rooting for wants revenge against the main character. If Afro himself was interesting then their fight could've been 100x more engaging.The rest of the show isn’t too amazing either. All the colors are muted and gray so it becomes tiresome to look at. The villains don’t ever pose a threat and aren’t interesting themselves.I liked that they kept the power of the headbands ambiguous. Did they really grant the power of a God? It added a level of mystery and didn’t take away from the theme of revenge. The action itself is great. You're given a buffet's worth. Overall, Afro Samurai is good watch the first time.

These were grindhouse samurai exploitation films that you would see in an old drive-in theater after a screening of ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" or ""Wizard of Gore"". These...films didn\'t try to be artsy or deep. They simply wanted to spray the audience with blood and give them a good time with lots of stupid fun! By the way, a drive-in theater in case you didn\'t know is where the audience pulls up in cars and watches from their cars as a projection is cast on a large outdoor screen. Yes, those actually used to exist in the 1950s-1970s! They usually played non-mainstream films, most often violent exploitation films and porn.One does not watch Afro Samurai for the amazingly deep characters and philosophy, but for the over the top madness and fun! In addition to absolutely nailing the tone and feel of a 70s Samurai exploitation film, it also mixes that with another 70s staple: the blaxploitation film. Due to the synthesis of samurai style with hip hop music and dialogue, Afro is often compared to Samurai Champloo. The difference is that Afro takes itself far less seriously, but is MUCH more entertaining to watch and actually mixes the 2 cultures in a much more effective manner. The voice acting by Samuel L Jackson is superb, and the soundtrack is actually quite good, unlike Champloo!Afro Samurai may not be an artistic masterpiece, but it is a very fun ride that I would highly recommend. It is an American produced anime, but the Yanks actually did a great job with this one, so don\'t let that put you off! If you actually sit your ass down and finally watch this underrated anime, you will probably enjoy it. films didn\'t try to be artsy or deep.

Jackson plays the main character only raised my expectations. My expectations were met.To start (extremely) positive the animation is pristene and the direction of battle is executed exceptionally well with the animation style. Granted it the cliche blood physics are kept, but it is used to great effect during both battle and character development.My one criticism of the story is the not so original main character motivation of revenge and the reason for it. However, the character, or rather...characters, formed from this origin is far from predictable. As well as the underlying plot is not very imaginitive but what is seen on the surface is pure gold.The main character(s) is pretty much unbeatable: silent type, vengance driven, efficient killing machine samurai played by Samuel L. Jackson with an afro (black), and a loud mouth, weed smoking, counterpart also played by Samuel L.Jackson with an opposite afro (white). The villains are very unique and give new meanings to: never-ending supply, creepy, robotic ninjas, gunslayer, and insane teddy bears. Their motivation is not unique i.e revenge or power but still the story behind the explained is rather moving.One more, and final criticism I make, is sound during battle. I don't know why but I prefer to be able to tell which sound goes to what action to the extents that I think I'm supposed to. Yet, with this the awesome sound track as well as fast paced cool fighting sequences threw me off a bit.It's fair to say I really enjoy watching this series, because I do and I watch each action and blood filled episode with a feeling of great anticipation. characters, formed from this origin is far from predictable.

The characters, which seems like it should've been the main focus of the story in an anime that catologues the heroes' journey, aren't well designed. The episodes typically consist of the main character, Afro, fighting some foe that he takes out because he's a samurai. And apparently that makes him cool.The creators seemed to have expected us to root for him and think that he was the ultimate badass because of his voice actor, Samuel L. Jackson, his afro, his sword, his afro, his stoic and reserved aura, and...his afro. There isn't much room for character development or even story telling when your main character only says two sentences per episode that attempt to highlight how badass he is.The story, one where Afro must face off against the man who killed his father, isn't well crafted either, as the entire thing can be summed up by the first and last five minutes of the series, meaning that in a five episode series, four and half episodes are unneccessary.Despite this, I still found myself mildly entertained most of the time, and would recommend it to certain people, especially considering how short it is. his afro.

His chit-chatter of Afro Samurai's foreseeable demise is a common irritation throughout.While the voice acting was mediocre, RZA can be commended for his polished musical score for the series.Character - Being 5 episodes long, there was no chance...of any character development whatsoever, you either loved the protagonist from the start or loathed him, which would explain why sympathy was used as the initial attention puller.

Not only is the main Samurai character black in race but we are presented with a twisted alternate universe of Japan.As far as story line goes there isn't much, partly because of the series only lasting 5 episodes but also that it wasn't developed that much either. The plot line of why things are the way they are in this twisted universe is not explained, we're given a VERY brief reason to why and it doesn't make much sense aside from 'everyone wants to kill everyone'. Sadly to say the...story can be summed up in one line and that is &quot;All warriors want to be Number One&quot;. With all its flaws and open holes in the story, it still remains interesting because there has been nothing else quite like it. Seriously, when is the next time you'll see a animation about a Black Samurai with a rippin' Afro kicking some serious butt? Probably not for a looooong time.The art style can well referenced to being very similar -if not the same as- to the art used in Todd McFarlane's &quot;Spawn&quot; the TV series. It can be described as a very flowing but detailed art style with often a dark tone to it. The attention put into the finer details in the art form to make the action really come to life and defining the scene, it gives a surreal feel to the series. I particularly like this art style for its detail alone but the dark overtones really sets off really dark series like this one very well.The characters in this series are movie motion perfect for an action series and fit greatly into their roles but something is lacking. We learn very little to nothing about the characters in the series and what we are given we have to use our own imagination to fill in, which isn't too bad I guess (again, if it was more than 5 episodes I'm sure there would have been more).

What I mean to say is that most of the characters and dialogs sound as if a poor designed robot is try to articulate emotions it knows nothing about. More work could have been put in.Overall?

However there aren\'t many anime titles that I can say I actually hate as typically I\'m indifferent to anime shows that I don\'t like. However in this case just about everything in this series is just a mess and I\'m surprised it did well enough to get a movie adaptation of itself and a movie sequel (which is equally shit but I\'m not here to talk about that). Anyway we\'re here to constructively criticise,...not ramble like a moron.STORY (2) - A 2? Are you serious? Surely the story can\'t be that bad right? Believe me it is. No originality in any way shape or form, no plausibility in both the overall plot or the chapters it has to get there, the pacing is far too fast for you to care about anything as there are too few episodes and a god awful ending that comes out of nowhere. But I will go into great lengths to explain just how shitty this story is.The start of the first episode sets up the premise, Afro Samurai (yeah that\'s his real name apparently) is a man with a revenge motive because back when he was a child some bloke with a hat called Justice killed his father whom until that point was the strongest man in the world because his headband that says ""# 1"" on it says so. After Justice kills Afro\'s dad Justice gives Afro his old headband that says ""#2"" on it but he later loses it to some punks. From then on we realise we\'re following two stories. One revolving around Afro as a child trying to get the #2 headband back by tracking down whoever might have it because for some reason he needs it in order to challenge Justice to a duel to get his revenge and another when we see the present day Afro with the #2 headband travelling to where Justice is and get challenged by people from his past and a church who are essentially villains for the sake of having villains.Is it just me or does this set up not make much sense? Afro, a small child with no fighting experience lost the #2 headband to a bunch of random guys he met and then they lost the headband to someone else who lost it to someone else. How does this prove who the second strongest fighter is? All that just happened is weaklings lost to stronger weaklings. Even if I was to accept that after so many years a #2 would be established by every named fighter in the world losing to them, the guy who turns out to be #2 kept it a big secret so such an argument can\'t be made!For that matter why would people be so concerned about going after the #2 headband to begin with? especially Afro. Everybody knows where Justice lives anyway so why would they dilly dally around challenging the second best instead of just challenging the best straight away? It\'s a fight to the death after all so what\'s Justice going to do about it if you show up without the headband? Try and kill you for breaking the rules? There\'s no change in the circumstances whatsoever.In the present time storyline at some point or another per episode Afro gets attacked by the church of mecha (I call them that because they somehow have the technology to build extremely talented fighting robots in a time where everybody else uses swords) The action scenes are quite entertaining at the time you see them but you\'ll very quickly forget everything about them. Such as who the bad guy was, what their weapon was, what kind of techniques they used and even how Afro defeated them. For the most part its very mindless too. The biggest example I can think of is when Afro had to beat the villain by doing something ""spontaneous and unexpected"" but he doesn\'t do anything creative and just does an epic slash that\'s really confusing what actually went on. Aside from this nothing very interesting happens except for one part that involved Afro having sex which was the only enjoyable part that wasn\'t a fight scene. The only thing that prevents the story from getting a 1 is a plot twist with the guy who follows Afro around everywhere. It\'s one of those cool twists where you don\'t see it coming but when you think about everything leading up to it, you could have figured it out and you kick yourself a bit for not being able to, so that much is appreciated.As far as the past time story goes we are simply waiting for the inevitable moment where Afro will kill the guy who you could figure out is going to turn out to be the #2 headband guy straight away. This leads to another character called Jinno who was sort of like family to both Afro and the #2 guy wanting revenge on Afro which is really irritating because he should have understood what the fight actually meant to both people fighting but instead he becomes yet another villain who\'s just there for the sake of being a villain.It couldn\'t even succeed in having at least an atmosphere to this story. It could have been a really dark, edgy, bloody, cool, serious samurai era world, but sadly it fails to deliver on that too as there\'s far too much comic relief (unfunny comic relief) given to us by Afro\'s obnoxious tag along buddy and the church who never say anything interesting and technological inconsistencies that remind you that you\'re just watching a cartoon. We live in a fudel era where people fight with swords, a future setting with robots and lasers and also we are in a dragon ball world where people can fall from ridiculous heights and land without breaking so much as a single bone.The ending was a let down and it comes completely out of nowhere. It involves a plot to bring all the headbands in the world together because it will grant the #1 headband guy godlike powers and let him transform into a monster that looks like it would fit well into a hentai. This whole idea just comes across as a plot convenience because they couldn\'t come up with a reasonable explanation for why there needed to be both a #1 and #2 headband in the first place.CHARACTERS (3) - There isn\'t a single character in this series that stands out as memorable, at least in a positive way. The fact it\'s 5 episodes long is no excuse. Anime Movies have overall less runtime and many have excellent levels of character development by comparison to this garbage.Afro is a tiny little bit bad ass since he wins loads of fights and can cut bullets in half for some reason but he\'s extremely boring too. He rarely ever says anything and when he does it\'s always to tell the guy following him around to shut up. Silent or near silent characters have been done well. Brandon Heat from Gungrave didn\'t talk very much but you still understood his personality and his conflicting emotions, Afro on the other hand has no depth at all and it\'s next to impossible to describe his character without saying ""he was kind of cool and was good at fighting with a sword.""The guy following Afro around is intolerable, just a typical comic relief character to lighten the mood. I hate that shit in anime. D-Gray Man could have benefited greatly from taking itself more seriously instead of throwing in a bunch of lame jokes and this series suffers for the same reason. The plot twist with him is the only thing that makes him kind of interesting but aside from that he\'s thoroughly unlike-able in personality.Then there\'s the two characters from Afro\'s past who he kind of became family with who end up wanting him dead for no good reason. As I mentioned earlier they should have understood what the fight between Afro and the #2 headband guy meant and why it was important to Afro but instead they decide that they want revenge on him. The girl nearly kills Afro while having sex with him but fails when Afro\'s massive cock gives her the orgasm of her life and decides she wants to help him all of a sudden and the guy (Jinno) ends up becoming one of the most laughable side villains in anime history. Not to mention Afro spends more time fighting Jinno than he does fighting Justice, the guy who he\'s supposed to take revenge on. To be fair the fight with Jinno and Afro is one of the best animated fights I\'ve ever seen but because I hated both Jinno and Afro so much, I just didn\'t care about any of it. That\'s really bad. Then in the rematch between Justice and Afro we pretty much get a one hit KO situation. Well that sucks!The church villains are all stock. Just bad guys for the sake of bad guys. The church never say or do anything that makes them interesting, they just have a bunch of numbered fighters challenge Afro because...someone has to I guess. They are all conveniently numbered in order from strongest to weakest in the same vein as the Espada from Bleach to make them seem like they have more character and personality than they actually do but sadly you\'ll forget the personalities of every single one of these guys. At least Bleach had Ulquiorra, Nnoitra and Grimmjow.ART AND ANIMATION (8) - As much as I hate to admit it the artwork and animation was very good. The character designs are pretty unique, the attention to detail is great, the weapons look awesome and the backgrounds are beautiful. However a lot of the time I kept thinking I was watching Sin City. It was black and white almost all the time and like in Sin City you\'d only catch certain colours here and there like green eyes, red because of the blood splashes and the occasional piss yellow when Afro had a lemonade on the go (one of the ""running gags""). There are a few daytime scenes which is when the colour comes out and during such times the colour work is great too.Overall, not much to complain about in art design.As far as the animation goes you\'d be disappointed if it was anything less than exceptional when the show is only 5 episodes long and as such Afro Samurai demonstrates some great animation. Of course like with any anime you get the slow framed parts every now and again and sometimes you get obviously repeated clips but when Afro Samurai tries to be well animated it fully succeeds. As you might expect, the action scenes are best at demonstrating this. Although there are even little things like when Afro smokes a cigarette, it burns away so fluidly it\'s like the real deal! Looks way better than the cigarettes in Trigun. Oh and Afro\'s afro moves too. Badass!SOUND (6) - I watched this anime dubbed and to be honest it was dubbed very well. Samuel L Jackson despite hardly having any lines with Afro still put in a good performance and his voice acting for the guy tagging along with Afro (yeah he plays him too) was good too but sadly the writing was so bad for both these characters that he couldn\'t save them. The rest of the cast was voiced well enough for dub haters not to be able to complain too much about but I wouldn\'t be ranking this up there with Baccano or Black Lagoon either.As far as music and sound effects go, to be honest I have nothing to say. It was just fine. The soundtrack fitted okay enough for me not to be able to complain but it didn\'t really stand out either like say Rurouni Kenshin or Samurai Champloo\'s which tackle this kind of fudel era (much better I should add).For the enjoyment section I\'m going to tie it in with the overall since I have pretty much the same things to say about both.OVERALL/ENJOYMENT (4) - You know what? Since when was decent worse than mediocre? That\'s what this scoring system seems to think. I always thought decent fell between average and good. To me 4 means BAD!If you worked out the mean average score of the 4 categories you\'d notice it actually averages out to 5. However the characters and the story are the most important aspects to a show so if both characters and story are both lower than art and sound I deduct an extra point since it would more accurately represent my feelings. This is a bad series, not an average one. However if the characters and story were higher than art and sound I would have given an extra point overall, so it\'s not like I\'m being unfair in that regard. Anyway now for the conclusion.It\'s kind of fun to look and the action scenes are fairly entertaining because of the really good animation but the story and characters are really what screw this anime up. The revenge story was boring and the concepts were just ridiculous with no good characters to prop it up even a little bit. They just written to be used for action scenes or to attempt to give shock value. If you want a really good show that deals with people from this kind of era I\'d recommend Rurouni Kenshin as it has a plausible set up, the characters are much better and the story is highly enjoyable. Sure the action scenes aren\'t as well animated but you\'ll like them a lot more for the simple reason you actually care about the people fighting and why. Afro Samurai however is a massive crock of shit and I do not advise watching it at all unless the only thing you care about is mindless action and nothing else. If you want a good revenge story then I would recommend either reading Berserk or watching Hunter X Hunter for Kurapika\'s storyline (plus it\'s a great anime all around anyway). not ramble like a moron.STORY (2) - A 2? Are you serious? Surely the story can\'t be that bad right? Believe me it is. No originality in any way shape or form, no plausibility in both the overall plot or the chapters it has to get there, the pacing is far too fast for you to care about anything as there are too few episodes and a god awful ending that comes out of nowhere. But I will go into great lengths to explain just how shitty this story is.The start of the first episode sets up the premise, Afro Samurai (yeah that\'s his real name apparently) is a man with a revenge motive because back when he was a child some bloke with a hat called Justice killed his father whom until that point was the strongest man in the world because his headband that says ""# 1"" on it says so. After Justice kills Afro\'s dad Justice gives Afro his old headband that says ""#2"" on it but he later loses it to some punks. From then on we realise we\'re following two stories. One revolving around Afro as a child trying to get the #2 headband back by tracking down whoever might have it because for some reason he needs it in order to challenge Justice to a duel to get his revenge and another when we see the present day Afro with the #2 headband travelling to where Justice is and get challenged by people from his past and a church who are essentially villains for the sake of having villains.Is it just me or does this set up not make much sense? Afro, a small child with no fighting experience lost the #2 headband to a bunch of random guys he met and then they lost the headband to someone else who lost it to someone else. How does this prove who the second strongest fighter is? All that just happened is weaklings lost to stronger weaklings. Even if I was to accept that after so many years a #2 would be established by every named fighter in the world losing to them, the guy who turns out to be #2 kept it a big secret so such an argument can\'t be made!For that matter why would people be so concerned about going after the #2 headband to begin with? especially Afro. Everybody knows where Justice lives anyway so why would they dilly dally around challenging the second best instead of just challenging the best straight away? It\'s a fight to the death after all so what\'s Justice going to do about it if you show up without the headband? Try and kill you for breaking the rules? There\'s no change in the circumstances whatsoever.In the present time storyline at some point or another per episode Afro gets attacked by the church of mecha (I call them that because they somehow have the technology to build extremely talented fighting robots in a time where everybody else uses swords) The action scenes are quite entertaining at the time you see them but you\'ll very quickly forget everything about them. Such as who the bad guy was, what their weapon was, what kind of techniques they used and even how Afro defeated them. For the most part its very mindless too. The biggest example I can think of is when Afro had to beat the villain by doing something ""spontaneous and unexpected"" but he doesn\'t do anything creative and just does an epic slash that\'s really confusing what actually went on. Aside from this nothing very interesting happens except for one part that involved Afro having sex which was the only enjoyable part that wasn\'t a fight scene. The only thing that prevents the story from getting a 1 is a plot twist with the guy who follows Afro around everywhere. It\'s one of those cool twists where you don\'t see it coming but when you think about everything leading up to it, you could have figured it out and you kick yourself a bit for not being able to, so that much is appreciated.As far as the past time story goes we are simply waiting for the inevitable moment where Afro will kill the guy who you could figure out is going to turn out to be the #2 headband guy straight away. This leads to another character called Jinno who was sort of like family to both Afro and the #2 guy wanting revenge on Afro which is really irritating because he should have understood what the fight actually meant to both people fighting but instead he becomes yet another villain who\'s just there for the sake of being a villain.It couldn\'t even succeed in having at least an atmosphere to this story. It could have been a really dark, edgy, bloody, cool, serious samurai era world, but sadly it fails to deliver on that too as there\'s far too much comic relief (unfunny comic relief) given to us by Afro\'s obnoxious tag along buddy and the church who never say anything interesting and technological inconsistencies that remind you that you\'re just watching a cartoon. We live in a fudel era where people fight with swords, a future setting with robots and lasers and also we are in a dragon ball world where people can fall from ridiculous heights and land without breaking so much as a single bone.The ending was a let down and it comes completely out of nowhere. It involves a plot to bring all the headbands in the world together because it will grant the #1 headband guy godlike powers and let him transform into a monster that looks like it would fit well into a hentai. This whole idea just comes across as a plot convenience because they couldn\'t come up with a reasonable explanation for why there needed to be both a #1 and #2 headband in the first place.CHARACTERS (3) - There isn\'t a single character in this series that stands out as memorable, at least in a positive way. The fact it\'s 5 episodes long is no excuse. Anime Movies have overall less runtime and many have excellent levels of character development by comparison to this garbage.Afro is a tiny little bit bad ass since he wins loads of fights and can cut bullets in half for some reason but he\'s extremely boring too. He rarely ever says anything and when he does it\'s always to tell the guy following him around to shut up. Silent or near silent characters have been done well. Brandon Heat from Gungrave didn\'t talk very much but you still understood his personality and his conflicting emotions, Afro on the other hand has no depth at all and it\'s next to impossible to describe his character without saying ""he was kind of cool and was good at fighting with a sword.""The guy following Afro around is intolerable, just a typical comic relief character to lighten the mood. I hate that shit in anime. D-Gray Man could have benefited greatly from taking itself more seriously instead of throwing in a bunch of lame jokes and this series suffers for the same reason. The plot twist with him is the only thing that makes him kind of interesting but aside from that he\'s thoroughly unlike-able in personality.Then there\'s the two characters from Afro\'s past who he kind of became family with who end up wanting him dead for no good reason. As I mentioned earlier they should have understood what the fight between Afro and the #2 headband guy meant and why it was important to Afro but instead they decide that they want revenge on him. The girl nearly kills Afro while having sex with him but fails when Afro\'s massive cock gives her the orgasm of her life and decides she wants to help him all of a sudden and the guy (Jinno) ends up becoming one of the most laughable side villains in anime history. Not to mention Afro spends more time fighting Jinno than he does fighting Justice, the guy who he\'s supposed to take revenge on. To be fair the fight with Jinno and Afro is one of the best animated fights I\'ve ever seen but because I hated both Jinno and Afro so much, I just didn\'t care about any of it. That\'s really bad. Then in the rematch between Justice and Afro we pretty much get a one hit KO situation. Well that sucks!The church villains are all stock. Just bad guys for the sake of bad guys. The church never say or do anything that makes them interesting, they just have a bunch of numbered fighters challenge Afro because...someone has to I guess. They are all conveniently numbered in order from strongest to weakest in the same vein as the Espada from Bleach to make them seem like they have more character and personality than they actually do but sadly you\'ll forget the personalities of every single one of these guys. At least Bleach had Ulquiorra, Nnoitra and Grimmjow.ART AND ANIMATION (8) - As much as I hate to admit it the artwork and animation was very good. The character designs are pretty unique, the attention to detail is great, the weapons look awesome and the backgrounds are beautiful. However a lot of the time I kept thinking I was watching Sin City. It was black and white almost all the time and like in Sin City you\'d only catch certain colours here and there like green eyes, red because of the blood splashes and the occasional piss yellow when Afro had a lemonade on the go (one of the ""running gags""). There are a few daytime scenes which is when the colour comes out and during such times the colour work is great too.Overall, not much to complain about in art design.As far as the animation goes you\'d be disappointed if it was anything less than exceptional when the show is only 5 episodes long and as such Afro Samurai demonstrates some great animation. Of course like with any anime you get the slow framed parts every now and again and sometimes you get obviously repeated clips but when Afro Samurai tries to be well animated it fully succeeds. As you might expect, the action scenes are best at demonstrating this. Although there are even little things like when Afro smokes a cigarette, it burns away so fluidly it\'s like the real deal! Looks way better than the cigarettes in Trigun. Oh and Afro\'s afro moves too. Badass!SOUND (6) - I watched this anime dubbed and to be honest it was dubbed very well. Samuel L Jackson despite hardly having any lines with Afro still put in a good performance and his voice acting for the guy tagging along with Afro (yeah he plays him too) was good too but sadly the writing was so bad for both these characters that he couldn\'t save them. The rest of the cast was voiced well enough for dub haters not to be able to complain too much about but I wouldn\'t be ranking this up there with Baccano or Black Lagoon either.As far as music and sound effects go, to be honest I have nothing to say. It was just fine. The soundtrack fitted okay enough for me not to be able to complain but it didn\'t really stand out either like say Rurouni Kenshin or Samurai Champloo\'s which tackle this kind of fudel era (much better I should add).For the enjoyment section I\'m going to tie it in with the overall since I have pretty much the same things to say about both.OVERALL/ENJOYMENT (4) - You know what?

If you want a good revenge story then I would recommend either reading Berserk or watching Hunter X Hunter for Kurapika\'s storyline (plus it\'s a great anime all around anyway).', 'Want a very stylized, mindless hack-and-slash gorefest of an anime?  Look no further than Spike TV and their 2007 production of Afro Samurai.This anime is a mixed bag depending on how you approach it (as can be seen just by briefly looking through the reviews on here).  If you are seeking a deep story and complex characters, this anime is going to disappoint you royally.  However, if you are looking for an action-packed product to get the man juices flowing, Afro Samurai will look like the best piece of animation you have ever witnessed.As stated, the story is about as basic as...it gets: Boy\'s father is killed, boy vows revenge, boy trains up, boy kills his way to his father\'s murderer....you get the drift.  As it is only a five-episode miniseries, you can\'t expect much in the form of deep subplots or a vast network of strongly developed characters (though that is not to say that this franchise doesn\'t have its own collection of lore to read into).  The timeline of the story very flatley sees Afro cut down a challenge and proceed to the next opponent (usually stronger and more intimidating in scale than the last) until he ultimately reaches his ""final boss on the top floor"".The animation and art is where this show really shines.  It is extremely fluid and the darker tones of the anime really come out in its shading and dreary hues.  As it was made for an American audience first and foremost, it is a very ""western"" piece of Japanese animation, causing it to be quite unique in the library.  The piece definitely stands out in comparison to most other family members of the typical action anime genre.This show is exclusively in Dub and with its voice cast roster, it is clear why.  It features many dynamic actors who bring their chops to the table in all the right ways.  Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard 3) stars as Afro Samurai and his internal voice Ninja Ninja, Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Sons of Anarchy) provides the voice of the series\' main antagonist Justice, and the likes of Kelly Hu (X2), Terrence C. Carson (God of War), Tara Strong, James Arnold Taylor, Grey DeLisle, and Steve Blum provide various supporting roles throughout the series along the way (large and small).The characters of the series, though simple, are pretty solid and serve their purpose well.  Afro Samurai himself is obviously the most developed character and receives the lion\'s share of the treatment on progression.  Ironically, Afro himself is a fairly silent and stoic character and Jackson ultimately gets to shine through the almost-constant annoying chatter dialogue of his companion Ninja Ninja (Afro\'s 180° degree antithesis) more so than the actual protagonist.  Besides the main character, the side characters do not see a lot of development and can suffer from a lack of depth if one decides to fixate on it (aka. shallow archetypes such as generic love interest character, typical villain posse, best friend, former master/mentor, etc.).Your enjoyment of this show will depend on your desire to see blood.....like, a LOT of blood (Arms flying, decapitation, pierced eye sockets....the works).  This anime is all about violence and you won\'t go over three minutes without seeing a character spill their bowels on the ground in some shape or form.  Besides that, this anime doesn\'t hold back on cursing and swearing either (definitely more so if you watch the Director\'s Cut).  The anime also contains a smattering of nudity throughout the first few episodes and a full sex scene in the second (The miniseries has a solid and deserved TV-MA, so you shouldn\'t be blind if you are considering a watch to begin with.).  All in all, Afro Samurai is a mindlessly fun anime full of stylized gory action.  It\'s really that simple.  It\'s ""nothing personal, it\'s just revenge."" it gets: Boy\'s father is killed, boy vows revenge, boy trains up, boy kills his way to his father\'s murderer....you get the drift.

Jackson (but he almost never says a word...) and there are some other famous american celebrities involved aswell.Despite its flaws I found myself liking it just for the craziness which is...what it was going for. The anime knows what it is and accepts it. I also find this to be a very unique anime because of the japanese/american style fusion. what it was going for. The anime knows what it is and accepts it. I also find this to be a very unique anime because of the japanese/american style fusion."", 'If I never had a reason to accuse an anime of being all beauty and no brain. Then I would definitely have one now, because Afro Samurai fits the term ""style over substance"" like no other. It makes sure to cater only to a specific audience, which are the action and eye candy crowd. Studio Gonzo has been known to deliver when it comes down to visuals. Series such as Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Basilisk more than back up this claim. Afro Samurai continues to carry their legacy.The artwork and animation are top notch without a doubt. The battle scenes are fast...paced, very fluid, and detailed. It is amazing watching bullets chopped in mid flight only to scatter and kill people by the dozens. Plus the animation is completely free of stills with very little reused cels. The choreography is among the best I have seen in a samurai related anime with fights even surpassing that of Ninja Scroll, while completely crushing the completely horrid Samurai Deeper Kyo. Anyone whom says the animation in Afro Samurai is lacking either didn\'t see it, or they\'re searching for reasons to hate it; which really is uncalled for because it has more than enough dragging it down. The artwork is splendid with some great character designs and very nice settings with a very well use of color and schemes.The soundtrack is very good as well. East Coast hip hop artist RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan is behind the soundtrack. The beats are everything you would expect from him, and they capture the gritty feel plus the rhythm of the series. When I first saw Afro Samurai and Samurai Champloo, I didn\'t care for hip hop in a samurai setting. I guess it had a lot to do with the traditionalist in me; but I\'ll admit that it does work here. Even though I\'m still not completely a fan of it. In fact I\'m not a fan of it at all.The voice work is done by Samuel L. Jackson(Afro Samurai, Ninja Ninja), Ron Perlman(Justice), and Kelly Hu(Okiku). The voice work is average, but a majority of the time you will hear from the ultra irritating comic relief Ninja Ninja, and he never ever shuts up. The other two voice actors are barely heard from due to their short roles.Afro Samurai also has an interesting world simply because the imagination definitely ran wild. These aren\'t exactly your traditional samurai and monks. The characters are equipped with a vast arsenal of weaponry and cybernetics that combines genres old and new, such as a monk using a cell phone along with ronin packing a crossbow/grenade launcher.Now for the bad features of the series, this is the part that is completely a matter of taste. The writers focused so much on the eye candy and blood lust audience, that they completely forsake the character and plot driven crowd. All of the characters are incredibly bland, and almost no one is really likeable. Afro is not really developed, his sidekick Ninja Ninja is the opposite of Afro\'s quiet personality, in which he\'s very out spoken, loud, and upbeat. It is said, that he\'s actually Afro\'s character development. I just don\'t see that because Afro simply doesn\'t change for better or worse. He is one of the most static characters I can think of. This doesn\'t necessarily make him a bad character, just not a very interesting one and easily forgettable. The rest of the characters are merely meant to push the thin plot and nothing else.Afro Samurai is a very violent series with lots of blood, death, and severed limbs. Followed with lots of profanity that Samuel L. Jackson has been known for. There is also a bit of fan service and an almost non graphic sex scene.This series is not for everyone and I haven\'t re-watched it in years. Those whom love lots of bloody and gory action shades of Ninja Scroll will more than likely be entertained. Fans of Sam Jackson and RZA\'s production should give it a shot as well. The DVD set also comes with a second disk containing commentary, interviews with the voice actors, producers, and behind the scenes.Highs: Very high production values, good blend of different genresLows: Paper thin plot, bland characters, weak ending paced, very fluid, and detailed.

I mean I like thought provocative stuff but it\'s just this type of thing appeals to my more lazy nature.That being said Afro Samurai definitely doesn\'t require you to analyse details or think about character motivations, let alone explore their psyche. I went into this show looking for action, maybe some good technical performances (BGM, animation, good fights) as well. Sadly this doesn\'t make it any good to me. If I were to take aside the brilliant animation and art to explore this show...from a critic\'s point of view — there would be nothing to redeem it.Whatsoever.The show starts off strongly, showing a boy witness the brutal decapitation of his father: an act that justifiably sees him take on a journey of vengeance to eventually murder his father\'s killer in the future. Now THAT is a statement. Buuuut...even a person who loves this show greatly would agree that...there\'s pretty much no story. I went into this anime expecting nothing from the story either way. Yeah, there\'s a ton of flashbacks in between fight scenes to add some superficial layers to Afro or the people he\'s in contact with — but that\'s pretty much filler to the action scenes. Overall very poor in the story department, but that\'s understandable considering what this anime is trying to be.Before I take rip this anime apart, I want to list its positives.The animation for this show is downright gorgeous. I love how smoothly done the fights are: channeling the best of Samurai Champloo in some of its fights together with all these satisfying sound effects when blades make contact with each other, or when tear into flesh. The artists have done a good job nailing the atmosphere as well, I was in love with some of the shots in Afro Samurai. There\'s really some great cinematography here. Also the dubbing is the best lol. Samuel L. Jackson knocks his role out of the park, with some of the greatest voice work I\'ve ever seen. He brings such life to his character that actually highlight his abilities as an artist himself. Job impeccably done.Sadly that\'s about it. That\'s all I can enjoy about this show.A lot of people are fans of the soundtrack, but I\'m just fully underwhelmed by it. Let\'s start with the BGM...which feels so cheaply done at some points. Some of the sounds feel like the things you produce when you go to a 90\'s keyboard and click on the different modes (Latin/Bossa Nova etc) while playing four or five notes again and again. While there are a few scenes where the music complements the mood/action sequences, they are sadly too few and far between. The overwhelming majority of the BGM put me off so bad. There are occasions where important characters are thrust into (what\'s supposed to be) emotionally draining situations—and you just have an awkward BGM that keeps you stoned in your seat, just not feeling anything.That kinda pissed me off.Maybe some of you may like it, I agree that music is a very subjective experience...but I feel it could have been miles better. It didn\'t bring anything new to the table and it wasn\'t faithful to hip hop. But if you\'re expecting something along what Nujabes contributed to Champloo, please just don\'t get your hopes up.I also mentioned that the animation was pretty sick—but based on what I\'ve watched so far, all of this is style and not substance. I draw parallels from the hand to hand fight scenes in Cowboy Bebop or even Fate: Zero. Every move made sense in the flashy fights you see in those shows, there was a REASON for every punch thrown, an intended effect. Drawing back to even shows such as Samurai Champloo (the easiest comparison here): Afro\'s swordplay (at its best) is animated as gloriously as Champloo\'s, but the tactical nature of the latter is missing in the former. Afro Samurai is choreographed to be more of a flashy dance, flying from wall to wall and breaking through stuff; rather than to actually defeat an opponent with style.And I don\'t know, but for a fighting/action anime to lack meaningful choreography...it just made this anime harder to enjoy given that it has little to no plot, exceptionally shallow characters and as I\'ve mentioned, an overall underperforming BGM. On the note of characters here; again...nothing much. It doesn\'t have an expressive cast, and its MC shows nothing much and isn\'t relatable in the slightest. Perhaps the only thing worth noting about Afro was how much regret and doubt he harbours in him for most of the show, but that\'s really all there is to say about him. I can\'t really go into the other aspect of this show because that would be a spoiler, but rest assured — it\'s nothing much. You shouldn\'t be looking for characterisation in this anime either, won\'t find a single ounce. Every other character is extremely forgettable, not playing a role at all—unless they\'re fodder to Afro\'s blade.And ah yes, the final boss fight. I expected something at least...gripping. But I was met with the same ""gore is god"" mentality after a cheap and insignificant plot twist. Not even a decent fight. No great moves, none of the fun animated fight pieces that the show flaunted in its first 30 mins.Meh.I enjoyed probably the first 30 mins of Afro Samurai but the action got very repetitive after that. It\'s only strength and selling point was something that lost me as the show went on longer; and given that there aren\'t strong characters, or anything else of value besides for the action...I found myself just hoping it would end already. And right now as I type this review, I\'m just glad I\'m done with this. Maybe there\'s stuff I missed, but I\'m just not in the mood to revisit this show anywhere in the near future.TLDR: Afro Samurai is not a show that EVERYONE can enjoy. I sure as hell disliked the living daylight out of it, but it\'s something you should consider giving a go nevertheless—if you feel you may like it. As you can see it rubbed me off the wrong way, but several of the points I penalised it for may actually appeal to you, as this kind of experience varies with the individual. from a critic\'s point of view — there would be nothing to redeem it.Whatsoever.The show starts off strongly, showing a boy witness the brutal decapitation of his father: an act that justifiably sees him take on a journey of vengeance to eventually murder his father\'s killer in the future. Now THAT is a statement. Buuuut...even a person who loves this show greatly would agree that...there\'s pretty much no story. I went into this anime expecting nothing from the story either way. Yeah, there\'s a ton of flashbacks in between fight scenes to add some superficial layers to Afro or the people he\'s in contact with — but that\'s pretty much filler to the action scenes. Overall very poor in the story department, but that\'s understandable considering what this anime is trying to be.Before I take rip this anime apart, I want to list its positives.The animation for this show is downright gorgeous. I love how smoothly done the fights are: channeling the best of Samurai Champloo in some of its fights together with all these satisfying sound effects when blades make contact with each other, or when tear into flesh. The artists have done a good job nailing the atmosphere as well, I was in love with some of the shots in Afro Samurai. There\'s really some great cinematography here. Also the dubbing is the best lol. Samuel L. Jackson knocks his role out of the park, with some of the greatest voice work I\'ve ever seen. He brings such life to his character that actually highlight his abilities as an artist himself. Job impeccably done.Sadly that\'s about it. That\'s all I can enjoy about this show.A lot of people are fans of the soundtrack, but I\'m just fully underwhelmed by it. Let\'s start with the BGM...which feels so cheaply done at some points. Some of the sounds feel like the things you produce when you go to a 90\'s keyboard and click on the different modes (Latin/Bossa Nova etc) while playing four or five notes again and again. While there are a few scenes where the music complements the mood/action sequences, they are sadly too few and far between. The overwhelming majority of the BGM put me off so bad. There are occasions where important characters are thrust into (what\'s supposed to be) emotionally draining situations—and you just have an awkward BGM that keeps you stoned in your seat, just not feeling anything.That kinda pissed me off.Maybe some of you may like it, I agree that music is a very subjective experience...but I feel it could have been miles better. It didn\'t bring anything new to the table and it wasn\'t faithful to hip hop. But if you\'re expecting something along what Nujabes contributed to Champloo, please just don\'t get your hopes up.I also mentioned that the animation was pretty sick—but based on what I\'ve watched so far, all of this is style and not substance. I draw parallels from the hand to hand fight scenes in Cowboy Bebop or even Fate: Zero. Every move made sense in the flashy fights you see in those shows, there was a REASON for every punch thrown, an intended effect. Drawing back to even shows such as Samurai Champloo (the easiest comparison here): Afro\'s swordplay (at its best) is animated as gloriously as Champloo\'s, but the tactical nature of the latter is missing in the former. Afro Samurai is choreographed to be more of a flashy dance, flying from wall to wall and breaking through stuff; rather than to actually defeat an opponent with style.And I don\'t know, but for a fighting/action anime to lack meaningful choreography...it just made this anime harder to enjoy given that it has little to no plot, exceptionally shallow characters and as I\'ve mentioned, an overall underperforming BGM. On the note of characters here; again...nothing much. It doesn\'t have an expressive cast, and its MC shows nothing much and isn\'t relatable in the slightest. Perhaps the only thing worth noting about Afro was how much regret and doubt he harbours in him for most of the show, but that\'s really all there is to say about him. I can\'t really go into the other aspect of this show because that would be a spoiler, but rest assured — it\'s nothing much. You shouldn\'t be looking for characterisation in this anime either, won\'t find a single ounce. Every other character is extremely forgettable, not playing a role at all—unless they\'re fodder to Afro\'s blade.And ah yes, the final boss fight. I expected something at least...gripping. But I was met with the same ""gore is god"" mentality after a cheap and insignificant plot twist. Not even a decent fight. No great moves, none of the fun animated fight pieces that the show flaunted in its first 30 mins.Meh.I enjoyed probably the first 30 mins of Afro Samurai but the action got very repetitive after that. It\'s only strength and selling point was something that lost me as the show went on longer; and given that there aren\'t strong characters, or anything else of value besides for the action...I found myself just hoping it would end already. And right now as I type this review, I\'m just glad I\'m done with this. Maybe there\'s stuff I missed, but I\'m just not in the mood to revisit this show anywhere in the near future.TLDR: Afro Samurai is not a show that EVERYONE can enjoy. I sure as hell disliked the living daylight out of it, but it\'s something you should consider giving a go nevertheless—if you feel you may like it.

My opinion changed a bit as between my first trip to the crazy world in which the story takes place and this not-so-long ago as I watched a hundred or more other series and frankly said got used to the toposes found in the world of M&A.Nevertheless, AS (as I will from now on abbreviate the title) is unique even after those few years. I'll cover the 6 criterions, which are Story (S), Art (A), Sound (S), Character (C), Enjoyment (E) and Overall (O) as I go through the series. Before...I start, however, I have to admit that this is my first entry here, so よろしくね.S: 6I have to say that however typical the story is, it has some original flavour to it as a story of revenge. I liked the fact that AF follows his goal all the way through without changing his mind like many characters do. After watching the movie that follows the story I was even more satisfied with the state that we find him in the moment 'Ressurrection' begins. The mediocre side of the series got the best of it: there was a lot of situations when AF had no chance of surviving, barely survived and the next day looked as if he never got into any fight. The motif with him being targeted was interesting, but his skill made it all look not-so-fine. Also, gore moments were cool when I was a teenager, but now they just drag on and on throughout the episodes.A:7I have to admit the art of the series is quite unique as the style differs from other series. It kicked off as a doujinshi and that's the proper reason behind this, I have to rate it as a GOOD (if the series wasn't 7 years old but for example was produced in 2010, it would drop as the standard went a lot higher each year).S:7The rap music is not really my field of interest, but I have to admire the good quality of the soundtrack and how it tunes well with the fight scenes.C:5I have to admit: there was no depth to any of the characters. That's probably because the creators focused too much on the action, but nothing interesting other than the revenge motif came out during these five episodes.E:8I enjoyed it few years ago and even now it's fun to watch. Nothing deep or intriguing, only pure action and blood everywhere.O:6The series was original when it came out and it even went viral in my coutry. Nevertheless, probably I won't watch it ever again as it has nothing other than action. If there is somebody that'll read this review, I have to alert you: if you seek something more than action and guts, look somewhere else. I assure you: there are hundreds of more interesting series out there and you'll find many good ones soon enough.

Well, lucky for me I recently found it and watched all 5 episodes in one sitting and I must say... I was very impressed with it.The story is rather simple. Afro Samurai is out for revenge for his fathers death, and he'll f*** anyone who stands in his way.With each episode we learn just a little bit more about Afro and his haunted and blood filled history, and this all builds up to the final showdown. The plot overall, is rather simple and straight forward, but...in the latter episodes things do become more heart and story driven. Not exactly the deepest story you'll find, but it still delivers the goods.The art and animation is fantastic, that simple. Each movement is carefully animated creating a very smooth and often times beautiful animation. The action scenes are incredible to watch and should make any action junkie very happy. I'd even say the action scenes here rival Hellsing Ultimate. And that's saying something. So yeah, the animes budget is clearly seen here.The voice acting was great, one of the best I've seen in an anime, with Samuel L. Jackson and Ron Perlman being the highlights. The soundtrack was also very good and fitting to the series, and even though I'm not much of a fan of rap, the slow rap intro was great to listen too.The characters themselves were pretty interesting. While I thought the main protagonist Afro, was a walking badass, he was very cold... maybe even to cold. It was a tad hard to feel any sympathy for him, especially during a certain fight in episodes 4 and 5 (in which I had a tough time figuring out who I was routing for). Ninja Ninja, Afro's sidekick was pretty damn annoying, though it was interesting seeing the true role he played later on.The antagonists weren't really that interesting in my opinion, save for 2 (one's a twist and the other being Justice the main antagonist) the others were just meh. The main bad group of characters 'Empty Seven Clan' are made up of identical monks and a big dude... yep, nothing very interesting there.Overall, I say this is one hell of an anime and something which I wish had lasted a bit longer. An entertaining story, beautiful animations, superb voice acting, a badass protagonist, you really can't go wrong here.So yes, this get's my stamp of awesomeness :D in the latter episodes things do become more heart and story driven.

I have a hard-on for the modern day samurai thing so I couldn\'t help but give this anime a 9/10. Also, Samuel L Jackson is one of my favorite actors of all time. I am going to write this very biased review anyway because I fucking loved this show.Story-The story follows a young black man, I think he\'s 30 at the most, and his quest for vengeance against the man who killed his father. In this world, there are two headbands that ""rank"" a warrior\'s strength. The number one headband and the number two. Only the person...with the number 2 headband can challenge the number one, so many people are after this thing. The black man, Afro, had a father who was number one, but he was killed by a gunslinger named Justice. So, from there on, Afro trains himself to be the world\'s strongest warrior. Very generic, I know, but the whole father-son thing touched me quite a bit.Art-This series had a very high budget. The animation was amazing and the art style reminded me of some old samurai anime. Afro was portrayed very well and I thought he had the coolest hair and outfit ever. Nothing much to say really. Alot of money was spent on this series, so you get what you pay for. Oh yeah, and the fight scenes were cool as shit. I have never once seen a guy cut a bullet into tiny pieces and kill the guys surrounding him with the shrapnel.Sound-Nice hip-hop beats and some jazz mixed in there. The RZA did really well with the soundtrack. It reminded me of the BGM from Samurai Champloo, but alot edgier and more ""oomf"" to it. If you are a fan of hiphop/rap, you will not be dissapointed with the soundtrack. Oh, and Samuel L Jackon\'s voice was sexy. He got like 20 lines, but each line was cool as shit. And Justice had a pretty nice voice as well.Character-Afro, Justice, and the Ninja are the only characters I really liked in this anime. I really didn\'t give a crap about Afro\'s childhood peers, so I disliked all of them. Afro is a very chill dude. He smokes his joints and keeps to himself. The typical ""lone wolf"" but more badass. Justice had some very good quotes in my opinion. He was a man who had gotten drunk with power and it really reflected in his mannerisms and such. Ninja was funny as hell and he kept Afro\'s sanity in check.Overall-This anime was just cool as hell dude. I know it might be just me, but modern Samurais are the coolest thing ever. Whats cooler than a joint smoking samurai who fights with a style of breakdance and disciplined swordmanship? Anyway, if you like samurai stuff and/or hiphop, definitely check it out. It\'s very different from your conventional anime, but that\'s because it\'s Western. I fucking loved this series, but I can\'t guarantee the same for you. with the number 2 headband can challenge the number one, so many people are after this thing.

It was to be one of those titles that I had to watch just to say that I actually watched it; and I really had no intention of watching it anytime soon.That was, until my friend (who is still new and fresh to the world of anime) was flabberghasted that I had watched so many different series and have not watched Afro Samurai. All my attempts to explain to him that...I had a set list that I wanted to complete first fell on deaf ears, and I was promptly plopped in front of his computer and watched the first episode. My first thought was ‘oh God….*sigh*’ and it didn’t quite leave me even as I watched the last episode.Story: 6/10It was said that the original Afro Samurai manga was severely lacking as Takashi Okazaki didn’t really have a talent for storytelling. And from what I’ve seen from the animated adaptation of it, I’m inclined to agree.The story is pretty straight forward -- we’re set in a world that’s mixed with a modern day inner city feeling with sci-fi elements in a feudal Japan theme. And in this world there are two headbands that symbolize the greatest fighters in the world; Number 1 is considered a God, and untouchable. While Number 2 is the only one who can challenge Number 1, but cursed to fight everyone seeking their headband.We start out as 1 and 2 are about to fight. 1’s son watches as 2 kills his father and takes the headband and title of Number 1 for himself. He challenges the young boy, telling him that he’ll be waiting for him at the mountain of the Gods when he feels like he’s ready to fight him. And so the young boy grows and fights as the new Number 2, vowing to seek revenge against 1 for killing his father and becoming the legendary and feared Afro Samurai.And that’s what we see him do through the entire 5 episodes, making his way to the mountain to fight Number 1. Each episode appears to be separate from one another as a new enemy comes to try and kill him, with a little bit of his life as a youth as Number 2 is revealed in every episode. We soon realize that his past is not only tied in to the present, but it serves as a key component near the end.But other than that, it’s just a story about death, and not much else.Animation: 8/10Now the art is where Mr. Okazaki shined. Apparently in his youth he liked to draw African Americans and was inspired by hip hop. We see a style that is mixed with the Boondocks and Samurai Champloo. It’s all exaggerated and stylized, which I found to be fitting for the show. None of the men are good looking, they either look plain or look like thugs which adds a certain realistic feel to the art despite the stylization (that being said the women are beautiful, which is always a staple in these sorts of adult themed shows apparently). The animation is also stylized and exaggerated, which again works with the art that makes it look good rather than makes it an eyesore.As odd as it is to say, I didn’t really notice the background that much. I was too busy paying attention to the characters and their dialogue. The purpose of the background isn’t meant to take over the entire scene, but to help set the mood of the scene as well as give the characters room to interact with it and with each other. In this sense the background served its purpose well.The color scheme is also similar to the Boondocks and is somewhat opaque and dark. It’s also due to the time in which it came out, as the early 2000’s produced a lot of anime with a dark and dreary color scheme. You won’t really find a vibrant color in the show, save for the sunset orange.One last thing I would like to mention. There is a TON of blood in it. However, this is to be expected since the story just has Afro killing a bunch of people.Sound: 6/10I’m sorry to everyone who likes hip hop and rap in their anime! The music score was composed by none other than RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, which is sort of a big deal considering how popular they are. You will find him rapping throughout the anime as well as through the Opening and Ending theme songs.And who else to play a better Afro Samurai and his alter ego Ninja Ninja than the man Samuel L. Jackson? Right from the moment you hear Afro speak (or perhaps if you haven’t heard his voice that often, you’ll better recognize him when Ninja Ninja speaks) you know who the voice actor behind the animated character is. At first you might think that this is impressive, but then you realize that Samuel L. Jackson doesn’t say no to anything…..and you still might think that this is pretty cool.Unfortunately, I didn’t really care for such flare or stardom incorporated into the show. Don’t get me wrong, the music fit the theme and Mr. Jackson’s acting was fine - it’s just not my cup of tea. But at least you can tell that this show was definitely made in America!Characters: 5/10The characters are about as straightforward as the storyline is. We really only see Afro’s background getting the focus of the story, which shows how he grew in strength and resolve. Personality wise we see him stay as stoic and revenge driven as ever. The other characters aren’t touched on at all, and the bulk of who Afro interacts with wants to kill him for his Number 2 headband. This serves its purpose to the story, but if you’re wanting deep character growth then I suggest you check out another anime.Another thing I’d like to mention -- even though the characters are pretty two dimensional they act as though they are ‘gangster thugs’. Well, they are -- but what I mean is they act like modern day, inner city thugs. This makes the show a little more comical, I will admit. Also, there is A LOT of cursing in this show. So keep this in mind.Overall: 6/10Sorry everyone! I just couldn’t get into the show, but at least I can say that I watched it. This is a very adult show, so I don’t suggest watching this with children nearby. I wouldn’t even recommend young teens watching it since there is seriously a huge amount of cursing and killing and blood. On the other hand, if you just want to kick back and have something to watch where it will entertain you without heavy thinking or story involvement, then I would suggest Afro Samurai because it’s only 5 episodes of death and bad assery.

I frankly don't have much problem with the anime as a whole (because it was well constructed), except a bit with the story.It kept you clinging, but it would have been nice if it had a little more air time. The back story of our protagonist really was handled well, and we understood the emotions and his overall perspective fluently. The characters makes it hard for me to let the story go...at this point, truthfully speaking - with such a kick ass villain as there was (speaking here of the English Dub, in which in my opinion, Samuel L. Jackson kicks ass, but Ron Periman is just a shade better).This is a worthwhile watch. I've seen it three times, and it still never ceases to amaze me. A definitive addition to one's list. at this point, truthfully speaking - with such a kick ass villain as there was (speaking here of the English Dub, in which in my opinion, Samuel L.

There wasn\'t anything offensively awful, which lands it a 4. I like the idea of just making the guy a cold-blooded killer. That\'s about it. Everything else either barely manages to stand or falls flat on its face. I was fine up until the story relied almost exclusively on flashbacks to tell us the story, sometimes interrupting action scenes. Honestly, this would\'ve been better without Afro having connections to that dojo place. His...connection to the dojo only serves as a plot device so he holds back against Jinno later. The chick he bangs in episode 2 also came from that dojo. That\'s it. The monks serve barely any purpose in the story; they just show up and fight Afro for some action. They have the very unclear motive of ""becoming God,"" but fail to answer why they want to do that in the first place. I actually feel like this would\'ve been better as a movie or a short, rather than a 5 episode series of pure boredom.Art 7/10The single thing that I actually cared about. It\'s a shame that none of the attacks in this show have any impact since most impacts are not shown on screen, and those that are aren\'t sword attacks, and given the name of the show you expect some sword on flesh action. The gore in this was enough to make me bear all 5 episodes, but you can bet your ass I won\'t give it a pass just on that.Sound 3/10The music is awful, and also inappropriate for most scenes it\'s placed in. The impact noises are mostly okay. The voice acting is good from Jackson, but average to piss poor for everyone else. It\'s hard to hate on Jackson here because he\'s one of my favorite actors. The voice for Jinno is actually the same guy who did the English voice for Sasuke Uchiha, which was admittedly entertaining, but failed to make his acting any better. Jinno would\'ve been a convincing character despite not being developed if it weren\'t for his voice actor butchering every emotion Jinno is supposed to feel. The bad guys relied on having low register voices with a bit of a growl to sound evil, and that wasn\'t enough to convince me.Character 1/10I liked the guy that followed Afro around, but not enough to care when he died. He was supposed to be comic relief, but rarely ever succeeded in making me laugh. The only reason I liked him was because Jackson got to talk a lot. Everyone else blows. Afro\'s motivation is boring. Revenge just isn\'t a compelling motivation when there aren\'t any layers to it. I wanted to feel bad for Afro over his father\'s death, but since he got almost all of his friends killed and killed his master over this revenge, I ceased to care. I actually wanted Afro to die in the fight against Jinno. Speaking of Jinno, he sucks. He\'s barely developed and has an even worse motivation than Afro. Come on, he\'s getting revenge on the guy he lectured about choosing revenge. The show doesn\'t even attempt to address it, and I was waiting for Afro to call Jinno out on his hypocrisy, but of course he remains silent and defeats Jinno. The main villain of the series appears very little, only having more than 5 minutes of screen time in the very first scene and the last episode. That makes it difficult to give a shit about him collecting all the headbands. The monks are all boring, despite them each being designed differently to show that they are different. The guy that looks like Jabba the Cyborg Hutt is just some random fucker they put in there to explain why Jinno and that chick Afro banged survived the massacre. The dojo characters are all boring, especially Master, who exists only to give Afro an excuse to get his friends killed, and serve as a half-assed explanation of Afro\'s skills.Enjoyment 3/10I enjoyed most of the fight scenes. Everything else was either boring exposition, a flashback, or comic relief. They forgot about ""show, don\'t tell"" in this show. Every bit of information you need is told to you. There were parts where they show you something only to immediately explain it afterwards like you even needed an explanation. This show was just boring. They spent time establishing why Afro ordered fucking lemonade at a bar. How about you write a better story so this show isn\'t just some revenge quest?Overall 3/10Skip to the fight scenes.

Rating 8/10"", 'Hello and Welcome to TheMediaHoundsShow, I\'m Andrew and today we are going to finally start the first Anime Review of the channel!!Although first things are first, this video will contain Spoilers. If you don\'t want this show to be spoiled on you, leave the video... Also I want to point out that this Anime is rated 18+ as there is a gore and some adult themes within the Anime, so anyone under 18 you have been warned.The Anime that we will be reviewing today is none other than ""Afro Samurai!"". A heavily Action, based Anime with a lot of sword fighting and violence.The Manga Artist...behind the Dōjinshi ""Afro Samurai!"" series was Takashi Okazaki!The Company that made the Anime are Studio Gonzo. Studio Gonzo is a Japanese animation Studio that was owned by its corporate parent the GDH Group. Studio Gonzo are also well known for releasing other Anime\'s such as ""Rosario & Vampire!"" and ""Gantz!""As well as many Anime\'s, they also released many Video Games such as ""Street Fighter VI!"", ""BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger!"" and ""BlazBlue: Continuum Shift!""In the late of 2008 - 2009, the Studio Gonzo eventually got overcome by financial problems and stated its deficit was estimated over 30 million dollars. That\'s Quite a lot!!Only having 5 episodes in the Anime series Studio Gonzo tells the Story of a Samurai with an Afro played by Samuel L Jackson.On the dark path of swordsmanship in a ""Futuristic"" yet Feudal Japan, it is said that the one who becomes No.1 will rule the world. But the only rule in this world is that only the No. 2 is allowed to fight the No. 1. The No. 2, the Afro Samurai, travels the road looking for revenge on the man who murdered his father in front of him when he was just a boy, a three-armed gunman who is the lord of the dark swordsman\'s road and the current No. 1.Afro Samurai was a Self-funded Dōjinshi, brought out 1999, releasing 10 chapters within 2 volumes. The Anime follows the Manga series somewhat but ends before the Manga. The Manga\'s story continues on.The Main characters to this Anime are ""Afro The Afro Samurai"" and ""Ninja-Ninja!"" Played by none other than the legend that is Samuel L Jackson.Other Characters in the series are ""Kuma/Jinno!"" his sister ""Sio!"" who only appeared in ""Afro Samurai: Resurrection!"" & ""Rokutaro!"" The father of Afro!The antagonists in this series are ""Brother 1, Brother 2, Brother 3, Brother 4, Brother 5 & Brother 6!"" and The main antagonist ""Justice!""My Favorite Characters to this Anime series was Afro and Ninja-Ninja both played by Samuel L Jackson. I loved how different these two characters were from each other and yet they worked well together. Ninja-Ninja had his sadistic moments, with his clever unique jokes whereas Afro was calm, cool, cruel and collective letting things pass by without phasing him.The soundtrack to this Anime is very unique; The album was produced by RZA of the Wu Tang Clan, and features big names such as Big Daddy Kane, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, and GZA.In my opinion the Anime was excellent, it had a great story and the action really draws you in and engrosses you in it. There is plenty of Action, Blood, Comedy, Fighting & Violence in the Anime from people being cut up til Ninja-Ninja and his hilarious endeavours.The only problems that I found with the Anime, was that there wasn\'t enough episodes to really get into it, it tried really hard to convey so many hidden messages throughout the series such as ""violence only creates more violence"", but then maybe I am being to critical as this message is easily overlooked.There was also a Video Game brought out based on the Afro Samurai Anime, with a slight retelling brought out on the Xbox 360 and PS3. It was developed by Namco Bandai Games.The Anime had a good OST but the Video Game OST was by far better and stranger...I rate this Anime 4/5, it was a great Anime, had an amazing dark twisted story, amazing soundtrack, the main characters are awesome, good voice acting and what I felt let it down slightly was because it was so short, if they had of made it maybe 12 episodes rather than 5 they might of been able to build up the characters better.I highly recommend this Anime to anyone who is interested in dark stories, Samurai\'s and action filled Anime\'s! Overall though, I enjoyed the show, and recommend it for any fans of action flicks.Well guys, that\'s it for this Anime Review, hope you liked it.Feel free to leave a Comment, like the video or Subscribe to our channel, this has been Andrew from TheMediaHoundsShow Stay TunedDon\'t forget to check us out on our Facebook page, Twitter Account, Google+ and Deviant Art.

The ghetto voices and the seedy vibe of the setting worked well with Samuel L Jackson's vocals.I found afro to be a very unrelatable character though I do suspect that was the intention. Comic relief is provided throughout by his verbal sidekick. Action lovers need not fear watching this however as epic sword fights occur frequently. The artwork is not brilliant by any means, the story is not extremely coherent and it is maybe too short but it is nevertheless an entertaining and action-packed anime. "", '""Who is Samuel L. Jackson?""""Ever see a movie? He\'s the black guy.""Apparently this applies to anime to! But seriously... I\'ve heard that this anime was supposed to be the USA\'s attempt at an anime to compete with Japan or something. Well whatever reason it was made for it was pretty well done. Even though it is really short and has a simple plot its quite entertaining. Sam L. Jackson does a great job in his roles as always. The show has really good action sequences. The music track is produced by the RZA so of course it has that Wu-Tang hip-hop feel to it which...I really enjoyed. Some of the character designs are somewhat unconventional compared to typical anime but that didn\'t bother me at all. Overall I thought that art/animation was quite good. It has blood and gore but unless you are really turned off by anime blood then I would recommend this anime. Great show for a short thrill if you are in the mood for an action anime.

Great show for a short thrill if you are in the mood for an action anime.', 'So I picked this up from my local Wal Mart pretty much just because it looked interesting. When I was younger, I have heard of Afro Samurai, but I never knew exactly WHAT it was, like a video game, TV show, or just some character. But let\'s get down to business...Story: 6/10A revenge story... this shit again? Well, revenge stories are somewhat fun to watch if you like characters getting owned by the MC, but if you don\'t have much patience for that kind of stuff, then roll out. Afro Samurai is about, well, Afro Samurai, who\'s father was killed by Justice in a duel...for the #1 headband, which is said to give the wearer god-like powers. As a fully-developed grown man, Afro finally journeys out to challenge Justice to a duel for the headband, but must first face off against other warriors who want the #2 headband that Afro wears. And... that\'s pretty much it. A simplistic plot doesn\'t work very well for me, but what I did enjoy was Afro\'s backstory.Character: 6/10As many people would probably think, Afro (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) seems like a pretty lifeless character besides his almost-flawless combat skill, but his backstory really makes up for it, showing how Afro became the heartless man he is and it was rather enjoyable to watch. Ninja Ninja (also voice by Jackson), is the major comic relief character, which is very necessary for an anime as dark as this one. Ninja Ninja was funny. Some may think he isn\'t, some may think he is, but with Samuel\'s excellent voice acting, he really brought the character to life. Although, Ninja Ninja doesn\'t play a very major role in the show, other than making the audience laugh. He\'s mostly ignored by Afro and other characters, no matter how loud or witty he is. Even though characters don\'t develop, I wouldn\'t have expected them to considering that this show is only 5 episodes long. You shouldn\'t expect any character development simply because the anime is just way too short to cram it in, so this character score is not going to affect too much of my final score.Art: 10/101 word: hardcore. To the animators for Afro Samurai, hats off to all of you because this show probably had the cleanest animation I\'ve seen in an anime. The detail in the fights are so dynamic that I kept replaying pretty much every single fight, especially the fight between Afro and AfroDroid which still ranks in my top 10 best anime fights. Colors are incredibly bold and dark, which played a huge role in the animation, making everything around Afro look deceiving and violent. Oh, and by the way, this show is very bloody. It\'s not the most violent anime I\'ve seen; like it doesn\'t go as far as internal organs spewing out, but it showcases a lot of unique video game-ish ways to slice up humans with a large katana.Sound: 8/10I like all kinds of music; hip-hop, rap, jazz, rock, film orchestra, and almost anything else that\'s not head-banging heavy metal. I grew up listening to hip-hop and rap, so I\'m pretty much a sucker for TV shows and films that showcase some of that type of music. The music of this show is far from  anything as good as something like Samurai Champloo, but the show still showcases some tracks that caught my interest, most notably the end credits Outro theme simply because it sounds like the closest thing to an actual SC track. Caught Up by Black Knights was an excellent choice for the AfroDroid fight. If you have a good ear for music, the song basically gave the fight scene a sort of ""hype"" feeling to it, even though it\'s on a low tempo. The soundtrack is a good pick-up for people who are into that kind of music. I don\'t really care much for the theme song, though, simply because the rhymes are a little too sketchy even though I like the rhythm, but other than that, the music for Afro Samurai is enjoyable.Enjoyment: 8/10At first glance, you may enjoy the hell out of watching Afro Samurai simply because of its kick-ass action and animation...Overall: 7/10But once you take some time to think about it, the show is not top-tier. I could\'ve given this anime a 6 due to its simplistic plot (but rather interesting backstory), but the animation, insane fights, and good music makes up for most of it, so it will enjoy a permanent stay in my anime collection. for the #1 headband, which is said to give the wearer god-like powers.

The story is very simple and not the greatest story ever told, but it suffices for this series.The art style is gorgeous to look at and the fights are all very smooth and highly entertaining.The music is great as well.However, I never really critique music unless it really sticks out. The series doesn\'t really have an opening, so...there is no point in talking about it.The voice acting is good as well, although there is the twist that there is only an English version. This is another reason why I think that this series is great for newcomers that might not want to watch everything subbed.The characters are good too, although Afro and his friend don\'t have a real personality outside of ""being cool"" and ""being quirky"".Everything considered, this is an awesome show both for newcomers and long-time anime lovers and I highly recommend it. there is no point in talking about it.The voice acting is good as well, although there is the twist that there is only an English version.

Jackson kill the population equivalent of the state of New Hampshire while wielding a katana?…What do you mean, ‘no’?…Not even a little?Afro Samurai is a post-apocalyptic  western scifi samurai tale of vengeance, in which Afro, the titular samurai, seeks to kill the man who killed his father and claim the Number One headband, the symbol of Afro’s father’s former status as the deadliest man alive.  Afro can only challenge the new Number One while wearing the Number Two headband.  The catch is that the position of...Number Two is perpetually up for grabs, and countless people attempt to kill Afro and take the headband for themselves.  These people tend to fail spectacularly before being sliced open and producing enough blood to fill a kiddie pool, but that doesn’t stop them from trying.The premise leads the audience to all sorts of interesting questions.  Where did these headbands originate from?  Do they actually grant any special powers, or are they only significant because of the status they convey?  Who made them?  Why is claiming them more important than attempting to rebuild society in the wake of nuclear holocaust?  How the hell does Afro keep his hair looking  so perfect when all the salons in the world have been wiped out of existence?The answer to all of these questions is, “Look how badass Afro is!”To be fair, watching Afro being a badass is fairly entertaining on its own.  The striking, unique visuals and masterful animation are coupled with a gloriously shameless love of camp.  At one point, Afro slices a rocket propelled grenade in half with a katana, and suffers no ill effects when it explodes directly next to him.  At another, Afro fight an evil robot clone of himself, who, in the fight’s climax, uses rocket boosters to carry itself and Afro into the atmosphere before they both plummet back to Earth.  This is a show that can seamlessly move between beautifully choreographed and animated sword-fights to a cheesy disregard for physics normally reserved for the kind of 80’s science-fiction movies you see at the bottom of a Walmart bargain bin.  Afro Samurai has little going for it beyond sheer visual spectacle and style, but these are two areas it undoubtedly excels in.The Negative Side: Afro Samurai is a series whose presentation is at odds with its own themes.  The central message of the story, perhaps the only thing that might elevate it beyond the level of being highly stylish, violent and sexual fluff, is that a drive for vengeance and unchecked ambition are terrible forces that ultimately lead only to tragedy.  The problem is, it’s hard to take that message seriously when 95% of the series is screaming, “Look how badass our hero is!” while he’s taking vengeance and murdering countless people on his quest to be the single baddest muthafucka on the planet.The Kill Bill films (the other campy anachronistic samurai story of vengeance Jackson was in) struggled with the same problem, but the protagonist of Kill Bill was capable of running the full gambit of human emotion.  She was capable of sorrow and regret and love, and this helped ground the vengeance story in spite of its gore and camp.  Afro displays no such humanity.  He is a blood-stained power fantasy with all the emotional depth of a can of Axe body-spray.  When, as a child, his quest for vengeance leads to the death of his foster family, he simply writes it off as the cost of avenging his father.  Not only is Afro seemingly incapable of recognizing the consequences of his actions or considering redemption, he never does anything that could make us like him on a level other than, “What a badass!”There’s a particularly gross sequences of events in which an enemy spy falls in love with Afro, then sacrifices herself to save him from an ambush.  Why does she fall for a man who rarely says more than three words at a time?  Because Afro is a badass, of course.  He is the most badass badass of all baddasses, so it goes without saying that in addition to being ridiculously good at killing people, he can also make every woman he meets wanna screw him by doing literally nothing.  In fact, he’s too badass to even bother changing facial expressions during their lengthy, gratuitous and utterly unsatisfying sex scene.  You’d think the death of this poor woman would have some degree of emotional fallout, but Afro never expresses guilt over being unable to save her, never considers seriously pursuing a relationship with her instead of continuing his quest for vengeance, and never mentions her name again.  In fact, none of the women in the series accomplish much other than dying to motivate men or shaking their asses at the camera.There’s a popular theory going around the internet to account for Afro’s seeming lack of depth that is worth addressing here.  The theory posits that Ninja Ninja, Afro’s obnoxious jive-talking companion, is actually a figment of his imagination, or else a personification of his inner thoughts.  The numerous times Ninja Ninja clearly interacts with physical objects contradicts this, but ignoring that, the idea that Afro is so emotionally damaged that he has literally cast out his feelings and conscience as a separate entity is a potentially interesting idea… an idea that, like the series’ premise and setting, receives zero exploration.  As a series, Afro Samurai lacks the patience to give attention to anything but sex and violence, and once the thrill of the visuals wears off, this leaves it feeling hollow and forgettable.Final Verdict: Afro Samurai is all flash and no substance.  While its visuals are strong, there are other series with visuals that are just as beautiful and don’t throw character development and pathos under the bus.  If you’re not a diehard Samuel L. Jackson fan, skip this one and watch Samurai Champloo instead. Number Two is perpetually up for grabs, and countless people attempt to kill Afro and take the headband for themselves.  These people tend to fail spectacularly before being sliced open and producing enough blood to fill a kiddie pool, but that doesn’t stop them from trying.The premise leads the audience to all sorts of interesting questions.  Where did these headbands originate from?  Do they actually grant any special powers, or are they only significant because of the status they convey?  Who made them?  Why is claiming them more important than attempting to rebuild society in the wake of nuclear holocaust?  How the hell does Afro keep his hair looking  so perfect when all the salons in the world have been wiped out of existence?The answer to all of these questions is, “Look how badass Afro is!”To be fair, watching Afro being a badass is fairly entertaining on its own.  The striking, unique visuals and masterful animation are coupled with a gloriously shameless love of camp.  At one point, Afro slices a rocket propelled grenade in half with a katana, and suffers no ill effects when it explodes directly next to him.  At another, Afro fight an evil robot clone of himself, who, in the fight’s climax, uses rocket boosters to carry itself and Afro into the atmosphere before they both plummet back to Earth.  This is a show that can seamlessly move between beautifully choreographed and animated sword-fights to a cheesy disregard for physics normally reserved for the kind of 80’s science-fiction movies you see at the bottom of a Walmart bargain bin.  Afro Samurai has little going for it beyond sheer visual spectacle and style, but these are two areas it undoubtedly excels in.The Negative Side: Afro Samurai is a series whose presentation is at odds with its own themes.  The central message of the story, perhaps the only thing that might elevate it beyond the level of being highly stylish, violent and sexual fluff, is that a drive for vengeance and unchecked ambition are terrible forces that ultimately lead only to tragedy.  The problem is, it’s hard to take that message seriously when 95% of the series is screaming, “Look how badass our hero is!” while he’s taking vengeance and murdering countless people on his quest to be the single baddest muthafucka on the planet.The Kill Bill films (the other campy anachronistic samurai story of vengeance Jackson was in) struggled with the same problem, but the protagonist of Kill Bill was capable of running the full gambit of human emotion.  She was capable of sorrow and regret and love, and this helped ground the vengeance story in spite of its gore and camp.  Afro displays no such humanity.  He is a blood-stained power fantasy with all the emotional depth of a can of Axe body-spray.  When, as a child, his quest for vengeance leads to the death of his foster family, he simply writes it off as the cost of avenging his father.  Not only is Afro seemingly incapable of recognizing the consequences of his actions or considering redemption, he never does anything that could make us like him on a level other than, “What a badass!”There’s a particularly gross sequences of events in which an enemy spy falls in love with Afro, then sacrifices herself to save him from an ambush.  Why does she fall for a man who rarely says more than three words at a time?  Because Afro is a badass, of course.  He is the most badass badass of all baddasses, so it goes without saying that in addition to being ridiculously good at killing people, he can also make every woman he meets wanna screw him by doing literally nothing.  In fact, he’s too badass to even bother changing facial expressions during their lengthy, gratuitous and utterly unsatisfying sex scene.  You’d think the death of this poor woman would have some degree of emotional fallout, but Afro never expresses guilt over being unable to save her, never considers seriously pursuing a relationship with her instead of continuing his quest for vengeance, and never mentions her name again.  In fact, none of the women in the series accomplish much other than dying to motivate men or shaking their asses at the camera.There’s a popular theory going around the internet to account for Afro’s seeming lack of depth that is worth addressing here.  The theory posits that Ninja Ninja, Afro’s obnoxious jive-talking companion, is actually a figment of his imagination, or else a personification of his inner thoughts.  The numerous times Ninja Ninja clearly interacts with physical objects contradicts this, but ignoring that, the idea that Afro is so emotionally damaged that he has literally cast out his feelings and conscience as a separate entity is a potentially interesting idea… an idea that, like the series’ premise and setting, receives zero exploration.

I went into this expected hip hop samurai antics and thats what I got.I'll be frank, the story is kind of cliche. I liked the idea of the headbands though. But other than that, the idea was terribly cliche and i've seen it done better elsewhere.The art style was utterly phenomenal. There are few anime that truly impressed me with the level of artistry. It was fluid, it was unique, and it captivated me. They way that the characters looked was gorgeous.The soundtrack while not normally what i listen to (Serious...Metalhead here) It fit the overall feel of the piece. No complaints here.The characters were pretty damn interesting for the most part. The main character was a bit stereotypical of the Samurai Vengence Super Swordsman type, but everyone else was pretty damn neat to me. Especially the Teddy Bear samurai and Justice. Oooh Justice was cool.Despite all that I really enjoyed about this anime, something was off. I never could place my finger on it, but something failed to click with me in any cohesive way. It felt...rushed I suppose one could say. Something was missing. Maybe it could have stod to be a little longer, I dunno. It didn't feel right after all was said and done.Overall, I give it a five simply because that feeling of incompleteness was so profound to me that it seemed to almost mar everything else about the series to me. I just couldn't shake it. Stunning visuals, awesome characters a cliche but still interesting story, fitting soundtrack, and I still couldn't seem to enjoy it.Thats my two cents and I'm sticking to it.

Where were you and what were you doing that year? A lot of us were in high school, and knowing a lot of the inhabitants of this website middle school. I only bring that year up because that was the last time I watched any anime dubbed. Ever since Sakura Taisen dubbed, I've never let my ear be poisoned by horrible English voice acting. But Afro Samurai gives you no choice... oh and it has SAMUEL L JACKSON!Afro Samurai starts with a young Afro and his father...atop a mountain. A mysterious stranger appears to challenge his father to a duel to the death. His reason? To obtain the #1 headband that Afro's father possesses. After a short duel, Afro sees his father decapitated in front of his eyes and the stranger take the headband. This sight puts only one thought into his mind... revenge.The entire point of Afro Samurai is our main hero Afro heading back to that mountain to regain that headband and revenge for his father. Afro wears the #2 headband which allows him to be the only one that can challenge the #1, but the #2 is fair game to anyone who wants a shot. So Afro while trying to get to #1 must fight all comers as they try to take it over and give themselves a shot at being the best fighter in the world. What this means is lots of fighting and lots of blood.Afro Samurai can be comparable to a Ninja Scroll for this generation of anime fans. It's got lots of action and lots of mindless violence to give you that pure feeling of bloodlust. It has the same kind of crazy cast of characters, the same inclusion of sex (just not AS graphic) and that main character that can only be described as a &quot;bad ass&quot;. Problem is... it's just kinda boring. The entire show consists of a fight between Afro and some kind of villanous character followed by a flashback showing Afro's upbringing, rinse and repeat. He eventually reaches the summit, wins his battle and that's game over.Afro Samurai proves to be a love it or hate it show in the animation department. This is Gonzo Digimation so you can expect a high attention to detail and an overall great look. It has a certain feeling to it but it can prove to be distracting when the action gets hot and heavy as characters just become almost a bit too loose in their movements. Character designs on the whole are quite good but again remind me entirely too much of Ninja Scroll, just prettier. Afro's character exudes that pure sense of awesome in his dark complexion and smooth walk... well that and his gravity and weather defying hair. He can be inside a building where there is clearly no draft of any kind, and yet his headband will wave and wave. I know, it's anime that happens all the time, but still.Really the animation is hard to describe, judge for yourself.As I said before, SAMUEL L JACKSON! I'll be the first to admit that seeing that name on the front cover of anything makes me want to watch it. Snakes on a Plane anyone? Anyway Sam Jackson delivers all the types of lines you'd want to hear from him... such classics as &quot;What!? You got a mother f*%kin RPG in your backpack!?&quot; Or &quot;You's a crazy mother f*%ker&quot;. Problem is he never seems to shut up. Sam plays the part of Afro and his friend Ninja Ninja. Afro rarely says much but Ninja squared never stops blabbing throughout the entire show. He's always advising Afro to not fight and talking about &quot;hitting that&quot; and other various one liners. At first it's funny and overall kinda cool.Music on the other hand are the best. No composer by the Nobuo or Yuki here, instead you get The Rza (WU-TANG FOREVER - THE BEST HIP-HOP Group).

I watched it again at a later date and was very happy that I did. Afro Samurai is a new take on an old style, it shares many of the same qualities as Cowboy Bebop and Rurouni Kenshin. The art is spectacular and the colors while very dark are rich in quality, there is a small use of heavy 3D rendering towards the end of the show but it is well done and does not detract from the rest of...the setting. The story line of Afro Samurai is mostly about build up, yet the conclusion is short and sweet (in a manner of speaking). It is well rounded in the end and leaves one with a bittersweet feeling of social angst and a touch of pride for the character. the setting.

Even though the anime was 5 episodes, it kinda felt like a big anime. I kinda liked Afro Samurai because the whole 20 minutes of the anime they stayed on the story other than fillers and other stuffs. The story wasn't the best ever but for a small anime it was great. I gotta say that the action are off the hook. Through out the story all you see is is fights and lots of blood. The violence in this anime is off the chart, every second you will see someones head chopped off and blood spurting. I like when they have violence such as like Afro Samurai in animes. The music was also awesome, it had a hip pop kinda theme that went great with the anime. Every song was kinda fast and it would have been great if they could have put some melodies here and there.Well i think everybody should spare a few hours of there time to see the short 5 episodes. Its an awesome anime but watch out children it has a lots of violence and sexual content.

Alas, I was severely disappointed with this. This a a pretty bad anime, probably the worse Samurai based anime I have ever seen.  Afro samurai has little to no story at all.  A young Afro accompanies his father too a fight, his father loses,  I need revenge, then ensue the massacre of petty much everyone on screen. This is just a simple revenge story, there is absolutely nothing else in...the big picture, he feels no remorse for slaughtering any and everyone that crosses his path. Some of you may be thinking, wow that guys a pretty cool bad ass right? Wrong. Hes not a bad ass. Hes just a guy that walks around with a sword killing people and smoking a cigarette. He mumbles about 10 words throughout each episode, most of the time it being 'shut up'.Story:Don't watch this if you're looking for a story, you will be severely disappointed when you try to scape up whats considered the story of this anime. At around the middle part of the second episode I figured out that this anime had no intention of having a compelling story, its just a hack and slash show.Art: Besides the sound the art is probably the only thing thats good about this show. It properly shows everything its supposed to show from the great detail of each characters face to chopped limbs, blood, and weaponry. Due to the artwork you can properly understand each scene and experience fights the way they were meant to be.Sound: RZA did a great job with the sound on this one. Everything sounds like it should and the music fits. Like I said before, the sound and art are the only good things about this anime.Character: ....How can I explain the characters without expressing too much hate? I really can't but I'll give it a try anyway, Afro, the main character of this anime is a merciless swordsmen that kills everything in his path only stopping to drink lemonade and smoke a cigarette on his path to get revenge, pretty straight forward. The problem is thats exactly all he does. There were numerous scenes where someone was talking to him and he just simply didn't say anything at all. Theres pretty much no dialog at all between him and anyone besides Ninja,Ninja another character. At one point I thought he was mute until he mumbled his trademark 'shut up'. Why is this trademark you ask?  its trademark because he muttered it more than once, unlike any other word or phrase that he never said even once.Ninja, ninja is a character that follows Afro around to annoy him I assume. Every other line from him is proclaiming Afros death in the upcoming battle. Hes a pretty straightforward character also. There is nothing more to him. Hes basically a thorn in Afros side that has the magic ability to get Afro to talk. You might spend time wondering what exactly he is though. I thought he was a ghost but he picks up stuff so i don't know what exactly is going on with that.Enjoyment: I would enjoy this anime if I was a little younger back when I loved watching hack and slash. The fights themselves are enjoyable because of the bizarre enemies he has to face.Overall: A pretty lame forgettable anime. the big picture, he feels no remorse for slaughtering any and everyone that crosses his path.

And lots of ass kicking.Afro Samurai has good animation, great fight scenes, an amazing soundtrack that totally fits the character and good tidbits of humor inbetween all the fights to keep you enjoying this anime.This is the anime for you if you like mindlessly awesome fight scenes, crude humor and more awesome, violent fight scenes. ', 'You know, knowing about this anime when I first discover it, I wasn’t that exactly knowledgeable of much anime as this was the time I was pretty much limited to TV via Cartoon Network on Toonami and Adult Swim when it came to anime but once seeing a preview of it, knowing that it’s going to air on SPIKE TV, who was…….um…….well, some shows. (Yeah, I don’t watch that network that much anymore) but that was the time when I was still much a teenager and now that I’m in my early 20s, I wonder if this show still holds up to today.But are all...the origins of the show and where it’s from?It is originally a seinen dojinshi manga series by Takashi Okazaki, in which the artist has a love for soul and hip hop music, which like many people said about anime is that while American artists do have some inspiration from anime, sometimes the Japanese does have a bit of our influences in their material and for this time around, it’s hip hop and I love hip hop and I love the usage of it being more creative in a style like this rather than a gimmick to sell to audiences as this is an anime directly hand-made for the American audience.On the dark path of swordsmanship in a ""futuristic"" yet feudal Japan, it is said that the one who becomes the No. 1 warrior will rule the world with powers akin to a god. Only the No. 2 warrior is allowed to challenge the No. 1, but anyone can challenge the No. 2. The current No. 2, the Afro Samurai, travels the road looking for revenge on Justice, the man who murdered his father (who was then the No. 1) in front of him when he was just a boy, a skilled gunman who became the current No. 1 after defeating Afro\'s father.Now with the plot outline out of the way, you know that I love a good revenge storyline and that’s the overall theme for the character of Afro. The reason why Afro hunts for these headbands…..he didn’t care about the power or the fear of others or the respect of it. He was haunted by his father’s death at the hands of Justice and that was his only motive to hunt down Justice,  even though he managed to break some friendships he made in his past and judging by the way it went, I’m not surprised that one of his former buddies want to end him and I completely understand it.Does it mean I like Afro any less of a character?No, not really? Yes, Afro is a character with some fucked-up tendencies about him but you can’t argue the fact that Afro can kick some ass and I love seeing him in action, kicking some ninja/samurai ass all around but thankfully, he isn’t some god-like fighter as he even struggles with some fights, thus making them more exciting to watch.Plus, this is one of the few leads in an anime where the lead character is African-American and I like that they portrayed him well and not in an embarrassing, coonish way that make you want to facepalm. Also, he is a silent-type stealth character – another trait that I like in a character because it means their actions are far more important and meaningful than just talking your ass out about something that can be pointed out in less than a second.And there’s Ninja Ninja and no, I’m not annoyed by the presence of him because he actually provides some good humor into the show and it does balance out the tragic aspects and the action scenes, so it doesn’t feel too awkward and out of place. I don’t get how people are annoyed by him considering he is about as important to the character of Afro.Jinno (or as he called Kuma), I really do feel for this character’s motivation for wanting to take down Afro. He might sound a bit cliché with the whole “you killed my master” shtick but when that and your whole class died (with one of whom isn’t entirely dead) from being cutted down, you wouldn’t take that lightly. Otsuru (or Okiku) is one character that does have some focus on her having a crush on Afro but I feel that she was shafted early on in the start of the series, although I could see if the opposite of that would’ve happened, it could have made some more major problems than what we got.As for the villains, the Empty 7 Clan are just some secondary villains to Justice, the main antagonist prize and while he only shows up in the beginning and the end of the show, he is still more of a threat than them as the Empty 7 Clan just wanted the #2 headband for themselves. They want that for power and yet they were so full of themselves.Now for the animation. Yes, GONZO was in charge of the animation here and knowing its reputation and what people say about their style and as for how they’re done in the show, it is actually fitting and very appropriate from the dark atmosphere, the harsh surroundings and the desolate dystopian and futuristic setting. Also, the action and fight scenes were just downright amazing in my eyes and if you happen to be squeamish, you might want to think twice before watching because there is a lot of blood and gore. Possibly my favorite fight scene of the series is the final showdown between Afro and the Afro Droid. Maybe it may not look fancy or shiny but it’s definitely something worth noticing.The music……(yeah, this is the part where I show my fanboyism)….If you don’t know much about me, I am a big fan of the Wu-Tang Clan but more specifically, the producer behind it, Robert Diggs aka The RZA and I’ll say that the score and soundtrack is fucking excellent but not because it just uses hip-hop in a show and it’s done right but he does take on more musical genre influences such as spaghetti-western style music to the funk fight-showdown style music to some traditional samurai/martial arts music. The point is, the music does explore a few genres fitting into the series and I appreciate that fact. The opening theme is just 30 seconds long and while it’s good, I wish I had more to listen to but the rest of the soundtrack got tracks I really got love for, mostly the song “Fury in My Eyes/Revenge” with the RZA and Thea van seijen, whom often is a go-to singer/vocalist for anything RZA or Wu-Tang related but yeah, this is that song that goes with the tone of who Afro is as a character and the choices that he made throughout his life.Oh, the English dub……actually, no, it’s the only version because there is no Japanese voice-acting on this and this is a dub-only title (and this is actually very rare considering there is a lot of sub-only anime on the market so this is quite fair) and not only that, this is quite the star-studded cast of either well-known actors and voice actors, even ones that don’t be in a lot of anime productions, but then again, this is a Studiopolis production and FUNimation is the one distributing it, instead of using their own people. Let’s start with but who else but SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKSON!!!! Yes, for doing dual roles as both Afro and Ninja Ninja, I say that he delivers a great performance from both, especially for characters with different traits; Afro being the silent one and Ninja Ninja being the talkative one. Ron Perlman was great as Justice, Kelly Hu did a decent job with her being Okiku although Tara Strong as Otsuru was actually a better effort. Yuri Lowenthal as Jinno did put a great performance as well and others such as Phil Lamarr, T.C. Carson, John DiMaggio and even small appearances by Grey DeLisle, Steve Blum, Liam O’ Brien & Greg Eagles was also well-acted.FINAL VERDICT: This anime, to me, feels like it’s made for a person like me, wanting to cross two genres that may seem a weird fit but in the end, it does work well.  When people say this is Samurai Champloo mixed with The Boondocks, it does draw much of an interest in me. It feeds within the anime fan of me, the action fan in me, the samurai/martial arts fan in me, and also the hip hop side of me as well. I can’t say for others if they’ll like it but the thing is, the show isn’t some perfect work of art but it’s downright over-the-top and enjoyable. the origins of the show and where it’s from?It is originally a seinen dojinshi manga series by Takashi Okazaki, in which the artist has a love for soul and hip hop music, which like many people said about anime is that while American artists do have some inspiration from anime, sometimes the Japanese does have a bit of our influences in their material and for this time around, it’s hip hop and I love hip hop and I love the usage of it being more creative in a style like this rather than a gimmick to sell to audiences as this is an anime directly hand-made for the American audience.On the dark path of swordsmanship in a ""futuristic"" yet feudal Japan, it is said that the one who becomes the No. 1 warrior will rule the world with powers akin to a god. Only the No. 2 warrior is allowed to challenge the No. 1, but anyone can challenge the No. 2. The current No. 2, the Afro Samurai, travels the road looking for revenge on Justice, the man who murdered his father (who was then the No. 1) in front of him when he was just a boy, a skilled gunman who became the current No. 1 after defeating Afro\'s father.Now with the plot outline out of the way, you know that I love a good revenge storyline and that’s the overall theme for the character of Afro. The reason why Afro hunts for these headbands…..he didn’t care about the power or the fear of others or the respect of it. He was haunted by his father’s death at the hands of Justice and that was his only motive to hunt down Justice,  even though he managed to break some friendships he made in his past and judging by the way it went, I’m not surprised that one of his former buddies want to end him and I completely understand it.Does it mean I like Afro any less of a character?No, not really? Yes, Afro is a character with some fucked-up tendencies about him but you can’t argue the fact that Afro can kick some ass and I love seeing him in action, kicking some ninja/samurai ass all around but thankfully, he isn’t some god-like fighter as he even struggles with some fights, thus making them more exciting to watch.Plus, this is one of the few leads in an anime where the lead character is African-American and I like that they portrayed him well and not in an embarrassing, coonish way that make you want to facepalm. Also, he is a silent-type stealth character – another trait that I like in a character because it means their actions are far more important and meaningful than just talking your ass out about something that can be pointed out in less than a second.And there’s Ninja Ninja and no, I’m not annoyed by the presence of him because he actually provides some good humor into the show and it does balance out the tragic aspects and the action scenes, so it doesn’t feel too awkward and out of place. I don’t get how people are annoyed by him considering he is about as important to the character of Afro.Jinno (or as he called Kuma), I really do feel for this character’s motivation for wanting to take down Afro. He might sound a bit cliché with the whole “you killed my master” shtick but when that and your whole class died (with one of whom isn’t entirely dead) from being cutted down, you wouldn’t take that lightly. Otsuru (or Okiku) is one character that does have some focus on her having a crush on Afro but I feel that she was shafted early on in the start of the series, although I could see if the opposite of that would’ve happened, it could have made some more major problems than what we got.As for the villains, the Empty 7 Clan are just some secondary villains to Justice, the main antagonist prize and while he only shows up in the beginning and the end of the show, he is still more of a threat than them as the Empty 7 Clan just wanted the #2 headband for themselves. They want that for power and yet they were so full of themselves.Now for the animation. Yes, GONZO was in charge of the animation here and knowing its reputation and what people say about their style and as for how they’re done in the show, it is actually fitting and very appropriate from the dark atmosphere, the harsh surroundings and the desolate dystopian and futuristic setting. Also, the action and fight scenes were just downright amazing in my eyes and if you happen to be squeamish, you might want to think twice before watching because there is a lot of blood and gore. Possibly my favorite fight scene of the series is the final showdown between Afro and the Afro Droid. Maybe it may not look fancy or shiny but it’s definitely something worth noticing.The music……(yeah, this is the part where I show my fanboyism)….If you don’t know much about me, I am a big fan of the Wu-Tang Clan but more specifically, the producer behind it, Robert Diggs aka The RZA and I’ll say that the score and soundtrack is fucking excellent but not because it just uses hip-hop in a show and it’s done right but he does take on more musical genre influences such as spaghetti-western style music to the funk fight-showdown style music to some traditional samurai/martial arts music. The point is, the music does explore a few genres fitting into the series and I appreciate that fact. The opening theme is just 30 seconds long and while it’s good, I wish I had more to listen to but the rest of the soundtrack got tracks I really got love for, mostly the song “Fury in My Eyes/Revenge” with the RZA and Thea van seijen, whom often is a go-to singer/vocalist for anything RZA or Wu-Tang related but yeah, this is that song that goes with the tone of who Afro is as a character and the choices that he made throughout his life.Oh, the English dub……actually, no, it’s the only version because there is no Japanese voice-acting on this and this is a dub-only title (and this is actually very rare considering there is a lot of sub-only anime on the market so this is quite fair) and not only that, this is quite the star-studded cast of either well-known actors and voice actors, even ones that don’t be in a lot of anime productions, but then again, this is a Studiopolis production and FUNimation is the one distributing it, instead of using their own people.

Its story is sub-par but really the only reason you watch it is to follow this bad-ass dude, ""Afro"" and watch him slice people into bits. Its very entertaining and a good use of wasting a couple hours; its visually nice nothing spectacular but the voices are amazing, can\'t forget Samuel L. Jackson. This has to be watched Dubbed. Overall this Anime is pretty good I give it an 8 and a recommendation to anyone into gore. ', ""Welcome to Afro samurai where people get sliced and diced. Decapitations and limb cutting ahoy. Gore everywhere. Swords, guns and arrows and more swords. That's the motto.Action 8/10: The action is flipping thrilling. People get sliced to bits. Its brutal. Its really brutal. Heads flying, limbs falling. Its rough stuff but good stuff. Action is mostly fast paced and enticing with quick and fast movement however there's times where there's intellect and emotion displayed which really seduces you into the anime.Story 6/10: This is as basic as you get but as a anime action lover I don't mind. The story is logical, clear and makes...sense so its decent. It's mostly about revenge as Afro samurai tries to avenge his father and claim the number 1 headband. During the story the emotion levels are high. It's truly a sad anime as Afro samurai past is shown through parts of the anime. You feel sorry for the main character. His life was a struggle and he continues that bloody struggle as he watches his friends die amongst him as he slices his way to the number 1 headband.Overall 8/10: This anime is unique. Another anime infused with hip hop. The music is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. It really does match with the scenes. What I would do to get a OST collection for Afro samurai! The soundtracks are totally amazing and the instrumentals really do bang. Wicked anime! You will not be disappointed by this. The conclusion is decent. I've watched this many times.

You won't be disappointed by this anime"", ""Well, first review. Just for fun. Just finished afro samurai. Here we go.The STORY is about a guy named afro who seeks revenge for his father and never doubts to clean away every obstacle that comes in his way. So, It seems like a  pretty basic samuraianime but for me It´s a weird mix of disturbing voice acting, colorful characters and bloody fighting scenes. And I love It!... Well, I dont love the VOICE ACTING but I gotta say It was todely fine even though I mostly cant stand english voices for an anime. It was disturbing in this case too apart from the...stars samuel l jackson and ron perlman that were just splendid.The anime only has 5 EPISODES and that becomes important when were coming to the CHARACTERS. I cant avoid to think that the work characters is something that Takashi Okazaki had a really good start with but never was allowed to make complete because of the few episodes. But on the bright side of life its really impressive how effective they are building up the characters with FLASHBACKS and stuff. I would actually bet on that its more flashbacks then its ''present''. The flashbacks are not cheesy and boring... They are .. kind of cheesy and actually makes a point in the anime. A bigger point than just to fill some holes in the story.But this applies mostly to the ''good guys''. When It comes to the ''VILLAINS''  you will dind lots of unnecessary characters that just exist and doesnt even have a story... Ye, I know, its too short to make storys to all the people but why do you have to include these guys then. They are just ruining everything. Another thing that you could skip is all the freaky machines n' stuff the bad guys are using.One thing that is skipped is the crap. And this is at least one advantage with a short anime. For example in Samurai Champloo (26 episodes) you will have lots of episodes that doesnt take you anywhere in the story (no offense... at all!). In Afro Samurai you will see it pointing right towards the goal, which is Afros revenge.Samurai Champloo is actually a good comparison. They both have smart and not too messy FIGHTING scenes with good angles. Afro Samurai definetely has a lot of more blood and exaggerated sword slices though.They both have the HIPHOP-MUSIC. The music in Afro (by the RZA) may not be as original as champloos but It's really, really great anyways.If youre looking for HUMOUR, champloo is a better choice. Afro is actually kind of heavy even if they have some characters that can give you a fellgood-vibe for a second or two.Overall 8 of 10.

Afro Samurai is a show that doesn\'t boast a great story or character but gets by simply on its excellent animation and soundtrack.The theme of the show in a word is ""Revenge"" you combine that with a Ronin element and basically you have the ingredients for a time-tested winning formula. The story never gets complicated (doesn\'t need to) or boring (with all the blood n guts how could it?) and that is because of the crisp animation style and fast-paced action sequences.The voice acting is also top notch, with Samuel L Jackson doing a good job as the...brooding Afro and a spectacular job as his eccentric conscience. The villains in the show really make watching it worthwhile because while the hero is straight out of every western revenge flick ever made, the villains are original and their characteristics are entertaining.All in all, it\'s a fun ride for the 5 episodes. brooding Afro and a spectacular job as his eccentric conscience.

Unfortunately, there is very little to enjoy outside of that.The 2007 anime is a quick watch, sitting at only 5 episodes. While you may initially be led in by the smoke-like hair of the main character Afro and a gritty introductory scene, the show falls very flat afterwards.You will immediately recognize the heavy blaxploitation inspiration throughout and while that is perfectly fine, any show in my opinion needs a fairly well-written story to fall back on as the appeal of visual aesthetics can only get you so far.Compounding the lack of a...good story, it is very difficult to get invested in any character and their arcs (even Afro to an extent) as the writing is below average, at best. A majority of the dialogue hinges on dated African-American cultural archetypes, with it almost feeling like a purposefully awful dub of a 2000s anime. Even the ending is lackluster in most regards. It overstays its welcome which in turn hurts its narrative impact.Luckily, the show doesn't overstate its welcome too long with it's 2:30 runtime over the whole series. If you sit down and view it as a fun, yet hollow thrill ride of a anime, then you'll have a great time; just don't expect much nuance or substance beyond the surface. good story, it is very difficult to get invested in any character and their arcs (even Afro to an extent) as the writing is below average, at best.

The pacing and tone are very rough, and I\'m going to go ahead and break down the show\'s many flaws. Spoilers past this point (Duh.)Let\'s start with one of the worst choices in this show, Samuel L. Jackson. Since this show is in dub only (not really a negative) one of it\'s main selling points was one of the characters is voiced by him (Afro himself doesn\'t count bc he has like 10 lines total). However, his Ninja character doesn\'t matter, is super annoying, and detracts from the overall experience. He...follows the Afro Samurai around and cracks a lot of jokes and never shuts up. The worst example is this character talking about the samurai wanting to bang Okiku and that they should have an orgy for a like a full minute straight. It\'s not funny, it drags on, and even the samurai gets pissed at him.Near the end of the show, he takes a blow from an enemy to try and talk some sense into Afro before he gets struck down... but apparently he just an imaginary friend of the samurai? After realizing he\'s not a real person, you look back at all the things he was saying and you can infer that these were things he was thinking himself. So... why not have the samurai convey these things himself through subtle facial expressions or movements? If he was scared of the Robo-Afro-Samurai, then show his hand(s) tremble as he\'s holding his sword after clashing with the robot or something. Or maybe the Ninja could\'ve been a real character and have his sacrifice meant something so you feel pity for him at the end. What a clusterfuck of a storyline and a character.Since I already mentioned the robot, let\'s break that down next. The Empty 7 make a copy of the Afro Samurai thanks to... Okiku downloading his dreams? Given the Afro is 100% human, downloading dreams makes less than no sense. She then has sex with him and gives up trying to betray him because of it, and then immediately gets killed so the bad guys get it anyways. The only way I can see this part of the show getting fixed is the brothers downloaded recordings of Afro\'s fights into an AI, and put that in a robot. Then Okiku would just be a random side character that just heals him out of good will and is never seen again. It\'s not great, but it\'s better than whatever that other logic is.Finally, the show has major pacing issues overall due to the flashbacks. The show starts with his father being beheaded and him getting the number 2 headband as a result, only for us to see him lose it and regain in different episodes later on. There is absolutely no need to chop up the story in this way and the two long flashback sequences should\'ve just made up the majority of the 1st episode. The reason for the show cutting in the flashbacks when it does is to make you feel bad for Jinno when you meet him in the 4th episode on the mountain. However, having the viewers thinking he\'s dead only for him to reappear would have 10x the shock value. Also, cut the random scene of after he got Frankenstein-ed and just wanders off, kills some dudes, and wanders back; it\'s just needless padding to the show that could\'ve been a longer fight scene instead. Oh yeah, and even though he was surely dead back on the mountain, he somehow shows up ""many years later"" at the end with the other 9 headbands?

At its heart, it’s a simple and very old story- the hero was wronged by the antagonist, who destroys both something precious to the hero and the hero’s innocence. The hero, in turn, seeks righteous revenge against the antagonist. It’s a time tested tale, and has been recycled over and over again in countless martial arts films, novels old and new, and a few notable 80’s anime. The series’ creator Takashi Okazaki uses this trustworthy archetype as the...bones that he fleshes the rest of the series around. The world of Afro Samurai is actually a collision of worlds and cultures- the core of it is hip-hop and samurai, and there‘s a dash of the post-apocalyptic here, a lot of mad and fantastic machinery is running loose, and only a blind man would miss the Akira homage planted square on the noggin of one character- but it is the revenge story that acts as the simple, accessible crux that keeps the whole potpourri together.Afro Samurai has a lot going for it: Samuel L. Jackson, samurai, Samuel L. Jackson, slickly animated fights, Samuel L. Jackson, a seamless blend of post-apocalyptic sci-fi with hip-hop aesthetics, and a kickin’ soundtrack by the RZA. Oh, and did I mention it has Samuel L. Jackson? I’ll admit it: I was stoked at the idea of one of my favorite live-action actors being a voice actor in an anime. Though, I was sorely disappointed because Jackson, as the voice behind the title character, didn’t get any more than twenty words in the whole series. It seemed cheap and gimmicky, since Jackson was the Big Name that attracted a lot of attention to this series, hyping Afro Samurai above every other action release this year before it even premiered on Spike. Regardless, the entire vocal cast of Afro Samurai is superb, even without Mr. JacksonI thoroughly enjoyed the show, and recommend it for any fans of action flicks. You can watch the whole series where I watched it, at [www.watchafrosamurai.com].Overall, 9/10. Great show. bones that he fleshes the rest of the series around.

Why you gotta kill me?""Afro: ""Nothing personal. It\'s just revenge.""The brainchild of mangaka Takashi Okazaki, Afro Samurai follows the adventures of the aptly named Afro, a samurai who devotes his life to avenging his father\'s murder.The series is a High Concept anime that reflects Mr. Okazaki\'s love of hip-hop and American culture. And what could represent American culture more than Samuel L. Jackson? Well, a lot of things, actually, but I won\'t complain. Mr. Jackson actually does pretty well in this series, voicing both the protagonist Afro and his jive-talking sidekick, Ninja Ninja. [spoiler]This is a bit...of Fridge Brilliance when you realize that Ninja is a manifestation of Afro\'s desire to end his bloody campaign against Justice.[/spoiler] And Jackson manages to make two distinct voices for both characters (although Ninja Ninja is very obviously Jackson\'s normal speaking voice).

The plot is very straight-forward. The Big Bad kills Afro\'s father, then Afro learns to swordfight so he can get revenge. It seems heavily reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino flick, and is about just as emotionally engaging. However, there are some subtleties to it, such as Ninja Ninja\'s character and Jinno\'s double standards. But all of this is put on the backburner for the fights. The fights are ultra-violent and stylized, but have this odd, surreal aspect where you simultaneously know and don\'t know what\'s going on. The fights are criminally short, however, with a few exceptions (such as the fight with the Afrobot), which largely takes away from the experience.This leads me to the show\'s number one flaw: the pacing. It is WAY too fast. This is undoubtedly due to its five-episode length, but still. FLCL managed to get an unrushed narrative out in six, and even one more episode would have done a world of good for ""Samurai"". For god\'s sake, the last episode features a fight with Afro\'s Rival Turned Evil (although the ""evil"" aspect is YMMV), the Big Bad\'s A God Am I speech, and the Climactic Battle between said Big Bad. In 20 minutes. It\'s too much to ask, and it makes the show seem somewhat schizophrenic.Summary - With stylish, violent fight scenes and an enjoyable, if simple storyline, Afro Samurai is a decent, if flawed, series.

Jackson voicing the lead. Sounds amazing, right? However...Story: 3/10Afro Samurai has a really generic revenge plot- boy\'s father is murdered in front of him, killer encourages boy to seek revenge, boy grows up and seeks revenge. It\'s not the worst premise I\'ve ever seen. However, as the story progresses, the premise gains absolutely no depth. There\'s a hamfisted attempt at pushing a ""break the cycle"" moral, but it never seems to have any bearing on the plot or the characters whatsoever. The main plot is honestly boring, which is...a major negative when considering how much screentime is devoted to it.The episodic plots are even worse somehow. They don\'t really have any relation to the plot besides ""#2 headband"" and they leave a lot of loose ends dangling and plot holes. I found myself constantly confused about where these subplots came from. My guess is that they\'re mostly excuses for a gore-fest or a really uncomfortable sex scene.Art: 8/10The art is very stylized and certainly hard to get used to, but the longer I watched it the more I grew to like it. The use of grayscale is intentional and gives the (copious amounts of) blood a stark contrast. One could also say that it\'s symbolic of Afro\'s mindset, and given how artsy it feels I wouldn\'t argue.The animation itself is also good. Nothing about it feels clunky or cheap. The blood spurts are definitely Kill Bill-esque, but I believe that\'s intentional.Sound: 9/10The soundtrack is where Afro Samurai really shines. The Wu-Tang Clan breathed life into this thing, giving it a hip-hop feel that isn\'t there without it. This is one of those cases where the soundtrack actually enhances the series instead of just acting as background noise.The voice acting was generally very good. SLJ\'s characters in particular had excellent voice acting. A few side characters sounded awkward, but I\'ve honestly never seen a dub this good. My only complaint is with how godawful the few Japanese words sound when spoken by the English cast, something I\'ve never encountered before.Character: 1/10This is the main problem with the series: none of the characters are likeable. At all. Ninja Ninja is annoying, Afro himself is a forgettable silent badass with no redeeming qualities, and all of the side characters and villains managed to grate on my nerves somehow.To make it worse, none of the characters really experience any kind of development. Sure, there\'s a limit to what you can do in 5 episodes, but the main character at the end should be different from the main character at the beginning. The only ""character development"" we get is in Afro\'s flashbacks, and they really only show him as a kid fostering his hatred and anger. There\'s also a huge gap in character between child Afro and adult Afro with nothing to bridge it, to the point that I can barely even recognize that they\'re supposed to be the same person.Enjoyment: 3/10I may have enjoyed looking at the art and listening to the soundtrack, but I was bored pretty much the whole way through and I couldn\'t wait for it to be over. If you\'re looking for senseless violence and sex, you may enjoy it more than I did.In closing, I\'d only recommend this anime if you aren\'t interested in plot and don\'t care about characters.

I really have no complaints with it since it\'s the right anime to watch when looking for a good bloodfest.Although you may see some reviews ""praising"" its story, don\'t be fooled. Afro Samurai pretty much follows a pretty simple story and plot; Revenge. don\'t believe any reviews you may see that say that""Afro Samurai is the beautifully tragic story of a little boy who after witnessing a tragedy, must find the strength to blah blah blah in this heart-moving  show about blah yadda blah"" or something along those lines.

Warriors of honor, loyally serving their masters, as well as lone ronin, serving only to uphold the values they hold true, whether they be religious or personal. Around these parts, you’ll hear tales of one such ronin, a bad ass motherfucker who’s as silent as the grave and twice as terrifying. This man knows no love, no empathy, and no tears. He invites no trouble, and will offer no mercy to those stupid enough to give it to him. He knows few pleasures, save for the warmth of a woman’s body, the refreshing tang...of a cool glass of lemonade, and the sweet, sweet flavor of revenge. Rumor has it he doesn’t even need to eat... That the blood of his enemies, which constantly bathes the blade of his sword, provides him all the nourishment he could ever need. I myself have no idea which rumors are true and which ones are just the product of fear, but I’ve got no intention of finding out, and neither should you.You’ll know this young samurai when you see him, as he sports an afro... A rare hair style indeed, and one that will surely become his sigul long after he’s departed our world, if he ever does. But don’t worry, traveler, there’s no need to fear this man... Well, unless you have what he wants. Otherwise, he’ll be perfectly willing to live and let live. See, you’ve probably heard tell about the headbands... Trophies only the mightiest of samurai are able to carry, and the only way to obtain one is to spill the blood of it’s previous owner. Well, this Afro Samurai is carrying the #2 headband, which... If you can’t guess... Is the second most prestigious headband in the known world, and the only one that grants it’s user the right to challenge the greatest samurai currently living, the holder of the #1 headband. And you didn’t hear this from me, dear traveler, but the Afro Samurai’s drive to challenge this man isn’t based on mere ambition, but something much more personal. He fights not for glory, or for honor... But for revenge.Unlike most anime, Afro Samurai was the product of an international collaboration. Studio Gonzo was interested in adapting the deeply personal work of Takashi Okazaki, a manga artist who had been influenced by his love of both samurai classics and African American culture, particularly in regard to rap and R&B. He was shy at first, and probably wouldn’t have signed over the rights if not for the encouragement and participation of American actor Samuel L Jackson, who had gotten his hands on a rare action figure based on Okazaki’s illustrations, and had become obsessed with seeing the project through. Jackson and Okazaki apparently connected instantly, language barriers be damned, and the project went ahead, albeit with what I’m told was a 1 million dollar budget.For an American cartoon, that sort of budget for a five episode series is abysmal, but it’s not that generous for an anime, either, despite the fact that anime is universally cheaper than it’s western counterparts. For Afro Samurai, this meant that each episode could only cost less than twenty thousand dollars, and that meant they had to cut a lot of corners... Which they did, brilliantly I might add, by turning the cheapness they’d been cursed with into a highly appealing visual style that incorporates the absolute best out of all the budget saving tactics you’ve seen before. It never quite falls back on the time old talking heads, at least not to the point that you’d ever notice it, but when movement is limited, the beautifully detailed artwork is more than sufficient to keep your eyes glued to the screen.To be completely honest, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an anime... Well, any animation, really... Get this much mileage out of such a limited color palette. There are occasional splashes of color throughout the series, especially when it comes to the buckets full of red blood and the golden glow of our hero’s precious lemonade, but for about 90 percent of the series, the colors on screen are almost monochromatic, playing with numerous shades of white, black and gray, as well as the occasional tan of the ground. At night, the cloudy, overcast sky is a captivating sight, and during the day, the lighting effects are beyond gorgeous. Other visual effects such as rain and fog filters are integrated smoothly with the cell-drawn animation.The real triumph here are the action scenes, which are fast, fluid and dynamic, even when the animators have to break a character’s anatomical frame in order to keep the pace up. It only takes one real glance to see this kind of animation style in motion, as Afro’s namesake blows in the wind like the reflection of the moon in a puddle, and the animators are not shy about letting an occasional arm or leg move with exactly the same level of consistency. It winds up working out better than you’d think not only because of sharp, fast editing, but because the sound design of every single sword movement is completely on point. I love all of the action scenes in this series, but a few easy highlights are an early fight where Afro splits a bullet with his sword, a huge bloodbath of a brawl from when he was a teenager that almost feels like Saving Private Ryan in the way it’s brutality is show to effect him, and of course, there’s also a fight towards the end where he takes on a robot who’s been designed to look and fight like he does, but has no problem taking Afro to the sky with it when those tactics don’t pan out.As you may have guessed from Okazaki and Jackson’s connection that I mentioned earlier, the music in Afro Samurai is made up mostly of hip-hop, full of vocal tracks whose head-banging beats fit the pace of the action in a way that’s easily similar to The Boondocks. The vocal work was performed by RZA, a former member of the Wu-Tang clan, a band that was, in it’s own right, influenced by Eastern culture. He also produced much of the music, as he did for his former band. The instrumental tracks feature slightly more traditional orchestration, but they fit more to the background, humbly doing their job without standing out too much. Besides, why bother making the instrumentals stand out when you have tracks featuring The Game, Too Short, Snoop Dogg and more, which are guaranteed to leave an impression all by themselves? The soundtrack, if you’re lucky enough to have it, features a small handful of tracks that weren’t from the show but inspired by it, and I don’t mean ‘inspired by’ like all the bullshit tracks on the Pokemon Movie soundtrack... These are songs that actually fit the series.The English dub is a very unique entity, as it’s comprised almost entirely of actors who work in traditional animation. or “Pre-lay.” This is a term referring to the practice of recording a voice actor first and then animating a character around them afterwards, as opposed to ADR voice acting, which does the opposite. Thankfully, they translate very well over to the more prevalent Anime recording style, although there are minor lip-flapping hiccups from time to time. The only anime regular who appears in this dub is Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Afro’s childhood friend, Ginno, who was an idealistic young boy in Afro’s past, but is even more compelling in the present day scenes, due to certain spoiler reasons. He does an outstanding job, probably the best performance in the dub, but because of a certain other big name, he was never the one I was going to get excited over.No matter how much hype went into the American airing of the series... And yes, the hype was palpable... The truth was, regardless of the show’s success, I was going to watch it either way because of one of the names attached to it. He’s one of the most underrated actors of our time, in my opinion, and as much as I enjoy his live action work, I practically chomp at the bit when I get a chance to hear him in a cartoon, or even in the rare video game, and I couldn’t resist the opportunity to hear him in an anime. He’s not only my favorite black actor, or my favorite voice actor, no, he’s my favorite ACTOR, period. I’ve been following him since BEFORE what many would consider his most memorable role in Pulp Fiction, and his inclusion made this dub for me. That’s right, I’m talking about Phil Lamarr, the original voice actor for Samurai Jack, who once again returned to the genre as the young version of Afro, as well as one of the Brothers, a league of elderly assassins including such prolific actors as Jeff Bennet and John Dimaggio!Oh, you thought I was talking about Samuel L Jackson? He did a fine job. I wish I could say more, but as a main character, he had relatively little to do or say throughout the series. The titular character Afro is a very soft-spoken character, choosing only to speak when necessary, letting his actions do the speaking for him unless he has no other choice. It’s not really Jackson’s fault, as it’s not really an acting-heavy role, but he still does an admirable job with it. Thankfully he has dual roles, as he gets a lot more lines as the mysterious Ninja Ninja, a loud-mouthed tag-a-long who appears to Afro the minute he earns the #2 headband properly. The true identity of Ninja ninja is never openly revealed, nor is it stated until the final episode whether or not he exists at all. While his endless jabbering is welcome most of the time, breaking up long periods of silence and questioning Afro’s motives, he can become annoying with his knack for stating the obvious. Think of him like... D’s hand from Vampire Hunter D.The other two high-billed names are Kelly Hu and Ron Perlman, though neither one really appears enough to justify having featured names. Outside of flashbacks, Kelly Hu only appears in one episode as a shrine maiden who takes Afro in when he’s near death, and nurses him back to health... Using both medical AND sexual healing to see him through. Kelly exaggerates her accent with this character, which I guess is fitting, because she’s one of the only definitely-asian characters in the cast. Ron Perlman is unrecognizable as the main villain, Justice, who only appears in the first and last episodes, but that’s mostly because he hisses his lines like a snake, playing up how misanthropic and morally bankrupt this #1 samurai has allowed his time in the top to make him, as well as highlighting his delusional, god-like ambitions. If there’s a problem with this dub, it’s probably in the fact that some of the Brothers, played by veteran voice actors though they may be, are performed as though they were southern evangelical priests, a bafflingly poor fit for the tone of the series.You wouldn’t be unjustified in saying that Afro Samurai had a very weak story. Despite all that happens in it’s five episode run, little to none of it seems to matter in the long run. Afro gets into fights that are resolved as easily as possible, and then moves on afterward, as if nothing had happened at all. This is because, at it’s core, Afro Samurai is the very simple story about a surprisingly simple man. While we do get generous doses of flashbacks to explain who he is and why he’s doing what he’s doing, you really wouldn’t lose anything important to the plot if you just told his backstory, and then cut directly to Afro standing at the gates of his final enemy. Even at five episodes, this anime could have been reduced to one, or two at the most, with nothing you would need to know lost in the process. The story does not see actual progress very often, and neither does Afro’s journey, as he himself sees little to no development, at least if you don’t count his childhood and teenage years in the flashbacks. This has become a major criticism of the series, and it’s one I feel I should address.One of my favorite movies of 2013 was 2 Guns, a more-or-less by the numbers action film that featured both Denzel Washington and Mark Walberg as undercover agents from two separate factions pretending to be friends to investigate each other, constantly fighting together and backstabbing each other as the story progresses. I say that, but the story for the most part was an incoherent mess. There were so many betrayals and plot twists that I’m not sure even the writers knew what was going on, so why did I love it so much? The answer lies in the execution, and what the movie brought to the table that worked. The insane story was made palatable by the sharp, clever dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads, and it ended in such a way that it was able to embrace it’s insanity... Where else am I ever going to see a shoot-out between the Navy, the CIA and a drug cartel that takes place in the middle of an honest to God cattle stampede?And that’s exactly why I like Afro Samurai so much. There are plenty of samurai stories with depth and complexity to them... Samurai Jack, Seven Samurai, Rurouni Kenshin... But in how many of them do we get to see the main character ride a robot version of themselves into the stratosphere, and then fight it all the way down? The only theme that Afro Samurai really tackles is the cost of revenge, as you do get to feel the bodies of Afro’s friends and enemies pile up over time, which forces you to wonder whether or not vengeance for his father’s death is really worth it in the first place, and his past does come back to haunt him at numerous occasions, as will often happen with the hunt for vengeance. Aside from this, there are a lot of things that just kind of happen, but the saving grace... And what makes the execution here so good... Is that it’s all done with so much sincerity that none of it ever feels forced or pointless. Every single fight is memorable, no matter how easily they’re resolved, and even no matter how forgettable or how generic the attackers themselves may be.Does this excuse the obvious problems with the series? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, while this series does make for good popcorn material, it doesn’t offer much in the way of a rewatch, and much like your typical Superman story, it’s kind of difficult to get invested in the story of an unstoppable man. There’s also quite a bit that doesn’t make any sense... The rules behind the headbands in particular are a head scratcher, and I’m not just talking about how easy it would be to fake a #2 headband, but... What happens when #2 kills #1? Do they choose who gets the #2? Apparently they do, because Justice just hands it over to little Afro so that some bandits can pick it up. And why can’t someone just break the rules and kill the #1 with a sniper rifle? Guns exist! And while I had no problem with most of Afro’s enemies, the writers never portended that they were supposed to be important... Except for the Empty Seven, who prove to be completely wasted by the end.And yet, the series keeps a consistent tone that makes it really easy to get lost in. Shallow as the story may be, one dimensional as adult Afro may be, underdeveloped as several concepts may be, it’s a dark, gritty story that’s taken completely seriously and steeped in the love of two very adult genres. It’s definitely style over substance, but with both a style and substance that feel more like a collaboration between Kanye West and Quentin Tarrantino than a collaboration between Sam Jackson and a Mangaka, it’s worth at least a second look. That’s not to say the series is as much as the sum of it’s parts, but there’s something to be said for how much fun it is to watch a passion project that’s creatively unhinged, and held back only by budgetary limits. It’s not trying to be art, it’s trying to be grindhouse, and to that end, it does a pretty solid job.Afro Samurai is available from Funimation in an impressive fold-out DVD case, as well as your standard thin blu-ray release. A follow-up movie, Afro Samurai Resurrection, is also available from the same company, and while you can buy them separately, you can also get them as a bundle in a set called The Complete Murder Sessions. The original manga consists of only two volumes, and it IS available stateside from Seven Seas Entertainment. A video game for the Playstation 3 and X-Box 360 is unfortunately out of print, but it’s not that difficult to find a copy online.Afro Samurai isn’t for everyone. In fact, I’m done making excuses for it. There’s a good reason I can only watch this series about once a year, tops. It has a definite cool factor, but so did the first seasons of RWBY and Hellsing, and I hated both of those. Granted, Afro Samurai has quite a bit more to offer than those two did(as much as it fails compared to their future incarnations), mostly in regard to it’s great production values, addictive music and engrossing adult tone, but I have to admit that if it were even one episode longer, I’d probably hate it. I love Afro Samurai, but like so many other guilty pleasures out there, I have to be brutally honest about it... This series works really well, but only in small doses spaced out over time. I give Afro Samurai a 5/10 of a cool glass of lemonade, and the sweet, sweet flavor of revenge. Rumor has it he doesn’t even need to eat... That the blood of his enemies, which constantly bathes the blade of his sword, provides him all the nourishment he could ever need. I myself have no idea which rumors are true and which ones are just the product of fear, but I’ve got no intention of finding out, and neither should you.You’ll know this young samurai when you see him, as he sports an afro... A rare hair style indeed, and one that will surely become his sigul long after he’s departed our world, if he ever does. But don’t worry, traveler, there’s no need to fear this man... Well, unless you have what he wants. Otherwise, he’ll be perfectly willing to live and let live. See, you’ve probably heard tell about the headbands... Trophies only the mightiest of samurai are able to carry, and the only way to obtain one is to spill the blood of it’s previous owner. Well, this Afro Samurai is carrying the #2 headband, which... If you can’t guess... Is the second most prestigious headband in the known world, and the only one that grants it’s user the right to challenge the greatest samurai currently living, the holder of the #1 headband. And you didn’t hear this from me, dear traveler, but the Afro Samurai’s drive to challenge this man isn’t based on mere ambition, but something much more personal. He fights not for glory, or for honor... But for revenge.Unlike most anime, Afro Samurai was the product of an international collaboration. Studio Gonzo was interested in adapting the deeply personal work of Takashi Okazaki, a manga artist who had been influenced by his love of both samurai classics and African American culture, particularly in regard to rap and R&B. He was shy at first, and probably wouldn’t have signed over the rights if not for the encouragement and participation of American actor Samuel L Jackson, who had gotten his hands on a rare action figure based on Okazaki’s illustrations, and had become obsessed with seeing the project through. Jackson and Okazaki apparently connected instantly, language barriers be damned, and the project went ahead, albeit with what I’m told was a 1 million dollar budget.For an American cartoon, that sort of budget for a five episode series is abysmal, but it’s not that generous for an anime, either, despite the fact that anime is universally cheaper than it’s western counterparts. For Afro Samurai, this meant that each episode could only cost less than twenty thousand dollars, and that meant they had to cut a lot of corners... Which they did, brilliantly I might add, by turning the cheapness they’d been cursed with into a highly appealing visual style that incorporates the absolute best out of all the budget saving tactics you’ve seen before. It never quite falls back on the time old talking heads, at least not to the point that you’d ever notice it, but when movement is limited, the beautifully detailed artwork is more than sufficient to keep your eyes glued to the screen.To be completely honest, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an anime... Well, any animation, really... Get this much mileage out of such a limited color palette. There are occasional splashes of color throughout the series, especially when it comes to the buckets full of red blood and the golden glow of our hero’s precious lemonade, but for about 90 percent of the series, the colors on screen are almost monochromatic, playing with numerous shades of white, black and gray, as well as the occasional tan of the ground. At night, the cloudy, overcast sky is a captivating sight, and during the day, the lighting effects are beyond gorgeous. Other visual effects such as rain and fog filters are integrated smoothly with the cell-drawn animation.The real triumph here are the action scenes, which are fast, fluid and dynamic, even when the animators have to break a character’s anatomical frame in order to keep the pace up. It only takes one real glance to see this kind of animation style in motion, as Afro’s namesake blows in the wind like the reflection of the moon in a puddle, and the animators are not shy about letting an occasional arm or leg move with exactly the same level of consistency. It winds up working out better than you’d think not only because of sharp, fast editing, but because the sound design of every single sword movement is completely on point. I love all of the action scenes in this series, but a few easy highlights are an early fight where Afro splits a bullet with his sword, a huge bloodbath of a brawl from when he was a teenager that almost feels like Saving Private Ryan in the way it’s brutality is show to effect him, and of course, there’s also a fight towards the end where he takes on a robot who’s been designed to look and fight like he does, but has no problem taking Afro to the sky with it when those tactics don’t pan out.As you may have guessed from Okazaki and Jackson’s connection that I mentioned earlier, the music in Afro Samurai is made up mostly of hip-hop, full of vocal tracks whose head-banging beats fit the pace of the action in a way that’s easily similar to The Boondocks. The vocal work was performed by RZA, a former member of the Wu-Tang clan, a band that was, in it’s own right, influenced by Eastern culture. He also produced much of the music, as he did for his former band. The instrumental tracks feature slightly more traditional orchestration, but they fit more to the background, humbly doing their job without standing out too much. Besides, why bother making the instrumentals stand out when you have tracks featuring The Game, Too Short, Snoop Dogg and more, which are guaranteed to leave an impression all by themselves? The soundtrack, if you’re lucky enough to have it, features a small handful of tracks that weren’t from the show but inspired by it, and I don’t mean ‘inspired by’ like all the bullshit tracks on the Pokemon Movie soundtrack... These are songs that actually fit the series.The English dub is a very unique entity, as it’s comprised almost entirely of actors who work in traditional animation. or “Pre-lay.” This is a term referring to the practice of recording a voice actor first and then animating a character around them afterwards, as opposed to ADR voice acting, which does the opposite. Thankfully, they translate very well over to the more prevalent Anime recording style, although there are minor lip-flapping hiccups from time to time. The only anime regular who appears in this dub is Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Afro’s childhood friend, Ginno, who was an idealistic young boy in Afro’s past, but is even more compelling in the present day scenes, due to certain spoiler reasons. He does an outstanding job, probably the best performance in the dub, but because of a certain other big name, he was never the one I was going to get excited over.No matter how much hype went into the American airing of the series... And yes, the hype was palpable... The truth was, regardless of the show’s success, I was going to watch it either way because of one of the names attached to it. He’s one of the most underrated actors of our time, in my opinion, and as much as I enjoy his live action work, I practically chomp at the bit when I get a chance to hear him in a cartoon, or even in the rare video game, and I couldn’t resist the opportunity to hear him in an anime. He’s not only my favorite black actor, or my favorite voice actor, no, he’s my favorite ACTOR, period. I’ve been following him since BEFORE what many would consider his most memorable role in Pulp Fiction, and his inclusion made this dub for me. That’s right, I’m talking about Phil Lamarr, the original voice actor for Samurai Jack, who once again returned to the genre as the young version of Afro, as well as one of the Brothers, a league of elderly assassins including such prolific actors as Jeff Bennet and John Dimaggio!Oh, you thought I was talking about Samuel L Jackson? He did a fine job. I wish I could say more, but as a main character, he had relatively little to do or say throughout the series. The titular character Afro is a very soft-spoken character, choosing only to speak when necessary, letting his actions do the speaking for him unless he has no other choice. It’s not really Jackson’s fault, as it’s not really an acting-heavy role, but he still does an admirable job with it. Thankfully he has dual roles, as he gets a lot more lines as the mysterious Ninja Ninja, a loud-mouthed tag-a-long who appears to Afro the minute he earns the #2 headband properly. The true identity of Ninja ninja is never openly revealed, nor is it stated until the final episode whether or not he exists at all. While his endless jabbering is welcome most of the time, breaking up long periods of silence and questioning Afro’s motives, he can become annoying with his knack for stating the obvious. Think of him like... D’s hand from Vampire Hunter D.The other two high-billed names are Kelly Hu and Ron Perlman, though neither one really appears enough to justify having featured names. Outside of flashbacks, Kelly Hu only appears in one episode as a shrine maiden who takes Afro in when he’s near death, and nurses him back to health... Using both medical AND sexual healing to see him through. Kelly exaggerates her accent with this character, which I guess is fitting, because she’s one of the only definitely-asian characters in the cast. Ron Perlman is unrecognizable as the main villain, Justice, who only appears in the first and last episodes, but that’s mostly because he hisses his lines like a snake, playing up how misanthropic and morally bankrupt this #1 samurai has allowed his time in the top to make him, as well as highlighting his delusional, god-like ambitions. If there’s a problem with this dub, it’s probably in the fact that some of the Brothers, played by veteran voice actors though they may be, are performed as though they were southern evangelical priests, a bafflingly poor fit for the tone of the series.You wouldn’t be unjustified in saying that Afro Samurai had a very weak story. Despite all that happens in it’s five episode run, little to none of it seems to matter in the long run. Afro gets into fights that are resolved as easily as possible, and then moves on afterward, as if nothing had happened at all. This is because, at it’s core, Afro Samurai is the very simple story about a surprisingly simple man. While we do get generous doses of flashbacks to explain who he is and why he’s doing what he’s doing, you really wouldn’t lose anything important to the plot if you just told his backstory, and then cut directly to Afro standing at the gates of his final enemy. Even at five episodes, this anime could have been reduced to one, or two at the most, with nothing you would need to know lost in the process. The story does not see actual progress very often, and neither does Afro’s journey, as he himself sees little to no development, at least if you don’t count his childhood and teenage years in the flashbacks. This has become a major criticism of the series, and it’s one I feel I should address.One of my favorite movies of 2013 was 2 Guns, a more-or-less by the numbers action film that featured both Denzel Washington and Mark Walberg as undercover agents from two separate factions pretending to be friends to investigate each other, constantly fighting together and backstabbing each other as the story progresses. I say that, but the story for the most part was an incoherent mess. There were so many betrayals and plot twists that I’m not sure even the writers knew what was going on, so why did I love it so much? The answer lies in the execution, and what the movie brought to the table that worked. The insane story was made palatable by the sharp, clever dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads, and it ended in such a way that it was able to embrace it’s insanity... Where else am I ever going to see a shoot-out between the Navy, the CIA and a drug cartel that takes place in the middle of an honest to God cattle stampede?And that’s exactly why I like Afro Samurai so much. There are plenty of samurai stories with depth and complexity to them... Samurai Jack, Seven Samurai, Rurouni Kenshin... But in how many of them do we get to see the main character ride a robot version of themselves into the stratosphere, and then fight it all the way down? The only theme that Afro Samurai really tackles is the cost of revenge, as you do get to feel the bodies of Afro’s friends and enemies pile up over time, which forces you to wonder whether or not vengeance for his father’s death is really worth it in the first place, and his past does come back to haunt him at numerous occasions, as will often happen with the hunt for vengeance. Aside from this, there are a lot of things that just kind of happen, but the saving grace... And what makes the execution here so good... Is that it’s all done with so much sincerity that none of it ever feels forced or pointless. Every single fight is memorable, no matter how easily they’re resolved, and even no matter how forgettable or how generic the attackers themselves may be.Does this excuse the obvious problems with the series? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, while this series does make for good popcorn material, it doesn’t offer much in the way of a rewatch, and much like your typical Superman story, it’s kind of difficult to get invested in the story of an unstoppable man. There’s also quite a bit that doesn’t make any sense... The rules behind the headbands in particular are a head scratcher, and I’m not just talking about how easy it would be to fake a #2 headband, but... What happens when #2 kills #1? Do they choose who gets the #2? Apparently they do, because Justice just hands it over to little Afro so that some bandits can pick it up. And why can’t someone just break the rules and kill the #1 with a sniper rifle? Guns exist! And while I had no problem with most of Afro’s enemies, the writers never portended that they were supposed to be important... Except for the Empty Seven, who prove to be completely wasted by the end.And yet, the series keeps a consistent tone that makes it really easy to get lost in. Shallow as the story may be, one dimensional as adult Afro may be, underdeveloped as several concepts may be, it’s a dark, gritty story that’s taken completely seriously and steeped in the love of two very adult genres. It’s definitely style over substance, but with both a style and substance that feel more like a collaboration between Kanye West and Quentin Tarrantino than a collaboration between Sam Jackson and a Mangaka, it’s worth at least a second look. That’s not to say the series is as much as the sum of it’s parts, but there’s something to be said for how much fun it is to watch a passion project that’s creatively unhinged, and held back only by budgetary limits. It’s not trying to be art, it’s trying to be grindhouse, and to that end, it does a pretty solid job.Afro Samurai is available from Funimation in an impressive fold-out DVD case, as well as your standard thin blu-ray release.

I give Afro Samurai a 5/10', ""(Reviewing the dub because I cannot imagine watching this subbed)Afro Samurai is one of those shows where the concept and production is so good that you want to love it, but the execution just doesn't live up to its promises.It's still enjoyable for what it is. The sound track is amazing, the art work is gorgeous, the animation references classics like Ninja Scroll while still being fresh and fluid, but don't expect any deep character development or innovations in storytelling. Our protagonist is the strong silent type taken to the absolute extreme (like everything else) and all emotions and human elements come in the form...of flashbacks.Afro Samurai s basically a blacksploitation film, but without the social sensibilities of Spike Lee or Gordon Parks. It's what would happen if you gave Shaft a tragic revenge story, took away all his lines, and dropped him in distopian Meiji era-future Japan.What I liked:It was awesome to see black characters staring in anime, and I loved that it was pointed out they they were different than all the Japanese characters around them. With Samual L. Jackson playing Samurai and his loud companion Ninja Ninja, the blackspoitation angle worked without being racist. I could not imagine watching this subbed.The world was really cool.

There are only five episodes, not enough time for all that.The lone named female character was woefully cliche and died right after sex in another terrible cliche. Not exactly a feminist show.There are almost too many fights (and I love fight scenes).Ultimately:The show could have benefited from a few more episodes to help the pacing, but I'm not sure Samurai's character could have carried any more.You should give it a watch if you like things like both Samurai Champloo and Pulp Fiction.

I guess it would be categorized as an action, gore type with the main theme being revenge. The story goes as far as telling you why and how, but doesn't delve deeper into other characters, but there really wasn't any need to. The art was cool. the anime as a whole was like an extended movie each episode leading into the other. I very much enjoyed this series and hope you will to.There is also a movie which I haven't seen called Afro samurai resurrection. "", 'So I was given this anime, and my friend kept telling me to watch it. Honestly I loved the series. I should have watched it WAY sooner. So there are very few negatives for me. The story is very low. However given that this is a 5 episode series, and its a revenge series. So I mean not much you can deviate from that. Also enough story is given to make you actually care about the characters. I also kind of wish they explored the world a little bit more. It is a very interesting mix of modern world meets ancient samurai world. However there...is a movie that came out after this series so I may just get that wish in that. The art work is phenomenal. It has such good fighting animation in it. It is so fluid with how the characters move around. Also one other plus is the facial animations. It is much better then most anime. The opening is also pretty good to. Like Samurai Champloo in a way. Definitely adding it to my workout playlist. The voice acting is also superb as well. Joe Dimaggio, Samuel L Jackson, and Phil LaMarr. All great obviously, but the side voice actors are also fantastic. You can truly believe what they are saying. So to say the least. This series is a great anime that I would totally recommend. It is a good story about revenge, fighting, and feels like a bloody Bruce Lee movie. is a movie that came out after this series so I may just get that wish in that. The art work is phenomenal.

It's a perfect storm of all the things I like about anime, westerns, and action movies, without any of the things I don't like. It's basically what would happen if Quentin Tarantino made an anime, complete with the obligatory Samuel L. Jackson.I'd say the only weak point is the story, which honestly is not that much of a weak point. Overall it's pretty damn generic. It's the same plot from every western/samurai movie ever made, but it's done really well. Tone and atmosphere are two things that I don't think are discussed nearly enough when...talking about anime, but they're probably the most important factors for me in deciding between a good show and a great show. The tone of this show is exactly what I'm looking for in an action anime, dark and somber without trying too hard and just being edgy. The art, sound, and pacing create a very enveloping, atmospheric, world to get lost in.The art in this show is phenomenal. It's expressive and it flows. All of the character designs are unique and interesting and they have their own personalities. The colors are dark and muted which creates a bleak and depressing world to match the somber tone of the show. Even at points when the story is bogged down by just hitting the necessary story beats of a western/samurai movie, the animation and choreography keep the show engaging.The soundtrack is definitely one of the better ones out there. Even for someone who is not the biggest fan of hip-hop. It all fits with the show incredibly well and effectively sets the tone and mood for each scene. It's engaging and enjoyable enough that you never just tune it out and forget it's there, but it never distracts from what's going on in the scene.The characters in this show pretty much all fit snuggly into an archetype of the western/samurai movie/hero's journey but, just like the story, they're exceptionally executed. Each character is given exactly the amount of backstory or development needed to make them effective at they're role. They each have depth and and internally consistent logic driving them. Nothing they do ever feels unmotivated or out of character. You can really grasp what drives them and why, without being told.All this would still count for nothing if it were a boring show though. Ultimately, it's all going to come down to personal taste, and as I said in the beginning Afro Samurai has everything I like and nothing I don't. There's a reason this is the only anime I own physically, and It's because I have no problem watching it over and over again (also because it's one of the few anime I don't have to be embarrassed about owning). This has all of the over the top action and gore I crave from an action show without trying too hard and just being edgy. The action scenes are exciting and engaging. I never get tired of the fountains of blood or severed limbs. The dialog is great, and has the absolute best dub of all time.If you're a fan of action movies, or westerns, or samurai movies, or all of the above at the same time, Afro Samurai will probably be one of the best rides of your life.Overall 10 severed heads out of 10. talking about anime, but they're probably the most important factors for me in deciding between a good show and a great show.

Geno was one of my favorite characters because of the changes made from the past to present. he was such a complex character for not really being shown in the present for too long. afro is also a very deep character, whose story is portrayed beautifully with the help of the back story, the producers did a good job. the villains on the other hand, weren't so great. they were very superficial, dry and stereotypical. they were just a bundle of pure evil with no real rhyme or reason. a little disappointingENJOYMENT: 6theres something missing to this series and its frustrating because i cant really put my finger on whats missing exactly. i didnt hate the series i just wasnt wowed by any one aspect of it as much as i thought i was going to. i suppose the series just wasnt for me. it was entertaining dont get me wrong but i just felt like it was just lacking in something. it might have been the voice acting that really put a damper on the dramatic parts of the series.OVERALL:-plot is very basic. a common revenge plot, nothing new-animation was amazing. not crazy about the style.  the color palate really help make for a feeling of emptiness, sadness and fastness-music was on point-geno and afro were awesome characters with great development. ninja ninja was annoying but necessary for comic relief. villains had no depth to them.-voice acting overall could have used some more direction and energy. Samuel L. Jackson's performance was great though-not for those of the weak of heart. a lot of blood, gore, fighting. theres a sex scene there as well-a good anime if youre in between stuff because it's short became a harden killer.ART: 7the animation actually is very very well done. everything was pretty fluid and the fight scenes were entertaining and beautiful to watch. im not so scary about the art style as much but it wasn't ugly. the color palate chosen really intensified the barren landscape and the overall feeling of emptinessSOUND: 7the music kinda reminded me of samurai champloo with those hip hop vibes. i actually really enjoyed the intro song. helps form the tone of the anime right from the start.

Geno was one of my favorite characters because of the changes made from the past to present. he was such a complex character for not really being shown in the present for too long. afro is also a very deep character, whose story is portrayed beautifully with the help of the back story, the producers did a good job. the villains on the other hand, weren't so great. they were very superficial, dry and stereotypical. they were just a bundle of pure evil with no real rhyme or reason. a little disappointingENJOYMENT: 6theres something missing to this series and its frustrating because i cant really put my finger on whats missing exactly. i didnt hate the series i just wasnt wowed by any one aspect of it as much as i thought i was going to. i suppose the series just wasnt for me. it was entertaining dont get me wrong but i just felt like it was just lacking in something. it might have been the voice acting that really put a damper on the dramatic parts of the series.OVERALL:-plot is very basic. a common revenge plot, nothing new-animation was amazing. not crazy about the style.  the color palate really help make for a feeling of emptiness, sadness and fastness-music was on point-geno and afro were awesome characters with great development. ninja ninja was annoying but necessary for comic relief. villains had no depth to them.-voice acting overall could have used some more direction and energy. Samuel L. Jackson's performance was great though-not for those of the weak of heart. a lot of blood, gore, fighting. theres a sex scene there as well-a good anime if youre in between stuff because it's short"", 'The story is quite simple, poor, with not-so-deep characters and a predictable course of events. But that\'s not the point here.The overall premise of this anime is to amaze you with amazing fights, with a badass style and great soundtracks, not with a great storyline and deep quotes.Afro Samurai is a 5 episode anime, produced by Studio Gonzo, with the collaboration of Samuel L. Jackson and OSTs by Wu-Tang Clan.Story 6/10I gave the story this score because it\'s really a poorly made story. It deals with a boy (Afro) who watched his father die. His father possessed the ""Number One"" headband, that it was...said it could grant godlike powers. The only way to obtain the ""Number One"" headband, is to defeat the wearer in a battle. However, the only one who can fight the Number 1 and claim his headband is the Number 2. Everyone can fight the Number 2, and after growing up, Afro is the current wearer of that headband. His only will is to defeat the one who killed his father. He\'s acting for revenge.The story is quite simple, but as I said, you shouldnt watch this anime for his story.Art 9/10If with ""Art"" you mean also the animations, then my score should be 10/10. Drawings really are amazing, starting from the main character\'s style and ending with every single enemy.Animations are next level, never seen such beautiful fighting scenes, the beauty behind every single hit is overwhelming.Sound 9/10Not only the osts fit perfectly with the anime style and fighting scenes, but also the sound fx were truly accurate.Characters 7/10Character\'s personalities aren\'t really original, i gave them 7 out of 10 because their desing were unique enough to let me love one of two of them (Jinno <3 )Enjoyment 10/10Although the story wasn\'t nothing great and character\'s personalities weren\'t nothing special, this anime managed to enjoy me a lot. The amazing combat scenes, the gory yet beautiful art style, the perfect OSTs, all of those features managed to let me love this 5 episodes anime, and give it an overall score of 9/10.So, if you wanna see amazing and well-done fights, and you can get over the plot, then you should definitely give this anime a try.As usual, English isn\'t my native language so sorry if you found any error. said it could grant godlike powers.

I'm not a fan of dubbed things, but I do love Samurai stories, plus, it's short so I thought it would be worth a short to just try it. I'm really glad I did.Story-6: The plot is fairly (very) straight-forward. If you're into revenge-based plots with a lot of gore, you'll enjoy this storyline. If you're looking for anything deeper, you should probably look elsewhere.Art-9: The art is gorgeous, very muted, stylistic, reminiscent of Boondocks and perfect for the show.Sound-7: I thought the dubbing was actually great, and the background music appropriate....There wasn't much special about the soundtrack though.Character-7: They were fairly flat, but I really enjoy backstories and this is chock-full of backstory. Also the guy that follows Afro around is pretty funny.Enjoyment-8: I'm picky about anime and I get bored often, but this one gripped me. I think it's because it's so short I didn't feel there was any filler that made the story drag, and I really appreciated that.

The storyline is very good although it is very short it was start to stop action all the way through. ', 'Man o man, when i heard that Samuel L. Jackson, one of the greatest black actors ive ever known, was going to dub a black samurai on a quest for revenge i was kinda iffy. I watched the first episode on Spike and i was actually impressed.Its a standard revenge setting. A boy loses his father and abandons all morale and morale (to an extent) to get back at the killer known as Justice. Its set in a feudal Japan type period but with the additions of modern day devices like cell phones and rpgs. Interesting twist. O and another note: this show is bloody!...if you\'ve seen other violent works such as berserk and elfen lied, then u should have some sort of idea of how things work. Not for the faint of heartThe dub is fantastic. Jackson, Kelly Hu, Yuri Lowenthal, Ron Perlman (just to name a few) give some awesome performances as the characters of this blood-soaked revenge story. Best of all IMO is Jackson\'s portrayal of Ninja Ninja. Kind of a throwback to his old Pulp Fiction roots only with a heavier dose of comedy and sarcasm. Another note: there are copious amounts of profanity in this show; most of them courtesy of Ninja Ninja lol so for those of you easily offended, steer clearWhile this is all well and good, my only real nitpick is that there was a certain lack of character development. Its all stuffed into 5 episodes and when u run that short, u sacrifice either story/characters or quality animation. In this case, its the former. If it only had a few more  episodes, this would truly be an epic story. I know theres a movie for it and theres most likely another series or movie but still it couldve been better. It probably had something to do with each episode being like over 1,000,000 dollars to produce lolOn the whole, Afro Samurai is a rich, deep show with lots of action, great music (courtesy of RZA), and much potential perfect for action/gore enthusiats. However if youre looking for character driven stories with little to no continuity issues, then u might wanna look elsewhere.

Can this five-part anime series prove to be a success?STORYThe story centers around a man named Afro (full points for originality there). The basic premise for the series is that, at a young age, Afro witnessed his father being killed (rather brutally) in front of him for a headband. This wasn\'t simply some stylish headband that people would (literally) kill for, it had a meaning. That meaning was that, whoever possessed the number 1 headband would, officially, be the number 1 assassin...in, urm, Japan I assume. Though this is set in a post apocalyptic world there is very little if any back story as to why the world is in such a bad state.After his father is killed the headband is taken by another man, Justice, who then tells Afro that, when he grows up, he can challenge him for it if he feels up to it. Suffice to say Afro trains for years and the series deals with his journey as he is finally ready and skilled enough to avenge his father.ARTPut simply it\'s stunning. There is, however, one warning: If you don\'t like gore this is definitely not the anime for you. One thing this anime can pride itself on is it\'s in-depth portrayal of blood and gore. The series in general is very stylized, it\'s all rather dark and the characters are all drawn in an odd-ish way, that lends to the show\'s character rather than making the people look weird. All in all it looks amazing.SOUNDThe sound for this anime is very much Western, having a heavy emphasis on hip-hop that the creator himself said he had a large interest in. The music for the series is all made and mixed by The RZA, former member of the Wuu Tang Klan, and it definitely brings some character into it. This doesn\'t mean, though, that the music is entirely Western. It also includes traditional Japanese music with instruments such as the shamisen and others making an appearance in the music, which is deftly made as a mixture of Western and Eastern.The voice acting is superb. There is, contrary to many people\'s belief, no actual Japanese track. This was originally made in the English language, as such many claims of it being ""a great dub"" are moot, as if there is, somewhere, a Japanese track then that would be the dub. The creator of the series said that he was a large fan of Samuel L. Jackson, and as such wanted him to voice Afro and his companion, Ninja Ninja. Though, despite such a stellar voice actor, Afro himself says very little. This is partly due to his mysterious character. Though this is all countered for by Ninja Ninja, his somewhat hyperactive companion, who essentially acts as Afro\'s inner thoughts spoken aloud.CHARACTERThe show has a very unique character. It brings with it a sense of the collision between East and West, with monks, shrine and traditional Japanese houses set to hip-hop, with many people wearing modern, Western clothing and the monks featured even speak like Christian preachers from the Deep South. All in all it\'s a character that hasn\'t been truly seen before in anime.ENJOYMENTAs stated above, if violence and gore isn\'t your thing stay away from this anime. However, if it is you\'ll truly get a kick out of how gruesome it can be, especially at certain times.OVERALLOverall if you\'re looking for a chilled-out, peaceful, happy anime then go elsewhere. If you\'re looking for a well-made world with genuinely interesting characters, even if it\'s all slightly depressing, and some non-stop action and a rather interesting story then Afro Samurai is a must. Plus, in total, it\'ll take you about 2 hours to watch, so even if you\'re not sure, watch at least one episode and see how you feel. Personally speaking I give it a 10/10. in, urm, Japan I assume.

The action was outstanding. The fights were easy to follow and beautifully animated. The story around the fights never dragged, never got boring. The music was fantastic; fit the mood perfectly and was just a pleasure to listen to. With 5 episodes, you'd think the characters would either have little to no personality or have an incredibly rushed back story. Nope. The animation is some of the best...I've seen period. It just had this flow to it that I have never seen anywhere else. The style was quite different from the usual anime as well. All in all, this is perfection; a must see. I've seen period. It just had this flow to it that I have never seen anywhere else. The style was quite different from the usual anime as well. All in all, this is perfection; a must see."", 'Going into this show, I thought it was going to be much like Samurai Champloo with rap and hip hop during the Edo period of time. I was definitely mistaken by that idea as this seems to be set in a post apocalyptic world where both technology and samurai values are intermixed. This follows a black samurai as he seeks revenge for his father’s murder. Sadly, there is a lot of stereotypical depictions of black people as almost all of them have Afros and and the ninja that follows him talks in a rather gangster style.I feel rather odd watching this seeing as how...it should be feudal Japan in look and feel, yet not at the same time. It throws me off when just as I get comfortable in my surroundings, I see a large robot or something off in the background, people have flip phones(why they have flip phones is another question I would love to be answered), and even one character fights with a RPG for crying out loud! I guess it would explain why there are so many different people with different styles of fighting, some with guns and others with swords, but here is the small problem. They talk about how the legendary headband is supposed to be worn by a great warrior, but what honor of a warrior do you have when your shooting RPGs at someone with just a katana? Answer; there really is no honor I think. People want to become the ‘god’ or ‘number one’ by any means necessary and for some reason, which means that they will do anything at all to get number two. Why not just go after number one if they are going to do cheater moves like that?Shall we talk about the Characters now? There are not very many to talk about as there are really only 2 main characters and a lot of side characters to go through. We will start with Afro, the silent strong type. Alright, so this isn’t a dating sim but he really is very quite. When we get some backstory on Afro, it shows that he was a very silent child as well; he only spoke when he actually wanted to. There really is not much about him except he is a skilled samurai and he is a very silent and caring person when he gets a chance to relax which is not many times.Now talking about him, I also have to talk about Ninja (they really don’t give him an actual name). There are many things you can debate about this character. Some may call him a different character, following Afro around and watching from the sidelines in order to see where his story will play out. I like the later idea that he is sort of the Hyde to Afro’s Jekyll. He is overly loud and talks with a lot of slang, not really what you would expect of a ninja. The only thing that links him as a ninja is how extremely agile he is and how other people never seem to end up seeing him or acknowledging he exists. The reason I think that he is actually in his mind is because even when he is loud, no one acknowledge him. He is never in any danger while hanging around Afro like everyone else. Ninja seems to be the one that pretty much says anything that Afro will not say himself, whatever he actually thinks or doubts. Of course, Afro doesn’t really listen to him, telling him to shut up sometimes like what some people would do if the little voice in their head is trying to tell them something that they don’t like. I also think in a way, he may be the only one keeping Afro sane to a point where he keeps going on no matter the cost. Ninja also seems to be the comedy that brakes up what would be a very dull or boring anime sometimes during the standby phases.The only other characters that seem to be a main staple of this show are the odd monks who keep calling each other brother. They are monks but each one has a different virtue to them like one would always be shown with headphones, the leader would have women with him all the time and so on. They talk like a stereotypical black priest with a lot of soul in their voice but in actuality, they are pretty much very white with strange heads. I guess you could call them whites who want to be black in a way… not that I have any problem with that. That’s just the stereotype that I see here.The art style is really high detailed and can be very beautiful in this sort of abstract way. Gonzo was the studio that drew it and it shows as many of the tropes that they are known for show in this. Sometimes there is awesome artwork that is high detailed and fluid, and then there are a couple movements that I would consider the runny egg design. The later is not enough that it would harm the show. The movement of the characters is so fast that you can’t really tell if the characters are keeping proportions but I do notice that there are some times Afro’s Afro and some of the fabric that trails off in the wind changes size. It is also very dark, making it sometimes hard to see what is going on; a lot of it is thrown into shadows near dusk or at night.Some of the voice actors are pretty good in the English dub (Couldn’t find the Japanese dub) and then some of them feel very out of place. It’s hard to say anything about Afro since he doesn’t talk very often, although when he does speak, it’s to the point and rather good. I actually liked the idea of Samuel L. Jackson (yes, The Samuel L. Jackson) playing him even if his voice seems a tad to deep once in a while. On the other side, Ninja is a rather interesting voice, also done by Samuel as well which adds to the point I made before about him being the Hyde to Afro’s Jekyll. It surprises me that Samuel was able to play both characters rather well even if they have different personalities. The monks caught me off a bit when they first started talking and even after they just didn’t feel like they fit in all the way. The background characters are really forgettable in voice and in character personality. The music is actually pretty good with a little bit of hip hop feel in the opening and closing song. The rest of the music though is always in the background and don’t really stand out. Lots of times, you can barely hear it over the sound of the wind and fights.While I wasn’t really into this show, it does have some interesting aspects to the ideas and concept.

I feel like it was rushed too, especially since it is 5 episodes long.Thanks for reading! :D"", ""Man, this anime shouldn't be as underwhelming as it turned out to be. You got medieval japan with sci-fi elements like robots, cyborgs, guns, cell phones and other technology and then you got a cool ass no-nonsense samurai at the center of the story just marching forward to slice people up until he can reach demonic looking cowboy and kill him. It sounds cool and many people probably think it is but I was bored thanks to how badly it all fits together.One thing to note before getting into the story is that it's extremely simple. It's a straightforward revenge plot with common revenge plot...themes and elements that goes through average action movie progression of fighting stronger and stronger foes until reaching target at the very end. It's also about 2 hours long so you'd expect that story being as simple as it is would be given less of a focus to give way for the real attraction - action. However it's not so, the pacing of the show is quite horrible so a lot of the time is spent on contemplative walks that don't add anything, drawn out backstory or long scenes of villains talking about their plans to bring down Afro. Then you get a short fight and the whole thing repeats.The fights are while generally well animated are a mixed bag when it comes to choreography, hardly any of them aside from maybe Justice fights are really memorable with only a few truly impressive moments sprinkled throughout. On top of that it's all brought down by the show's lacking visuals. To put it simply I think the original doujin/manga artist, Takashi Okazaki, designed some very unique, interesting and good looking designs but the way they transitioned to anime leaves a lot to be desired. Show's a gray, bland, muddy mess without anything impressive in terms of directing so it just undermines the whole art style. I feel like the show would be a lot better if went with the crisp, high contrast aesthetic a lot of Takeshi Koike works have.Lastly sound which also unfortunately was a disappointment. RZA is credited for music which at first got me excited, I don't know much about his solo work but I've listened to WTC before and liked. Don't expect anything out of that however since the hip-hop beats are not only scarce most of them are far too basic and don't even fit what's happening on screen half the time. If you want a samurai anime with hip-hop aesthetic turn to Samurai Champloo instead cause score from Nujabes and Fat Jon are infinitely better.Sound effects on the other hand were pretty good I thought. The sound of Afro cutting through people, sword clangs, the weird distorted voices of the ninja robots, footsteps, and other sounds were largely satisfying or interesting. In particular I thought the sound work for the robo-afro was good enough to make him seem more than just a generic robot.Also english dub is about as bad as I think most would expect out of anime but Samuel L Jackson did a surprisingly decent work, especially with Ninja Ninja, out of entire cast his scripts and delivery felt natural.That's about it. If you want a good, stylish action movie you're better off with anything Koike made. If you want Samurais, Champloo and Sword of the Stranger seems like a better choice. Afro Samurai itself it rather average and easily forgettable. themes and elements that goes through average action movie progression of fighting stronger and stronger foes until reaching target at the very end. It's also about 2 hours long so you'd expect that story being as simple as it is would be given less of a focus to give way for the real attraction - action. However it's not so, the pacing of the show is quite horrible so a lot of the time is spent on contemplative walks that don't add anything, drawn out backstory or long scenes of villains talking about their plans to bring down Afro. Then you get a short fight and the whole thing repeats.The fights are while generally well animated are a mixed bag when it comes to choreography, hardly any of them aside from maybe Justice fights are really memorable with only a few truly impressive moments sprinkled throughout. On top of that it's all brought down by the show's lacking visuals. To put it simply I think the original doujin/manga artist, Takashi Okazaki, designed some very unique, interesting and good looking designs but the way they transitioned to anime leaves a lot to be desired. Show's a gray, bland, muddy mess without anything impressive in terms of directing so it just undermines the whole art style. I feel like the show would be a lot better if went with the crisp, high contrast aesthetic a lot of Takeshi Koike works have.Lastly sound which also unfortunately was a disappointment. RZA is credited for music which at first got me excited, I don't know much about his solo work but I've listened to WTC before and liked. Don't expect anything out of that however since the hip-hop beats are not only scarce most of them are far too basic and don't even fit what's happening on screen half the time.

Something driven by nothing but pure instinct. Imagine it yourself rookie. You’re in the trenches laying in magazine after magazine into something, or someone, that does not falter the same way you do. Something that doesn’t care about strategic gain, and is just as satisfied and compelled to ravage itself than to specifically target you. Something that uses heavy weaponry and or artillery without any regard whatsoever to its own allies in the blast radius. Fending off an assault from them can seem bordering futile, all the...strength you and your allies can muster does nothing but devolve into a battle of grinding attrition. A slow chipping away of morale and sanity as one by one you watch your comrades fall to the overwhelming tide, worst of all - any successful defense against them only embolsters and urges them to try again harder. There is no sleep. There is no remorse. Only a relentless swarm of the enemy, and their dark laughter even miles away from them echoing in your ears. You’re faced with the question of: “How do you stop, and analyze something that defies all logic and reasoning?”Afro Samurai - is that something.Trying to get a solid, firm and mental grasp around this show will do nothing but agonize you more and more, and eventually it will either force you to submit to its madness, or you’ll simply give up. Either way, it’s going to win. We all know there are shows where you just need to: “Turn your brain off”, fine, understandable, even so, Afro Samurai stands out due to never being concerned about the story as more than a prop to get you to the next action scene, and it doesn’t admit this - it loves and relishes it. Simply beginning how to break it down on a logistical level will give you a a migraine. So, what are you supposed to think of it? What are you supposed to make of it? I don’t think that was a concern from the producers in the slightest, this is almost like a show made for one’s personal deliverance. I guess… this is usually the part where I try to explain stuff. O.oYoung boy who watched his father die grew up, became a samurai, and wants vengeance - done. . . . what? You know there’s nothing else to it. Fine, I’ll get serious.Afro Samurai’s lead, voiced by the oh-so-bombastic Samuel L. Jackson, who is named. . . Afro, isn’t exactly a character as much as he is a stagnant concept and caricature for the story to continue its pace, rather, to string itself along to the next fight scene. If I had to say anything about our protagonist it’s that despite being as bland as wonderbread he does have an air of charisma, no doubt due to the VA himself voicing him that will make you not exactly root for him,  you know he’ll win every encounter, but become enthralled into what creative way he will discover to defeat his next opponent. Strategy is not a thing employed too well in the series itself but the jaw-dropping acrobatics and animation used do make a joy for the eyes to gander at. I never cared for him or his goals, but he did keep me going along the way which to be fair deserves a slight bit of praise as, in the hands of a less competent-catharsis would be a horrible and numbing experience, there are seldom worst fates than a protagonist being someone who is unfavorable to watch.The supporting cast, what little there were, are somewhat entertaining if not and once again only due to the voice acting in the English dub - with another character who of course is also voiced by Sammy himself. Otherwise, Jinno if not typical was a decently interesting concept that at times I nearly wanted to see more of than Afro and was the only bit of true pathos the show could siphon from me in this flick - I say “flick” because the pacing at times is so breakneck it can feel like a western Hollywood blockbuster, either that or an arcade game. Only sad that there is no music as catchy as those found in arcade games, pardon if I don't give the OST much of an eye, but there's piss-poor to talk about, some cliche Japanese strings here, a decent foot-stomper when Afro rushes into battle, nothing you'll listen to by itself.Also, while this was done by studio Gonzo let me assure you - this is NOT Gonzo - this is Gonzo when they actually care/have money. One of the studios I am fascinated with the most because their works either rival madhouse or might as well move at one fps. They have done an amazing job putting Sammy’s vision to work, he forked up some big-money for them to get off their arses and put their hidden talent to use. The animation is consistently arousing in every action scene on screen, though with a keen eye you will notice that on occasion not just the designs in the distance, but the backgrounds themselves can begin to show their rushed-job if you’re paying close attention, then again who is from the pretty fair lighting used along with some intimate camera-angles when the scenes really start to get gory. Speaking of which when blood does spill it’s, promise, not a psychopath - majestic to see explode into the air and land gracefully on the ground.It’s extremely obvious that the aesthetic was lifted from western action shows that themselves were inspired by Japanese animation, such as Samurai Jack and Avatar: The Last Airbender, and it rides this aesthetic till the wheels fall off, its dedication to the craft while something you may be tempted to look over, does garner at least a fair bit of respect, the amount of detail put into capturing adult, western animation is astounding if you grew up with them (past your bedtime) like me.The antagonist of the show is about as depth-filled as Afro, that is to say not very much, but also has a pretty damn good voice actor too and you got me - I was at least curious to see how Afro’s final confrontation from them would play out from a story perspective rather than a battle one, which is something I thought would never happen, the two do not share a good, if any dynamic at all, but from the show’s narrative perspective these are two titans clashing, do you actually feel anything when they fight? Hell no but it's one of the best fight scenes of the 2000’s when it comes up, seriously, this is what Hellsing 2001 COULD have looked like if they just had some extra dough.By the end of Afro Samurai, what do you exactly gain? It’s certainly not a waste of time, but also not something to make fun of and laugh at ironically.` I was absolutely entertained during my time watching it, but I can’t help but make the comparison of eating mountains of candy. It was a hell of a ride, and you would do it again another time, but you’re left rather empty when the high calms down. Do you regret your decision? I wouldn’t say so at the time, and you had some fun looking back on it after it's over. It’s such a nebulous thing to break down because the show’s primary audience, no kidding, was for Sammy himself, which confirms my statement at the start that this was his own catharsis. We weren’t meant to view or care about the show like a traditional work of narrative and structural art, regardless of it possibly appearing otherwise due to this having a three-act-structure. Its only concern is having a good time - with itself. But you know what? It never lied and tried to tell me otherwise unlike many other works of benighted talent in this medium. Should you watch it? Why not.

You could say I recommend this."", ""Ahhh my first gateway Anime, i remember back when i would stay up all night, drink too much soda, listen to Wu-Tang and watch Afro Samurai. With its main character, title and ost, it's very easy to see this show’s western appeal even getting Sam Jackson! This was a very easy sell to me. It was the same year I learned who RZA was, I watched this show and you cannot separate  the two. For RZA’s music sets the tone for everything this embodies, over the top blaxploitation kung-fu samurai action, even if this lacks some of the charm compared to its musical equivalent....Story and Character: 5The story is painfully average, while many old school kung-fu movies have a light hearted cheesiness to them, this anime takes itself seriously. Even as a generic anime revenge story this falls flat. Afro himself is a block of wood, his sidekick Ninja Ninja is annoying and everyone else is just archetypes. Villians, babes and ex friends, all equally as forgettable if not for their imagery. The story starts strongly enough but fizzles quickly with a very anti climatic end and an underwhelming cliffhanger.Art: 7.5This show has some pretty decent animation, many fights are fluid and impactful. Acrobatics are easy to follow and the hits have weight, making fight scenes easy to watch and enjoy. A particular standout is a fight that sends our main character in the air, battling a robotic version of himself, fighting while he descends at rapid speeds. I like many of the character designs whether it may be the main character's fly afro, the designs of the android henchman or striking Bear-faced antagonist Kuma, character designs stuck with me even though the characters themselves were forgettable. My biggest complaint is the lack of color as the show can look very bland, with a dark grey palette.Sound and music: 9Not much to say for the anime itself, everything makes sense and the voice acting is well done but the soundtrack is excellent. A nice mix of R&B and Hip Hop. I’ve listened to the album outside the anime and if you love Rza production or R&B, i suggest giving it a listen.Enjoyment and Overall: 6The anime is very short and doesn't wear out its welcome too much but i can’t rate it more than above average as there just isn't much here. It’s enjoyable enough for what it is, nothing exceptional and if you're not really into blaxploitation or hip hop this probably wont be for you but if it’s something you’ve been meaning to watch i’d give it a try.

There is little character development and the assumed pay-off of this short adventure feels less epic and exciting than the writers intended I believe.As I finished the show, I felt that 5 episodes was too consice to fulfill the potential the series had. Music by RZA was a nice touch, and a...longer series or run time would do this series justice. longer series or run time would do this series justice.', ""Story 8: The story as expressed in Afro Samurai follows a semi-episodic formula, across its 5 episode arch, as each episode has a somewhat independent plot to it. However, Afro has taken note from some of the better episodic series of its predecessor, and instead of forcing an over all plot to be formed, the writers used this formula to make each episode in some way relate to our protagonist's past or over all development as a person. Each episode has a pretty long run time, being roughly an hour, but they pace it out so that you are glued every second, which is surprising...when looking back at it, as each episode is filled with long periods of inactivity, which instead of becoming dull were, for me at least, the best part of the show, as it was used for characterization, proper set up of a climax, and the building of tension. The only complaint I can give is that the series, due to its own formula doesnt exactly end, instead leaving it on a cliff hanger, and while it is a satisfying one, its still a cliff hanger.Art 10: The art of Afro Samurai can only be described as excellently bizarre, being a cross between western and eastern styles which just makes every image ooze style. It almost looks like a cross between a dark horse comic and a studio trigger production. I have absolutely no complaints for the animation, the fight choreography is spot on and never fails to impress, the sets are well designed and interesting, the character's designs are both disturbing and well fitted to the world they inhabit creating an excellent dichotomy of insane surrealism that just permeates every episode.Sound 8: The sound design is surprisingly subtle (besides the pretty good op), as the sound design is at its best when its in mid combat, each clang of the blade, each step the character's take, each breath of the wind, its made to be feel so natural that when they kick the music, or the explosives go off the impact hits you all the harder, and i love it. The only complaint I have is that it can be a bit too bombastic at times, but otherwise its excellent.Character 7: The character's of Afro are featured in a villain of the week formula, and as such dont really have much development beyond their relation to our protag, and that is a bit of a shame as some of them have huge potential to be quite interesting on their own. However, Afro himself is a pretty good character, but that has to do less with his actual personality or personal traits, but more to do with how they express his character and lead his growth in the series. The way they write each scene allows us to feel for this man in a way that most anime (or artistic mediums in general) fail to do, because he grows in proportion to the escalation of the series, and in turn this growth feels human and natural. Its quite an achievement on the writer's part that they were able to give this, would be angry plank of wood, a well rounded and interesting personality.Enjoyment 8: Afro is just a very good time over all. From the solid action, excellent animation to its unique uses of both western and eastern tropes, this series is excellent for both anime and western film fans. The gore is vsceral, yet not over bearing, the characters are interesting yet not clamoring for screen time, and the plot is easily accessible, yet doesnt feel shallow, its a series that is just built from every angle to be an enjoyable ride. However...looking for deeper meaning is probably not a good idea, beyond our protagonist's growth and journey of self reflection there isnt much to dwell on.Overall 8: Let this be my only warning, if you are younger than 16, you should not watch this. The series features sex, extreme violence, themes of suicide and depression, and is clearly made for adults. That said, for the rest of you, if you arent bothered by any of the previously listed aspects, then prepare for a thrill fest the likes you probably wont find elsewhere....Oh, one last....thing, Samuel Jackson is a voice actor for this series, and yes, his voice is like sunshine syrup on a pancake dream. when looking back at it, as each episode is filled with long periods of inactivity, which instead of becoming dull were, for me at least, the best part of the show, as it was used for characterization, proper set up of a climax, and the building of tension.

The action is fluid and fast paced. It's just all around fun to watch. Good popcorn action.But for me a lot of it was way over the top.

It's five episodes and absolutely worth the time."", 'STORYIt’s just a generic action flick about someone wanting to avenge his father’s killer, the holder of the No.1 headband. Because he is wearing the No.2 headband, he is targeted by all those who want to make a name for themselves… And that’s pretty much it. Nobody was watching it for the plot, anyways.CAST- Afro is another cool dude, ultra-powerful no matter what his opponent may be. He doesn’t talk much and doesn’t care about anyone else other than himself. He never tries to reason with someone and simply solves all his problems with brainless violence, making him distant.- There is a sexy woman in...the story, supposed to soften his heart. She is there to show him that happiness doesn’t involve killing a dozen people every day. But her contribution is hardly felt and in reality she’s just there for fan service.- There is this funny imaginary guy that follows Afro everywhere. In a way, he is Afro’s inner voice of reason, and is supposed to question his motives of revenge. Again, his words are wasted on “I don’t care what you say” Afro and he becomes the comic relief in the story.- The bad guys are typical insane megalomaniacs that engage with an obviously superior opponent but are too stupid to realize that they can’t win. The only thing they care about is wasting their lives on becoming the No.2 in the world. Why? So murderers like themselves will target them for the rest of their lives. What the hell are they thinking? They can be much better off as Afro’s lap dogs.So yeah not much to praise when it comes to the characters.PRODUCTION VALUESThe artwork is weird. Rough edges and as black palette colors as the samurai’s race. Kinda like a dark-themed American graphic novel, it makes it stand out compared to generic shonen and so-cute-that-you-want-to-puke moecrap.Action scenes get all the focus. Animation and sound effects are detailed and flashy albeit improbable in physics. Villains with cool gadgets and an insane look will engage the grimace-less Afro in faster-than-sound speeds. The speed of the battles is extremely high and has no intervals. Swords versus rocket launchers and laser guns may sound ridiculous to go up against each other but then again Hollywood is famous just for being extravagant. And this series tries to follow Hollywood’s footsteps.There is apparently a lot of air in the world of the series, as a breeze seems to run through everything and makes headbands, coats and hats to flap endlessly. This gives a non-stop movement to even stale images. You could even say that the breeze is in fact the strength of the characters’ resolve and lust for power! … Or just hot air coming out of those airheads… Whatever it is, it makes everyone a lot cooler and imposing.The “air effect” also causes a lot of dust. As an optical trick, every action lifts considerable amounts of dust, giving the feeling that the characters are not fighting in a static image, called the background. It also helps to hide the outcome of every attack for dramatic effect although that means you never really see the finishing blow.Music themes are a combination of rap and techno, appealing to African Americans instead of being some J-pop nonsense. They fit in a story that has a black man as a protagonist, voiced by Samuel efing Jackson. Cursing included.LEGACYAfro Samurai was standing out for three things. The first being the only anime with a black samurai protagonist, something which no longer applies after Netflix made the Yasuke series. The second thing was the very cool action scenes regarding sword fighting. That also doesn’t matter once shows like Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen came out. That leaves us with the third thing, the protagonist being voiced by Samuel efing Jackson.P.S. This series reminded me of the song Dust In The Wind, performed by Kansas. It is full of dust and air.

Guy wants to be the best, then becomes the best. It completely lacks any story and this should be obvious from the fact there is only 5 episodes. It gained lots of popularity from the fact it was written and voiced bu Samuel L. Jackson.To then release a squeal movie makes no sense. Make a half season of anime if you have to wait for source material then wait. The lack of content to immerse you into the anime is where this anime falls short by a long shot.Jackson is good don't get me wrong but maybe...writing anime isn't the best idea for him. You may say you can't compare it cause it isn't anime, well it is animated by studio Gonzo, who made Full Metal Panic and Hellsing.Also there is only English dub. There is no Japanese with subtitles but why would you watch it with subs if all it's going for it is the voice actingStory, there isn't one 3/10I did quite like the Art style but it wasn't anything special, the backdrops where kinda of bland and it didn't do much for story building 5/10I don't even remember the Music so I'm going to say it had 0 impact on me, the Sound bonus is the voice acting 6/10Characters are kinda just there in the show no time development or to learn about them 4/10Best bit? Quick to watch cause there is only 5 episodes so you don't waste too much time. Enjoyment? 4/10Overall for an anime with no story or in-depth characters with mediocre everything else don't be surprised 4/10 writing anime isn't the best idea for him.

The very epic fight scenes and the dark atmosphere gave me goosebumps while watching it. The main character's tragic past and it makes him stronger day by day really excited me to watch it. I also really like all the character designs in this anime, all of them seem manly and violent. But from episode to episode the story is getting more and more off in the wrong direction I don't know what it would be like in the comics but the storyline is so directionless entering the final episode....Starting from the main goal the main character is no longer seen, and the side story of the supporting character that many leave behind makes me have a less pleasant impression of this anime. Starting from the main goal the main character is no longer seen, and the side story of the supporting character that many leave behind makes me have a less pleasant impression of this anime."", 'While it\'s decidedly not for children, AFRO SAMURAI is surprisingly well made. Its primary strength is in its art, which is lush and detailed. Many critics have argued that the story is somewhat generic, which is probably true. But fans of anime and martial arts likely won\'t be swayed by such concerns.I\'m sure a lot of people were involved in making Afro Samurai but I cannot discuss this show without mentioning the Wu-Tang Clan. It was an iconic rap group that dominated the 1990s, a team of seven members who served different roles in making the Wu-Tang what it was. Inspectah Deck introduced a philosophical...feel to each song with his introspective rhymes, Method Man was the most popular member of the group with his infectious charisma, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah brought their Mafioso ideas into the Wu, Ol\' Dirty B*stard injected his eccentric style of silliness into each song, GZA was among the greatest lyricists of them all, and RZA was the Wu-Tang\'s leader/producer. These seven rappers (along with an army of Wu-Tang wannabes, including Killah Priest, Masta Killa, and Cappadonna) created many popular albums in the \'90s, including three hip-hop classics (36 Chambers, Liquid Swords, and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx) before Ol\' Dirty died in 2004. After Ol\' Dirt McGirt passed away, the Wu-Tang weren\'t the same, spewing out a few good but ultimately forgettable albums. They needed a spark, something that would help them bring great music back to hip-hop and keep them relevant, and that spark turned out to be\x85 Afro Samurai.This 5-episode anime was perfect for the Wu-Tang, combining rap and a love for martial arts into one, and this is why RZA, my favorite member of the bunch, created this show\'s soundtrack. Afro Samurai is about a swordsman who witnessed his father\'s murder as a young boy and his blood-filled journey to exact revenge on the gunman who killed his dad. Before I became a fan of the Wu-Tang, before I watched a lot of anime, I checked out Afro Samurai with my little brother a couple of years back on Netflix and saw everything except for the last episode. At the time, I thought it was an excellent anime that could be improved, rating it a 7 out of 10. A few weeks ago, I decided to re-watch Afro Samurai to see if I still hold the same opinion of this show that I had before.Some theme songs are colorful and extravagant while others are complex and emotional. ""Brief"" is the first word I would use to describe the Afro Samurai opening, along with ""disappointing"" and ""visually unappealing"". Now you\'re probably saying ""Okay, well the theme song sucks. Anything good about this show?"" Like I said before, RZA created this anime\'s soundtrack and, of course, it\'s amazing, perfectly complementing each scene with a grimy, edgy mood (There\'s this one song, Stone Mecca\'s ""A Walk"", on the soundtrack that\'s definitely worth listening to). The acting in Afro Samurai is simply fantastic mainly because a handful of great American-based actors and actresses were brought to the fold; Ron Perlman, known for his work in Titan A.E., was the voice of Justice, Afro Samurai\'s chief antagonist, while Kelly Hu, who appeared in X-Men 2, served as the voice of Okiku, the seductress/spy for an evil organization, and the famed Samuel L. Jackson starred as both Afro and Afro\'s companion Ninja Ninja (Even Steve Blum and Liam O\'Brien, giants in the world of anime voice acting, hung around as a random swordsman or two). Oh yeah, and there\'s an African-American protagonist here (a first for anime titles) as well as a couple of other black characters too (Always a thumbs-up for me). These are all the positive traits that I could find here.Afro is the titular character of this anime, and he\'s one of those quiet types. He\'s a lonely swordsman marked by trauma and frustration whom the show portrays as a figure deserving sympathy, but Afro simply comes across as uninteresting. Through Afro\'s quest in ancient Japan with robots and rocket launchers, other characters are introduced. Justice is the pale-skinned gunslinger/philosopher with a decent amount of depth but not enough to be particularly memorable. Ninja Ninja is my favorite, Afro\'s much-more-talkative sidekick who wittily comments on what he observes and gives unwanted advice to our protagonist. Along with Justice, other villains are after Afro\'s head such as Afro Droid (the producers are real imaginative with their character names, aren\'t they?) and the Empty Seven (reminds me of a group of seven rap figures that I mentioned before), but the true standout of them all is Jinno. The embodiment of fury, he is a man confined to a bear-like robotic armor who wields two blood-stained swords and is determined to slay the swordsman he once called his friend. Sadly, not even Jinno could save Afro Samurai from itself.""This cannot be the entire series."" This was the first thought that crossed my mind upon completing Afro Samurai. The over- the-top fight scenes and general lack of characterization could be forgiven but the head-scratching ending about non-violence really frustrated me. Afro Samurai doesn\'t deserve to be labeled a series; it\'s a barely above-average 5-episode bloodfest of an OVA with plot holes aplenty that fails to be seen as a serious title. It\'s one of the classic examples of a ""turn-your-brain-off"" show, the kind that action fanatics enjoy without thinking about aspects that really solidifies and legitimizes a series. You could call Afro Samurai overrated but I\'m disappointed because I expected something better from an anime associated with the Wu-Tang Clan. feel to each song with his introspective rhymes, Method Man was the most popular member of the group with his infectious charisma, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah brought their Mafioso ideas into the Wu, Ol\' Dirty B*stard injected his eccentric style of silliness into each song, GZA was among the greatest lyricists of them all, and RZA was the Wu-Tang\'s leader/producer.

I felt this was an articulated series for being only 5 episodes, perfect for my short attention span to repetitive fighting (because there aren\'t many story elements that contribute to an interesting narrative in the current day of the series if you take out the flashbacks*)Story:Afro Samurai had an emotive story line from the beginning, similar to ""Dororo 2019"" and ""Demon Slayer"" where...a pivotal event happens in the beginning that fuels the main character forward in their quest for vengeance/revenge/remedy etc. but the fact that not all details are blatantly given away in the first episode of 5 episodes makes this more appealing for short term viewers. I\'d say Afro Samurai beats Demon Slayer by far and is more on part with Dororo\'s story despite being a 19 episode difference. However, there is a reason why the narrative of Afro Samurai has been carefully crafted for 5 episodes, I view it more as being more resourceful and generous to the story leaving out non canon/filler content. Overall, I enjoyed the story fairly well, it wasn\'t too transformative but it did hold its weight against larger budget titles, and for that I will be rating it 8/10Art & Sound:While watching Afro Samurai, I couldn\'t shake off the idea of how the art style mimics the western cartoon series ""The Boondocks"". The art style of Afro Samurai includes over-expressed facial features, most commonly the facial hair (beard/eye brows) of the characters and diverse character figures. Afro, being the main character is no exception as his free flowing \'afro\' and facial structure are a major contribution to this western cartoon art style. Nonetheless, it is more refreshing to view diverse approaches to art styles rather than the same plain modern-eastern high school art style.

He trains and becomes stronger to the point where he is one of the best swordsmen around. Now then my only problem with the plot is that it’s somewhat generic. It’s literally a revenge plot and We’ve pretty much seen this in Shounen and Seinen time and time again, so not the most original story plot ever. And yet the added plot of the Samurai Ranking Bands is interesting.Art: The art style is nice, especially with all the gore and colors. The art style reminds of the...same art style from Samurai Champloo and Ofc both anime share many similarities which should be obvious. In the Directors Cut the art looks much better and The censoring is gone.Sound: The sound is based around what seems like LoFi Hip Pop and Conscious Rap Music and That is pretty enjoyable seeing that most people who watch anime love Rap music. It goes well with the anime itself and That it makes the anime more enjoyable. Simply put “ The Music Vibes Well With The Anime “Character Development:Now then the character development is alright for five episodes, but This wasn’t a series based around OVA’s either, so it leaves disappointment to those who wanted more from Afro Samurai, but Didn’t get much aside from a Movie based on the anime itself. We see little to no development from Afro himself as well as the side characters.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the anime regardless of how short it was. I enjoyed the Directors cut much more compared to the T.V version which is why I recommend buying the directors cut when you get the chance. The art is much more defined, The language isn’t censored, and The change is much needed honestly. I loved the Hip Pop playing within the anime and Even though character development wasn’t much, it’s a five episode anime with a movie....

The artsstyle is kind of grindy but feels smooth with the movement of the characters. The sound design (both ambient, soundtrack, sound FX etc.) are absolutely amazing and makes up for the lack of storyotherwise...its a very good anime that can be watched in one sitting so it isnt a tedious process having to watch 50-150 episodes to get to some form of climax its a very good anime that can be watched in one sitting so it isnt a tedious process having to watch 50-150 episodes to get to some form of climax', ""For an anime named Afro Samurai it really is what the name tells it to be. It's a flashy sword fight extravaganza with some not that well developed characters and, to put it bluntly, a bland cliche story.The story follows a very cookiecutter shounen storyline with the main theme being that of redemption. The best part of the anime hands down is the animation. Fight scenes make it feel like the swords really have weight to them but at the same time they look to be as light as paper to the characters wielding them. The movement of the characters is fluid and well...animated and as such quite pleasing to watch.If you're searching for a deep story driven anime that takes it time to develop the characters, world build and immerse you in its plot, move along because this isn't that kind of anime.

I've seen it four times already ,i always enjoyed it but Movie version is better because i dont have to get up from my bed to start another episode ,it's smootherPROS : +Good soundtrack+Samuel+Good fight choreography+Nice environmentCONS: -Weak story-Supprting characters are kinda bland-English desing is Jinno’s.

The sounds and music in this show were amazing. The RZA combined Hip-Hop and Japanese music into one and it turned out perfectly. The Art in this show is incredible. I own it in Blu-ray so watching this in HD you really see all the details that went into making this show. I love how it is only 5 episodes long. Plus it is only season one so there is more Afro to come.  I find that most places I look people are saying this is a really well dubbed Anime. Ranivus...even stated that it is one of the best dubbed version of a show he has seen. The show was done in English first. I have no idea if they have made a Japanese version of the show yet though. Most of the animation for the characters mouths were done in America because while speaking english you move your mouth  more and make way different gestures than when speaking Japanese. even stated that it is one of the best dubbed version of a show he has seen.

Undeniably, it sounds like an interesting project, but one that I didn't really trust. An anime with Samuel Jackson in the starring lead role, a soundtrack produced by the RZA, a legendary hip hop producer, and the villain is voiced by Hellboy himself, Ron freaking Perlman? I hate to gush, but it sounds like it should be the greatest experiment in anime history on paper. Unfortunately, and sadly, not to my surprise, it's nothing special. It also suffers...from an extremely fatal flaw of attempting many things that Samurai Champloo does, but comes nowhere close to it's quality.Story - 6/10Afro (that's the main character's name, I'm not kidding) was the son of the number one ranked killer in the world. We know this because his father wears a headband with number 1 on it in the opening prologue of the show. If you're thinking it gets more complex than headbands, it does, but not by much. See, number one can only be challenged by the one with the number two headband, but the number two headband can be challenged by anyone. As a boy, Afro saw his father die at the hands of Justice, a deliciously evil villain that I wish had more time during the course of the show's petit five episode run. Afro decides to take the number two headband and go on a crash course to grow up and exact revenge on Justice, who sees himself as the god of this world. The plot is as basic as it gets, with one interesting twist that develops during the last two episodes. Even though you will get some backstory on Afro and a few other characters, it never seems to greatly enhance him as a lead or make the journey much more engaging.Animation - 8/10Afro Samurai is a very good looker. The style of character design isn't one I'm personally fond of but it would be a lie to say that the level of detail doesn't capture facial expressions very well. The opening moments of the show put things like clothes blowing in the wind or smoke billowing out of nostrils on full display and it looks very well done. There is fluid animation all over, with grand fight scenes that occur in alarming number per episode. The only thing I can knock the animation for is colors, which tend to be very dry and muted too often. Very often, it feels like the anime is in black and white.Sound - 9/10RZA's hip hop soundtrack makes an astounding marriage to the samurai culture here. There's a large variety of beats and the arrangement never tries to reuse anything. This is very reminiscent to RZA's work on Tarantino's Kill Bill, but not quite on that level of quality. Voice acting is decent, but many of the voices do seem over the top and exaggerated with weird accents.Characters - 6/10Afro is your generic silent badass, his sidekick (also voiced by Jackson) serves as the main mouthpiece and humor during the show. Though, this is the kind of street lingo humor that isn't going to appeal to everyone and will come off annoying to some. The rest of the cast is pretty basic, only serving as foes standing in Afro's way. There was a female character by the name of Okiku that posed as a possible love interest for Afro, but the show pretty much dismisses this possibility as soon as it presents it. The bottom line here is that your main character is a dull lead, ditching words in favor of looking cool. In that respect it works, but it also shows that the lack of depth is not limited to story.Overall - 7/10Afro Samurai is so short that it's kind of worth checking out if what you're looking for is visceral action and over the top violence. There are epic fights all over the series and while it's simple and predictable, it clearly succeeds at being an action anime that does the action like few others. from an extremely fatal flaw of attempting many things that Samurai Champloo does, but comes nowhere close to it's quality.Story - 6/10Afro (that's the main character's name, I'm not kidding) was the son of the number one ranked killer in the world.

I will admit the anime has a very high rewatch value since its short (5 episodes) and its a pretty good action Series.The Main Character is quiet I guess trying to be the cool calm collective type but honestly throughout the series he never came off as ""Badass"" to me he...just seemed...... There.... Then there is his sidekick WHO NEVER SHUTS UP!!!!! I assume they did this to add flavor so the fights arent boring or to add SOME flavor to the quiet atmosphere, however he comes off as just loud and annoying. Whether or not the series would have been better off without him is a mystery but I thought his character needed some reworking.For those who are Shaky on watching this or wanna know if they should watch this now.....I believe if you are reading this (or any review on this) you should watch it. You wont be bored watching actually its quite the opposite you will enjoy it.

This is more like turn off your brain and enjoy the extremely good visuals and fight scenes.When i first heard about Afro Samurai i thought it was a joke, a show made to mock. But when i found some clips and i saw how funny it could be, and how gorgeous the visuals were i was sold.Story: 5. This is easily the weak point of the show. Afro Samurai ( the main character) Wants the #1 headband to avenge the death of...his father who had the #1 headband when Afro was a kid. At the start of the show he has the #2 headband.Its said that the #1 gives you immense power and so on. Nothing really too interesting, just a revenge story. The conclusion isn't satisfying either.Art: 10. This is easily the best point of the show. It looks absolutely amazing and the animation is outstanding. Creative and beautiful designs on the characters and the scenery.Sound: 9. Having Samuel L. Jackson as the voice actor for the main character couldn't been a better choice. It fits him so well, the serious Samuel ( think Pulp Fiction etc) and the not so serious Samuel is present in Afro and Ninja Ninja.The music is mostly rap music, but it fits the situations and the flow. Even though i'm not a fan of rap it works so well with the world and the environment it doesn't bother me.Character: 6. Other then Afro, Ninja Ninja and the bad guy, there's not many characters that you will care about. And i find it hard to even care about them, they fulfill their roles just fine. But that is about it, there is close to no character development. Ninja Ninja is easily the best character in my opinion though.Enjoyment and Overall: 9 and 8. It is really enjoyable as long as you don't want it to be deep or have some kind of meaning. It is basically just one bad ass samurai killing a lot of people. With some good jokes and stuff from Ninja Ninja. If you have a night off where you just want to see really well animated awesomeness this is highly recommended.

Most of the characters are 2D characters except for Afro Samurai and his childhood friend Geno. Many would dispute...this fact but,*SPOILER ALERT*when we saw afro kill the black ninja that followed him around (his imaginary friend) that helped him deal with his lifestyle of constant fighting and no friends we realize that he has emotions and that he a simple revenge killer. Although the Afro Samurai has some depth to him the storyline never changes its mostly Afro fighting and Afro's flashbacks.Art and Sound:  Amazing the art and sound is what really keeps you watching this anime. Because of this unique art style the fights look absolutely fantastic if anything pick up this anime for the visual enjoymentConclusion: go watch this anime i am sure that you will enjoy watching it and come out of the experience saying this is the best anime i have ever seen till you look back and think about the storyline and everything like i had to.

It's one of the first anime where I actually googled the soundtrack because it fit so well with the feel of the anime.Overall the characters are like balls to the walls extreme, nothing is normal, nothing is as you'd expect, even the world where they are in doesn't have any consistency. I know it can be a bit of a turnoff for some people but when executed right, I freaking love it.And...in the 5 episodes that it has, it never get's boring, there is just so much action everywhere, it's like a testosterone fuelled action flick.But if you'd like a more indepth review on it then I have one on my channel on Youtube if you just search for MudanTV.

Not it is time to take a tumble into this review.I have been wanting to watch Afro Samurai for some time now and I finally got around to it. I was expecting over the top action but I was surprised with how wonderfully stylistic it all was. The largest issue that pulls this show down dramatically is its piss poor sound design. Characters more in a dramatic fashion and you hear nothing, footfalls are inconsistent, and...the clashing of blades effect is rescued time and again. That said the visuals are truly a sight to behold, especially in the later three episodes Afro Samurai makes gushing blood feel impactful by displaying grotesque scenes of bone and viscera with powerful jetting blood that never feels like blood pinatas seen in other anime. The narrative is simple but effective and could have been more so if it wasn’t obvious that the Japanese animators were having a hard time animating lip flaps for an entirely English speaking cast. Which is a shame because the voice work is truly stand out, especially in the case of Samuel L. Jackson and Ron Perlman. If you get the chance I recommend you watch this bombastically brutal display. the clashing of blades effect is rescued time and again.

The artwork is crisp and the animation is smooth. These are all positive marks in my book.Samuel L Jackson also does a good job in his voice work. While Afro doesn't talk a lot, his sidekick is hilarious comedy relief. Though some of the other voicework is just bizarre and at least one of the guys from the syndicate he battles through the show was voiced in such a way that it was comical.If you want to watch something that includes the lead character going on a...murder spree through a gauntlet of victims and each one dying horribly, then this is the right show for you. murder spree through a gauntlet of victims and each one dying horribly, then this is the right show for you."", ""There are some reviewers that would whine about the story not being very good but listen to me that's not the god damn point of this anime.Afro samurai is a simple revenge story about a badass samurai with a radical hairstyle travailing though a world where everyone wants him dead.

The first episode got me hooked. It was refreshing to once again see a fusion of the east and west, old and new, after Samurai Champloo leaving much fond memories for me (watched SC twice).

The only character who seemed semi interesting was his alter ego who quickly became annoying and repetitive, and played absolutely no role in developing the story at all.I don't...want to say too much as it would spoil the story. In short, if you want cool sword fights (and guns and RPGs and robots) with awesome artwork, watch it.

Well because it's cool, and the point of the show was to be cool, and with that in mind it very much succeeds in doing what it had set out to do. That isn't the end of it of course, the animation is some of the best I have ever seen and undoubtedly the best Gonzo had ever done as a studio. The fights are amazing, the main character is bad-ass, the villains are all cool...and move in cool ways, and the visuals flow nicely in ways that all other modern anime still can't flow to this day; the story is a mute point. Heck, the story isn't even half bad: a revenge plot to kill his fathers killer? Sounds cool. But what makes the story actually pretty good is what happens in-between: the search for a headband that allows you to challenge the strongest man in the world, an awesome main character that can cut down armies of men, a sad backstory that ends with murder, a slew of villains that act tough but get cut down in the end, and a comic relief character that may only exist in the main's mind.The whole point of Afro Samurai is being cool, and I think that it does so with flying colors. It's not even that difficult to watch with only five episodes, so if you don't like it you've only wasted a couple hours of your life as opposed to much worse anime that waste several days. You can even watch it with a good English dub, which is a good thing since that's the only way to watch it.Sure, call me a sucker for cool animation and cool fights, but when it's grouped with a slew of anime that do neither of those things well, is that really a bad thing? and move in cool ways, and the visuals flow nicely in ways that all other modern anime still can't flow to this day; the story is a mute point.

But really its only for those who want loads of mindless blood spilling with no comedy, no story, and no character development. The Main protagonists says 2 words per episode!!!The sound and the Art were outstanding... if i was to grade an anime based on those two, Afro samurai would be a 9, but the truth is Afro samurai failed in every other category as American programs usually tend to do.Most of the time fights will occur randomly for no reason. There are many random moments in the anime that make no sense... for example one moment our...afro hero is cuttin down some foe, the next moment hes in the hospital with no reason given for why hes in there...Compared to shows like Samurai champloo or the lone swordsman, Afro samurai is fail.I kinda liked how the creators wanted to mix Hip hop with sword fighting but it just didn\'t feel right, nor does it help you get into the story. The Music sucked, the characters voices were retarded and its hard to take the show serious because of the wacky villians and stupid side kick that fallows afro samurai around.The show also is a bit gloomy, dark, and disgusting. The creators probably wanted the viewers to feel like crap after watching the series. The worst part is our Hero is actually a jerk, hes actually more evil then most the villians hes up against. Usually i like cool charachters that have mixed morals such as Yagami light from Death note, or Mugen from samurai champloo. But this guy is a plain blood thirsty idiot ogre who says 2 words per episode!!! Its hard to get attached to people like that.Samurai champloo does a better job in mixing ""hip hop"" with its style, then does Afro samurai i would recommend samurai champloo to anyone who likes that style of story telling.I give the series a 5, i really want to give it a 2, but thats just me.

Well for the first part, it is set in an alternate world, were hip hop, rock, and samurai all meld together into a unique far east asian world.The story centres on Afro, a black ninja samurai who is trying to avenge his dead father who was the previous number one, before he was beheaded by the current number one who was the previous number 2.The story revolves around Afro's Past and the number 2 head band.There is alotof well fought out action scenes, and some of the ideas fit well with...the anime. the art isn't bad or poor, considering the detail they tried to include all I can say was there was some areas where the animation didn't seem fluid. but the action parts were well done, with lots of blood and limbs, and even sex.Overall I enjoyed it but I didn't expect alot, and I wasn't certain it required samuel L Jackson to voice act the ninja, but i guess the artists wanted his sassiness.but it was disappointly short, being only 5 episodes. it wasn't anything special but there were some great episodes and some great action, overall the action helped to pass the time. the anime. the art isn't bad or poor, considering the detail they tried to include all I can say was there was some areas where the animation didn't seem fluid. but the action parts were well done, with lots of blood and limbs, and even sex.Overall I enjoyed it but I didn't expect alot, and I wasn't certain it required samuel L Jackson to voice act the ninja, but i guess the artists wanted his sassiness.but it was disappointly short, being only 5 episodes. it wasn't anything special but there were some great episodes and some great action, overall the action helped to pass the time."", ""An entertaining yet shallow anime. Welcome to Afro Samurai.Afro Samurai is like one of those movies you watch with crazy CGI and flashy effects, yet when you leave the theater you sense a feeling of emptiness.In other words the story kind of sucks. With a seemingly cliche plot of a kid who looses his father and has to get revenge. It does what it needs to though, mildly entertain its audience for 5 episodes. Never at one point did I relate to any of the characters while watching this show or deeply care about them.The artwork is pretty well done in this show and...is extremely flashy. There is lots of blood, gore, and action, something I enjoy watching in my anime shows. Of course, something with a little more substance, such as Gantz and Elfen Lied are better.The main character doesn't really talk, if not at all from what I remember, and is accompanied by the comic relief, Samuel Jackson, who did a pretty good job here.Don't go into Afro Samurai expecting a masterpiece, instead watch it as mild entertainment. is extremely flashy.

It has some great characters and a good but weird story, but most of the enjoyment you get from the show is the “vibe”. The show feels as if you went to visit your cool cousin who is all about the good kush in the sketchy part of town. If you want an authentic samurai show look elsewhere cause this is some crazy sh#t yo! My only few gripes is that the dub, which is actually good, is sometimes difficult to hear due to mumbling....Which is a shame cause the dub, again, is quite good featuring Samuel L Jackson. My other complain is that it is so short but then again if you want more there is a movie the takes place directly after. All in all, I do believe it is one of the best anime out there.

Whereas the character Afro and his childhood friends were excellently developed in this series, I felt that characters such as Ninja Ninja and the seven old guys on the mountain were just kind of there for no reason. They didn't really explain this in the franchise as a whole, which they could have done, they would have had to make a few more episodes but it would have been worth it. I understand the Ninja Ninja was meant to...be Afro's imaginary friend, but they never state when or why Afro created him. We also really didn't need that sex scene. Where as I do think that some series would be better with sex (cough school days cough) this didn't really benefit the series as a whole and could have been cut out completely. Maybe we could have gotten a back story for Ninja Ninja instead.The good. I loved the animation this, and how they use the same animation through out the whole series. From the fight scenes to the calm scenes, and even that sex scene I was talking about, this series is beautifully animated. The next thing I loved was the amount of development we got for our silent protagonist. The next is the soundtrack that we got, even though I'm not much for RZA and the Woo Tang Clan, I seem to love it when they work with anime. They also seem to be the only North American group the Japanese seem to like. But the soundtrack was very well written and you could even just listen to the soundtrack and get pretty much the whole story. The last thing I want to talk about is the casting chooses. Jason Marsden and Samuel L. Jackson as Rival, this was beyond perfect. I mean I don't know a fan that watches the Japanese version if there is one.Final Verdict:This is 5 hours out of your life that you will immensely enjoy if you like Samuel L.

Still sound related, the voices used in this show are something to notice too.The art is good, I feel it fits the content of the show...and considering the time it was aired it's ok.The only thing this show did wrong on my opinion is that it didn't followed the manga, there are things introduced in the anime that don't exactly fit nor are explained properly and there are things that are better explained in the manga, in an 5 eps show this kind of stuff is really risky, since there isn't time to explain everything about that universe.Overall, great show to binge watch, really enjoyed it. and considering the time it was aired it's ok.The only thing this show did wrong on my opinion is that it didn't followed the manga, there are things introduced in the anime that don't exactly fit nor are explained properly and there are things that are better explained in the manga, in an 5 eps show this kind of stuff is really risky, since there isn't time to explain everything about that universe.Overall, great show to binge watch, really enjoyed it."", ""REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERSAfro Samurai is a gore and not creative samurai story.I need to admit that it can be a very stylish anime... the strange design, the hip hop elements... but in terms of plot and story, it's cliché and predictable.

Im not going to spoil due to the fact its too short.  Not including movies either by the way, but the whole revenge arc was lit to me at least.

I hated every moment of it that didn\'t involve swordfights. There, that about sums it up.Seriously, I have never been more enraged by an anime. I hate it so much that I decided to write this review, mostly to vent, but also to warn people who\'ve heard about this thing and think it may be a fun ride. Oh, my poor summer children... You could not be more wrong.I\'ll just start by getting the good stuff out of the way. The animation in...this show is very good, especially during the fight scenes. The way the characters move and the way they pose is very dynamic and lets viewers gleam small details about their personality. The color palette is also pretty interesting, giving it an old timey samurai movie feel. The story is decent, focusing on revenge and the effect it has on not only the protagonist, but also the people closest to him. It\'s nothing new, but it\'s reasonably well told.And that\'s about it. Now for the more substantial part of the review...The sound design is a complete mess. Some music tracks are pretty good, but they\'re inserted really awkwardly. And the fight scenes tend to be pretty silent most of the times. The swords seem weightless, their clashing packs no punch and the bombastic action on the screen needs bombastic sounds to go with it.The voice acting is atrocious. Afro\'s the best out of the bunch, but only because he barely speaks. The rest sound stilted or bored. And Samuel L. Jackson sounds like he was in some other gig, some kind of comedy with slapstick action. His character is one of the most annoying and pointless in the entire history of anime.Character development is a joke. Characters are introduced and dropped so fast that you never get to feel invested in any of them. And yes, I am mostly talking about a certain character who should have been one of if not the most important player in Afro\'s life. they should have been a major bump in his road towards vengeance, but screw that. Here\'s some awkward fan service, a reason for being dropped from the plot and then they\'re dropped from the plot.And the dialogue... Who in the blue hell allowed such crap to make its way onto people\'s screens. I could write better, more believable, less cringey dialogue... And I\'m not even an amateur writer... It\'s ear-bleedingly awful. Maybe that\'s why the characters sound so bored. It\'s like the actors saw the dialogue and went ""Screw it! If they\'re phoning it in to such a degree, then so am I!""Afro Samurai is not a good anime. More than that, it\'s a horrendous abomination that dares call itself an anime.

I was looking forward to it because of the selection of voice actors, representation, and interesting style choices. However, I was extremely bored and felt that the plot was lacking. The main character lacks depth minus it being a basic anime revenge for family plot. Also the monochromatic art style did no favors in the excitement department. I pushed through to finish it which is sad with it only having 5 episodes. I think this only appeals to those who have nostalgia for it or minimal anime exposure. If you want to watch a...solid anime about samurais, I suggest Samurai Champloo instead. solid anime about samurais, I suggest Samurai Champloo instead.', ""Sat down to watch one episode last night and resume the rest the next day. Ended up binge-watching the whole thing in one sitting! Afro Samurai had my attention right from the credits mentioning Samuel L. Jackson, whose voice acting is just out of the world, and.makes the characters more memorable. I was really not expecting to be blown away like that, and that is where this anime surely surprised me. With a fast-paced plot yet featuring subtle character development, Afro Samurai is an adrenaline-fueled, no-holds-barred action spectacle filled with fight sequences bound to make your jaw drop.Within merely five episodes, this show manages to...achieve its set standards, and the voice acting surely is one of the reasons. Not a single voice feels out of place, and English seems to be the apt language for this anime in spite of the samurai backdrop. SLJ does, as mentioned before, the most impressive job; be it the hilariously talkative Ninja Ninja or the protagonist with lines as few as possible, his voice befits both the characters, and I really couldn't believe both were voiced by him. Also, Afro's character development is splendid. I found him a well-developed and well-written character who at times gave me Wolverine vibes.The writing never feels dragged or lagging at any point, and the beautifully choreographed as well as drawn fight sequences make the five episodes fly by real quick, ending on a near-perfect note. There's also the essential message about the futility of violence and revenge, and how humans sometimes just can't escape that darkness no matter how hard they try.

I think that was the first time when I saw a sequel before the original movie. It was also the only time when it was my initiative to do such a thing. I was impressed, not with the story and characters as I usually do, but with the graphics and animation! Well, that was a first 😊. While leaving the cinema, I remembered there was a series, [i]Afro Samurai[/i], that I have kept avoiding because it was not my style. Now, all of a sudden it became a must see!Although, at first sight you would find...the plot quite shallow (a man seeking revenge), I think that there is more to this anime than just an endless slaughter. It has a more profound side, a meditation on the yearn for power and the desire for vengeance. Together with the amazingly violent battles, which are so popular with the audience, you can also find this other side, where the characters, especially the main character, are deep in thought, even going into introspection. And if by comparison to the fights, the meditation moments seem rather tranquil, I’m not so sure about that. I felt they were some sort of duel-like inner conflicts, keeping me in suspense about whether the character would change his mind.I would go even farther! Suppose that the countless attacks that Afro Samurai, the main character, confronts with, would be an allegory of the inner battles from the human heart (passions, ambitions, desires, etc.). Or, suppose that bringing together landscapes of different places of the world (American western or Japanese doujo) and elements of different times (cowboy, samurai, cyborg, etc.) could show that, no matter the place or time, people stay the same, with the same challenges, fighting the same battles, again and again.Maybe at first glance it would appear that, while the attention is centered on Afro Samurai, the rest of the characters are only gravitating around him. It would be a mistake, though, to underestimate their significance. Let’s take the case of the cyborg, for instance; I cannot help but see how its patched body, part human, part robot, expresses so convincing a disfigurement, not only of the body, but of the soul also (torn apart between blind hatred - the destructive side, the robot - and pain, longing  - the human side). And there is so much more to the bear head of the fighter Kuma than it actually seems. Let’s not forget about Ninja Ninja. Completely indifferent to this world and its story, he is, at the same time, inseparable from Afro Samurai and also his opposite in almost every respect. It makes you wonder…I must confess that I have a soft spot for Ninja Ninja (:P) because he has such a charming invigorating presence, together with little Otsuru (one of the children Afro Samurai grew up with) being the only characters that managed to loosen me up a bit, in the context of such a decadent, gloomy world; with vicious, perverted, desperate or even savage people.The visual impact of a world enslaved to the evil is very well built up: the characters, rather ugly but not all the same, depending on the inner state of each of them, with opposite extremes (little Otsuru is so cute that you’d say she was imported from a different anime, while Justice is so hideous that you’d say he is a devil brought directly from [i]The Exorcist[/i]) blend so well in this dry and dark environment (sometimes it reminds me of the death gods’ world from [i]Death Note[/i]) occasionally illustrated in red and black.There is so much more to tell about the animation and graphics, but I will mention only the two aspects that impressed me most:-\tPassing from a concrete, almost organic image to an abstract image with simple colors and powerful contrasts (red and black for instance) is like a switch from one dimension to another, with the two images completing one another in what should be a single idea.

Brilliant! At the same time the gloomier music, a little bit disturbing, amplified the effect of the more dramatic scenes. It gave me the chills.At the end of the series I was rather sour and with a heavy heart, but at the same time I had that unique feeling of a qualitative experience, like when you eat a very fine dark chocolate and, despite its bitterness, you cannot help yourself to acknowledge and enjoy the sophistication of its texture and flavor, incomparable to those of the ordinary chocolate. the plot quite shallow (a man seeking revenge), I think that there is more to this anime than just an endless slaughter. It has a more profound side, a meditation on the yearn for power and the desire for vengeance. Together with the amazingly violent battles, which are so popular with the audience, you can also find this other side, where the characters, especially the main character, are deep in thought, even going into introspection. And if by comparison to the fights, the meditation moments seem rather tranquil, I’m not so sure about that. I felt they were some sort of duel-like inner conflicts, keeping me in suspense about whether the character would change his mind.I would go even farther! Suppose that the countless attacks that Afro Samurai, the main character, confronts with, would be an allegory of the inner battles from the human heart (passions, ambitions, desires, etc.). Or, suppose that bringing together landscapes of different places of the world (American western or Japanese doujo) and elements of different times (cowboy, samurai, cyborg, etc.) could show that, no matter the place or time, people stay the same, with the same challenges, fighting the same battles, again and again.Maybe at first glance it would appear that, while the attention is centered on Afro Samurai, the rest of the characters are only gravitating around him. It would be a mistake, though, to underestimate their significance. Let’s take the case of the cyborg, for instance; I cannot help but see how its patched body, part human, part robot, expresses so convincing a disfigurement, not only of the body, but of the soul also (torn apart between blind hatred - the destructive side, the robot - and pain, longing  - the human side). And there is so much more to the bear head of the fighter Kuma than it actually seems. Let’s not forget about Ninja Ninja. Completely indifferent to this world and its story, he is, at the same time, inseparable from Afro Samurai and also his opposite in almost every respect. It makes you wonder…I must confess that I have a soft spot for Ninja Ninja (:P) because he has such a charming invigorating presence, together with little Otsuru (one of the children Afro Samurai grew up with) being the only characters that managed to loosen me up a bit, in the context of such a decadent, gloomy world; with vicious, perverted, desperate or even savage people.The visual impact of a world enslaved to the evil is very well built up: the characters, rather ugly but not all the same, depending on the inner state of each of them, with opposite extremes (little Otsuru is so cute that you’d say she was imported from a different anime, while Justice is so hideous that you’d say he is a devil brought directly from [i]The Exorcist[/i]) blend so well in this dry and dark environment (sometimes it reminds me of the death gods’ world from [i]Death Note[/i]) occasionally illustrated in red and black.There is so much more to tell about the animation and graphics, but I will mention only the two aspects that impressed me most:-\tPassing from a concrete, almost organic image to an abstract image with simple colors and powerful contrasts (red and black for instance) is like a switch from one dimension to another, with the two images completing one another in what should be a single idea. We have the blood, slippery, slimy, plain red in one image and glowing red in the other, floating as there would be no gravity, with candle-flame-like drops.-\tThe hair of Afro Samurai and Ninja Ninja seems to defy the law of gravity, and the way it waves make it look like clouds, smoke, cotton candy? 😊…it’s amazing how such a little detail made me dream far away from the story…The rhythmed music, especially in the presence of Afro Samurai or Ninja Ninja, stressed so well the moments and also the style of the characters!

I believe it was between 2012 and 2015 when I first watched Afro Samurai. It was after the show came to Netflix, and I hadn\'t seen anything anime-related since I was still watching Toonami in the mid-2000s (it had to be back when Bobobo was still airing), and based on what I remember watching I genuinely loved the action of the show! I didn\'t care about the story and nor did anyone on the team who made this, I\'d...reckon. It\'s a by-the-book story of revenge with its roots being firmly planted in the kung fu movies of old. Then again, I\'m sure there\'s more to see upon a revisit. Like the antagonistic figure Afro pursues being a cowboy named ""Justice"", a samurai fighting a cowboy clearly has some allusions to the concept of East vs West. Something many stories have dabbled with before and after.Either way, if you ask me what the real selling point of Afro Samurai was, the action the show brought to the table would be my answer. The gross and gritty action sequences of the show were definitely assisted by the show\'s darker aesthetic. Speaking from a more personal standpoint, this was the first time I watched something and realized something you watch in an episodic format could have something that Afro Samurai offered. It was so crass and dynamic, I\'d never seen anything besides a feature-length film present its action sequences in such a way before.But that\'s the beauty of the show for me. It was such a strong gateway into anime. I don\'t think I\'d be the person I am today if it wasn\'t for Afro Samurai. So, if you have a friend who is looking to get into anime as a medium but neither of you knows where to start. Then I would recommend starting here if something your preferred flavor is on the bloodier side. reckon.

To start off I don't like gory, masochistic, or sadistic things.  Especially when it's seemingly pointless slaughter.  The anime starts off with Afro Samurai's father losing his head.  It is really a bloody mess of an anime series.  I'm kind of writing this review to warn people not to watch this series.  Because in my eyes it's very degrading.The music and voice acting is the only bright spot in an otherwise lousy series.  You get some closure in the movie resurrection.

Afro samurai seemed like the perfect pick and despite the relatively low score, I decided to binge it.The short verdict is that it really disappoints in most areas even in those it tries to sell. Afro Samurai, for all the production value that seems to have been given, feels amateurish at best. I feel like everyone who\'s ever seen anime will notice it, too. The show feels off in a bad way, but it took me some time to pinpoint the issues.Ok, I...like simple stories. Short and easy to understand goals, help shows focus on other things. But this is simply at an unacceptable level. The setup, for me at least, was fine. Revenge stories are simple and fun. The premise was fine, by the standards I expecting at the start. But this ""simplicity"" starts affecting the rest of the show. Every character is one-dimensional and only one stands out, simply for the comedy he offers. Love interest?, scenes that make no sense story-wise random nonsense ramblings from characters we do not care, nothing seems to work and all stands out as an amateurish attempt at (something??). I have no idea what the point was to most of the the non-fighting scenes.Continuing with the amateurish theme, the entire voice and sound design feels completely off. It\'s sad to see good music and good voice acting feel butchered by lackluster directing. Quick switches in music tones, weird sound effects that actually made me pause to check if YouTube was open, bad lip syncing and voice acting. It all culminates in a cheap product, despite all the A-list music and voice actors they had.Animation was supposed to be the selling point of the anime. And I don\'t want to be too harsh on it, as there are some beautiful fights scenes and a few good shots. But again, it feels amateurish as some shots are hard to follow and with too many close ups. Again feels more of a directing issue than anything else.Short edit note: Really just another directing (nitpick?), I saw so many scenes fade to black, that it actually made me wonder how other anime ended scenes. It is done so many times, that I had to open a random anime just to see that I am not stupid in feeling off every time the screen faded to black.To summarize: AMATEUR WORK, I wouldn\'t recommend this to most people. like simple stories.

Along with that the voice acting is awful, they are able to get incredible voice actors but do nothing with them, the only one who actually had an outstanding performance was Ron Perlman, but even then he\'s hardly in the anime and he\'s probably not the reason why you watched the show, I feel like I can safely say when someone hears ""Samuel L. Jackson anime"" it probably peaked their interest, and that\'s what happened to me, and I was stoked to watch this anime because he\'s one of my favorite actors, but they don\'t really do anything with his skill as a actor, they just have him this kind of racist portrayal of this ""funny token black guy"" who is the main character\'s subconscious, which could be interesting, but once again do nothing with it.Overall this anime had great potential but ends up falling flat on it\'s face, with the only thing being done well is Ron Perlman\'s character, but he\'s hardly in the show so we don\'t get much time with him, I would still recommended this anime, but only to laugh at it with some friends.

Even the fights hold up really well in today\'s standards. Absolutely no complaints here.Sound design is great, it\'s not the generic stuff you hear in most anime nowadays, and it is really good. Soundtrack is done by RZA, who knocked it...out of the park for this one. It\'s a nice mixture of early 2000\'s hip hop along with some rock, and it is overall pretty damn good. Voice acting is really good, Samuel L. Jackson\'s performance was probably one of the best I\'ve seen in dubbed anime.Characters are pretty flat, as Afro is an average character with a ton of strength. He doesn\'t give a fuck about anything else and would rather use force than argument to get things straight. Afro embodies the word ""badass""; he acts as he pleases, when and when he pleases, while extending an imagined middle finger to everyone who mistreats him. The ladies in this anime are only decorations for the fan-service component, despite the fact that all the males in it seem rather badass. Overall, not the worst, but could be better.The story is pretty basic, since it\'s just main character\'s father dies, he seeks revenge and becomes number 1 samurai trope. It is pretty enjoyable at times, but it\'s mostly basic.Overall, Afro Samurai is pretty good for what it is, sure it\'s not the next best fight scene Shonen or some masterpiece story anime, but it tried to put a unique twist on the samurai theme.

The Samurai concept itself already doesn't peak my interests but I tried to show an open mind knowing its popularity. The headband concept itself showed potential, however the dialogues, the fights were just plain bad. At around episode 3 I was just begging the show to finish so I would be put out of my misery. I did however find the background story given to Afro mildly interesting however nothing more than that.When looking at it through the ratings I give the story a generous 3 and that is due to the potential it had until it...was destroyed. The sound effects to be fair was pretty decent and well done in my opinion so it deserved a 6. The art itself was unique and well drawn so I have to give credit to where its due. The characters were horrible as I noticed zero character development nor zero emotions, it was awful. Overall I give it a 2 despite giving the Art 7, but that is because within my tastes and preferences certain factors such as story and characters contribute more than art in my opinion.

It's was ok, I don't know if there is a remastered version but I think I watched the original and let's just say the quality was not very good. But it also looked kind of like it might have been made to look that way but either way it was a little hard to watch it and be able to see everything.Story: 7.5/10 - the story is pretty good, it's very short but still has...quite a lot of content in the short 5 episode season. The story is set on a world that's been ravaged by death and war and famine, it seems like a mix of the old west with Japanese culture with remnants of some modern technologies. Now everyone fights over 2 headbands, #1 & #2. The No.2 headband is something you must acquire before challenging the holder of the No.1 headband. The story starts with the MC as a child named Afro and he lives in a temple on top of a mountain with his father who is the current holder of the No.1 headband, then the holder of the No.2 headband named Justice comes to challenge Afros father for the No.1 and I don't want to spoil to much but ohwell it says this in the actual anime description anyways, Justice beats Afros father. After that is a time skip to when Afro is an adult and he goes on his journey to reclaim his father's No.1 headband. I liked the plot to the story, I just wish that it had a full 12 episode season. I know the manga is fairly short also but it would have been better if they would have added some anime original content to make is seem more interesting and maybe a little more content whether it was a few more fights of more information and storyline in each episode.Art: 7/10 - the reason I don't watch a lot of older anime, especially anime with a lot of movement and fighting scenes because with the older animation most of the movements turn our blurry or unclear unless the anime has a remastered version which isn't the case with most anime. Also I'm just getting into anime and haven't watched very much or for very long. Fortunately some anime is being reanimated like Shaman King rather than just remaster and clean up the originals. Afro Samurai suffered from this and it was done with a lot of darker colors with not really any bright colors which I liked because it helped signify how hard life was for most people and that life was a dark and dirty thing. Unfortunately though it being done in a darker tone made the fight scenes even more muddled. One thing I did like though was it was all hand drawn and if I remember right there might have been 1 or 2 pencil sketch scenes but I might be thinking of a different anime.Sound: 9/10 - by far the best part of this anime, the soundtrack and all the source music and the OP & ED were all done by RZA and it was all fire. When they would put Wu-Tang as the source music while Afro was doing all his sword play was so good, it made me smile and start bobbin my head to the beat.Characters: 8/10 - the characters were pretty cool, they all have really good designs especially Afro. And I still can't believe they got Samuel L. Jackson to do the voice of Afro himself and his funny ass companion Ninja Ninja, he is absolutely hilarious and one of the best characters in this anime. He is loyal to Afro and always stays at his side. Afro is really stoic and doesn't say very much unless he's asking for some lemonade that he drinks with his own custom made straw. He lives his life similar to a samurai, his main weapon is a huge katana that was his father's. Justice is the main villain but Afro has many enemies because he wears the No.2 headband so anyone in the world can challenge him or literally try and assassinate him because how good he is. Justice is an ugly mother that wears cowboy boots with spurs and a long black trench coat black jeans and shirt and a big black cowboy hat, his weapons are a couple of revolvers. There's a few others but I don't want to make this too long so I'll try and make it brief. Next is the brothers, I think there are 7 or 8 I forget but each one is mechanically modified somehow and they keep sending mercenaries after Afro to get the No.2 headband without having to fight afro themselves. Next is Jinno who was a friend of Afro's who lived with him at a swordmasters dojo when Afro was a kid until he was a young teen. When Afro was still a young boy he was still in possession of the No.2 headband so he was constantly being hunted, one night he is attacked by a group of men after the No.2 and eventually corner Afro and almost kill him and they end up taking the headband and shortly after is when is ends up at the dojo. I went off track there for a minute. In present time Jinno is an assassin that has been mechanically enhanced by the brothers and wears a teddy bear head and he is after Afro also.Enjoyment: 8/10 - I enjoyed this anime a good amount, might have enjoyed it more if it were a bit longer and definitely if it had a remastered version out. I hope they get around to remastering this anime or maybe even remaking it, but only if Samuel L. Jackson does the voice overs again. The sword fighting was cool and I enjoyed that also and even though it wasn't the the highest quality I would still recommend watching this anime.Overall: 7.9/10 - it's a decent anime for when it was released, I liked the story and the plot and if this anime ever gets an updated version whether it's the original remastered or all new animation and new story, I would definitely check it out again. For fans of sword fighting anime and anime from the 2000s or anime anime that has some gore and blood than I'm sure you will enjoy this anime, also for an anime being almost 20 years old it still holds up and is entertaining still today. quite a lot of content in the short 5 episode season.

So save your time.', 'I honestly didn’t know exactly what to expect going into this show, other than a few recommendations I had no info on it. Overall, it’s a weird comedy (similar to abridged anime) hidden in the shell of a serious and gritty show.I found the concept of the story actually pretty interesting. I wish it was longer than 5 episodes so it could get more in detail but for 5 episodes there’s quite a bit.

What the series lacks in originality in the concepts it draws, the implementation and integration of these influences is what may draw someone to the series. With a mesh of a medieval samurai setting and presence of cell phones, sunglasses, and general digital technology, the series goes in its own direction never allowing the audience a chance to wholly predict where the series will continue(for better and...for worse). With the amount of story beats and directions in the plot, there is hardly much context as to why things are the way they are besides the fact that the Number #1 can only be challenged by the Number #2 and that the Number #2 can be challenged by anyone. This leaves the presence of digital technology and monks that are ballin' completely unexplained(though a proper explanation may remove the main draw of the series: the wacky but played straight tone of the series). The main drawback of Afro Samurai is that the show is first limited by the short five episode length of the series and second that, beyond the mosaic of influences and the tone, there is not much to draw an audience into the series. If you enjoy watching something that will take you for a loop or just want something to occupy two to three hours, this may just be a good watch.

On my Letterboxd account, I have a list of annoying characters that almost ruined good movies for me. Examples included Last Action Hero, The Seventh Curse, and Temple of Doom. And Afro Samurai absolutely belongs in that category.Everything about Afro Samurai, with the exception of Ninja Ninja, is great. I love Sam Jackson in the dual role, he seems like he's having a blast. I also think the art style is stylish and fun in its outlandishness, the story is solid and dark, and I...loved the creativity that went into the character designs. But as I said, the one exception to an otherwise fine anime is Ninja Ninja.SPOILER ALERT: Ninja Ninja is Afro Samurai's conscience. He's a more outgoing and wackier version of Afro and he acts as the hesitant side of Afro that he tries to suppress. And personally, without a character like Ninja Ninja Afro Samurai, the show would suffer. Because the character of Afro as an adult is your standard code of honor, way of the sword, strong silent type that you envision when you think of a samurai. Think something like Samurai Jack. And if we were left without a more vibrant sidekick we wouldn't be as interested in Afro because he says almost nothing, does nothing but kill, and overall has no personality. And there's nothing wrong with that type of character, but you need someone by their side to lighten the mood and build the character up. The sad thing is, however, that that character is Ninja Ninja.Ninja Ninja is unbearably annoying. It wouldn't be so grating if he were a much lesser supporting character, but he's around every time Afro is on-screen. So he's with us every step of the way. And along the way Ninja does nothing but loudly proclaim useless things and provide nothing to anything. He's just there to be a pain in the ass. And again, it wouldn't be so bad if the character were written differently. I don't mind a more exaggerated version of Afro, I just hate that it's this character.And really, that's my only issue with Afro Samurai. Sure, the story isn't anything grand, but it's serviceable when paired with the beautiful artwork, killer soundtrack, great voice acting, and stellar fight scenes. The story is just there to keep the violence going. But personally, it was hard to enjoy the show with Ninja Ninja constantly butting in to give his two cents and generally be a nuisance. If he were any other annoying character in an anime/manga like Chi-Chi from DBZ or Puck from Berserk he'd be less of an eyesore because in the larger story he'd be a more minor player, and therefore less of a hindrance to the enjoyment of the series. But as it stands I don't think I'll be watching Afro Samurai again unless a friend wants to watch it with me because I just can't bear to listen to any more of Ninja Ninja. loved the creativity that went into the character designs.

now dealing with the characters themselves, I noticed a very strange animation regarding their clothes and hair, a certain estrangement.The coolness of the colors is clearly on purpose, whether...to enhance the temperature of the room or emphasize seriousness, so, at least for me, at some point it became uncomfortable and I believe that the greater use of colors could add to the anime.The story is ok, maybe because of its simplicity or its almost expressionless protagonist, but it's a fact that it's a common plot in stories of this type, and the way the script doesn't look for new situations and discard characters bothers me.As for the protagonist, he demonstrates a clear objective throughout the journey, he is in fact inexpressive, he seems to have little interest in those who were part of his story up to that point.|| PORTUGUÊS/PORTUGUESE ||Afro Samurai é um anime que me foi massivamente recomendado, então aqui o meu veredito:Esse anime é estilizado de uma maneira incrível, e muito disso se deve ao ótimo trabalho de dublagem, a trilha sonora num geral e a alguns personagens intencionalmente caricatos.A animação num geral é boa, as lutas são convincentes e bem fluídas, e a excentricidade delas, seja na sanguinolência ou na inserção de objetos inesperados para a época, só realça sua qualidade; agora lidando com os personagens em si, notei uma animação bem estranha quanto as roupas e cabelos dos mesmos, um certo estranhamento.A frieza das cores é claramente proposital, seja para realçar a temperatura do ambiente ou enfatizar seriedade, portanto, ao menos para mim, em algum momento se tornou desconfortável e acredito que o uso maior de cores poderia agregar ao anime.A história é ok, talvez em decorrência da sua simplicidade ou por seu protagonista quase inexpressivo, mas é fato de que é um plot comum em histórias desse tipo, e o jeito como o roteiro não procura novas situações e descarta personagens me incomoda.Quanto ao protagonista, esse demonstra um objetivo claro do começo ao fim da jornada, é de fato inexpressivo, parece ter pouco interesse por aqueles que fizeram parte da sua história até aquele ponto. to enhance the temperature of the room or emphasize seriousness, so, at least for me, at some point it became uncomfortable and I believe that the greater use of colors could add to the anime.The story is ok, maybe because of its simplicity or its almost expressionless protagonist, but it's a fact that it's a common plot in stories of this type, and the way the script doesn't look for new situations and discard characters bothers me.As for the protagonist, he demonstrates a clear objective throughout the journey, he is in fact inexpressive, he seems to have little interest in those who were part of his story up to that point.|| PORTUGUÊS/PORTUGUESE ||Afro Samurai é um anime que me foi massivamente recomendado, então aqui o meu veredito:Esse anime é estilizado de uma maneira incrível, e muito disso se deve ao ótimo trabalho de dublagem, a trilha sonora num geral e a alguns personagens intencionalmente caricatos.A animação num geral é boa, as lutas são convincentes e bem fluídas, e a excentricidade delas, seja na sanguinolência ou na inserção de objetos inesperados para a época, só realça sua qualidade;

The first 2 episodes seemed really good to me, then it just got boring. One of the only entertaining things was Ninja Ninja. The fights though they seemed cool at first were actually very bland and boring besides the robo-Afro samurai fight, that one was the one i only really found interesting. This revenge story seemed very boring and stupid to me. the stupidest part to me was that Sasuke...came back for revenge, and they whole backstory on how he became a cyborg (literally almost exactly like Anakin from Star Wars becoming Darth Vader), they way Sasuke was introduced back and his dialogue seemed very stupid and cliché.

The story revolves around macho confrontations with a brutal resolution, where the protagonist seeks revenge against the man who killed his father when he was a child.It stands out for its style that remains captivating throughout the protagonist's journey through challengers. The creative design features an irreverent world where rocket launchers are as common as daggers in close combat, and the main character dons 18th-century oriental bell bottoms.

Survivor\'s guilt, will to live, or continue fighting, the drive for companionship and inner peace, it\'s all in there. And no filler either, this was 5 episodes only! It was all excellent, and Samuel L Jackson is on the cast!!! Unfortunately so are many Funimation regulars, but that\'s fine.The storytelling is very subtle, making use of monologues and flashbacks.The animation is very good- action scenes feel very well choreographed and flashy as fuuuckSound- due to the Funimation cast, this is the weakest point of this anime. The...soundtrack was good :) a little out of style but it\'s an older anime!Characters-hmm well the characters were a little flat, but that\'s fine, I feel this was a more abstract anime than others, despite the blood and violence. The flat characters do not necessarily harm the story being told. This is 5 episodes, shorter than some movies!!! For those 5 episodes, the characters had good chemistry in the story.Overall enjoyment- I\'m a little squeamish but when I\'m feeling it I really enjoy these types of shows. Thoughtful, funny, fucking gorgeous, and a gem of the hellhole we call anime. It\'s notable for continuing the long tradition of Black American/Japanese cultural exchange, and notable for being a Spike TV original!!!

The violence is very strong, gory and constant. People are constantly killed in gory ways, with Japanese weapons and samurai swords throughout. There are some uses of strong language, such as ""f***"" and ""motherf*****"". Milder swears are...more frequent: ""s***"", ""bastard"", ""hell"", ""damn"", ""bulls***"", ""son of a b****"", and other profanities. Afro is often seen smoking what looks like a joint, as are some other characters. Drinking is seen briefly.I can say though that it kind of felt like it was repeating events about it and I slightly lost interest at timesThe ending was quite good, so the review is probably proportional to the whole!! more frequent: ""s***"", ""bastard"", ""hell"", ""damn"", ""bulls***"", ""son of a b****"", and other profanities.

Guy sees someone kill his father, becomes vengeful and walks the path of revenge and killing, only to stand alone at the end with no friends. Yes, the plot is extremely recycled but you could still pull off the same mainstream story if you hone it to near perfection. Afro Samurai, sadly couldn't do that. I hate to admit it but I was so bored at certain points that I felt like dropping it. Luckily I have an ironclad rule of completing every anime/manga I touch upon no matter how cliché it is (unless it's...absolutely, I mean ABSOLUTELY unbearable). I feel like a 12 episode length would make the same story worthwhile but 5 eps were too quick and the story felt incomplete at parts.Art : 10/10Ooof the art and animation made me watch through this no so great series.

There's a jazzy OP with simple 70's style split-screen graphics madness, bounty hunters, western sensibilities.  The prototype for Shinichiro  Watanabe's version which maxed out everything this franchise has.  Unfortunately it does not have Watanabe.What it has is Rally Vincent and Minnie-May causing havoc in Chicago in their Mustang GT500 via their trusty guns and bombs.Watching this OVA after reading the manga is preferable as if you dig the manga then watching it animated after 9 volumes of guncrazy magic, is nice.  Another reason is that 9 volumes doesn't translate into 3...episodes, so you're only getting a small percentage of the glorious fun that is Gunsmith Cats.The OVA feels like its set either during or after the manga and doesn’t bother following anything in the source material or setting up character relationships.  It just jumps right into the lives of Rally and Minnie-May, so casual viewers will either fall on board or check out swiftly, and manga readers will begin enjoying it immediately, just to keep Gunsmith Cats alive for a bit longer.Unfortunately there is a noticeable lack of certain characters in the manga, such as Roy the friendly cop who is relegated to a cameo, Misty the thief who is absent, and there's a gaping black hole where Bean Bandit should be.  Becky's way too nice and Minnie-May appears much younger here also, like a ten year old which makes her hijinks with bounty hunter Rally even more ludicrous, and with absolutely no hint of sexual deviancy that was so rampant in the manga.So yeah, this is filler but like the manga it has an attention to detail with the city of Chicago as a backdrop and other miscellaneous aspects that at least keep the anime somewhat in reality, when every scene with Minnie-May threatens to blow it into fantasy.  The OVA is also full of call-backs to the manga that uber fans will recognise and grin at (prosthetic guns anyone?) so the OVA is going to be an acquired taste.The animation is pretty average but the design is good, cars, guns, gorgeous Rally herself, it’s all watchable so don’t let the year of release put you off.  The music is nothing to shout about unfortunately, as is the direction, editing, writing, ok so other than the brand name this is just standard entertainment.But then the OVA at least does something that the manga did excellently.  That is to say: have an awesome car chase!  A definite highlight of the OVA and one of the best in anime, with kinetic visuals, edge-of-your-seat thrills and all based in reality, with no physics-breaking stunts.And finally the story.

With bounty hunters, ATF, local cops and gunrunners, its hard to go wrong with this anime if your looking for a good action fix that is grounded in reality.Story: the story is great, at least as far as cop stories go.  gun runners,  a Russian assassin, and a dedicated ATF agent back up the two main characters in making this show both fun and intriguing to watch.  Im not going to lie though, the story is simple and you will probably figure it before the end, but thats really not why your...watching is it?Art: When you watch old anime you have to judge the art by its day and not overall.  If you were to judge gunsmith cats art to modern shows like macross frontier your just being unfair.  I give art a 9 because for its day, and compared to other shows (like AD police that some one mentioned earlier) gunsmith cats really blows other shows of its day out of the water.  Its in the detail.  I also live in Chicago and they did do a very accurate job.Sound:  This show has a good music score along with appropriate sounds throughout the show.  Its hard to judge sound, but suffice to say if you dont notice anything wrong they did a good job.Charecters: Theirs just something about old anime and stereotypes.  That said they knew how to make them work.  Every character in gunsmith cats is about as cliche as you can get, but they are worked into the story and with a cliche story the charterers fit right in.Enjoyment:  You may be wondering why I rate it as highly as I do when iv already said its very predictable and cliche.  The reason is that gunsmith cats knows what type of anime it is, and they know that there story is cookie cutter, and that there characters are very stereotypical.  This all said, in our age its about presentation, not originality.  Gunsmith cats is an excellent example of how to take a tried and true story and make you love the characters and engross yourself in there world if only for a little while.If this show cant at least entertain you, your standards are way to high.

The owner of the shop is a gun maniac named Rally Vincent. Rally is incredibly skilled with a gun, but she’s not a superwomen. She’s vulnerable at times, isn’t very lady-like to her dismay, and sort of clumsy and awkward. Her partner is the cute as a button, explosives export “Minnie” May Hopkins. Minnie May is more feminine then Rally and also more experienced with men. While no one doubts her abilities with explosives (grenades and smoke bombs...being her favorite), she is a bit dangerous and way to quick to resort to using them. Sure she’ll blow up the bad guys, but also half the house with them! Together they are the Gunsmith Cats!  They rely on a stingy, greedy, and yet charmingly geeky information export for much of their work, named Becky. The series is based on Kenichi Sonoda’s famous manga of the same name. When the series starts off an ATF Agent named Bill Collins is using a little old fashioned extortion to get the Gunsmith Cats to assist him in a complicated case involving gun runners and a criminal, Jonathan Washington, who Rally and Minnie May just captured for a bounty. Bill Collins drags them down into this case, which leads to gun slinging action, adventure, explosions, and great car chases. The plot is well written involving a possible mole at the ATF (which is not entirely unrealistic considering their checkered history) and many other interesting elements at work at the same time. To get into the plot too deeply however would spoil the fun. This 1995 OVA, rather then start adapting the manga from page 1 or choosing the very best of  Sonoda’s stories, decided to create an anime original plot. The characters, ideas, feel, look, and tone of the manga are all here, but with an all new story. This approach is one I like, as it gives fans of the original manga something new to enjoy, while also allowing people to go back and read the manga and not have to sit through the same stuff they just saw. The anime is a tad less risque then the manga, but I am fine with that.Much like the wonderful Riding Bean, this is much more a Hollywood movie/tv show with gunslinging action scenes, car chases, and traditional police elements, then an anime. And the fanservice here reflects that. The fanservice is actually the good kind: sensual, not creepy, doesn’t take away from the plot, and actually helps develop the cast. And this actually spices up the show. And the show has a sense of humor that works (at least for my tastes). Rally’s car is the famous 1967 Shelby GT 500, and it gets as much attention as any of the main characters do. It is a wonderful car, a joy to look at, and incredibly fast. Clearly this is a car Kenichi Sonoda likes, since it is also featured in Riding Bean. The anime has some excellently animated and well choreographed gun fights and car chases. These are action scenes done right, where we care about the results (and they just look cool to boot). I love the artwork style and presentation of it all. It has that high quality 90′s look that I just eat up. The backgrounds are photorealistic, and really help to bring the city of Chicago to life. Still to this day few series look as good as this (well maybe another gun-porn anime, Gunslinger Girl season one, looks as good). The character designs are a little cartoony, but not entirely unrealistic. There was a lot of attention put into their clothing. Not to mention the girls are easy to look at. The budget must have been through the roof on this series. The music is exciting, and has an American rock/jazz feel to it that wouldn’t seem out of place on an American cop show of the same era. The opening is easily one of the best of the 90′s. And I have to mention that the sound effects for Rally’s car are actually recordings of a real 1967 Shelby Cobra Gt500!! Blows the mind!The dub is another great ADV job done in Houston, Texas. The dub has brilliant casting, excellent acting, a perfect script, and divine directing. This is the kind of perfect storm of a dub that is rare, but ADV often manages to pull off. In this dub everything comes together to give you one hell of a show! This is one of the best dubs of the 1990′s by far. It showcases Matt Greenfield’s excellent ADR talents, more proof he is one of the best directors in the business,  and is another reason why he needs to direct more dubs today. While the script is a little loose, it never changes the intended meanings, and in fact makes the show more authentic. It is made more American, more “ chicagoan” if you will. The slight changes in the phrases said or jokes being made make it more natural and more western. Amanda Winn-Lee plays Rally and gives out another stellar performance worthy of her reputation. She fits the character very well, and her acting is spot on. Kimberly Yates’s voice may be a little high pitched, but this is the only voice that would ever fit Minnie May. Tiffany Grant plays the greedy Becky, and this is not at all who I would expect in that role. But she gives a wonderful, if  unconventional for her, performance here. The star of the dub however may very well be Rob Mungle as Bill, the sleazy, unsavory ATF Agent. He has an aspect to his voice that I can only describe as “middle aged grit”. So I don’t need to mention how perfect he is for this role. It’s a shame he’s been sidelined to background voices and smaller roles over the years, as he has a real talent and great voice for these types of characters who spring up in anime often enough. In Gunsmith Cats his performance often has a whine to it  (“Buuut RALLLY!?”) that seems very genuine, and his acting is top rate. Many of the other characters are cops or tough middle aged guys but they all sound great. Oh and watch out for the Matt Greenfield cameo in episode one!What is interesting about this show is the girls are the stars and the villains. The guys take a back seat to the colorful female cast who do most of the work. And boy do the girls rule! For such a “manly” show that’s pretty much gun-porn and car-porn, we have a strong female cast of characters that make the show very original. The OVA is highly researched, with thanks given to the A.T.F. , The Chicago Police Department, Cook County Sherifs Office, the Chief of Police,2 homicide detectives, ordinary street cops, and plenty of others. The anime team made multiple trips to the United States to scout locations and photograph the city of Chicago and surrounding areas. They also became familiar with firearms while in Chicago, since guns are nearly outlawed completely in Japan (except for the police), this is their only real opportunity to get an up close experience with guns of all types. The anime crew did a lot of work before even starting on this show, and it all paid off completely. You can easily see the care Takeshi Mori and his team took to put this all together. The only problem with the show is it is too short!ADV Films put this out on DVD twice, originally in 2001 and then again in 2004 under their Anime Essentials product line. I have the original DVD release, since it was cheaper to buy new at the time. Both DVDs have the entire 3 episode OVA series, with dub and original Japanese audio with subtitles on it. This show is long out of print, and scalpers on Amazon seem to be asking a pretty penny for both releases, but used copies are more reasonable. I’m just glad I got this brand-new when I did. But it is really worth tracking down this classic. ADV’s DVDs tack on a 40 minute extra feature at the end of the show. The extra feature is about the making of the OVA, which is partially dubbed/narrated by Amanda Winn-Lee. This extra has interviews with the animation’s staff, the original mangaka, features their home video recording of the staff’s trips to Chicago, and plenty of other goodies.  This is the kind of extra we rarely get anymore but is really interesting. Dark Horse Comics put out the manga and that’s worth looking into as well.(original review posted here: http://predederva.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/gunsmith-cats/ ) being her favorite), she is a bit dangerous and way to quick to resort to using them.

The slight changes in the phrases said or jokes being made make it more natural and more western. Amanda Winn-Lee plays Rally and gives out another stellar performance worthy of her reputation. She fits the character very well, and her acting is spot on. Kimberly Yates’s voice may be a little high pitched, but this is the only voice that would ever fit Minnie May. Tiffany Grant plays the greedy Becky, and this is not at all who I would expect in that role. But she gives a wonderful, if  unconventional for her, performance here. The star of the dub however may very well be Rob Mungle as Bill, the sleazy, unsavory ATF Agent. He has an aspect to his voice that I can only describe as “middle aged grit”. So I don’t need to mention how perfect he is for this role. It’s a shame he’s been sidelined to background voices and smaller roles over the years, as he has a real talent and great voice for these types of characters who spring up in anime often enough. In Gunsmith Cats his performance often has a whine to it  (“Buuut RALLLY!?”) that seems very genuine, and his acting is top rate. Many of the other characters are cops or tough middle aged guys but they all sound great. Oh and watch out for the Matt Greenfield cameo in episode one!What is interesting about this show is the girls are the stars and the villains. The guys take a back seat to the colorful female cast who do most of the work. And boy do the girls rule! For such a “manly” show that’s pretty much gun-porn and car-porn, we have a strong female cast of characters that make the show very original. The OVA is highly researched, with thanks given to the A.T.F. , The Chicago Police Department, Cook County Sherifs Office, the Chief of Police,2 homicide detectives, ordinary street cops, and plenty of others. The anime team made multiple trips to the United States to scout locations and photograph the city of Chicago and surrounding areas. They also became familiar with firearms while in Chicago, since guns are nearly outlawed completely in Japan (except for the police), this is their only real opportunity to get an up close experience with guns of all types. The anime crew did a lot of work before even starting on this show, and it all paid off completely. You can easily see the care Takeshi Mori and his team took to put this all together. The only problem with the show is it is too short!ADV Films put this out on DVD twice, originally in 2001 and then again in 2004 under their Anime Essentials product line. I have the original DVD release, since it was cheaper to buy new at the time. Both DVDs have the entire 3 episode OVA series, with dub and original Japanese audio with subtitles on it. This show is long out of print, and scalpers on Amazon seem to be asking a pretty penny for both releases, but used copies are more reasonable. I’m just glad I got this brand-new when I did. But it is really worth tracking down this classic. ADV’s DVDs tack on a 40 minute extra feature at the end of the show. The extra feature is about the making of the OVA, which is partially dubbed/narrated by Amanda Winn-Lee. This extra has interviews with the animation’s staff, the original mangaka, features their home video recording of the staff’s trips to Chicago, and plenty of other goodies.  This is the kind of extra we rarely get anymore but is really interesting. Dark Horse Comics put out the manga and that’s worth looking into as well.(original review posted here: http://predederva.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/gunsmith-cats/ )', ""Oh what to say about Gunsmith Cats? One of the earliest anime I ever had the luxury to view, it was quite a fantastic experience as a teenager. Having recently re-watched the show I found that I enjoyed it even more, having noticed the little details that I disregarded when I was younger (such as the welded on 'S' on the Gunsmith Cats store, obviously indicating that the business was opened before Rally made contact with Minnie May) and understanding a bit more of the culture at hand. That is...Chicago. Yep, this anime takes place in the glorious U.S. of A, so if that isn't...your thing then maybe you should avoid it. That said, let's proceed with the overall story.STORY: 9The story, while not exactly the most in-depth one, is insanely enjoyable. It's not too simple but it's not too complicated--Rally Vincent, the owner of a gunsmith shop in Chicago, is requested to help with a case being investigated by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) via the somewhat sleezy cop Bill Collins, and both her and her friend Minnie May end up in too deep. For only three episodes they make it through the entire story arc very smoothly--the first episode is getting involved with the overall case, the second is the rise of action and suspense, and the final episode is the peak. In general it never seems like there's too much going on due to lack of time despite there being only three episodes.The main reason I give the story a 9 instead of a 10, though, is because despite it being a smoothly executed story...it does run into a few hiccups. My main complaint is the final bad guy. The man behind the conflict, so to say. It just doesn't work as well as it probably should. He just comes off seeming super hammy and forced, which is a real shame considering how well the story builds up to it. It doesn't help that said bad guy isn't introduced until the final episode so we aren't really too assed to care about him, especially since he doesn't really reveal himself until the last ten minutes of episode three. The overall short run also does serve to leave some background characters underdeveloped. So that does weaken the score.ART: 8I like this art. There's really not much for me to say about this besides that--I just like it. But I don't really LOVE it. It looks nice, and the faces have a pretty nice structure. These are based off designs from the manga made by Sonoda Kenichi, and in general his art is well done and well thought out. However, the women have a bad tendency to look alike. The male designs don't suffer from this, as each male character typically has a fairly unique facial structure, but the generic faces of the women does kinda hurt the art. The backgrounds looks fantastic, however. They've really captured the gritty look of Chicago here.SOUND: 8To start, the opening to this is something that I could just listen to all day. The song is completely free of lyrics, and stands out from your typical anime intro by being more focused around a jazzy feel as opposed to a pop feel (which is understandable considering the focus of the show). Comparisons to this choice in music have been made to Cowboy Bebop's 'Tank', and it's a suitable comparison. Both are fantastic earworms.The rest is just kind of a hit and miss. The background music is more okay than it is fantastic. As for the voice work, the dub is surprisingly good for an ADV dub--most of the voices match the characters pretty well and overall they execute the lines pretty well. But it still has some typical early dub issues. Some lines don't match up to the lip movements, and while Rob Mungle does a pretty fantastic job on most of the sarcastic lines for Bill Collins...it's a little more hit and miss when it comes to the dramatic moments. He sounds just flat out kind of silly in dramatic scenes, and really tries to overplay it. Which is a shame, because the rest of the time his execution is perfect.CHARACTER: 9There is nothing I can really criticize about the charac...okay, there is. Let's start from the good points: Rally Vincent is an amazing protagonist. She's smart, sassy, and well equipped to handle the problems that face her but has a cocky side that can lead her into trouble. Minnie May is admittedly kind of a brat, but in a far more endearing way than your typical anime 'little bratty girl' archetype. You can tell she wants to help, she just isn't a very good judge of what is helpful and what isn't so her actions can either lead to great success or great disaster. I've heard a lot of badmouthing towards Bill Collins, the ATF agent, on other sites but I personally think he's a great character and oppositional force to Rally. He's just as cocky as she is, but with a thicker layer of sarcasm and sleeze. That said, he's not a complete ass anyways, since he does show a need to protect Rally and Minnie May as well as crack the case. Personally I think it makes him a really fun character and a lot of good dialogue comes from him.Now let's get to the bad characters. Becky is obnoxious. I don't even know why she's in the show. She consistently serves absolutely no purpose besides balling out Rally and Minnie May. She just bitches and bitches and bitches and doesn't seem to have any helpful skills...I think she's supposed to be their accountant or something, but it's not too clear and it just makes her seem like an annoying space-filler. A lot of the side characters, like Roy and that one ATF chick who shows up in the third episode, don't really do much and probably could've been blessed to be expanded on more. Roy is built up as someone Rally has known for a while, but how? I guess there's only so much to be demanded out of a three episode anime, and they did really good with what they had.OVERALL: I'd give this one a 9/10. It's a REALLY good anime, and I mean REALLY good. I wouldn't go for it looking for any deep or complex plotline but in terms of fun factors...this one should leave the majority of viewers satisfied, if not by the story than at least by the major characters. I'd honestly sit down and pop it in any day. your thing then maybe you should avoid it.

In '95, OLM, Inc. released a three episode OVA. Incidentally, OLM also worked on Steel Angel Kurumi 2, Berserk and the anime that never ends or changes, Pokemon. So, let's take a look at the OVA  and see if it's worth the three episodes.Story:Rally Vincent & Minnie-May Hopkins are bounty hunters who also work as gunsmiths. After a mission, they're approached by agent too much hair oil of the ATF. He coerces them into working for him,...using the gun shop as leverage because Rally, apparently, couldn't be bothered to get a proper license. Someone is sabotaging the ATF's operation to find the mastermind behind the man they just captured and several other illicit arms dealers. Little do they realise,  the case is going to be more difficult and dangerous than it  appears.The biggest issue with the OVA  is just that it's really formulaic. The ultimate antagonist and person behind sabotaging the investigation are both obvious from the first moment you see them. The narrative has no real surprises behind it. Which isn't exactly conducive to getting you invested in the action. The only thing the series really does differently is that it's very deliberate and absurd with how over the top it can get. It doesn't take itself particularly seriously, which definitely leads to its strongest moments.Characters:The bulk of characters in this are tropes played pretty straight. The sleazy cop. The helpful friend. The corrupt politician. The cold-hearted assassin. They're all here. The only two characters who don't quite fit neatly into standard tropes are Rally and May. And the big thing that elevates them above that is the way they interact with one another. These two play off of one another really well, and not just for comedic purposes. They manage when things get more serious as well.Art:The artwork and animation are pretty good. Dated, but still solid. The biggest issue is the way the series shamelessly uses fan-service. We're talking close calls that conveniently tear shirts in order to show  off the bosom shameless. The character expressions are definitely the best element of the artwork. These characters are highly expressive and they do different things with expressions for different characters. May's mischievous grin isn't the same as Rally's more wry smile and they're both distinct from hair oil's faeces consuming grin. The action scenes are pretty good. The car chase in particular.Sound:I'll give OLM full credit for their casting. Our dynamic duo are voiced by Neya Michiko (Riza Hawkeye) and Araki Kae (ChibiUsa). Not only do they both do really well in their roles, but they work well together. I'm not sure if they were ever in the same room while recording their lines, but the direction is good enough that it maintains that illusion. There are some good actors in more minor roles as well, notably Hisakawa Aya, but their performances come across as a bit lacklustre since none of the other characters are particularly strongly written. The score isn't brilliant, but it does suit the OVA well and it has some good pieces. The best being the  tracks played during intense action sequences.Ho-yay:There really isn't any. The closest  you get is Rally offering to buy her trustworthy friend, Becky, dinner in exchange for her help. And that definitely doesn't come across as a date.Final Thoughts:That's Gunsmith Cats. Ultimately, it's a predictable, clichéd action work. The only aspects that save it from true mediocrity are the dynamic betwixt Rally and May and its sense of humour. If you don't mind the tropes and you really love the genre, you may very well enjoy it more than I did. If you want something more original or aren't a fan of this type of thing, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, it was decent enough. My rating is going to be a 6/10.

The former I don't have a problem with as long as there's some type of creativity and interesting characters to go with it. The latter on the other hand is something I do have a problem with, because some anime directors will jam pack the screen with constant bouncy moments and panty...shots that grows very distracting, and the end result is usually a very stale anime with nothing to offer. I usually find myself going to older titles with intentions on reminding myself that the sub-genre can actually be good sometimes. Gunsmith Cats is one of those titles I can still look back on fondly.Gunsmith Cats is a three part OVA based on Kenichi Sonoda's manga series. I have to point out that it's pretty toned down in regards to just about everything when compared to the source material. Some fans of the manga have a problem with that, while I'm just fine with it. The anime works very well on what it focuses on; action, mild comedy, and a straight-forward easy to digest plot that gets to the point.The anime follows expert marksman Rally and bombs specialist Minnie May, as they're tasked to bring down a gun-smuggling operation. They succeed in taking down a minor player, and the result is a mysterious benefactor hiring an ex-KGB turned assassin to take them, and everyone they consider to be loose-ends out of the picture.Gunsmith Cats is all about the action and the high speed chase. It delivers very well on what it promises, plus it does well in delivering a sharp antagonist. The former KGB named Natasha Radinov is a solid enough match for the two, and the razor-thin confrontations with her are exciting enough. There's enough creativity during the action segments, and I can imagine most action fans getting what they want. The shoot outs aren't overly gory, but there are some detailed killings and people mowed down by gunfire.The only problems I can think of would be the lack of character and story development. Rally and May are charismatic enough, however they're such fun characters it would have been nice to see what brought them together and keeps them that way. I like how they're developed as real-life roommates, since they argue about each others choice of take out food. Some background on them would have been very nice. The same in regards to the setting. We know that the guns on the streets are a problem, but the anime never provides a real inside look to this and how exactly it's effecting the community. I feel this could have been examined.I really enjoy the production values. The animation doesn't utilize a re-used cel format, and the gun battles are quick and to the point with some fast paced animation. This also goes for the car chases. The character designs and backgrounds are what stands out to me though. Rally's Cobra looks about as close to the real thing I've seen, and I also have to note the details in the weapons; the SAW M-249's look really great and the sound effects seem accurate, and this also goes for the pistols. It's said that director Takeshi Mori actually flew out to The Windy City and took pictures to bring out that Chicago feel. I never been to the city, but the anime does have a film noir feel to it.Gunsmith Cats meshes its comedy well enough to the point where the action and content doesn't feel like a clash of artistic differences. It doesn't aspire to be anything more than popcorn entertainment and that's not always a bad thing. It would have benefited from a longer run time for better story and character development, plus it could have at least tried to be less preedictable. In any case, I haven't seen the title in more than ten years until this re-watch, and I still find it to be fun.

Rally and May are just impossible not to love, and their comaraderie carries the entire show and its flawless technical aspects on their capable shoulders.it's a shame it's only three episodes!"", 'Based on a longer-running manga that I’m quite interested in reading now, Gunsmith Cats is a three-episode OVA that follows the lives of a half-Indian/half-English gun shop owner named Rally Vincent and her bomb-specialist friend named May Hopkins. The two sell firearms to people by trade, but when the business is slow, they go bounty-hunting. Because what’s wrong with using your own products to earn a little extra cash on the side? The plot of this anime-original story focuses on the two being hired by Chicago investigators to assist in uncovering an illegal gun-running operation and in doing so they uncover corrupt politicians and incur...the wrath of a Russian assassin who takes blows to pride more personally than Montresor from The Cask of Amontillado.Now Gunsmith Cats isn’t exactly revolutionary with the whole Chicago crime formula or anything. You can pretty much predict how everything will go down without much fanfare and aside from the fact that it’s in anime, there’s not too much that stands out about it. As such, the thing relies on its individual elements more than the big picture in order to sell the product to you. And I can’t say I have too many complaints regarding that.First off, if you’re a resident of Chicago, then you’ll probably love how much love and craft the creators put into recreating the setting for their anime. I’ve never been to the place myself, but Gunsmith Cats has a bit of a reputation for being one of the most well-researched Japanese cartoons to ever be created from the feel of the city to the actual Illinois police station. The team behind this apparently visited the place multiple times in order to make sure they knew what they were doing the same way the Durarara guys copied the feel of Ikebukuro, except with plane tickets. Knowing that sort of lends an atmospheric feeling to people who are interested in that sort of thing. Not that I wasn’t sucked into the whole setting before I found that out. That jazzy soundtrack playing in the background does a good job of that.But what I really dug about this thing are the characters. They all range from lovable cops to cartoon-y corrupt politicians, but the main charm lies in the female duo. Specifically when listening to them in that corny, yet sincere, English dub. A pity that Amanda Winn Lee isn’t doing much these days, because I really like her voice.Rally is pretty much your standard fun, but tough, female character who mostly only stands out because these days, anime try too hard with their female characters in regards to fanservice, snarkiness, and just being flat-out-stupid. With that said, there’s a lot of genuine charm to her character that puts her above the other competent females of her type. She’s strong and competent and only has to rely on other people’s help because the opponent is just that hard to beat, and is mostly fighter-first/woman-second. Or funny business person-first, fighter-second, etc., etc. It’s pretty cool to see an underage gun-shop owner in anime, let alone fiction, without it coming across as forced, and for that she’s got my respect even when talking to higher-ups whilst not covering up her underwear.May is a fun character too. She’s hyper, yet competent, and acts as a good foil for Rally’s trigger finger through the use of creative explosions and traps as well as balancing out Rally’s more serious personality. It’s the kind of comedic sidekick that doesn’t make you want to tear you ears out because they say “meesa in trouble” with an irritating voice and contribute as much help as Youhei Sunohara with a pickaxe lodged in his head. My favorite scene involving her was the final confrontation when the Russian assassin had Rally down for the count and May used her wits and traps to blow her to kingdom come. It was like watching the finale of Higurashi, except it was actually cool rather than stupidly boring because it actually looked professional in all its simplicity.Not really sure why female duos like those two aren’t done much in anime, let alone all that well. Maybe it has something to do with the evil that we humans like to call “shipping”. I notice that you can’t have many male duos these days without going “oh look, they’re gay! They’re so gay!”. And people wonder why I’m harsh against Sunrise.Gunsmith Cats isn’t going to change your world or anything of the sort, but it’s a really well-executed example of its genre that gets things done in its limited runtime without overstaying its welcome. The only reason I can see for not recommending it to you is if you hate guns, explosions, fun action heroes, accuracy, good music, and entertainment in general. In other words, if you’re a fan of that anime. You guys know what I’m talking about. That anime that was basically Lord of War except much longer and it removed Nicholas Cage, the one good thing about the movie, from it. the wrath of a Russian assassin who takes blows to pride more personally than Montresor from The Cask of Amontillado.Now Gunsmith Cats isn’t exactly revolutionary with the whole Chicago crime formula or anything. You can pretty much predict how everything will go down without much fanfare and aside from the fact that it’s in anime, there’s not too much that stands out about it. As such, the thing relies on its individual elements more than the big picture in order to sell the product to you. And I can’t say I have too many complaints regarding that.First off, if you’re a resident of Chicago, then you’ll probably love how much love and craft the creators put into recreating the setting for their anime. I’ve never been to the place myself, but Gunsmith Cats has a bit of a reputation for being one of the most well-researched Japanese cartoons to ever be created from the feel of the city to the actual Illinois police station. The team behind this apparently visited the place multiple times in order to make sure they knew what they were doing the same way the Durarara guys copied the feel of Ikebukuro, except with plane tickets. Knowing that sort of lends an atmospheric feeling to people who are interested in that sort of thing. Not that I wasn’t sucked into the whole setting before I found that out. That jazzy soundtrack playing in the background does a good job of that.But what I really dug about this thing are the characters. They all range from lovable cops to cartoon-y corrupt politicians, but the main charm lies in the female duo. Specifically when listening to them in that corny, yet sincere, English dub. A pity that Amanda Winn Lee isn’t doing much these days, because I really like her voice.Rally is pretty much your standard fun, but tough, female character who mostly only stands out because these days, anime try too hard with their female characters in regards to fanservice, snarkiness, and just being flat-out-stupid. With that said, there’s a lot of genuine charm to her character that puts her above the other competent females of her type. She’s strong and competent and only has to rely on other people’s help because the opponent is just that hard to beat, and is mostly fighter-first/woman-second. Or funny business person-first, fighter-second, etc., etc. It’s pretty cool to see an underage gun-shop owner in anime, let alone fiction, without it coming across as forced, and for that she’s got my respect even when talking to higher-ups whilst not covering up her underwear.May is a fun character too.

The 3 episodes are very well researched by the team that made the series. There is stuff such as Amoco signs, which for those that don\'t know, it was a gas company based in Chicago which started in Whiting Indiana(right over the border). The guns in the show are amazingly accurate which is great for a gun nut like myself. I\'ve watched the show multiple times, the plot, the characters, and the research and realism behind it make me come back. The Japanese versions is very great and I prefer it, while I also recommend the team behind the dub...if you would like to. The team behind the dub was also a local Chicago team, meaning that when Rally messes with May by stealing her ""Soda""(for all you non-Midwesterners) May responds by saying ""Give me back my Pop"" which is what we call it in Chicago. Overall it is amazing such as plot and all that jazz, but the research of the city and guns is what makes it truly a great series. if you would like to.

I\'m sure that isn\'t the case for many people from other parts of the world, and so I can\'t be sure how this show would stack up for them, but I was thoroughly immersed.

The three episodes all have a conclusive story each, but still tell a story throughout the whole series. There's not much wrong you can do with this plot and it is executed quite well. Being only 3 episodes long, it also prevents it from ever becoming boring.9/10Art:The characters look a little blocky, something not uncommon for 90s anime. It...still looks better than many tv anime of its time, though it is not as detailed as some of the beloved classics like GitS or Bebop. Something I noticed was that they drove on the right side of the road, which I found was a nice little detail showing they really cared to make this look like America (which also shows in the side cast).7/10Sound:At first I thought the opening was an hommage to Cowboy Bebop...untill I realized that Gunsmith Cats is in fact older. So, is it possibly the other way around? Who knows. It is a pretty cool one, adding to that cop show feeling. The voices were all solid, best being Bill. While not as memorable, the ending had a nice easter egg: The staff thanked all kinds of Chicago facilities like the police department or the local museum, as if it were a real American show with real research taken place.8/10Characters:Like I said a couple of times already, this cast is full of cop show characters. The laid back attitude cop, who goes the extra way to investigate, even though he's told not to? Check. Angry fat boss? Check. Shady political figures? Check. Gangster mooks defending their secret hideout? Check. On top of all the cliche characters (which doesn't mean they're bad) we have the girls. Rally is a pretty cool character, bordering on action hero. I didn't think it was a good idea to have two sidekicks however, combining them into one would've been more than enough for me. Radinov as the antagonist worked pretty well too.8/10Enjoyment:I like a good cop show and Gunsmith Cats is one. As I mentioned, because it is so short, it never even has the chance of becoming boring. The pacing was right, the characters enjoyable, the action scenes were pretty cool, there's not much I can point my finger at. If I were to change something, I'd scratch the ship tease between Bill and Rally that lead nowhere.9/10Overall:8.2/10 still looks better than many tv anime of its time, though it is not as detailed as some of the beloved classics like GitS or Bebop.

It\'s set in Chicago, and tells the adventures of a pair of girls who, on the surface, are just the owners of a firearm store... except they actually earn a secret living as bounty hunters.It features all the things that are common for the genre: flamboyant gunfights, high speed car chases, and even the villain, an ex-KGB Russian woman (why is it that all the Russian villains that appear in these things are ex-KGB??), is ripped straight from some Hollywood list of...cliches. Everything is done well enough for the OVA to be fairly entertaining, which is the whole point of it. The story, like the anime itself, is nothing special, but is good enough to keep me vaguely interested.Compared to other stylish gunslinging action anime like ""Mezzo Forte"" however, ""Gunsmith Cats"" feels a little lacklustre. Not only that, it doesn\'t fully adopt the style either. And unlike anime such as ""Cowboy Bebop"" that manage to combine western and eastern styles perfectly, the fusion in ""Gunsmith Cats"" feels a bit jarring. The Gunsmith Cats themselves (as in the main characters) look like they belong in a different anime from the rest of the characters - they look so much more... kiddy-ish with their large eyed, cartoonish cuteness. The fanservice also seems kinda out of place.""Gunsmith Cats"" may not be the best thing since slice bread (though slice bread itself is rather overrated in my opinion), but it\'s pretty decent. And since it comprises just 3 episodes, it\'s worth checking out as you won\'t be wasting away too much of your life even if you don\'t like it.

It isn't often one finds buried treasure, but that was how it felt to discover this hidden gem of an OVA. Set in my home city of Chicago, Gunsmith Cats stands out for its unique setting for an anime and the high quality it infuses in each of its three episodes. Despite its short length, the series feels full of content and life, leaving the viewer satisfied, if wanting more.Story: The premise is rather straightforward—bounty hunters Rally Vincent and Minnie May get roped into helping an ATF investigation filled with danger and action at...every turn. The highlights of the series are its high-octane action sequences, tailor-made for a Western audience accustomed to Hollywood action movies and 70s cop shows. Gun fights, one of the best car chases in anime history, political conspiracy, and a shootout in The Art Institute of Chicago, a building this author has been in countless times. The OVA is a taste-test from the manga, or just a fun ride to enjoy, accessible even to those who know nothing of the series. Therefore, there isn't much more here than a standard action flick might offer, but for a 3-episode OVA, there isn't much need or space for more. Pure, simple fun.Characters: Rally and Minnie are a lovable duo. One loves guns, the other explosives. It's a treat to watch their teamwork through ever more over-the-top escapades. Other characters, like ATF agent Bill Collins, have their moments, but the short length doesn't leave much time for characterization. This isn't the place to find hard-hitting internal conflict.Animation/Art: Character designs have that iconic 90s anime quality. Fans of the era will be pleased. Animation and effects elevate the action and spectacle well. It's no Akira, but it is visually appealing, nevertheless.Music: Fantastic soundtrack perfectly evoking the cop show vibe the show's going for. The opening tune got stuck in my head so many times.Overall Enjoyment: Even with no experience with the source material, Gunsmith Cats is a wild ride. The larger-than-life action, fun characters, and American setting make the short series an enjoyable experience for anime fans and more Western oriented fans alike. A hidden gem in every respect—give this short series the love it deserves! every turn.

And some of the worst voice acting I\'ve ever heard. Honestly there is nothing really unique about Gunsmith Cats that brings me to recommend it. Everything here is rather middling, unless you care a lot about firearms your not going to get much out of this. It feels like a good concept that no one put enough effort into to really sell it.At the end of the day, Gun Smith Cats feels like filler.

While the story is pretty straightforward, I can't help finding lots of the charm to its cast of characters: Rally Vincent and Minnie May are really a fun duo to watch. On top of this, the story never get boring and the 3 episodes connect pretty well with each other. For a very quick summary of the story, our 2 ladies are basically working with the ATF (and particularly ATF agent Billy) in order to regain their license to buy weapons. They obviously lost...it due to the ATF, so it brings up some funny tension between Rally, Minnie and Billy.I was greatly surprise by the level of details in the background art, the guns, the cars etc, they are all brilliantly working well into the OVA. It is definitely looking like you are in America from the details, I mean I was surprised just by the fact they have the Illinois flag in the first episode.The music is also something to praise, I find it catchy, funky, with its jazzy vibe. It goes well with most of the parts of the anime. I am not exactly a fan of the ending music, but the opening is pretty rad music and design wise.Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by the OVA which, from what I understood, is an original story, unrelated to the manga. I would recommend this OVA to anyone that loves police/detective story with a fun and charming lady duo. it due to the ATF, so it brings up some funny tension between Rally, Minnie and Billy.I was greatly surprise by the level of details in the background art, the guns, the cars etc, they are all brilliantly working well into the OVA.

I would say to that, that it\'s a 3 part OVA and so it\'s not that big of a commitment, the second and third episodes are also very much the same as the first so you can get a feel for the show quite...quickly and decide if it\'s for you or not. Much of the shows charm is that it stands on its own as a story without the need to rely on (too many) tropes and set pieces. So if you like something more original, or at least as original as an 80\'s action type show can offer, then definitely check it out.Obviously this show is not as aesthetically polished as shows made these days, especially the ones backed by the bigger studios. But there-in lies much of its charm. The animation is still of a high grade despite its age (if you can forgive the rough edges caused by the old animation technology that made it) and the actual frame to frame animation is going to be more pure and dynamic as a result of being hand drawn (i find even the best of the modern shows to have somewhat stiff characters, you see it in shows like Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei where the characters, as full of detail as they are, feel like statues because they never really do anything with their arms unless they have to). There\'s a classic cartoon style to be seen that you just don\'t get anymore with modern shows that take themselves far too seriously. You\'ll find the same innocent quirkiness in other shows of the era like Tri-gun, Tenchi Muyo, Dominion: Tank Police, Full Metal Panic; effectively late 80\'s going on early noughties.The character designs are straight out of an 80\'s Hollywood action classic which also matches the music and overall atmosphere of various scenarios like the ""police precinct"". There\'s not much to be said here, it all fits, it\'s a tad cliché, but the kind of cliché that it would feel lesser without it. The personalities are also relatable; they\'re trope-y in a Hollywood fashion it has to be said, but not so overbearing that they\'re not believable as individuals like some cookie cutter characters are. The mature tone also lends itself to this story telling and i\'m not talking about sex scenes or violence, but that the show focuses around adults doing adult things without it explicitly being a skit, even if it seems like they\'re often goofing around).One thing that will strike you about the show is the overall attention to detail that is one display. A lot of modern shows rely on obnoxious main character designs and set service pieces to carry other elements that can be neglected because ""the important boxes were ticked""; and whilst there are 2 or 3 ""panty shots"", they don\'t feel like panty shots because they\'re written in to a believable scene or a scene where the main focus is not the pants; you could say it was supplementary servicing. But back to my point, a lot of the shows quality can be observed in both it\'s background art, vehicle designs and even the sound. There\'s one scene that involves a car chase and someone lands on a car bonnet and it actually sounds like someone landing on a car bonnet as opposed to a generic muffled metallic thud sound bite bought off a stock website.Without spoiling too much of the show (even though it could be argued as being quite predictable) It\'s well paced and well rounded. The main characters could use a little development, but it\'s a 3 part OVA and not a full seasonal show. It\'s just an overall pleasure to watch even if i do have a bias towards 90\'s action anime. quickly and decide if it\'s for you or not. Much of the shows charm is that it stands on its own as a story without the need to rely on (too many) tropes and set pieces. So if you like something more original, or at least as original as an 80\'s action type show can offer, then definitely check it out.Obviously this show is not as aesthetically polished as shows made these days, especially the ones backed by the bigger studios. But there-in lies much of its charm. The animation is still of a high grade despite its age (if you can forgive the rough edges caused by the old animation technology that made it) and the actual frame to frame animation is going to be more pure and dynamic as a result of being hand drawn (i find even the best of the modern shows to have somewhat stiff characters, you see it in shows like Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei where the characters, as full of detail as they are, feel like statues because they never really do anything with their arms unless they have to). There\'s a classic cartoon style to be seen that you just don\'t get anymore with modern shows that take themselves far too seriously. You\'ll find the same innocent quirkiness in other shows of the era like Tri-gun, Tenchi Muyo, Dominion: Tank Police, Full Metal Panic; effectively late 80\'s going on early noughties.The character designs are straight out of an 80\'s Hollywood action classic which also matches the music and overall atmosphere of various scenarios like the ""police precinct"". There\'s not much to be said here, it all fits, it\'s a tad cliché, but the kind of cliché that it would feel lesser without it. The personalities are also relatable; they\'re trope-y in a Hollywood fashion it has to be said, but not so overbearing that they\'re not believable as individuals like some cookie cutter characters are. The mature tone also lends itself to this story telling and i\'m not talking about sex scenes or violence, but that the show focuses around adults doing adult things without it explicitly being a skit, even if it seems like they\'re often goofing around).One thing that will strike you about the show is the overall attention to detail that is one display. A lot of modern shows rely on obnoxious main character designs and set service pieces to carry other elements that can be neglected because ""the important boxes were ticked""; and whilst there are 2 or 3 ""panty shots"", they don\'t feel like panty shots because they\'re written in to a believable scene or a scene where the main focus is not the pants; you could say it was supplementary servicing. But back to my point, a lot of the shows quality can be observed in both it\'s background art, vehicle designs and even the sound. There\'s one scene that involves a car chase and someone lands on a car bonnet and it actually sounds like someone landing on a car bonnet as opposed to a generic muffled metallic thud sound bite bought off a stock website.Without spoiling too much of the show (even though it could be argued as being quite predictable) It\'s well paced and well rounded. The main characters could use a little development, but it\'s a 3 part OVA and not a full seasonal show. It\'s just an overall pleasure to watch even if i do have a bias towards 90\'s action anime.', 'With it’s upbeat music, angled action sequences, explosions, and guns, Gunsmith Cats is made to feel like an American 90’s film featuring bounty-hunting action. The main characters find trouble, get blackmailed. Crazy shit will happen first, the cops come after. The twist is that two cute girls are main characters.Vincent (Rally) is the one in charge. She does things her way and wants to do it alone. Minnie May is the crazy-explody girl who loves to end every event with a bang. They live together and share a strong bond. There’s also Becky, who isn’t nearly as bold as the main two, thus being often...ignored.The action events can get pretty intense, and are executed well. When Rally is in a pinch, the show will leave you wondering what she’s thinking. She appears to have a set plan, but it’s seldom spoken out. It just happens. The enemies as well as May and Bill have their quirks of killing, however, Rally is specifically fun to watch because of her skill with the gun. She can just shoot a bunch of guys, roll, reload on a knee, and balancing a magazine on her foot, shoot some more. Then she’ll kick her foot up, catch the mag in the air and reload.The director, Takeshi Mori, had little knowledge of guns before the production of the show, and went out of his way to learn about it. He’s no Watanabe, but I give him props for doing some homework. Some staff members, also, made many trips to Chicago in order to locate Gun shops and Police departments, which increased the shows authenticity.One flaw is how bland the plot is. It has its twists, but it’s missing that spark a show needs.The soundtrack is very 90’s, bringing you back to that golden age of city life, though outside of that it isn’t special. Visually, very 90’s too, and I like that.The show isn’t very special or memorable. It lacks a strong message. All we have is Rally’s final lines: “I have to stand up by myself. That’s what you’ve got to do in this town...” like, it’s a city. What the fuck. ignored.The action events can get pretty intense, and are executed well.

Because of this, Gunsmith Cats–based on a manga of the same name–was refreshing in that it is set in such a familiar place and is actually quite American in the style and themes of the story. It’s the first of the OVA’s I’ve watched so far that I was sad to see end and wonder at how it only managed a three episode run.Rally Vincent and her partner May run a gunsmith shop in Chi-town but also take the occasional mercenary job. When an ATF...agent blackmails the girls into taking on a mission, they wind up embroiled in a battle against gun runners that is somehow tied to the political campaign of a local senator. Complicating things further is a Russian assassin who doesn’t seem to die no matter what the girls do.As a three episode adventure it’s cohesive and entertaining. It has a clear beginning, middle, and end and the story neither overstays its welcome nor bores. We are quickly introduced to a pair of cute girls–Rally being the badass while May is more a childish explosives lover–as well as the gun-centric action that is the biggest selling point of the anime. From there the action is constant, there’s enough fan service to keep eyes glued to the screen, and the pacing is good enough to have you watch the entire OVA in one sitting.Our main heroines aren’t as three-dimensional as I usually like but given the limitations of the show, they’re entertaining enough and work well together. Other characters are one-dimensional, including the assassin the girls battle and the ATF agent they work with.The action is fast and exciting though nothing of real note aside from a pretty good car chase sequence in the second episode. The final battle against the assassin is especially anti-climactic and leaves you wanting just a little more.The animation is noticeably dated though it does a good job of recreating the kind of car, gun, and regular porn (did I mention these girls are half naked a lot) that keeps the guys glued to their seats. The music is pretty good as well, a cheesy jazz soundtrack that hearkens to buddy cop movies of the 80’s.What truly sets this show apart is the fact it is set in Chicago and it’s noticeable. From the Cubs shirt that May wears to the use of the Art Institute of Chicago as a final set piece (despite the fact it is nowhere near an accurate representation) to the fact Illinois politicians are all corrupt sacks of shit, Gunsmith Cats does a pretty good job of representing a non-Japan setting.While not a memorable romp, Gunsmith Cats is entertaining while it lasts and certainly worth a watch for those who wish their anime came with a little more gunplay. It’s a pulpy show that failed to generate a lot of interest in Japan because of it (very rarely does it seem that more realistic action shows do well), but should still be regarded as a good adaptation of the manga (which I will review at some point). It’s too bad this never made the cut to be a full series. agent blackmails the girls into taking on a mission, they wind up embroiled in a battle against gun runners that is somehow tied to the political campaign of a local senator.

All anime plans have this very agile and objective character, not only in action scenes, but also in their dialogues and more informative plans.Although the anime is divided into 3 episodes, and both have their own ""end"", the main...conflict exists and connects in both. This one, of course, will be more present until the last episode arrives. There\'s a scene in the first episode, when Rally goes to Jonathan for a deal. Before she enters the room, the anime does a very quick close-up of the website Jonathan is viewing, and then she enters. Apparently, it\'s just a scene with a comic intention (since the character appears to be watching a pornographic website), but that has its relevance in the following episodes. Or the scene where Bill is talking in Chief George\'s office. As Bill leaves the room, the Chief receives a phone call from the State Representative, who is above him. (Bill\'s own phrase as he leaves the room also reinforces this moment: “Being in such a high place, they keep him very busy.”)All the important information in the anime communicates very well in a visual way.The character Radinov, in the scene where she is sent to kill Jonathan, in addition to accomplishing her feat, she also kills the other officers who are there. In the confrontation, she gets shot, but is protected by her bulletproof vest (which is a cape), and comes out unscathed from the shooting and returns to her accommodation. In the car chase scene in the second episode, she gets a wound on her ear, and this makes her very angry – even vengeful in the next episode. All this shows that her physical integrity is something very important. It is even more relevant in the final episode, when the character is shot dead by the Rally, and the shot shows the bullets going through her body and being stopped by her cape.Being visually informative is something that many animes, movies, series, etc. manage to do very well, but Gunsmith Cats has its very agile character and objective of informing. It won\'t stop precious seconds for the viewer to pay the most attention to that detail and wait for that one to be revealed later. Gunsmith Cats will frame one shot, and will already switch to another shot; shows something happening, corrects the framing and switches to another shot. It\'s an anime, which even when it\'s not in an action scene, it\'s always in constant motion. The continuity of the scenes has a very good sense and rhythm.It is not an anime that will worry about a dramatization, history or future of the characters and the plot. Everything that is experienced in the anime begins and ends very quickly.Even some character traits are more immediate and “obvious” with the intention of not having to specify too much about them. May has this more childlike appearance, a voice with a more spontaneous tone, and in action, in a comical way, she displays this more carefree and explosive side. Officer Bill can already be assumed, from his clothes and way of talking, that he is someone brazen and a little ham. Radinov is already this emotionless, rude, superior character.The way that director Takeshi Mori used, composed and staged elements and characters in the scene, even if some small details, within a very frenetic and informative style worked very well. conflict exists and connects in both.

She is roommates with May Hopkins, an explosives expert and they are best friends with Becky Farah, an expert hacker/whatever else the plot needs her to be. The duo gets blackmailed by a government ATF agent who wants them to track down an illegal guns dealer which leads to a bunch of shootouts, car chases, and a bunch of mindless fun. This isn\'t a show you watch for the plot. It\'s rather basic and at times is...laughably bad, but it\'s a lot of fun.Visuals: A+ *The reason I watched this in the first place. My roommate was on his Xbox watching a YouTube video that was talking about this show and just from glimpsing at the panels, I fell in love with the show\'s aesthetic! The character designs are adorable, the animation style is super cute, and the fight sequences and car chases look awesome!Voice Acting: B- *I started with the sub and was not impressed. So I switched to the dub and was both surprised and delighted to find out how many voices from this show would later voice on the dub of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Anna Winn Lee, (Rei Ayanami) the voice actress for Rally,  apparently talked her friend Allison Keith (Misato) to play a couple side characters in this. Kimberly Yates (Hikari) voices May Hopkins. And Tiffany Grant (Asuka) voices the girl\'s friend Becky Farah. Plus, Aaron Krohn (Kaji) voices a corrupt senator named Edward Haints. Much like the Eva dub, there are quite a few laughably bad side character voices, but I was enjoying the recognizing the Eva voices too much to care. And I still can\'t believe that Rally Vincent is Rei!Film Score/Soundtrack: A *Bebop before Cowboy Bebop. Super fun jazz to go along with the car chases and shootouts.***My favorite track: Big City(Probably the catchiest and most fun song on the soundtrack)Characters: B- *In three episodes there isn\'t a lot of time to get super invested in any of the characters, but I still can\'t help but enjoy what they were building up to. Rally Vincent is the badass protagonist that can\'t do anything wrong... except for cooking and doing anything that is considered girly. Her roommate May Hopkins was a former prostitute so she knows all about making herself look good for dates but also has an insatiable love of excitement. And explosions in particular. And even though she is really little and is nowhere near as deadly up close as Rally is, May is tenacious and is aways eager to help out and make things go BOOM lol! Becky needs the most explanation as to what the hell she is and how she can do all that she does, but she is the voice of reason amongst the trio and is the "" girl in the chair"" of the group. And lastly, William Collins, (voiced by Rob Mungle aka the voice of the Cat in the Ghost Stories dub) the ATF agent had a cute flirty-thing going on with Rally that I would have liked to see develop if the show had more episodes.Cringeworthy Anime Moments: This entire show is fanservice. There\'s no point complaining about it. For the most part, I don\'t mind it at all. The only scene that made me roll my eyes was when a giant crane hook nearly impaled Rally Vincent, but instead, all it did was rip open her first layer of clothing which left her in a bra and panties to do a backflip off of the platform to incapacitate the last few baddies. It was a ""are you serious"" moment that I couldn\'t help but laugh at and say ""Oh Japan, never change you horny bastards.""Opening Titles: B *Cute and fun just like the show.Final Verdict: 7/10 *Not a show that needs to be analyzed too much. It\'s a super fun three-episode OVA series about two gorgeous bounty hunter anime girls kicking butt. It\'s got a gorgeous aesthetic, awesome action, shameless fanservice that fits in the themes of this show, catchy music, and just enough plot to keep me interested and genuinely wanting more. laughably bad, but it\'s a lot of fun.Visuals: A+ *The reason I watched this in the first place.

In the end, I had a great time with this little story! If you want an anime take on those classic American action shows/films, this is for you! Awesome action, jazzy music, a fun story, and good comedy! The story had me invested and the pacing was great, so I never felt bored and time flew by. If this was a full length series some issues may have popped up and I might of bumped it down to a 9, but...it felt perfect with this short length.One last thing I'd like to praise the show for is the art. I always have a soft-spot for traditional/non-digital animation, and this is no exception. The background and setting art was beautiful, and it was especially fun to see Chicago depicted inside an anime. Additionally, the characters had nice designs and there was a wide variety of fun expressions! Lastly, I loved the stylish intro for the show. it felt perfect with this short length.One last thing I'd like to praise the show for is the art.

Lastly, I loved the stylish intro for the show."", ""Gunsmith Cats is a cool as hell cop comedy with a heaping dose of drama, and is delightfully 90s right down to its very bones. Needless to say, this makes for a pretty excellent time. Beginning with the story, it's set up in such a way so as to evoke an unmistakably American flavor, and this is a repeating theme throughout the show's 3 episode run. It manages to blend plot progression with comedy and action in a seamlessly Americanized style, which not only makes for an engaging story but is also simply a feat of writing and directing on its own. Of course, it...does feel a little predictable, but with this kind of story that's not really that big of a deal as long as it reaches that obvious ending with some style. This leads me into the art, which is easily the best part of Gunsmith Cats. The background of 90s Chicago is electric and visually compelling, while the character designs are immaculate and stylized, but then there are of course the guns. All the guns. Gunsmith Cats features a firearm of some sort in damn near every scene, and as such the guns which feature in the anime are minutely accurate down to the very last detail, and it's easy to tell that the people behind this anime have a deep respect and admiration for the firearm as a tool of self defense, but also as a technological work of art in its own right. The guns in this anime could probably serve as schematics for a stage prop in a pinch. In terms of sound, that's very hit-or-miss in this case. The music and sounds of life are finely tooled and very impressive, while the English dub, which I watched because they're based out of Chicago, is very lackluster, taking me out of immersion with every weird slip-up. But, where it lacked in the voice acting department, it makes up for it in regards to the characters which navigate that story. The motivations of Irene, May, and agent William are all so entertaining and ultimately human that one can ask for little else at the end of the day. Overall, Gunsmith Cats is a great anime, tackling issues of gun control, corruption, and fraud all while maintaining an atmosphere of rugged individualism, which pays off every time. This is a definite recommend, and I'd even wager to say that it's better than most of the cop shows running today, period. does feel a little predictable, but with this kind of story that's not really that big of a deal as long as it reaches that obvious ending with some style.

It feels like an old school American action movie and there wasn't a single scene wasted! The artstyle, the sound design, the animation; it's all perfect! Even has the classic American-style pacing and storytelling you'd expect from 80s and 90s Hollywood films!!Much like Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro I went in without any expectations or prior knowledge of the series (other than its connection with Riding Bean, another awesome anime) and once again I got a complete and satisfying story from beginning to end. It's a simple one, but it works and the creators made sure to get the most out of it.What...an opening too! One of my favorites for sure! So full of colour and energy!! This is what an anime opening (or any opening for that matter!) should be like! Banger OST as well!!There were a few campy scenes, but overall the action wasn't mindless. There was clear planning involved in each of the characters' moves and each had their own motives. The final battle in particular stood out the most; they kept it short and simple but it was clear the characters were all pros. What's amazing is the sheer number of people they contacted to make this series as realistic as possible. They really knew their stuff and it shows.If I had to nitpick is that there're surprisingly few deaths for a show all about guns and shootouts, but maybe it wouldn't click with the artstyle they went with. At the end of the day, it's still a masterpiece!I'm down for a rewatch anytime, anyday! Really glad I watched this one! Cannot recommend enough!! an opening too! One of my favorites for sure!

Based on the manga by Sonoda Kenichi, serialized in Kodansha\'s Monthly Afternoon magazine, it was produced by studio OLM in 1995. You might know it as the studio behind the original 1997 Berserk anime.Gunsmith Cats is the story of Irene Vincent, Rally for short, May Hopkins, and Becky Farrah, the members of the Gunsmith Cats freelance bounty hunter company, which also doubles as a walk-in gun store.The story of GSC is mediocre at best. Devil-may-care Spike Spiegel wannabe law enforcement agent hires the GSC girls to help him with an investigation,...they reluctantly agree, wonder if he can be trusted, things go sideways, they find out there\'s some kind of a mole within law enforcement, an evil ex-special forces something-or-other antagonist makes an appearance, shootouts and car chases ensue.The artwork is that of classic 90s anime, with the giant eyes and overly rigid and dazzling hairstyles. While the animation would not impress today, it would have been fairly top shelf back in 1995. Having said that, there\'s a car chase in episode 2 that I would argue stands the test of time and shits on 99.99% of all content from the 2000s. Watching a giant truck crash all over the place without a single CG element was impressive to say the least.While there is some sexual innuendo in the first episode, and you get to see one of the girls wearing a thin shirt which allowed her nipples to poke out ever so subtly, there\'s no nudity or innuendo whatsoever for the rest of the anime, so I got my hopes up for nothing. Least they could\'ve done is show me a titty for my troubles, honestly. For what it\'s worth, such as it was, little as though it was, it was sexy - not Golden Boy sexy, but sexy nonetheless.I called it a dollar store Cowboy Bebop and I stand by that statement. Just look up the opening on YouTube. It\'s almost a 1 to 1 copy of the Bebop OP, except the tune isn\'t nearly as groovy. That said, ""not as groovy as literally some of the grooviest tracks the medium has to offer"" is not much of a condemnation. Point and fact, both the opening and particularly the ending feature some very classy jazz tracks. As I am writing this, I am listening to the ED on repeat.Still, me calling GSC mediocre isn\'t the insult you might think it is, for I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is simply an indication that I did not enjoy it as much as I would have expected to, given its popularity, for make no mistake, it has a decent following. This leads me to an inescapable conclusion.The anime medium suffers from a decisive lack of proper, mature crime thriller content – no, not supernatural shit like Gungrave, not zoomer garbage like Banana Fish. I’m talking about proper noir crime thrillers with guns and investigations and car chases and all that good old school DeNiro stuff. Samurai swords shooting lasers and magical girls are all fine and dandy, but anime fans are so starved for this kind of content that even something as unimpressive as Gunsmith Cats can achieve cult classic status.I appreciate it for what it is and can only hope that, one of these days, someone will make an anime Jason Bourne or James Bond without any silly cartoon trappings like in, say, Netflix\'s Hero Mask. they reluctantly agree, wonder if he can be trusted, things go sideways, they find out there\'s some kind of a mole within law enforcement, an evil ex-special forces something-or-other antagonist makes an appearance, shootouts and car chases ensue.The artwork is that of classic 90s anime, with the giant eyes and overly rigid and dazzling hairstyles.

Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35889/Hakata_Tonkotsu_Ramens,"[""the only baseball anime i will ever watch!!i only started watching this because of yuki kaji, but i ended up falling in love with it. for people who enjoy character-driven stories like me, this is a great anime to watch. it's very satisfying to see how all of the characters come together and become some sort of found family.the arcs aren't drawn out, but instead of feeling rushed, they just make me feel more satisfied. they spend a bit of time in each arc introducing and fleshing out a character, which is to be expected with how many there are in the group. it doesn't...feel disjointed though.the music is also great!!! the jazz ed playing at high points of the episodes kind of remind me of archer a bit. and the op is a quality bop as well!!the only thing that bothers me is how they use light in scenes outside, but other than that, i really love this anime. hope more people watch it!! feel disjointed though.the music is also great!!! the jazz ed playing at high points of the episodes kind of remind me of archer a bit. and the op is a quality bop as well!!the only thing that bothers me is how they use light in scenes outside, but other than that, i really love this anime. hope more people watch it!!"", ""(Spoiler Warning)Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens was one of the Winter 2018 anime I've anticipated for quite a while, and it truly delivered the punch that it deserves.Story:The city of Fukuoka (or Hakata City as always mentioned) is not your usual city, while it thrives on the outside world, its citizens are literally another story. Basically, the thing is, one in every three citizens is are revenge-job-seeking hitmen, killers (whether hired or not) and detectives, all laying low in the lurch.Zenji Banba is one of those private detectives in the Hakata area, trying to seek out hitmen companies so that he could interfere with their hitmen jobs,...and that raises the aspect of hitmen Ling Xianming, a crossdressing man who's complaining about the lack of jobs and pay of his hitmen agency. A killer job out to exterminate Banba sets him the job of partnering with him and the slew of casts who are tied together with him (Saitou, hire-turn-target for Murder Inc, Enokida the mushroom head and intelligent hacker, the other hitmen Jiro and his caretaker Misaki) to figure out the disturbings of Hakata city.Based off a novel series of the same name, I was immediately pumped by the setting and was deeply enthralled with the killing (be advised, no one below 18 should watch this) and action that kept me engrossed all the while, and I wasn't disappointed one bit.Characters:Zenji Banba isn't your causal, typical detective. Nicknamed the Niwaka Samurai for his slick-sharp ninja skills, he's considered the primary target for most of the hitmen, including the organization (sorry I forgot the name) that on hindsight oversees the entire hitmen situation, and with the help of his friends, he's always a step above the competition. His love for ramen, pollock roe and baseball defines the show's title and it's uncanny but good information.Ling Xianming the crossdressing man who's on a mission to figure out the death of his sister, is the usual hitmen, until (as mentioned) the very agency he worked for are the culprits behind the murdering, and storms on a rage to get his revenge back. His young appearance with Fei-lan serves as both a brother and a backstabber, as his killing-ridden youth serves him the purpose of being a hitmen to this day. Never a man that's cool on jokes, he primarily serves to get his job done with the least amount of disruption possible.Kazuki Saito is your average hired hitmen that really can't seem to do his job well after a hiring from Murder, Inc. that leaves him in tropes that nothing ever goes well for him, and that relegates him into secondary character development.Enokida, Banba's best informant and hacker, is also uncanny, but the best character I have seen in this series: Intelligent, knows his way around things, and even if in a tight corner, plays the trick games to eliminate his opponents into oblivion. His signature hacking is displayed by his red mechanical spiders that pick up info, and serves great information for him as sort of a pick-up. His relationship with his father is canon to the series, once admonished for hacking his dad's stuff, was sent to be killed but given a chance to live in Hakata and reestablish him as an alias to his real identity.Shunsake Saruwatari (or Sarucchi as Nitta calls him) the hitmen sent to kill Banba (that no one else can kill) and Naoya Nitta the consultant on child murders both have a relationship that extends beyond the agency that they once worked for, Murder Inc. Their young days were spent playing baseball, and with that relationship, extends to the hitmen days where Sarucchi (like Lin) was getting tired of lesser jobs, and left Murder Inc on the job to exterminate Banba. Unfortunately, crossing with Banba with his always miss-the-target shirukens, so his killing resolves into another day.The other characters (Jiro the other hitmen, Misaki his caretaker) really did a good job showing off their character traits, and that's something that I really treasure with the series, it's really good.Art/Animation:Satelight really did their magic on this, and it really feels on-point with the lavishing visuals of Hakata City, no to mention the murders that though feel like uncensored, but it really fleshes out the series as its driving tour de force. The character designs were really nice and thought out through and through, giving the series the stylized, serious but casual look. Well done and well played.Sound:It's weird for an OST to have a jazz-sounding track on here, but it's the same reason that is exemplifies the series when it comes in adherence to the settings that the series is based upon. With that said, the OST here is nothing short of a great job done, with the OP really giving the sense of the killing and murder intent and the ED totally jazz-sounding end card that showcases the series setting (AGAIN) and rounds it up like a summary.Overall:Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens definitely isn't a show for those below 18 (age-restriction), but it highlights what it was supposed to do, and it does that well. Moreover, like me, if you came into this with the PVs before it, the anticipation really turned out to be an experience not to be missed. With that said (for anime onlys), if you're up for the action, I'd recommend this to you, it's one of the great shows of the Winter season. and that raises the aspect of hitmen Ling Xianming, a crossdressing man who's complaining about the lack of jobs and pay of his hitmen agency.

It doesn't make sense, it's overflowing with clichés and one could ask why the hell does it even exist. Yet, it does and I have to bear with the fact that it'll continue to exist. Because there is one reason why it does still make a lot of money. And that reason is the action, because action equals entertainment. But entertainment, like Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens perfectly shows, doesn't equal quality.The story takes place in a city Fukuoka, which, in this fictional version, is overflowing with killers and assasins. So much infact that...the show itself tells you that 3% of Fukuoka's population are indeed those blood-seeking hitmen. Wait.. what? Let's take a minute and think about how ridiculous that number is. Speaking in the name of math, every 33rd person is a killer, and we are not counting those who are not directly killing, but work within the hitmen system aswell, hence the number of people either working or helping the hitmen companies is even more ridiculous. Not only it begs a question like 'why doesn't the police or goverment do anything about it' it's also absurd to believe that such a city could even exist as it would be very normal for people to move out of a city in which there are murders happening at every corner of the street. Oh but please don't missunderstand, I don't want this show to be realistic, I purely want it to make sense. Which it doesn't.You might start complaining that I'm digging too much into details that are not supposed to be the main factor of the show and that I'm just nit-picking to find mistakes in it. Which is fair, because I propably am, however I just can't stand that the show tries to act normal and peaceful even though the information it provides suggest almost everyone should be dead by now and the whole city should be in shambles. And it's not just that. Nothing about the show makes sense. I have an another example. There are some sort of detectives, which might make you think that somebody wants to do something about the situation. However, the only thing the detectives do is kill the 'bad guys', which results in more mad people, which results in more hitmen jobs, which results in more killed people. Good job Mr. Detective, you really saved the city this time around.One thing I hear a lot when defending a non-sense making show is that it's just making fun of itself, which is something I understand and can respect. In terms of Hakata however, it just seems like a lame excuse. Sure, all the things I've written might make it seem like the show is a one big satire. However, even if that's supposed to be the case, it doesn't work. A show that it worked quite well in is for example Animegataris. Which was just a parody in general, and a good one at that. Hakata is not a parody. It's creators exaggerated every single statistic number to new heights to make it seem like it's an original idea and then completely forgot to explain why are the things as ridiculous as they are. That's a parody? No, that's laziness.In terms of the actual story, the show could be divided into a couple of arcs in which always some sort of bad guy who likes to kill people appears only then to be killed or reformed to a good guy in the end. Sounds plain and simple and that is exactly the case. It always tries to give us background information about some of the characers, but not only those moments fail at making me care about them, the flashbacks themselves are in most times so overused and cliché that you can't even take much from them. There was for example that classic case of two best friends forced to kill each other in order for one of them to survive. Which is as cliché as you could possibly get. The whole story development also lacks a lot of drive and almost every episode, even if having a different villain and resolving around a different character, always had the same feeling as the ones before. Overall, the story ended up being a huge pile of rubbish mess that didn't make any sense and wasn't even interesting one bit.Another thing that supports my claim of Hakata being a bad anime are the characters. Which are (suprisingly?), just very bad. I guess I'm gonna start with the main duo, Bamba and Lin. Both of them are hitmen and they start living together because of circumstances I don't even remember anymore. Bamba is a.. nice guy, potentially. A classic case of an outgoing, caretaking MC that would normally end up with the female MC. I said normally because there is not really a female MC present. But you know who is? It's Lin. A guy, who is, for untold reasons, wearing women clothes and a blonde wig for the whole show. Yes guys, that 'girl' on the cover is a guy in reality. Well, atleast the show says it. I personally wouldn't want to believe it because outside of having a male voice-actor, that guy is just a classic anime woman in heart. You know, just a 'trap' in general. And I hate traps. They are always the most bland and poorly developped characters in the entire show and their only purpose to exist is to get the memes going for you. Which is a process just begging for attention. He is also an extreme Tsundere, which is just a terrible personal trait for males in general and the whole series makes it seem like he has a thing for Bamba. All hail yaoi? Well, nothing really happens (thank god), but the feeling is certainly there at times. And while the show tries to make us care about both of them, neither of the two appealed to me in any way. Quite the opposite actually.As for the other characters, I don't think anyone is even worth mentioning. There is really a lot of side characters and almost none get any actual screen-time. The reason for that is that the show really overdid it with the number of people shown. You'll realize soon enough that there are so many characters just standing in the background doing absolutely nothing, that really shouldn't even be there. The problem of so many random characters came in place when some of the kinda important ones really started to blend together and I just didn't know which one of the bad guys is on the screen anymore. And talking about characters, I think the show tried too hard to 'please' everyone with the personalities diversity. There is the super-smart guy, the loli, the strong guy, the dumb and aggresive guy, the Tsundere, the nice guy, the innocent and clumsy guy and some others. I'm not saying that this would't work under different circumstances, however in this case it felt like the show once again tried to hide it's huge flaws behind a thing that could possibly appeal to the audience, which could result into them not noticing the actual mess. And by the mess I mean the non-existent plot continuity and terrible character development.The last thing the show does and the only thing I can agree does atleast respectably well is the action. Environment around hitmen and assasins provides quite a lot of ground for fightning and killing and the show does an OK job at exploiting that. The fights, while not being dramatic or climactic by any means, are pretty much the only bearable part this anime has. One because you are able to forget about all the other things for a while, Two because they are not the worst even in comparison to some others. Though I still have to say that while the close-quarters combat was the one done decently, whenever anyone tried to use a gun I was asking myself if they ever held that thing in their hands.The art was definetly not the worst, I would call it very fair. Some characters had interesting desings though most of the less important ones looked almost the same. The whole animation wasn't bad and the arstyle looked nice and clean. The OST was very fast-paced and decent, though nothing extraordinary by any means. The voice-acting was not the most pleasant, though I think it's rather a problem of the character personalities rather than the actors that voiced them.------------With my review coming to an end, it's about time to answer some questions. Is Hakata fun to watch? Possibly, it's fast paced and has a lot of blood. That's enough for lot of people. But is Hakata also a good anime? No, it's not. It tries to hide it's undeniable flaws behind some action and self-aware jokes, and goes full-on enjoyment mode without caring about it's actual quality. And while I think I would fall for the bait half a year ago, I'm slowly getting to the level in which I also care about if the anime is actually good. And Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is not. the show itself tells you that 3% of Fukuoka's population are indeed those blood-seeking hitmen. Wait.. what? Let's take a minute and think about how ridiculous that number is.

There is the super-smart guy, the loli, the strong guy, the dumb and aggresive guy, the Tsundere, the nice guy, the innocent and clumsy guy and some others. I'm not saying that this would't work under different circumstances, however in this case it felt like the show once again tried to hide it's huge flaws behind a thing that could possibly appeal to the audience, which could result into them not noticing the actual mess. And by the mess I mean the non-existent plot continuity and terrible character development.The last thing the show does and the only thing I can agree does atleast respectably well is the action. Environment around hitmen and assasins provides quite a lot of ground for fightning and killing and the show does an OK job at exploiting that. The fights, while not being dramatic or climactic by any means, are pretty much the only bearable part this anime has. One because you are able to forget about all the other things for a while, Two because they are not the worst even in comparison to some others. Though I still have to say that while the close-quarters combat was the one done decently, whenever anyone tried to use a gun I was asking myself if they ever held that thing in their hands.The art was definetly not the worst, I would call it very fair. Some characters had interesting desings though most of the less important ones looked almost the same. The whole animation wasn't bad and the arstyle looked nice and clean. The OST was very fast-paced and decent, though nothing extraordinary by any means. The voice-acting was not the most pleasant, though I think it's rather a problem of the character personalities rather than the actors that voiced them.------------With my review coming to an end, it's about time to answer some questions. Is Hakata fun to watch? Possibly, it's fast paced and has a lot of blood. That's enough for lot of people. But is Hakata also a good anime? No, it's not. It tries to hide it's undeniable flaws behind some action and self-aware jokes, and goes full-on enjoyment mode without caring about it's actual quality. And while I think I would fall for the bait half a year ago, I'm slowly getting to the level in which I also care about if the anime is actually good. And Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is not."", ""I'd like to share my thoughts on this Show, as I think it doesnt get the Attention it deserves. [EDITED]Story : 7Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is the Story of a Group of Killers. You'll see who they are, and follow them while they struggle through life. There are a few Story arcs that will develop each characters, nothing complicated. Some stories like the first one could have been developped more and some may seem unnecessary but it doesnt Keep you from enjoying the Show.Even though the world the caracters live in is really violent, the fact that it is normalized and that noone in the Anime...overreacts makes you accept the context and enjoy the Show. It even makes it more unique.Of Course there is some social criticism, as it deals with corruption, murder, modern slave trade, drugs..Art : 8Both the opening and the ending have a great style.I found the caracter design really cool, the animation is smooth, theres really nothing negative to say about itSound : 9The ending is outstanding and gives a unique style to the anime as is it also used as an OST during the episodes. The opening is also very good, and the other musics are descrete but well usedCharacters : 9To me this is the strong point in this anime. I got attached to the caracters very quickly. They all have their Backstory or an entire arc dedicated to them, and the anime manages to make you like them all. Even though they're killers, you see them act as humans, and they become heroes even though they should be antiheroes.Enjoyment : 9I can't give a 10 because this is not the Anime of the year, but I can tell that this is one of the Shows I looked Forward to the most during the week, and it has a very unique atmosphere.Overall : 9I can't give this Show less than nine as it is really enjoyable once you've gotten attached to the caracters.Sorry for the poor english overreacts makes you accept the context and enjoy the Show.

But what I thought was going to be our main character ended up panning out to be someone who was only relevant on certain occasions. I'm okay with an anime having certain arcs to it, but unless the arcs lead to a final conclusion, story line wise I lose interest...luckily the action was so well done in this anime that I never lost interest and the story basically took a back seat to the amount of kick ass moments there were. Plus BASEBALL!!!The art and animation were not anything special. With guts, bloods, and brains spilling, along with heads...rolling you would think they would do a little more then Red Sports and Rivers of Blood. The hand to hand combat scenes were done okay but again nothing over the top.The opening and ending were really awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed them. The bgm was slightly above average but still fit the show great.The freaking characters were so enjoyable to watch. Normally an anime with a proficient amount of males turns me off to it, but these guys were freaking awesome! Each in their own unique way.I really enjoyed this anime a lot. It gave me a break from a lot of the cute and dramatic filled anime I have been watching for a while.Overall I can see how people will see flaws in this anime. Is it shelf worthy when it finally gets released on bluray? Maybe, but it definitely worth a watch if your looking for a nice action anime. rolling you would think they would do a little more then Red Sports and Rivers of Blood.

It is a dumb-fun action romp, but it is also more than that. It is a portrayal of queer people in a way that is fun, humanizing, sympathetic, and, almost miraculously, in an way that is not in the slightest bit preachy. If you like stupid action and also like gay characters and stories, you could do a hell of a lot worse than Hakata Tonkasu Ramens.I will be completely forthright and admit that I went in Hakata Tonkatsu Ramens (hereafter HTR) both expecting and wanting to hate-watch it. Even starting to watch this show with a clear bias...against it\'s being good, I will be damned if it did not completely pleasantly surprise me by being a really enjoyable experience. I expected the show to be dumb, fun, and crappy, but what I found was that it was only the first of those two things. I love things that are dumb and fun, and as such I unironically loved watching HTR.Story: Only sort of. There isn\'t really a strong plot, but what there is instead is a whole bunch of character development and world building. In short, a hit-man named Lin comes to a new town full of crazies and murderers and finds out that it is actually the coolest town ever. Hakata is a city where everybody seems to be allowed to kill anybody they want to with essentially no repercussions and also does so professionally. Lin meets and befriends secret samurai detectives in cute sweaters, terrifying little girls, mushroom-shaped 1337 hackers, camp gay revenge dispensers, and clumsy and petulant ninjas. There are also some subtle homosexual overtones,  in the way that an episode of Rupaul\'s Drag Race also contains some subtle homosexual overtones. This show is gay as a peacock and all the better for it.Art: Not great. Actually pretty bad, which kind of drags the show down a bit. The character designs, barring one in main character Lin, are nothing to write home about, and the action scenes frequently go off model. The whole show in general looks a little crunchy. The fact that I still liked it anyway is a testament to the other strengths of HTR.Sound: Love the OP. The song is catchy and emotional and always gets me hyped up. The voice acting is also great, and makes characters that could have been really stupid and cheesy instead seem grounded and relateable. Overall the sound great and fit the show like a glove.Character: Why you should watch this show. Not all of them are great, although all of them are fun. The ones who are though, namely Lin, deuteragonist Banba, and their relationship, are worth the price of admission on their own.Let us first take Lin. When we are introduced to Lin we see what appears to be a beautiful young woman in a school uniform and sensible high heels, but we soon find out that, despite what he may look like, Lin is very much a dude and will very much kill your ass dead if you get in his way. Lin lives his his life as a woman, and the fact that Hakata Tonkatsu Ramens chooses to have a person on the LGBTQ and so-forth spectrum as its hero and not choose to make fun of them or (SPOILER ALERT) murder them graphically is such a sight for sore eyes. We grow to know and like him despite and in fact partially because of his many and varied foibles, just as Lin grows as a person as he meets the residents of Hakata.Chief among these residents (at least in Lin and the story\'s eyes) is Banba Zenji, a detective with a mysterious secret life and an LL Bean sweater. Banba takes Lin in during a rare moment of vulnerability, and much to Lin\'s consternation he discovers that he kinda likes it here.The show ships Lin and Banba from the get, and their interactions are pretty damn cute. Lin is a textbook tsundere, and the fact that he is a man living as a woman makes the interaction between him and Banba all the more rife with incidences for Lin to tsun out over. Banba is alternately cool and adorable as the mood takes him, and really it is no wonder Lin falls for him so hard. I mean, just look at that sweater.HTR never comes right out and confirms that Lin and Banba are boning down, but come on guys we all know they are. It\'s great, just have fun with it! At one point Banba\'s ex girlfriend sits down with Lin and is like ""so Banba\'s totally your boyfriend, amirite?"" and Lin is like ""nooo I\'m totally not a gay"" and then she basically looks at the camera with an expression on her face that might as well have been subtitled ""GURL PLEASE."" Lin doesn\'t bother to defend the point. He\'s too busy being dere.The rest of the characters are more or less successful and fun, particularly mushroom hacker and glasses ninja agent, but all of them feel like they live and belong in the world of Hakata. They all serve to help tell the story of Lin learning to love other people and eventually himself, and as Rupaul says ""If you can\'t love yourself how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?"" The entire city of Hakata gives him an AMEN.If you made it through this overly effusive review, you owe it to yourself to watch this show. You are clearly interested in or at least appreciate gay shit, else you would\'ve tuned out the second you saw the big scary word QUEER (oh my god so spooky!!!).

The setting, while more than a bit ridiculous in concept, is still a pretty cool world with endless possibilities for big action and twisted crime capers that refreshingly have no sci-fi tech or magic involved for once. It also has the foundation of some potentially great sociopolitical satire as it essentially turns modern day corruption in the regular political process up to eleven a its entire premise and I'm excited to see how the main conflict will unfold over the...course of the series, it certainly has my attention.The characters, while somewhat simplistic in design, have wit, humor and unique personality that make up for it in strides, not to mention that their professional fields also tend to require that they be at least a little badass. The assassin, bodyguard, corrupt cop and honest detective factions that are revealing themselves are all entertaining to watch interacting with their various codes of conduct and MOs and they all boast a new cool or crazy character or two.The OP and EP, along with the running score of the show are also primo, catching major Cowboy Bebop vibe in terms of both sound and choreography and that's something you'll never hear me complain about. Overall, it's not top tier excellent quite yet, but it has the makings of something special and I'm definitely going to be keeping up with it if the quality remains consistent and the story keeps improving, it's an 8 out of 10 so far. course of the series, it certainly has my attention.The characters, while somewhat simplistic in design, have wit, humor and unique personality that make up for it in strides, not to mention that their professional fields also tend to require that they be at least a little badass.

More lively during the night than day, the city of Hakata radiates a deceptively alluring glow covering it entirely; masking the dangers that lurk around every corner.Hakata is infamously known for 3% of its population being comprised of hitmen, torturers, yakuza, and worse. This percentile is further divided into agencies, gangs, and websites for freelancers; a few of them are hilariously named “Murder Inc”, “Shadeyjobs.com”, and “RedRum Inc”. A sly snap at other action crime anime that strive to be realistic with overwrought edginess. Darkly...comedic and self-aware writing like this permeates throughout Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens, immediately defining the tone as pure enjoyment as opposed to the logic-based standard.With each member of the show’s large cast is in the 3%, it becomes abundantly clear that there’s always at least one criminal exchange occurring in this city. Even the cross-dressing main character Lin is an expert hitman with a comically harsh attitude. Cursing the men who ogling him, simply saying “I’m a man you moron” or “I’ll kick your ass” under his breath. He may say his cross-dressing is just because he likes the fashionable clothing, but he cleverly uses it as a method to be underestimated by his targets. At the beginning Lin’s completing his latest hit on a private investigator, that is until he finds that he’d rather swap sides and defend him to try and earn some extra cash. Hakata is after all as much of a money-driven city as it is crime riddled and our main character is only a cog in the system.Lin’s lone wolf personality immediately clashes in quite funny ways with the charismatic detective Banba. Make no mistake, him being a detective does not grant him moral high ground over the rest of the felonious 3%. In his introduction, we see him at a political rally casually feigning a gunshot by popping a balloon, all for the sake of weeding out a potential suspect. He often employs these radical but successful methods that no detective in their right mind would resort to. He's just as ready to kill as Lin and does so mercilessly alongside his hitman counterpart, with personalities so opposed it wouldn't be unfair to call them foils of one another. At first, their whole relationship consists of Lin being annoyed by Banba’s listlessness and constant baseball metaphors. Then, to kick the first arc motion, Lin’s sister is unexpectedly murdered, forcing the unlikely pair to work together and seek vengeance against the hitmen agency responsible.In the first of many arcs, the wide ensemble cast of characters is introduced. Each with a vivid personality, a distinct urban design, and a role they fill in Hakata. As Banba so nonchalantly puts it, they’re all playing a game of baseball. Whether or not you depend on the allies you make will decide how far you make it in the game. An ideology that starkly contrasts that of the lone wolf Lin, but satisfyingly he comes to embrace it as he spends more time with Banba. Them playing baseball on a team of their fellow hitmen served to support the show’s many metaphors, but also provided some of the purest light-hearted comedy in the show. Numerous food scenes also serve to lighten the tone, with delicious looking dishes and of course the titular Hakata tonkotsu ramen.Aside from those heartwarming moments, a devilishly wry tone drenches Hakata. Delving into the criminal underworld, dark themes are inevitably explored; however, these themes do not overpower the sarcastically comedic tone due to the characters we see them through. Each member of the criminal cast contributes to this tone with cool and collected attitudes; aware that their dangerous careers can lead to their death at any time, they throw themselves into entertaining action. Any need any need for arbitrary anxiety is removed. Even with the uncertainty when the next betrayal, murder, or kidnapping might happen, the headstrong cast remains a joy to watch. Most of them work in or run those previously mentioned agencies and gangs. In one of the more impressively balanced but tonally ludicrous scenes, we see the stereotypical but inoffensively portrayed gay bartender Jirou with the sly middle school girl Misaki design their torturing agency website as casually as if it were a school project.Only one character, a fresh face in town trying to start his hitman career, gives us a perspective of what an everyman would look like stuck in the middle of the whirlwind of crime. He's way out of his depth and gets into many hilariously troublesome situations. These side characters don’t receive the same level of development as the leads, but through seeing where they fit in the wacky underground of Hakata they become likable people who get further exploration in the background of the central story. After all, the story moves like a bullet, a pace fast enough to engage but it still finds the time to spare on the minor details. Shaping the world and its inhabitants as believable rather than outright outlandish.Most importantly out of the whole cast, the lead characters Lin and Banba are unphased by Hakata’s crime-infested underground and are ready to give it all they’ve got in combat to secure the outcome most in their favor. Sharing a few snide comments to maintain an air of entertainment rather than fear, they slice, shoot, mask their identities, and use every trick they’ve got up their sleeve to create action set pieces worth watching for alone. In spite of the show’s relatively low budget, it thrills with swift and comprehensive shot composition, thoughtfully composed writing, and enough blood to earn an R rating.Bolstered by a volley of trumpets rising during action scenes and mellowing into jazz during quieter ones, even the soundtrack contributes to the rich style. Both opening and ending sequences have fast pace jazzy tracks as well, showcasing major characters in rapid-fire succession with enough style and symbolism to make them as substantial of the show. Practically every facet of this anime carries the city’s dense style; the glow of colorful lights reflecting off the river during the night, as well as sunshafts sneaking around buildings during the day. Hakata is the kind of setting that serves as a character itself, with a distinct visual style underscored by jazzy music, alluring but also undeniably dangerous. Stylish, darkly comedic, and slyly self-aware.

I tried to avoid spoilers. There may be some very mild spoilers by context, but definitely nothing plot related.)Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is the most surprisingly entertaining and enthralling anime of the current season, in my opinion. It feels almost like a slice-of-life anime as you watch it, filled with colorful, interesting characters and goofy situations. However, these are interspersed with moments of intense action, drama, energy, and tension. Though it may start off a bit soft and slow, the story and its diverse cast of quirky...characters will quickly draw you into their daily struggles for work, companionship… and survival.Yes, survival. As in, trying not to get a bullet through the head. Despite its appearance and benign title, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens (I’ll just call it HTR from now on) addresses some very, very adult themes as the story progresses, and therefore this show might not be for everyone. And I don’t mean “adult themes” like an ecchi anime. Five episodes in I haven’t seen a single case of fanservice in this show. No, the adult themes of HTR are of a more dark, sinister nature, something that clashes wonderfully with the upbeat, charming characters that populate this world. The plot of HTR follows the stories of a number of hitmen and their associates in the city of Fukuoka as they fight for work, money, family, revenge, forgiveness, and the simple right to live a quiet and normal life as they please. The writers of HTR go on to bring in some incredibly dark themes such as murder, rape, human trafficking, political corruption and intrigue, blackmail, physical and psychological torture, and more. All this would normally produce an anime that leaves the viewer with a bad taste in their mouth, but HTR contrasts these themes brilliantly with a cast of comedic, intriguing, wonderful characters, who lighten the story and allow the viewer to approach these horrors in a relatively safe and controlled way.While the story of this series is still developing at this point, I would also like to mention how well the plot of HTR has been woven together. The story starts out feeling somewhat disjointed; each character in the show is introduced individually, in their own separate contexts. However, the writers quickly lead us, the viewers, to suspect that all of these disparate characters are somehow, some way, connected to one another. Call it fate, call it good writing, call it whatever you want, the story quickly leads its audience to suspect that there is more to this anime than meets the eye, a feeling that has kept me coming back for more each week.The music in this series has been fairly mundane thus far, nothing stood out to me as being particularly bad or good about it. The voice acting is excellent, the animation crisp and clear, and as I already said, the story is both entertaining and engrossing. If you are looking for an anime to try out this season, and enjoy complex stories that develop alongside their characters, I would highly recommend checking out HTR. We’re just five episodes in, and I’m definitely looking forward to next week.Tl;Dr This show a delightful mix of Gangsta. and Durarara!. characters will quickly draw you into their daily struggles for work, companionship… and survival.Yes, survival. As in, trying not to get a bullet through the head. Despite its appearance and benign title, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens (I’ll just call it HTR from now on) addresses some very, very adult themes as the story progresses, and therefore this show might not be for everyone. And I don’t mean “adult themes” like an ecchi anime. Five episodes in I haven’t seen a single case of fanservice in this show. No, the adult themes of HTR are of a more dark, sinister nature, something that clashes wonderfully with the upbeat, charming characters that populate this world. The plot of HTR follows the stories of a number of hitmen and their associates in the city of Fukuoka as they fight for work, money, family, revenge, forgiveness, and the simple right to live a quiet and normal life as they please. The writers of HTR go on to bring in some incredibly dark themes such as murder, rape, human trafficking, political corruption and intrigue, blackmail, physical and psychological torture, and more. All this would normally produce an anime that leaves the viewer with a bad taste in their mouth, but HTR contrasts these themes brilliantly with a cast of comedic, intriguing, wonderful characters, who lighten the story and allow the viewer to approach these horrors in a relatively safe and controlled way.While the story of this series is still developing at this point, I would also like to mention how well the plot of HTR has been woven together. The story starts out feeling somewhat disjointed; each character in the show is introduced individually, in their own separate contexts.

People either loved it or despised it and that made me super curious. And man am I glad that I watched it.The setting is very idiosyncratic. I mean a world where hitmen casually hung out and discussed their jobs and the people they murdered in public and had baseball teams...uhmm ...weird. But at the same time its pretty interesting if you just ignore the improbability if it. It had a bit of bebop feel to it at times(maybe thats just me though)The art is good when its good but...so very low budget at times. Sound is pretty good too but nothing to rave about.Now what made the story so so so very enjoyable for me were the characters. All of them are ridiculously quirky with amazing lgbt representation(for a shounen anime). Banba is definitley the hitman with a heart of gold but mess with him or the people he cares about and we see a totally different side of him. Lin is amazing. I dont think ive seen any non shoujo anime where a cross dresser is the lead but i seriously loved him. He met banba at a terrible point in time and slowly learns to trust him again. all the side characters were pretty intersting too especially the avengers. I felt there was solid chemistry between lin and banba but at the same time it leaves their relationship to the viewers imagination ( totally domestic newlyweds in my opinion). Very few female characters thoughThis anime certainly has its flaws but i think the charm outweighs it. Id definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a fun anime watching experience so very low budget at times.

Watch at least the first two episodes, since episode 1 doesn\'t sell the show as well as episode 2 does.Do not expect great plot or lore from this show. The plot is purely an excuse for characters to bounce off of eachother in fun and interesting ways. The highlights of this show are its action scenes, its characters and their designs, and the sound.The action scenes, at least as far as has released at time of writing, are pretty fantastic. Solid animation, plenty of blood, and a god number of stupid cool moments. Stupid is the...operative word here: a guy swings a katana like a baseball bat to reflect a bomb, and it works. If that makes you roll your eyes, this isn\'t your kind of show. It\'s stupid, it knows it, and so it throws just enough logic out the window to let it do what it wants, while keeping just enough logic for things to be coherent, if silly.The characters in this show are really entertaining. Everyone has a pretty distinct and interesting personality, and the way they interact with one another is pretty fun to watch even when nothing\'s happening. Additionally, every character, even the ones who show up for one scene with no dialogue, has a memorable design that sets them apart from each other character in the show. This means that you often can\'t tell whether characters will last past the arc or even the episode they\'re introduced, leading to several moments of ""oh shit he\'s dead!"", which are very entertaining. The one complaint I have is that the main guy looks like a tool, but his design has grown on me a bit, and it\'s not that big of a deal.Finally, the show\'s music tends to be pretty good, but the main thing that makes me mention it is the ending theme. God damn, TRI4TH did a fucking killer job with it. It\'s jazzy and fun, and I love the way they put the \'next episode teaser\' in the middle of the song and how that actually works. Fight scenes also have pretty good sound effects and such, so that\'s also good.Hakata Tonkatsu Ramens is not a smart show. It is a very, very, stupid show. It\'s also been a ton of fun to watch this season, and I\'m glad I didn\'t stop after the (mediocre) first episode. I think the best way to describe it is that it\'s Durarara!!, with a pinch of No More Heroes/Kill Bill, and a ton of brain damage.

Hence, the reason I just started watching now. I'm already caught up and I'm glad I decided to give it a chance. I normally would watch shows with two or more of the following genres: fantasy, adventure, superpowers, supernatural, and comedy. That being said, this show is entertaining even for me someone who prefers shows like One Punch Man, Hunter X Hunter, Overlord, etc.. I would recommend giving it a try.

It focuses on a corrupt society with murder, human trafficking, revenge, etc. Some places might look nice on the outside, but inside is way darker than expected. Unfortunately stuff like this actually happens in the real world. There are hitman...killing people they are assigned to, and even a hitman killing other hitman. It's pretty violent with not much comedy, but there are some scenes that are relaxing and enjoyable. Moral and ethic issues come up throughout this show too. Are the killers all evil, or are they doing this because that's what they were assigned to do the job or are there other reasons?? Each of the main characters have different backgrounds that are explored in the episode. If you read the light novel like I did, you'll learn even more about the characters.Character: I wish the anime explained more about each character and their backstory. They did a good job for Lin and Enokida, but the rest were not that clear. Why is Misaki with Jirou?? There's not much about Banba actually.Also the title mentions ramen, but food is not the main part of the show. I first thought this was maybe a show about food, but it's totally the opposite. The OP is not bad. The music is jazzy, something I did not expect for an anime like this. The order for the last two arcs in the anime are slightly different from the novel, but it doesn't seem to have a big problem. I would recommend this for adults who want some action anime.

Nor is it a stupid premise that went nowhere, like the haters would say. It\'s just fun. It\'s also a breath of fresh air from the usual high school setting and moe girls.I\'ll have a lot of negatives to say about the show in this review, but don\'t get me wrong. I enjoyed it a lot, and I recommend that you try it.A city where 3% of the people are assassins? Absurd. All the people relevant to the plot happen...to know each other and/or randomly meet each other in the city? Impossible. If you\'re going to be put off by this, it\'s probably not the show for you. I wouldn\'t blame you.What the show is good at is the characters. This show is honestly just a bunch of eccentric, hilarious, but still believable characters having hilarious interactions. If you saw (and liked Durarara), you\'ll probably understand what I mean about having a bunch of crazy characters talking to each other. There are plots, and story, and ""character development"" sure, but... well, I\'ll tell you about that later. There\'s a dude who dresses in a weird samurai getup and uses a sword. But when you meet him, it totally makes sense. He thinks it looks cool and won\'t let anyone get him down. There\'s another dude who gets a ninja theme, and again, it makes sense. He\'s not some crazy ninja fan, it\'s a marketing ploy to get more people to hear about him. It\'s things like this that kept the characters from feeling like absurd caricatures that wouldn\'t exist in real life.The story? I mentioned earlier that you need suspension of disbelief. Something happens to somebody, it turns out all the characters are involved in a different part of the plot, they accidentally run into each other, then they team up to steamroll the enemies like a group of over-leveled MMORPG characters crushing a public event. Rinse, repeat. There is also a main-ish story. Sort of. I forgot about it until I was writing this paragraph.The art? I like the designs. They\'re memorable, suit the characters, and animated well enough. The action is fine. (Aren\'t you glad you are reading this? Top-tier quality in-depth reviewing right here.)The characters? They get over trauma far too quickly. Some stuff goes down in the first arc of the show, and it just never gets brought up again. They have believable motivations and backstories that support their personalities in the show, but they don\'t change. There\'s not a lot of depth there, either. The show tries to make Lin deeper, but it\'s hard to feel serious when it\'s usually silly.The sound? It\'s not one of those OSTs that I remember after I finished watching the show. It didn\'t detract from the show, but it didn\'t stand out to me. The OP and ED themes were nice.As a personal gripe, I thought the gay doctor was too stereotypically gay. I\'m not the type of person who would really know if it was offensive or not, but it just irked me.On the other hand, I thought Lin was great. He crossdresses, and it\'s not made into a big deal.

The series focuses on a crossdressing assassin named Lin Xianming who partners up with a detective named Zenji Banba to dispatch rival assassins and crime syndicates within the city of Hakata.Before I dabble into this anime's more serious material, I should bring up the fun comical timing this series offers up. The title of the series in question is actually the name...of the baseball team that Banba and his companions are part of for recreation on the side when not caught up in their criminal activities and adding to that angle, episodes of the series are named after baseball terminology and some action scenes have fun with the baseball motif as Banba usually partakes in baseball-inspired attacks and tactics. Many of the characters have their eccentric character quirks that clash with the violent professions they take up in Fukuoka, but this actually makes for a good balance to the mentioned darker elements of Hakata Tonkatsu Ramens.And like Jormungand and Black Lagoon, Hakata Tonkatsu Ramens isn't afraid to show just how brutal and merciless the criminal underworld of Hakata can be. Hitmen, assassins, and torturers are shown to be brutally violent when performing their work and several major characters are shown to be negatively effected by their experiences within the criminal underworld. Lin's character story drives much of the show's run as the series explores his rather tragic beginnings of being forcibly raised as an assassin and learning to gradually trust Banba and his companions throughout the remainder of the series, offering the strongest character development of any character within the series. One prominent character within Lin's backstory has more relevance in the last story arc of the series and serves as a rather effective contrast to Lin as to the different experiences they had following their assassin training.As far as other characters go within Hakata Tonkatsu Ramens, they're a bit of a mixed bag. Some of Banba's companions have their backstories explored in the middle of the series and some hints of their pasts are brought up. But these elements just exist to flesh out the characters and criminal organizations within Hakata, without offering any development to them and other characters within Banba's group are largely one-note throughout the series. Also, the series is largely lacking in major female characters as the few that do have roles are either brief or largely stay in the background and some are used as nameless victims to drive how violent and depraved some of the male criminals in Hakata are.As mentioned, I wouldn't recommend this series to younger or sensitive audiences as it is often brutally violent in showcasing the killing and torture committed by characters and the clash of black comedy and dark drama found with the actions of its criminal characters won't be for everyone.

I would even go as far as to say this was the dark horse anime of the season and possibly year. I did not expect much from this show but was pleasantly surprised with what I got. Basically, the show is comprised of arcs each comprising 2 to 3 episodes. The arcs focus on a particular characters problems with other characters of the protagonist's group involved.[Story]This element was the biggest surprise for me....I enjoyed most of the arcs shown in the series and how it gives certain characters the spotlight. The main characters in the show are Lin and Banba who were both surprisingly likeable and a joy to follow throughout the show. They did a good job in making these assassins not seem unlikable and even succeeds in making me really care about the whole main cast.[Art/Sound]Solid is the best I can say. There is nothing I saw that really ruined my enjoyment. I was also surprised to find a decent amount of saxophone/jazz like music.[Characters]Like I mentioned prior, I enjoyed this cast of characters. The main cast is very likeable and I found them to be characters I wanted to root for. Despite this, the characters are not perfect. Lin by the end of the show was developed enough to where we knew enough of him and he became a very developed character. Some of the other characters were not given the same treatment. Banba in particular is an example. Despite this, given that the show is 12 episodes makes it understandable why many characters have to be sidelined and left undeveloped.[Enjoyment}This was the dark horse of the season. I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw in a season of cute girls doing cute things. This show brought me into a world of shitty people and made me explore a certain group of characters adventures through all of this. I found the first few arcs to be fun and interesting despite some OPness of some of the main cast. The last arc definitely was more predictable and not as strong as the others but despite this, did not really hurt the show.Overall, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is an anime for anyone looking to see an enjoyable action show. There is a likeable cast, a lot of bad situations for characters to go through, and just pure fun. Just be cautious of some lack of character development, over powered characters, and slightly weaker final act that doesn't answer every question.

It started off very intriguing, yet confusing. But a few episodes in I was able to understand everything. They kept everything fast-paced, yet always slowly inching toward a massive, unexpected ending. There were multiple flashbacks for the main characters, and each and every one was VERY likable, diverse, unique, entertaining, funny, etc. I thought this was a solid show until up to the last few episodes, where I thought it was an AMAZING show, the last...ep was action packed, just like the whole show. I highly recommend you watch this if you enjoy any sort strategic killing anime. This show features multiple agencies that have different relationships with each other, and follows the story of one guy through his journey through them and the city itself, rebellious acts through all. There's so much going on, and it's easy to miss something. Soundtrack was great, I loved how they were able to fit jazz into this killing spree. Overall, a fantastic show.

It stands out among others and I most definitely enjoyed it even though I thought I was risking quite a bit watching this show due to the rest of my watch list. All in all, fantastic execution."", 'This anime is superb <3 It is not your typical ""good vs. bad"" shonen, its more realistic and gritty. It is decently unique while still feeling comfortable to watch. Nothing too cliche but also nothing too strange or out too far outside of reality.Essentially everyone is the villain in their own way. It shows the complexity of actual realistic human personalities without sugarcoating what it means to exist.The main character is a femboy with an aggressive personality, which I personally find extremely endearing. The rest of the characters are also quite well put together.The storytelling, art, and general ambiance was really well...done. I wish there was more. done. I wish there was more.', ""very bland, no memorable characters but a very cool conceptit could've gone places but it lacked in a lot of areas making me feel like I wasted a few hoursThere was a lot of potentials but the characters just had nothing to them, no personality or story and failed to carry the plot, every time you thought you were going to learn something about the character they ignored ita lot of characters are shown to be important but you have no idea who or what they're like the whole thing felt like a first episodeThe whole thing felt aimless I can't even...tell you what the point of this story was or whether there was oneI will not remember any of them or the anime but I'll remember the uniqueness of some of the details which were niceHowever, if they did make the next season I would watch it and hope they can create something out of this because despite all this I still have high hopes tell you what the point of this story was or whether there was oneI will not remember any of them or the anime but I'll remember the uniqueness of some of the details which were niceHowever, if they did make the next season I would watch it and hope they can create something out of this because despite all this I still have high hopes"", ""It's been a long time since I enjoy an anime this much. It's about hitmen, they just do the job, not trying to do something for justice like one of the popular review said, the target just happen to be a bad person, nothing heroic here. (In the Light Novel they mentioned that the hitmen does take requests from police, to 'dispose' criminals they can't arrest by law.)The characters' stories are interesting, art and sound are good and fit very well with the theme. They didn't make the best decision in some cases imo, but I enjoy watching this anime so much. My only complaint...is there was no second season. I hope they follow the light novel, it's getting very thrilling at this moment. is there was no second season.

This anime has all that and more.We’ve got Lin, the straight crossdresser who looks irritated almost all the time but’s a lot brighter than you give him credit for. We’ve got Banba, the easy-going, enigmatic and downright cool guy who’s totally reminiscent of Spike Spiegel. We’ve got Enokida, the obligatory hacker who’s actually pretty interesting by himself, the perpetually unlucky Saitou who really is just not cut out to be an assassin, and the ‘Submarine Ninja’ who, despite the goofy name,...is a short-tempered lone wolf.That’s just to mention a few. Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens has a massive and extremely diverse cast, and all the characters are important in one way or the other. It’s a lot like Durarara!! In that regard, lots of minor events in the city have ripple effects that can alter the entire course of the story. You never know if that one guy you bump into whilst shopping will be the assassin that tries to kill you later, or the pitcher for your baseball team. It’s part of what keeps the anime exciting, and seriously there is rarely a dull moment.Sure, not everyone gets a load of screen-time, and that’s to be expected in a mere 12 episodes, but you get to know their personalities nonetheless. Lin, as the MC, is well developed – we get to see past his shell and into his backstory. The others are mainly developed through their interactions with each other. The characters are sort of like a family, but not like the Fairy Tail type. They tend to look out for themselves first and foremost, but will show up if someone’s in real trouble. They don’t show affection often, but it is somewhere under the surface. It’s less cheesy and melodramatic that way – plus all their snippy banter is quite amusing to listen to.Instead of a story revealed straight from the beginning, there’s a set of seemingly random episodes that introduce you to the city of Hakata and the weird bunch that inhabit it. There are some relatively heavy topics dealt with – murder, torture, human trafficking – but the anime doesn’t go all philosophical on you. Everything except killing is bad, and even then you should only try and kill those who deserve it (mainly organisations dealing with the aforementioned activities). It’s a show about various groups of hitmen after all, and an action series at that, so you would expect it to take a somewhat lighter approach to the killing aspect. Besides, we get to see a lot more fights that way.Which brings me on to the art and animation. Both are good – nothing outstanding, but the city is well drawn, the fights are animated nicely and the characters’ faces show their emotions properly.The sound is really great. The op theme felt really nostalgic for some reason, and the jazzy ed is also worth a mention. Distinct Cowboy Bebop vibes there.To conclude, I did enjoy this anime a lot. It was fast-paced and entertaining. Some parts were downright clever, and the mysteries and fights were thrilling. I got taken in by a fair few of the twists, and I was always eager for the next episode. I’d definitely watch another season of this.I’d recommend if you like anime like Durarara!!, Cowboy Bebop, or just anything fast-paced, fun, and action-packed. XDBTW, the baseball aspect did catch me a bit off guard, but it ends up being more than just a distraction from all the killings. It’s used both to show the neighbourhood dynamic, and as a shared activity that helps to foster teamwork and trust. It’s also part of what makes the anime unique; instead of a cult or secret society they have a baseball team. And the best part? Watching them play baseball is made even more fun by just how absurd it actually is. 😊 is a short-tempered lone wolf.That’s just to mention a few.

Nothing overly appealing, but not the worst I've ever seen either.Sound 5 / 10I feel the same about the sound as I do with the art. I didn't really care much about the op or ed and I feel similarly with the soundtrack. There wasn't...anything that I wanted to listen to over and over again. It was just music, but not music I particularly cared about or hated.Character 7 / 10I have to say there were some characters that I really loved an enjoyed while there were others that I liked but didn't think too much of. There were a lot of characters that just showed up every once in a while that I didn't care much for but I didn't hate either. Lin and Banba's relationship was very enjoyable for me, but they were also the most entertaining characters for me with Lin being my favorite overall. I think learning about Lin's past was quite nice too and I hadn't expected the show to delve into that so it was a nice surprise that made him more enjoyable for me.Enjoyment 8 / 10Despite what I've said so far, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens was definitely a show I was excited for weekly. I wanted to see it come around week by week and I'm definitely glad I continued with it up until the very end because I can definitely say it was worth my time.Overall 8 / 10At the end of the day this show gets an 8 because while some factors of it may not be particularly special, I enjoyed it enough that I can't possibly rate it any lower than an 8. I would definitely recommend it to others and I would watch it again maybe once more just because I enjoyed the characters I liked so much.

No non-biases guaranteed.In short, I find Ramens a relatively ""idealistic"" and ""light-hearted"" potrayal of the underworld (as opposed to others like Black Lagoon). This is a good show for pass-time, fun, light-hearted, (BL,) and perhaps, knowing slightly more about baseball and Hakata. However, it lacks depth for character and plot development, which is prevelant in underworld dramas involving multiple parties, reasons explained below.Story:...612 episodes are quite neatly divided into several arcs. No strong cause-and-effect relationships between arcs. However, the patterns are largely similar and strong hints to the story development are always given. Towards the later arcs, I gave up worrying for the protagonists even when they are emminent danger of betrayal/ death because of the repetitive and cliche pattern.Characters: 4Try recalling the underworld animes (e.g. Black Lagoon, Jorumugand, Durarara), or even movies you watched, what pops up in your mind first? It is often not the plot, but the characters that impress audience the most. The soul of this genre of work often lies in the characters. Ramens is critically damaged and flawed in this respect.All characters I can recall at this moment are largely stereotypes, especially allies of the protagonists: typical loli, typical old man-with a-past-glory, typical innocent rookie, typical smartie pants, typical hotheads. Allies of the protagonists mainly stand in the background as ""back-up"" serving protagonists in respective professional fields such as hacking and medication, and by chance information sources. Lack of female characters\' screen time, while proving Ramens\' target audience is fujoshi, is unrealistic for a modern city like Hakata.Now back to the main characters, who supposedly have more screen time and development to be convincing. Bamba (possibly also tasked with baseball and Hakata tourism promotion) is composed yet humourous, the type of lead which many, including myself, enjoy to watch. Lin, supposedly a well-trained assassin, is the de facto female lead which shows characteristics conflicting with his profession. Dressed as a female (yet staying with a male voice) for unexplained reasons, Lin\'s abilities has more than once been compromised by the outfit. Heels he wore caused him to lose balance when the train suddenly stops, and twisted his ankle when he jumped out from the window.  When protecting allies, Lin had also forgone to fight using his skills as an assassin/ fighter,and opted for the less effective method often used by female leads of other animes for no obvious reasons. I respect characters of different styles, but allowing style to get into the way of assassin\'s profession, where a slight mishap could cost life, is purely perplexing.The extremely strong bond between protagonists and their allies, while impressive and admirable, does not seem realistic for a world of outlaws. All characters never hesitated in siding with their own friends, despite threatened with death, in standing against politicians and mafia syndiciates. Ramen\'s alliance (centred around the main characters) has over 10 people (sufficient to monopolize Hakata underworld), always serves the protagonists but never maintains any organization structure or gives any interests. It solely relies on self-conscience and friendship, which is very ideal, but often stands so vulnerable to power, fame and money in the complexed world of reality, especially underworld. Can such pure alliance and trust exist in a world of outlaws, where even law is disregarded? Even if so, how such strong bonding came to centre around the protagonists is never explained in the story, thus failing to convince the audience.Enemies are less on par with the lead and their allies than expected. Minor: Although some screen time is given to the last boss, his tone is not strong enough to fully characterize a strong last boss with a unique mindset. (this is perhaps due to my own imagination of a stronger line for the boss)Art: 7Generally fine. Action scenes are often neglected until the last 2 episodes.Sound: 8Ending theme of pure jazz is great, bringing back reminiscence of Cowboy Bebop\'s OP, especially with the images shown as the song plays. Some piano arrangements of the Opening and Ending inserted towards the end of the arcs are pleasant, comparable to the kind of music performed live by a pianist at a hotel candlelit dinner. Rest of background music generally fits with the scene but does not stand out.Overall: 6Biased with my expectation of a in-depth exploration of the underworld, I find the story cliche and unexciting, characters unrealistic and even perplexing. On the other hand, I do recognize its effort in music and some light-hearted comedies. Again, if you look for light pass-times, Ramens is a good choice, but it is the opposite if you are looking for in-depth potrayals of human interaction in underworld/ mafia. 612 episodes are quite neatly divided into several arcs.

Aside from some fantastically smooth action scenes, visually appealing art work, and a story line that actually drives itself, THERE IS ACTUALLY CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Like, even if the show had a meh plot line I would still watch it in one or two sittings because of how well the characters play off each other.There might only be two or three characters max that are static and don't change but that is because they are needed for things like comedic relief (plenty of...that) or to have something for the other characters to compare to in how much has changed.

Overall it is very well written with almost every aspect extremely enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants something not exactly the most heard of to watch and doesn't mind blood."", 'First off, if you think this is a show about ramen noodles then nope, best looking elsewhere. It\'s a trap.The Hakata prefecture in Fukuoka was famous for its Tonkotsu ramen and looks like your regular city but it had its own underworld where 3% of its population were killers for hire. Some called themselves ""avengers"", people who can be hired to get revenge for their clients. Baseball loving Zenji Banba is a private detective out investigating a murder of a fellow detective who was murdered by a local hitman. As such, he also ends up being targeted for nosying around. Rash Lin Xianming on the...other hand, is a highly skilled hitman who had sold himself off as a kid so that his family could live a better life. Now he was trying to buy his freedom back from a Taiwanese gang so that he can return home to his sister and ends up being assigned to the job. However, he refuses and decides to protect Zenji instead - at least, until he gets paid properly. Laid back Zenji goes with the flow and it just so happens Lin was part of the organisation he was investigating. When Lin\'s sister ends up abused and killed by the very same gang, they end up working together and Lin ends up seeing a different side of the underworld including a close encounter with the Niwaka Samurai, a hitman that kills hitmen.Background art\'s quite good at times while others they over diffuse the lighting so much they look overly blurred. Otherwise the overall quality of the show stays consistent even though it\'s not great. As far as presentation goes, I think the instrumental pieces of the OST is the best part of this show including the upbeat ending theme, ""Dirty Bullet"".I assume the show got it\'s silly name from Zenji\'s favourite food, instant Hakata Tonkotsu ramen which is about the only thing linked to ramen. As if the title itself wasn\'t enough to hint at it being a bit of a silly show about the life of underworld criminals, they throw in a cross-dressing hitman and a kind of superhero who goes around slaying hitmen just to be sure so don\'t expect a Black Lagoon. In a way it kind of reminded me of Samurai Flamenco because the characters all have the same silly, easy going personality as they fight crime dressed up except here, they\'re not playing superheroes or fighting the supernatural. Instead, it\'s mostly a group of criminals who end up being the good guys. This show can be a lot more violent too where people are mercilessly tortured or killed with lots of blood and some gore. Even then they can still laugh and joke as they are surrounded by corpses. Of course, you also end up with brief scenes involving the abuse and exploitation of ladies. It\'s not a show for the young audience that\'s for sure.Instead of going for your usual cast of cliche Anime personalities it feels like the show just tries to make all the main characters look cool with the only exception of Lin. It\'s a character driven show since it\'s fairly much lacking a main plot and for the most part you\'re watching how Lin finds a place in his new circle of friends. When the show\'s not busy slaughtering people it does have it\'s fun moments as the gang spends time playing baseball matches together or, when you watch the odd relationship between Zenji and Lin playout. Even though everyone\'s buddy, buddies some don\'t hesitate to sell each other out when their professional career in the underworld calls for it. Eventually you get some more insight into the character\'s pasts too. Well... One or two of them anyway.I think the show does a fair job of bringing characters together through coincidence with only 12 episodes to do it in although I don\'t know how faithful it is to the 8 volume light novel series. In that regard I think a show like Durarara or Baccano pulls it off much better with its alternating POVs and equally silly characters. Funnily enough the original author Chikai Kisaki did do a collaboration with Ryougo Narita, the author of those two titles at one point, ""Durarara x Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens"".If you like action character driven shows with a laid back cast and don\'t mind the underworld violence you might like this.

Laid back Zenji goes with the flow and it just so happens Lin was part of the organisation he was investigating. When Lin\'s sister ends up abused and killed by the very same gang, they end up working together and Lin ends up seeing a different side of the underworld including a close encounter with the Niwaka Samurai, a hitman that kills hitmen.Background art\'s quite good at times while others they over diffuse the lighting so much they look overly blurred. Otherwise the overall quality of the show stays consistent even though it\'s not great. As far as presentation goes, I think the instrumental pieces of the OST is the best part of this show including the upbeat ending theme, ""Dirty Bullet"".I assume the show got it\'s silly name from Zenji\'s favourite food, instant Hakata Tonkotsu ramen which is about the only thing linked to ramen. As if the title itself wasn\'t enough to hint at it being a bit of a silly show about the life of underworld criminals, they throw in a cross-dressing hitman and a kind of superhero who goes around slaying hitmen just to be sure so don\'t expect a Black Lagoon. In a way it kind of reminded me of Samurai Flamenco because the characters all have the same silly, easy going personality as they fight crime dressed up except here, they\'re not playing superheroes or fighting the supernatural. Instead, it\'s mostly a group of criminals who end up being the good guys. This show can be a lot more violent too where people are mercilessly tortured or killed with lots of blood and some gore. Even then they can still laugh and joke as they are surrounded by corpses. Of course, you also end up with brief scenes involving the abuse and exploitation of ladies. It\'s not a show for the young audience that\'s for sure.Instead of going for your usual cast of cliche Anime personalities it feels like the show just tries to make all the main characters look cool with the only exception of Lin. It\'s a character driven show since it\'s fairly much lacking a main plot and for the most part you\'re watching how Lin finds a place in his new circle of friends. When the show\'s not busy slaughtering people it does have it\'s fun moments as the gang spends time playing baseball matches together or, when you watch the odd relationship between Zenji and Lin playout. Even though everyone\'s buddy, buddies some don\'t hesitate to sell each other out when their professional career in the underworld calls for it. Eventually you get some more insight into the character\'s pasts too. Well... One or two of them anyway.I think the show does a fair job of bringing characters together through coincidence with only 12 episodes to do it in although I don\'t know how faithful it is to the 8 volume light novel series. In that regard I think a show like Durarara or Baccano pulls it off much better with its alternating POVs and equally silly characters. Funnily enough the original author Chikai Kisaki did do a collaboration with Ryougo Narita, the author of those two titles at one point, ""Durarara x Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens"".If you like action character driven shows with a laid back cast and don\'t mind the underworld violence you might like this. There\'s the odd episode with extra scenes after the credits so don\'t miss out.', ""Story: 6/10 This is where my major turn off is. The title had you thinking it's an anime about cooking. Then the first four episodes went on as a murder mystery revenge anime. Fine, I like where that goes. It's not a bad idea. We still don't know where the Tonkotsu Ramen comes into play but if the story is about a crossdressing hitman getting revenge together with the Killer Killer in disguise, then that alone would make a pretty interesting plot. Then after that it suddenly turns into a baseball anime with all the members being either professional killers, or related to them. And...then the Tonkotsu Ramen's only purpose is being their baseball team name!?? WTF. Not only that, in the beginning of this anime there're lots of foreshadowings that're quickly revealed in the SAME episode or the next. That's not how it works, man. Please make up your mind. Be it a murder mystery or a sports anime or a cooking show. Pick one and STICK WITH IT! And please announce it beforehand so the right audience comes watching it.Art: 7/10 Not the best I've seen, not the worst. No one's really memorable except the mushroom blond wearing the neon yellow hoodie. Not my taste of art style.Sound: 7/10 It's okay. OP and ED are not my taste. Voice acting's good. I like the ost they playing when they fought.Character: 4/10 The mc is interesting when he wanted revenge but his revenge story ended as quickly as it began and then there's no more development after that and I quickly grew bored with him. No one else really stands out to me that makes me want to know more. Oh, maybe why all these professional killers want to make a frickin baseball team with a food name!??Enjoyment: 7/10 Was gonna give it a 6 but the revenge mystery in the beginning is totally my cup of tea, so I give it a 7. That's pretty much it.Overall a 6/10. If it stayed a murder mystery then I wouldn't have dropped this series. I like sports anime but baseball especially professional killers playing baseball is just not for me.

Also, if you\'re a homophobe who\'s irritated by queer people reading into subtext, I\'ll be speaking on that aspect of this show in the review, so please move along.This is, without a doubt, my favorite sports anime and indeed the only sports anime I have watched in its entirety. This is not to say that Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is in any way a sports anime, because it isn\'t, but baseball is certainly an important enough element to the show that calling it as such as a mild jest doesn\'t feel too far off.Additionally, this show came to me at a...time when I really needed it most. At the end of the opening arc, one of the protagonists says what can be boiled down to ""cool things are cool!"" and I knew then and there I would be watching this show in its entirety. Exhausted of psychological thrillers that fall short of being actually meaningful? Bored by the inexplicably deep friendships founded in a matter of minutes that pervade your typical long-running shounen anime? Well then, dear reader, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens is most certainly the palette-cleansing short anime for you!In terms of story, I enjoyed it. I don\'t necessarily feel the need to elaborate on that, but this is a review, after all, so I will anyway. I watched Great Pretender a few weeks ago, as well as just short of a season of Durarara!! many, many years ago, and I think it\'s fair to say HTR\'s plot falls somewhere on the spectrum with those two shows. It features an ensemble cast of criminals all mucking about a big, beautiful city that they just can\'t seem to quit despite its dangers - only, unlike DRRR!!, it\'s not...boring? My problem with shows similar to HTR is that the cast always feels too big for me to actually care about the characters, but HTR\'s is really only around twelve main characters. The plotlines are simplistic and the twists are easy to see coming, much like Great Pretender, but because the characters are engaging it actually feels worth it to see them through. Additionally, each plot also tells the backstory of one of HTR\'s central characters, just as GP - and even though their backstories are hardly as substantial as those in GP pretend to be, these are just more fun to consume. Maybe because it never feels like the arcs are pretending to be anything they\'re not - the show doesn\'t put up false pretenses. It\'s just cool for the sake of being cool.The art and sound got the job done. I was NOT a fan of the opening theme song, but the closing theme song was alright. There was nothing wrong with the art style or execution, per se - it just wasn\'t a central focus of the show. I love the aesthetics of anime and how it can be taken to the next level, but in this case, I can forgive the simplicity because it never detracted too much from the experience overall. Additionally, the voice cast was amazing - I mean, Kaji Yuki, Ono Daisuke, and Ono Kensho? Hanae Natsuki and Tsuda Kenjiro? Come on!A good character or two will always be a major incentive for me to consume any form of media in its entirety regardless of its flaws. HTR was no different. Lin Xianming is one of the most endearing, delightful little tsunderes I\'ve ever encountered in all my years of watching anime and I\'m forever grateful I decided to watch HTR for the sole reason of encountering him. I loved his design - the crossdressing detail was handled refreshingly as an entirely acceptable and normal hobby, which it IS and SHOULD ALWAYS BE PORTRAYED AS - and his two dedicated arcs in the show were bundles of fun and angst all wrapped up into one. Banba was also really sweet, if a little plain, and all the side characters were enjoyable too. I was particularly fond of Enokida and Dr. Saeki as well! The way the antiheroes and main characters bumped up against one another throughout the series was hilarious and relaxing - you don\'t feel forced to hate and despise anyone, at the end of the day. Overall, an incredibly likable and easy to get to know cast of characters! I wish they all could have gotten their own arcs.I will now take a moment to point out the queerbait (?) of the show, and how I absolutely fell for it hook, line, and sinker. I have no idea why they didn\'t just go all-in and solidify Banba and Xianming\'s relationship as a romantic one - as a matter of fact, I did some reading up on the original light novel series and it seems as though they practically are a couple in that, so I have no idea why they chose to hetero-wash the anime! There are several intimate moments between the pair (coupled with a few unrelated ""Hell no! I\'m not gay!"" exclamations from Xianming, which was frankly entirely unnecessary) and though I know it\'s probably nothing but queerbait, like I said, there\'s a part of me that wants to read it as explicit subtext regardless. I will say, however, there were two openly and canonically gay side characters in the show, which made me very happy to see!I really liked this anime. I honestly don\'t exactly know why, but I definitely did. It\'s just a really fun time, filled with as many baseball metaphors as it is improbable amounts of blood spraying out from someone\'s newly sliced carotid arteries and always able to leave you feeling warm and satisfied with the characters and the story. No, it\'s not a life-changing work of art, but it\'s a great way to pass the time and actually enjoy the time you\'re passing along the way. That enjoyment score means a lot when it comes to my ratings, because at the end of the day that\'s why I watch anime - to be entertained and to enjoy myself.

Story: Hakata is infamous city for being luxury and lot of different criminal business running rampant. There is also legendary man called ""Niwaka Samurai"" whose job is to murder the murderer.

Only then would they find humor in such a comical anime like this one. A short anime, but the details within a particular anime such as this one are simply inrvaled. It\'s interesting.

Boku no Hero Academia 5th Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41587/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_5th_Season,"['This show got worse? I’m sorry, but what the fuck are you talking about? How is this any different than it has ever been?Ever since working from home became a thing, my alcoholism has gotten exponentially worse, and I think I’m dying. Sometimes I’ll stand up, and then just find myself on the floor. Other times I can’t tell if I’m hungover, legitimately ill, or if I simply laid down funny and part of my body fell asleep. I’ve been an insomniac for years, but now my circadian rhythm is completely fucked. But the biggest issue is my memory. I’d rather eat nails than...try watching this shit sober, so much of this season is foggy to me, but what I do remember about it just makes me want to drown myself in even more liquor. Most of it is spent going back to interclass tournament arc style bullshit that’s filled with recap footage and feels like filler even when it isn’t. It was dumb, ugly, and I hated every second of it. The villains come back toward the end, but they’re still one-dimensional nobodies with nothing interesting to say about anything, and there’s still zero stakes because, just in case you forgot, “This is the story of how I became the greatest hero!” The artwork and coloration are hideous since Bones only cares about making non-canon movies, the show is 80% still images, the pacing is at once horrendously rushed but at other times painfully slow, and the fights are more panning stills with people screaming and crying at each other like autistic babies. It looks awful and nothing about it is entertaining. Everything it has ever done, is doing, and will continue to do has been done before, sometimes well, but often terribly, and even in the former case, many such properties are dragged out until they crash and burn or just slowly decline into dogshit. This series is somehow doing both, but you wouldn’t think so if you listened to its common reception, and I find this rather odd. Apparently, this show began to sully its reputation during season four, and its deterioration has clearly continued, but what’s weird is this has prompted people to start reminiscing about better times, and I don’t understand this at all. People talk about the good ol’ days, back when this was a show about a powerless kid working hard and overcoming weakness and hardship, whereas now we’re just watching an overpowered Gary Stu with infinite power who’s totally unsympathetic, and therefore it’s worse. This is not only bizarre considering the quote I used earlier, where season one begins by outright telling us Midoriya is destined to become the world’s greatest hero, but also because the series never embraced these themes to begin with.I know it’s typical to refer to the protagonist of a story as the “hero,” but one should only be celebrated as a hero if they preform heroic feats. People often conflate heroism with classic altruism, being a selfless actor who is concerned more with the needs and wishes of others than with their own, but whereas altruism is more about selflessness no matter the context, actual heroism requires self-sacrifice, putting yourself in harm’s way for the sake of others. It is for this reason the word is so often associated with the phrase, “war hero,” a solider who loses their life in battle placing valor, duty, and honor above their own personal safety. When it’s revealed All Might wasn’t born with a quirk and had instead been given one by a benefactor, it squanders the underdog story inherent in Midoriya’s determination to become a superhero despite his own powerlessness, but it also makes you wonder. What is even the point of delineating between people with and without quirks when, by this logic, a quirk isn’t even a congenital factor of one’s birth? The concept of “disadvantage” doesn’t hold in a world where “advantage” is a tangible commodity able to be gifted. This misunderstands the burden of superpowers and what it actually means to have one. The privilege of power materializes only in what you are physically able to do as compared to those without such privilege. Advantage is a blessing, a boon, it makes life easier like advanced technology, modern infrastructure, or even clean water does in the developed world, but as seen in Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia (then called Abyssinia) in 1935 or Japan’s invasion of China in 1937, advantage also makes violence and destruction far more devastating when used against the disadvantaged, so as the saying goes, “with great power comes great responsibility.” You can’t fuck around like a stupid, self-obsessed teenager if you can also go nuclear, and this is exactly what boils my blood about My Hero Academia. They insist it’s about heroism, but it’s really about ambition. Mount Lady became a hero for the sole purpose of gaining celebrity status by letting people take pictures of her giant ass in spandex, and Bakugo himself openly admits he\'s motivated by glory and proving his egotistic sense of superiority. What the hell does any of this have do with heroism? This is vanity and pride. People these days use the word “hero” so glibly, as if “icon” and “hero” have somehow become synonymous, decided by popularity as opposed to the morality of one’s conduct.It seems the real heroism was the sales we made along the way. Any celebrity or public figure can be christened a hero simply because they’re successful, not because they’re righteous. Bakugo shouldn’t have been allowed to participate in the hero exam in the first place! He thinks like a villain, and had the exam really been a matter of heroism, he would’ve been rejected the second he opened his mouth. Instead he’s allowed to progress, because as long as he scores high enough in the exam, anyone can. UA Academy, and by extension this entire show, does not promote heroism. Being accepted by the school because you’re powerful doesn’t give you moral license to call yourself a hero because not only have you preformed nothing heroic, but never does it require you to. It’s therefore not teaching you to be a hero either, because it permits motivations like fame and glory which by definition are completely unheroic. In fact, what the series truly promotes is this bizarre doctrine of social Darwinism. It contradicts the very themes its terminology attempts to establish while also brainwashing the teenagers and college kids watching it into thinking heroism is something totally selfish. Midoriya’s origin story seems to want to promote the idea that you don’t necessarily have to be powerful to do good, and the desire to do good can itself lead to you becoming powerful (while also being sure to portray said power as an opportunity to do so). You only need half a mind to see how it utterly fails to do this when All Might simply hands him the power needed to proceed, rendering his entire training montage pointless, but what many don’t realize his how insidious this mindset truly is. I’m not saying the author of this series is evil—in all likelihood, they’re simply naive—but they fail to understand the social implications of saying the desire for power to achieve goals is intrinsically heroic. If you start with nothing and attempt to become powerful to do good, the probability that your perception of justice is not seated in jealously of the privileged who you feel have done injustice to you is incredibly slim, especially in a world like this where the “have nots” are openly discriminated against by the “haves.” I’m not saying the only vehicle for realism is cynicism, but what I am saying is such a contrived, saccharine sweet, cloyingly optimistic view of the world is simply dishonest. This show just has a wrongheaded idea of what heroism even means, and this is nowhere near the only toxic message it has to offer.In life, you learn from your mistakes by enduring the shame, defeat, and loss which they bear, and only after examining and confronting these consequence of your own actions and shortcomings do you get back on your feet and win. My Hero Academia, however, operates by the logic of participation trophies. Nothing is achieved through genuine determination, and anything which is, is undercut by rendering the determination unnecessary through extenuating circumstances which would’ve led to a net gain either way. Even if he loses the tournament, he’s sent to train with the best teacher. Even if the class is defeated by the villains, no one dies, is taken hostage, or seriously endangered. Even if his ridiculously overpowered ability comes at a physical cost, it’s always healed instantly. In this world of heroes and villains, what defines you isn’t how talented you are or how powerful your quirk is, it’s about hard work, spirit, and the willingness to help others against all odds—only it’s not, because he wouldn’t even be a hero if there wasn’t hidden rules back in the original exam during season one. It’s portrayed as if Midoriya’s hard work and benevolent intentions were what made him worthy of All Might’s powers after he trained for a few months—fuck anyone who’s been doing so for their entire life, am I right?—but you have to realize he began training only AFTER he was PROMISED THE POWER. His efforts were impure, because his reward was guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how hard he trained, because there was no risk of failure, since his self-serving reward was set in stone before he expended ANY effort. I mean, it’s not even correct to say he trained to earn the power, as much as it is to say he simply prepared for All Might to gift it to him. All Might is a teacher; this is academic favoritism. The only thing this series ever got right was Stain. My Hero Academia is generic superhero shlock, but Stain challenged the very moral bankruptcy I’ve spend the last two paragraphs detailing, taking the heroes to task for their hypocritical corporate marketing and corrupt motivations, but after the anticlimactic battle with him ends, everyone ignores the manner in which he subverted their bastardization of heroism, all the thematic underpinnings of his arc are trashed, everyone forgets the incident like nothing happened, and we all go right back to boring school-life nonsense, filler horseshit, and shounen training arcs. We’re back to square one, and we learned nothing from the only scrap of intrigue in the entire series.Season five is the epitome of everything I’ve bitched about, too, because not only does it uphold and continue to promote these fraudulent ideas of heroism, but from the plot to the characters, it’s also the worst possible incarnation of the anime in every way. I haven’t kept up with this show for years, so coming back and putting in the hard slave labor of slogging through this season was pure fucking hell. I’d heard about the broken loli waifu character who could nullify any damage Midoriya did to himself by being carried into battle with him Guilty Crown style, but gosh, who knew every other character would get this preposterous?! So apparently—SPOILERS—Shigaraki is nothing but a literally insane, edgelord school-shooter now? Wasn’t he supposed to be Big Bad #2? Why would the hack authoring this disaster remove any chance the series had at a more thoughtful, interesting villain with new and challenging ideas and instead settle for Jared Leto’s Joker? Now it’s even more threadbare and hackneyed than before—great! Since I last watched this, the power creep has seemingly reached Azathoth scale, and I don’t see how anyone is supposed to matter when a few select characters are insurmountably more powerful than everyone else. Speaking of which, these fights are still the worst of the fucking worst. Minus one or two overdone action scenes, they just exchange blows with nauseating amounts of speed lines and other bullshit to distract you from the largely embarrassing animation production at hand. Plot conveniences still favor Midoriya at every step of the way, even when you may think otherwise, and the author still resorts to excusing asspulls with non-diegetic retcons, like that time in season three when the 1,000,000% Smash wasn’t actually one million percent because the author said so on Twitter, the thing which originally made me drop the show. Even as far back as season two, Midoriya wouldn’t have been able to break the mind control during the tournament if it weren’t conveniently written in such a way his quirk could counter, and it’s no surprise they’re still pulling this shit speaking of the aforementioned power creep, because how else could they limit the main cast now that they too are overpowered if not by introducing every seemingly unbeatable power with one single little weakness which just so happens to make the character in question wildly underpowered when fighting the protagonist who the series is still for some reason treating like an underdog.My Hero Academia is a conventional ""hero"" story. Nothing about it has ever broken the mold or subverted the expectations of anyone who’s seen anything like it, or in other words, anyone who’s seen any shounen anime in the history of existence, but unlike every other shounen anime in the history of existence, My Hero Academia is ugly. Yes, this season has particularly shitty animation, but that’s not what I’m talking about. I mean the design sense is awful. Please just take a second to think about shounen’s Big Three. Depending on the character, the designs in Bleach can be downright erotic, and it’s filled to the brim with hot babes and chad hunks. One Piece has some of the most distinctive and eye-catching designs in manga, and while Naruto’s designs aren’t exactly glamorous or creative, its color palette is at least consistent, and Tetsuya Nishio’s anime adaptation designs were outstanding. The newer hits also follow this pattern. I think everyone agrees Demon Slayer’s artwork is all it has ever had going for it in both manga and anime form, Hiro Mashima’s success is openly predicated on nothing but sex-appeal, and just look at One Punch Man. It was a cult classic when ONE was drawing it, but when Yusuke Murata began drawing it three years later with his insane digital manga detailing and irresistible women, it took the world by storm. Say what you will about these series perpetuating visual archetypes despite high-quality artwork, but Jesus Christ on a fucking bike, at least their character designs are worth advertising! BUT EVERY CHARACTER in My Hero Academia looks PANTS ON HEAD RETARDED, and forgive me for sounding so close-minded, but I simply will not entertain an argument to the contrary. They are just fucking goofy, period. Maybe, just maybe, one or two waifus are marketable, but most just look dumb, and the thoughtless coloration of the anime makes the weirder ones stand out like a sore thumb and lose any niche moe they may’ve had in manga form. Also, and I’m usually not one to complain about fanservice, but when highschool girls dress like camera sluts despite having a shy and modest personality, their whole character feels backward. I suppose it doesn’t matter, though, since even our protagonist himself is an inconsistent mess, an incongruous chimera who is both a crybaby loser who the viewer can empathize with during melodrama, and also a stone-faced alpha male they can self-insert with during hype action to satiate their trashy power fantasies.A few years ago, people began saying, “A-1 Pictures is the problem,” and I naively thought everyone was finally waking up to the issues plaguing the industry. However, since then, everyone has turned their ire toward other studios like Deen and JC Staff, because Post-Maruyama MAPPA is now guilty of everything everyone hated A-1 for, but since MAPPA also produces many of the newest fan-favorites, those same people who were rightfully decrying A-1 for their incorrigible outsourcing, absurd mismanagement, inhumane scheduling and working conditions, and cynical “quantity over quality” business model have now had to forgive and forget so they don’t sound like hypocrites when sucking up to their new favorites. I, on the other hand, have not forgotten this outrage we used to share, and in an attempt to rekindle negative attention toward these toxic business practices, I too stopped saying “A-1 Pictures is the problem,” only so I could instead start saying, “If A-1 Pictures is THE problem, then Bones is MY problem.” Like many others, Bones has sometimes engaged in these poor practices as well, of course nowhere near as much as A-1 or MAPPA, but the real reason I feel they should be maligned is different. I feel they should be maligned for manipulating their impressionable teenage, college-aged fanbase into marketing their anime for them. Don’t even worry about the complete fucking trainwrecks like their 20th Anniversary Production, Carole & Tuesday, and just watch My Hero Academia, Bungou Stray Dogs, Noragami, or even some of their shit with actual artistic integrity like Captain Earth or Concrete Revolutio, and I dare you to tell me you found ANY fucking consistency therein. Sure, you’ll have a few flashy action scenes drawn by a few talented holdouts from their early Sunrise days like Yutaka Nakamura, but their background art and compositing are often pitiful, and the animation itself is atrocious outside those few action scenes. But those action scenes are more then enough, because they’ll metastasize through social media and forum sites like a cancer and infect every unsuspecting consumer they can find. Bones earned their reputation in the 2000s and early 2010s when they were just a bunch of Ex-Sunrise boys whose creative ambitions were too big for Bandai, but they saw where that creator-focused business model lead Manglobe, and they aren’t stupid. This is why I call it a me problem and not a real problem, because not only is it silly to slap a label on entire studios when many have constantly changing staff, constantly restructured teams, constantly fluctuating budgets, and are almost always managed by corporate level business decisions which are made by production committees far above the pay grade of the actual creators working there, but also because to this day, Bones continues to produce amazing and objectively impressive works of animation. However, the prestige they justly earn from such projects goes on to unjustly ascribe prestige to other projects which look like they were fished out of a fucking pig sty, and those who’d mistake a Blue Raspberry Ring Pop for a Ten Carat Diamond Ring eat it up regardless, hailing Bones as the consistent and absolute best.I’m required to make the disclaimer that I dropped season three six episodes in and didn’t watch season four. Big funny.Thank you for reading. try watching this shit sober, so much of this season is foggy to me, but what I do remember about it just makes me want to drown myself in even more liquor. Most of it is spent going back to interclass tournament arc style bullshit that’s filled with recap footage and feels like filler even when it isn’t. It was dumb, ugly, and I hated every second of it. The villains come back toward the end, but they’re still one-dimensional nobodies with nothing interesting to say about anything, and there’s still zero stakes because, just in case you forgot, “This is the story of how I became the greatest hero!” The artwork and coloration are hideous since Bones only cares about making non-canon movies, the show is 80% still images, the pacing is at once horrendously rushed but at other times painfully slow, and the fights are more panning stills with people screaming and crying at each other like autistic babies. It looks awful and nothing about it is entertaining. Everything it has ever done, is doing, and will continue to do has been done before, sometimes well, but often terribly, and even in the former case, many such properties are dragged out until they crash and burn or just slowly decline into dogshit. This series is somehow doing both, but you wouldn’t think so if you listened to its common reception, and I find this rather odd. Apparently, this show began to sully its reputation during season four, and its deterioration has clearly continued, but what’s weird is this has prompted people to start reminiscing about better times, and I don’t understand this at all. People talk about the good ol’ days, back when this was a show about a powerless kid working hard and overcoming weakness and hardship, whereas now we’re just watching an overpowered Gary Stu with infinite power who’s totally unsympathetic, and therefore it’s worse. This is not only bizarre considering the quote I used earlier, where season one begins by outright telling us Midoriya is destined to become the world’s greatest hero, but also because the series never embraced these themes to begin with.I know it’s typical to refer to the protagonist of a story as the “hero,” but one should only be celebrated as a hero if they preform heroic feats. People often conflate heroism with classic altruism, being a selfless actor who is concerned more with the needs and wishes of others than with their own, but whereas altruism is more about selflessness no matter the context, actual heroism requires self-sacrifice, putting yourself in harm’s way for the sake of others. It is for this reason the word is so often associated with the phrase, “war hero,” a solider who loses their life in battle placing valor, duty, and honor above their own personal safety. When it’s revealed All Might wasn’t born with a quirk and had instead been given one by a benefactor, it squanders the underdog story inherent in Midoriya’s determination to become a superhero despite his own powerlessness, but it also makes you wonder. What is even the point of delineating between people with and without quirks when, by this logic, a quirk isn’t even a congenital factor of one’s birth? The concept of “disadvantage” doesn’t hold in a world where “advantage” is a tangible commodity able to be gifted. This misunderstands the burden of superpowers and what it actually means to have one. The privilege of power materializes only in what you are physically able to do as compared to those without such privilege. Advantage is a blessing, a boon, it makes life easier like advanced technology, modern infrastructure, or even clean water does in the developed world, but as seen in Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia (then called Abyssinia) in 1935 or Japan’s invasion of China in 1937, advantage also makes violence and destruction far more devastating when used against the disadvantaged, so as the saying goes, “with great power comes great responsibility.” You can’t fuck around like a stupid, self-obsessed teenager if you can also go nuclear, and this is exactly what boils my blood about My Hero Academia. They insist it’s about heroism, but it’s really about ambition. Mount Lady became a hero for the sole purpose of gaining celebrity status by letting people take pictures of her giant ass in spandex, and Bakugo himself openly admits he\'s motivated by glory and proving his egotistic sense of superiority. What the hell does any of this have do with heroism? This is vanity and pride. People these days use the word “hero” so glibly, as if “icon” and “hero” have somehow become synonymous, decided by popularity as opposed to the morality of one’s conduct.It seems the real heroism was the sales we made along the way. Any celebrity or public figure can be christened a hero simply because they’re successful, not because they’re righteous. Bakugo shouldn’t have been allowed to participate in the hero exam in the first place! He thinks like a villain, and had the exam really been a matter of heroism, he would’ve been rejected the second he opened his mouth. Instead he’s allowed to progress, because as long as he scores high enough in the exam, anyone can. UA Academy, and by extension this entire show, does not promote heroism. Being accepted by the school because you’re powerful doesn’t give you moral license to call yourself a hero because not only have you preformed nothing heroic, but never does it require you to. It’s therefore not teaching you to be a hero either, because it permits motivations like fame and glory which by definition are completely unheroic. In fact, what the series truly promotes is this bizarre doctrine of social Darwinism. It contradicts the very themes its terminology attempts to establish while also brainwashing the teenagers and college kids watching it into thinking heroism is something totally selfish. Midoriya’s origin story seems to want to promote the idea that you don’t necessarily have to be powerful to do good, and the desire to do good can itself lead to you becoming powerful (while also being sure to portray said power as an opportunity to do so). You only need half a mind to see how it utterly fails to do this when All Might simply hands him the power needed to proceed, rendering his entire training montage pointless, but what many don’t realize his how insidious this mindset truly is. I’m not saying the author of this series is evil—in all likelihood, they’re simply naive—but they fail to understand the social implications of saying the desire for power to achieve goals is intrinsically heroic. If you start with nothing and attempt to become powerful to do good, the probability that your perception of justice is not seated in jealously of the privileged who you feel have done injustice to you is incredibly slim, especially in a world like this where the “have nots” are openly discriminated against by the “haves.” I’m not saying the only vehicle for realism is cynicism, but what I am saying is such a contrived, saccharine sweet, cloyingly optimistic view of the world is simply dishonest. This show just has a wrongheaded idea of what heroism even means, and this is nowhere near the only toxic message it has to offer.In life, you learn from your mistakes by enduring the shame, defeat, and loss which they bear, and only after examining and confronting these consequence of your own actions and shortcomings do you get back on your feet and win. My Hero Academia, however, operates by the logic of participation trophies. Nothing is achieved through genuine determination, and anything which is, is undercut by rendering the determination unnecessary through extenuating circumstances which would’ve led to a net gain either way. Even if he loses the tournament, he’s sent to train with the best teacher. Even if the class is defeated by the villains, no one dies, is taken hostage, or seriously endangered. Even if his ridiculously overpowered ability comes at a physical cost, it’s always healed instantly. In this world of heroes and villains, what defines you isn’t how talented you are or how powerful your quirk is, it’s about hard work, spirit, and the willingness to help others against all odds—only it’s not, because he wouldn’t even be a hero if there wasn’t hidden rules back in the original exam during season one. It’s portrayed as if Midoriya’s hard work and benevolent intentions were what made him worthy of All Might’s powers after he trained for a few months—fuck anyone who’s been doing so for their entire life, am I right?—but you have to realize he began training only AFTER he was PROMISED THE POWER. His efforts were impure, because his reward was guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how hard he trained, because there was no risk of failure, since his self-serving reward was set in stone before he expended ANY effort. I mean, it’s not even correct to say he trained to earn the power, as much as it is to say he simply prepared for All Might to gift it to him. All Might is a teacher; this is academic favoritism. The only thing this series ever got right was Stain. My Hero Academia is generic superhero shlock, but Stain challenged the very moral bankruptcy I’ve spend the last two paragraphs detailing, taking the heroes to task for their hypocritical corporate marketing and corrupt motivations, but after the anticlimactic battle with him ends, everyone ignores the manner in which he subverted their bastardization of heroism, all the thematic underpinnings of his arc are trashed, everyone forgets the incident like nothing happened, and we all go right back to boring school-life nonsense, filler horseshit, and shounen training arcs. We’re back to square one, and we learned nothing from the only scrap of intrigue in the entire series.Season five is the epitome of everything I’ve bitched about, too, because not only does it uphold and continue to promote these fraudulent ideas of heroism, but from the plot to the characters, it’s also the worst possible incarnation of the anime in every way. I haven’t kept up with this show for years, so coming back and putting in the hard slave labor of slogging through this season was pure fucking hell. I’d heard about the broken loli waifu character who could nullify any damage Midoriya did to himself by being carried into battle with him Guilty Crown style, but gosh, who knew every other character would get this preposterous?! So apparently—SPOILERS—Shigaraki is nothing but a literally insane, edgelord school-shooter now? Wasn’t he supposed to be Big Bad #2? Why would the hack authoring this disaster remove any chance the series had at a more thoughtful, interesting villain with new and challenging ideas and instead settle for Jared Leto’s Joker? Now it’s even more threadbare and hackneyed than before—great! Since I last watched this, the power creep has seemingly reached Azathoth scale, and I don’t see how anyone is supposed to matter when a few select characters are insurmountably more powerful than everyone else. Speaking of which, these fights are still the worst of the fucking worst. Minus one or two overdone action scenes, they just exchange blows with nauseating amounts of speed lines and other bullshit to distract you from the largely embarrassing animation production at hand. Plot conveniences still favor Midoriya at every step of the way, even when you may think otherwise, and the author still resorts to excusing asspulls with non-diegetic retcons, like that time in season three when the 1,000,000% Smash wasn’t actually one million percent because the author said so on Twitter, the thing which originally made me drop the show.

Big funny.Thank you for reading.', ""I did enjoy the plot idea of the first couple of episodes of this show, especially with all the different and unique quirks used in the battles between classmates of 1a and 1b. It's nice how they bring back the fights from season 2 and make them even better with their new special moves and all that. However, in my opinion, the battles were just so boring, and it was the only reason why I gave up watching the show and started to speed read the manga. I knew that the fights between both classes are only a couple of chapters long, and after that,...it gets to the good shit. However, the battles just seemed so useless, and I would prefer if the studio would start the adaptation at the beginning of the next arc since it's just better than the class battles in pretty much everything.Besides that, I can't see this show becoming darker because it's just so childish. After all, when I started watching this show at the beginning of last year. I always believed it to be some kid show with some adult and darkish jokes and scenes stashed behind it. I could see this in the fights like the one between All Might vs One for All because it was indeed the most important battle back then. However, after the battle finished, the show slowly loses its excitement and maturity and eventually becomes childish once more. I look at this as a repeating cycle that happens in every season, and it just makes me pissed when it happens because it just ruins my enjoyment of the show.Anyways, I would rate this show a 1/10 due to the disappointment it gave me. I would have rated it a higher score if the show had evenly distributed the dark themes and plot points throughout the previous seasons.Notes: I would be pissed if they have to add another season just to start the next arc because I have to wait another year or more just to come out (I'm becoming impatient with this show now).I also hate the downgrade of the animation for this season. It was really good in season 4, but in this season, it's just so crap. I hope the animators fix it after the class battle arc is finished.Oh yeah, I just hate every single character in the show besides Creati, and you should know why.Also, if you don't like my opinion about this show, it's fine with me. I don't mind if you love this show, and I won't bully you just for that. Go like what you like. I'm not here to ruin your favourite things lmao. it gets to the good shit.

Even though I’m not a My Hero Academia enthusiast or even a fan for that matter, I can wholeheartedly say that this season of My Hero Academia was supposed to be the series game-changer and tone shifter. The 5th season was supposed to set My Hero Academia in a new and more compelling direction. A direction that would’ve brought My Hero Academia’s writing to a new height because of the fascinating and enchanting thematic value that it has to offer. As the egregious season has...finally encroach to its end, I can say that the changes the anime made will devalue and potentially destroy the story that Kouhei Horikoshi originally intended to tell.The anime only had one job: Adapt the source material faithfully and bring the spirit of the manga onto the screen. The studio behind the anime has done it before and is capable of doing it, but they purposely dragged out the pacing of the first arc to this season just so enough time is given for a non-canon side film. The second half of the season was pretty much filler content mixed in with minuscule canon manga materials, which ultimately created an unnecessary mess that the future installment must clarify later on. The choice of dragging things out and making changes to the narrative structure ruined how the future narrative will play out.You could advocate that I should evaluate the 5th season of My Hero by excluding my knowledge of the source material. But that would, in my eyes, be doing a massive disservice to myself. And in no way that I’m comfortable in doing so. Furthermore, I’m dubious that even people with absolutely no knowledge of the source material have praises for this season alone.Honestly, there’s really nothing else to expand on because everything is just pointless. There’s little to no driving force in its narrative, nor was the season even entertaining. The 5th installment of My Hero was just a filler. Skipping the 5th season and you’ll miss nothing. At this point, I’m just hoping My Hero Academia will continue to fade into obscurity because the previous installments aren’t much better. finally encroach to its end, I can say that the changes the anime made will devalue and potentially destroy the story that Kouhei Horikoshi originally intended to tell.The anime only had one job: Adapt the source material faithfully and bring the spirit of the manga onto the screen.

While it may not be the single biggest hit of the decade, it does challenge the Big Three with its cult following. That doesn\'t mean MHA is a masterpiece franchise just because it\'s popular. In fact, MHA may be one of more controversial anime this year.My Hero Academia is a franchise that needs no introduction at this point. It\'s been an established franchise for years and we all came to know the heroes and villains that makes up its roster. For any long time fan, MHA has also explored...the hero society and dark underworld of the villains league. What if I told you we get to see an in depth look at both sides? Season 5 may have a more expanded character roster and plot but that doesn\'t always translate into a better show overall.From the first half of Season 5, we are once again reintroduced to Class 1-A with some of its most prominent characters such as Deku, Bakugo, Todoroki, among others. Their primary rivals are Class 1-B where they compete in a series of matches. To put it simply, it\'s a battle of pride and respect on the line. While Class 1-B\'s character roster is nowhere near as prominent as Class 1-A, there are still some important members to take notice. Among them include Itsuka, Ibara, and Tetsutetsu. Some of these almost represent mirror images of Class 1-A such as Shihai when compared to Tetsutetsu. On the other hand, it\'s hard to root for Class 1-B due to their limited screen time and lack of development. Instead, the season decided to throw them in to showcase their abilities against Class 1-A to see which side is more dominant.When that\'s out of the way, Season 5 also decided that Deku needs more training to improve himself. So what does that lead to? It means training with none other than Endeavor. Deku, Bakugo, and Todoroki decides to all participate to improve themselves. Meanwhile, it appears that Endeavor knows when the Meta Liberation Army will strike so it\'s a chance to prepare everyone for the inevitable battles. While this all seems well structured on the surface, the season decided to drag its pacing by showcasing more of Todoroki\'s past, specifically his family. As if we didn\'t know enough already, the anime really pushes the envelope to show the type of man Endeavor is. It becomes an oversaturated character study where we just want to move on from the past. Let\'s face it, we know enough about Todoroki for who he is. It\'s freaking Season 5 already.But perhaps the most intruging part of Season 5 is the side of the villains. Specifically, I\'m talking about the League of Villain led by Tomura Shigaraki. As one of the most prominent characters in the entire franchise, his dark past is explored in detail from his childhood. It casts a shadow of how a once seemingly innocent kid becomes the gruesome villain he is today. He\'s not the only one we feast our eyes on either as the Villains gets their background stories told that includes Toga and Twice. It\'s important to understand their origins as the show wants us to experience the dark side of MHA. If you ask me, ""My Villain Academia"" is the best thing to happen this season.We\'re in a timeline where every year, MHA makes its presence felt. I say with confidence now that Bones and the directors will adapt the rest of the manga to the dawn of time, for when it ends, so shall the anime. That doesn\'t mean MHA managed to live up to the hype all this time though. And in fact, the next season will have a lot of work to do if it wants to regain its former glory. the hero society and dark underworld of the villains league. What if I told you we get to see an in depth look at both sides? Season 5 may have a more expanded character roster and plot but that doesn\'t always translate into a better show overall.From the first half of Season 5, we are once again reintroduced to Class 1-A with some of its most prominent characters such as Deku, Bakugo, Todoroki, among others. Their primary rivals are Class 1-B where they compete in a series of matches. To put it simply, it\'s a battle of pride and respect on the line. While Class 1-B\'s character roster is nowhere near as prominent as Class 1-A, there are still some important members to take notice. Among them include Itsuka, Ibara, and Tetsutetsu. Some of these almost represent mirror images of Class 1-A such as Shihai when compared to Tetsutetsu. On the other hand, it\'s hard to root for Class 1-B due to their limited screen time and lack of development. Instead, the season decided to throw them in to showcase their abilities against Class 1-A to see which side is more dominant.When that\'s out of the way, Season 5 also decided that Deku needs more training to improve himself. So what does that lead to? It means training with none other than Endeavor. Deku, Bakugo, and Todoroki decides to all participate to improve themselves. Meanwhile, it appears that Endeavor knows when the Meta Liberation Army will strike so it\'s a chance to prepare everyone for the inevitable battles. While this all seems well structured on the surface, the season decided to drag its pacing by showcasing more of Todoroki\'s past, specifically his family. As if we didn\'t know enough already, the anime really pushes the envelope to show the type of man Endeavor is. It becomes an oversaturated character study where we just want to move on from the past. Let\'s face it, we know enough about Todoroki for who he is. It\'s freaking Season 5 already.But perhaps the most intruging part of Season 5 is the side of the villains. Specifically, I\'m talking about the League of Villain led by Tomura Shigaraki. As one of the most prominent characters in the entire franchise, his dark past is explored in detail from his childhood. It casts a shadow of how a once seemingly innocent kid becomes the gruesome villain he is today. He\'s not the only one we feast our eyes on either as the Villains gets their background stories told that includes Toga and Twice. It\'s important to understand their origins as the show wants us to experience the dark side of MHA. If you ask me, ""My Villain Academia"" is the best thing to happen this season.We\'re in a timeline where every year, MHA makes its presence felt. I say with confidence now that Bones and the directors will adapt the rest of the manga to the dawn of time, for when it ends, so shall the anime. That doesn\'t mean MHA managed to live up to the hype all this time though. And in fact, the next season will have a lot of work to do if it wants to regain its former glory.', ""***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***The pros of Boku no Hero Academia s5 are pretty obvious. The characters are still fun, well developed quirks, worldbuilding, etc. Storywise there's not so much so far. The art and sound are still fine to me. Whatever.I just want to focus on the bad parts of s5 mostly. The class A vs B story arc sounds pretty fun in concept. Here's my problems with it though. (The first fight has less problems than the second in my opinion).1. Everyone is still describing everything to the viewer as if everyone watching is a toddler. We can see the action on screen and...we have the power of inference. We don't need a play by play of literally everything that's happening.2. Drawn out fights. Every fight between class A and B is looking like its gonna take 2 episodes which is absolutely ridiculous. Most of it is just useless information and filler of random characters talking slowly.3. Character relationships. I used to ship todomomo a lot, but this ship has gotten really bland. Momo is still way too timid and shows no personality progression. She develops confidence as a leader but still not in herself. Todoroki cares about her feelings and her plans even though there isn't any banter between them. Apparently there is some in the manga but it was cut out of the anime which is stupid because it's important to show why does he care so much.4. Stupid actions and plot convenience. Momo's quirk is overpowered. She just doesn't do anything with it as usual. She makes bulky weapons like a cannon just to launch a bag over a wall. After her usefulness for the episode is done, she just lets Kendo knock her out. I like to imagine anime stuff in my head since I have an imagination. And by far the most I've done it is with Bnha. Mostly to imagine Todoroki being overpowered or highly choreographed fight scenes. But another thing I like to do is fix dumb mistakes. Like I don't know... Momo making a taser to I don't know... incapacitate THE OPPONENT.5. Other random stuff. Class B is a lot more bloodthirsty than class A in this training arc for some reason. Tokoyami gets choked by a mushroom while he is too nice to knock out his opponent (dark shadow just stands there and watches). Momo is literally internally apologizing to Kendo as she is getting her ass kicked.Hopefully these problems get resolved later in the season. we have the power of inference.

Welp, I guess it\'s now time for me to review this thing.This review will have some spoilers BUT THERE WON\'T BE ANY BIG SPOILERS SO NO WORRIES :D.I don\'t even know why I called them spoilers; the stuff I\'ll be mentioning are so little I can really just say this review is spoiler free.Before we start, for those people who are too lazy to read I made a very short version at the end. Just scroll all the way to the end for it.All right let\'s get straight to it !!!! Here\'s a recap...of bnha !!! (You can skip this if you want to get straight to bnha s5\'s review)Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) takes place in a world where 80% of the human population have quirks, special abilities that varies from being able to make explosions to being a freaking seal. Because of this, people have used these quirks to commit evil crimes, these people are known as villains. The people who use their quirks against evil are known as heroes. Our sad main protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, was unfortunately part of the sad 20% of people who didn\'t have any quirks, these people are known as quirkless people. Nevertheless he still strived to be a hero until one day after he almost got devoured by a slime. The number 1 hero, All Might, a hero who smiles even in times of trouble, a hero so strong you can see his abs through the costume, chose Midoriya as the 9th wielder of One For All, a quirk passed down from generation to generation, accumulating power and different quirks from previous wielders. After long training, Midoriya, longing to be like the number 1 hero All Might, enrolls to U.A. Highschool, an academy made for heroes, and ends up breaking all the bones in his body multiple times, gets targetted by multiple terrorist groups, unlocks super saiyan, breaks all of his bones again, defeats a freaking drug lord, and almost evaropated into nothing because a child he rescued.The story idea is amazing. The anime isn\'t though.!!! bnha recap !!!Story: 7Boku No Pico Academia\'s 5th season (I\'ll try my best to not spoil a lot -- If you really don\'t want any spoilers then just skip this criteria) starts with the events following Hawks (no. 2 hero very hawt guy) and Endeavor\'s (no. 1 hero who\'s just tryna have a family again) battle against a Nomu (Monster-like humans with multiple quirks created with All For One). We see Endeavor, with him being the new number 1 hero, a whole lot in this season. The first major part of the season is a series of battles with class A and B. Just before this series of battles, Deku recieves a vision of the previous One For All members. During one of the battles, having received the same vision, Deku Manifests a new quirk! I only included the first major part and non-key info of this season to avoid spoiling anything :DArt: 8Boku No Pico Academia\'s animation for this fifth season was very consistent. There weren\'t any episodes that was poorly made and there weren\'t any episodes that I would say better than others. bnha\'s animation overall is pretty great, but I don\'t know if it\'s just me or the animation was better during the previous seasons and I don\'t really see anything in the animation that really surprises me. I don\'t really see any reason why I should give their art a 9. I don\'t really have much to say about their animation. IT\'S GREAT OKAY IT\'S JUST I DON\'T HAVE THE WORDS RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT MOVING ON!Sound: 8Just like their art, there aren\'t much to say about Boku No Pico Academia\'s sound LOL. I don\'t really see anything bad nor do I see anything that great? Oooo but I really like the first ending song it\'s very catchy and the rest of the openings and endings are pretty good too. I PERSONALLY DON\'T LIKE THE SECOND OPENING; I EVEN SKIP IT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE -- please don\'t kill me -- . Voice acting and sound fx all sound pretty natural. Like I said nothing much to say.Okey it\'s time for the characters; I\'m very excited for this one.Character: 5One thing I don\'t like about Boku No Pico Academia -- I should really stop calling it that -- is that there\'s WAY too many characters. The amount of characters that show up in my screen is more than the history terms I have to memorize for my finals. Come on do you really expect me to memorize all of them??? Since there\'s more bnha characters than the sands of the earth, we barely know anything about the characters. There isn\'t just enough time to properly introduce every single one; that\'s why we only have surface level information for everyone. MOST SCREENTIME DOESN\'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT SINCE THEY\'RE SO BUSY SHOWING A FLASHBACK FOR SOME CHARACTER I DON\'T EVEN CARE ABOUT OR MAYBE TOO BUSY WITH SHOWING US TODOROKI\'S FAMILY ISSUES. * Ehem * Forgive me; I got carried away. Because of bnha\'s large collection of characters, character development is also very slow. It took Bakugo 5 seasons to learn that a hero\'s job is to save people and 5 seasons to know that team work makes the dream work. LIKE BRU- ALSO DEKU WHEN THE HECK ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE SOMEONE HAS A HUGE CRUSH ON YOU AND MY GIRL WHEN ARE YOU GONNA CONFESS?? Also Tetsuo please forgive your dad (Mr. Endeavor San aka no. 1 hero) I know it\'s hard, but he\'s trying his best to have a family again; so please forgive him. Once again, because bnha has more characters than the members of every isekai main character\'s harem have, everyone doesn\'t have much of a personality. I CAN SUM UP MOST OF EVERYONE\'S PERSONALITY IN SEASON 5 IN ONE SENTENCE WATCH ME.Deku: I HAVE TO GET STRONGER TO BECOME #1 HERO * cries *Iida: THERE IS NO POINT IN GETTING SAD- LET\'S ALL MOVE ON AND TRAIN TO GET STRONGER. PLUS ULTRA !!!!Bakugo: LOL noob ur never passing me just go die and go straight to hell idc about ur silly dreams. go to hell.Mr. Endeavor San: SHOOOTOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!! #AllMight_kinda_noob #I_wanna_have_a_family_againTodoroki: Frick u dad.Ochako: OH MY LORD I JUST HUGGED DEKU KUN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG OMG OMG OMG OMGMidnight: AWWWW OMG U GUYS ARE SO CUTE HOW ADORABLE !!!!! UWU !!!!!Those may not be very accurate, but you know what I mean right? They all have one-dimension personalities. There are really just too much characters and because of that, bnha characters aren\'t very special. Most Boku No Pico Academia male characters only exist for gay ships and all the girls for ----- well you knowww. Don\'t get me wrong I don\'t dislike bnha\'s characters; I actually like them, since I relate to some of them in a way, but hear me out. THERE ARE JUST TOO MUCH BOKU NO PICO ACADEMIA CHARACTERS.Enjoyment: 5I don\'t enjoy Boku No Pico Academia. I started watching bnha, because my former bestfriend asked me to watch it and since I\'ve already seen seasons 1-4, I might as well watch season 5 too. I personally believe bnha is made for a younger audience -- I MYSELF IS NOT OLD OKAY IM REFERRING TO TEENS AND PRETEENS --. It doesn\'t make sense though, since there are uh. How do I explain. * ehem * Midnight * ehem * Mountain Lady * ehem * Momo Yaoyarazu -- I don\'t know if I spelled that correctly --. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN. As I was saying, I believe bnha was made for preteens. Most jokes aren\'t even funny (for me atleast) and rather childish (yes I just said childish). Some jokes are just very overused. Stuff like deku talking a lot and being a complete nerd; blabbing a lot of crap that no one cares about and people making him shut up used to be funny, BUT IT\'S BEEN 5 SEASONS LET\'S TRY UH OTHER THINGS PERHAPS? Also Kacchan being loud and disrespectful used to be really funny but It\'s getting kind of annoying to be honest. Now for fight scenes. I used to love Boku No Pico academia\'s fight scenes. I honestly don\'t know why anymore. I don\'t know why I ever loved their fight scenes. bnha battles are just 60% side characters stating the obvious facts about the battle, 20% chit chat between the people fighting , 10% screaming ""IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?"", 5% shouting the names of their ultimate moves and 5% actual fighting. Don\'t get me wrong, I actually enjoy battles from shounen animes it\'s just I don\'t like side characters that I don\'t care about talk about the battle. IT\'S AWKWARD. Another thing is bnha\'s very slow plot pacing. It\'s so extremely slow and because of that I don\'t really find bnha that interesting anymore compared to when it was at the first two seasons. I just continue watching for the sake of finishing.Overall: 6In conclusion, Boku No Pico Academia is just another shounen anime. The only thing this anime has anything different to offer is that it\'s main character is a total wimp and cries a lot and this anime has infinitely more characters. LOL all jokes aside, Boku No Hero Academia is an \'okay\' anime. It has a fairly nice story and plotline with great animation and sound. To be real, great animation and music is all Boku No Hero Academia is. bnha is very overrated. If you truly love this show and this is the type of anime you enjoy, that\'s okay. We all have our preferences and own opinions. I don\'t necessarily hate bnha, but it\'s definitely not the anime for me... and that is my review for Boku No Hero Academia Season 5 THANCHU FOR READING !!! HAVE A GREAT DAY :DFor those too lazy to read:Story: 7Art: 8 - consistent good animationSound: 8 - good sound. opening and ending songs are pretty good tooCharacter: 5 - bland characters and very slow character developmentEnjoyment: 5 - very slow plot pacing; made for a younger audience7 + 2(8) + 2(5) = 3333/5 = 6.6I suddenly forgot how to round up.Overall: 6 of bnha !!!

I was tricked too and picked it back up after 2 months. This season is getting really juicy and goes further into details in regards to ""One for All"" as well as some soon to be big fights. Stick around through the initial match ups for Deku\'s fight. TRUST me! It gets good and the whole story is starting to unravel.... You could technically skip a few episodes, but I don\'t want to spoil anything. ', ""Season five of MHA is here, and while I do personally enjoy the series, I do have to say that it might be within your best interests to wait for the series to either be finished, or wait until a few episodes have come out in order to progress with it. Not to say it's bad, but more that it at current stage, may take weeks to really go somewhere. Even if you understand the plot, understand what it's doing. Even then, it can be quite tiresome.I normally don't fully agree with the idea that 'Read the manga it's better' type of deal, as...I do feel like the anime can stand on it's own merit. But even now, I'd say it'd be better for you to go read the manga to get further within the story, rather than waiting for the current stuff to start progressing faster then the pace it currently is doing so.Not saying the story is bad, as I wouldn't discredit what it's trying to do currently, as it can be interesting for some, but for others, it can just get a tad bit repetitive, and making you have to wait a fair few weeks until it's over with, so you can finally see whats upcoming next more than anything. But if you're wondering if to pick this up and start watching it weekly, it might be ideal for you to wait until things start picking up. Right now, it's a bit of a slow burn. With I'm sure things will start getting better later on.As for everything else? Can't really say much of a bad word about it. MHA's animation, art style, and sound design as always been stellar, and a real good thing about the show. While some shows are lacking in areas, MHA always brings it out really well when it comes in that area. Or least does a real good job within this department.The characters are also another part that keeps the interest within this show. After all, we've seen most of them for four seasons now, and I'm sure, the more we see, the more development we'll get. It'll only get better from there. Say what you will about these characters. Where they'd be written bad or good, but they very much stand out a ton, in many departments.MHA is far more enjoyable if you binge it honestly, I'd say watch it if you want to keep up with it, but if you wanna wait, then that's more than a good idea also.

I thought there wasn’t even going to be a show that stands up against the like of Naruto but this show proved its worth and stole the hearts of teenagers of this era. From people calling it the future of the shounen genre and the bringer of the succeeding age group, “Boku No Hero Academia” or most commonly known as “My Hero Academia”. Written and...illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi this is one show that needs no introduction whatsoever, a show that has seen both its fair share of both haters and lovers, from it being promoted by the makers of Naruto and being called “just a child’s shounen jump” the show has seen it all.Studio Bones as always has done a great job at the adaptation part but as a manga reading I look up to the anime visuals that bring life to characters, and somehow it feels like after every season the show is losing its edge completely.My Hero Academia is a well-made, standard shounen anime that have lived up to the expectations of many.Story ~ 6The world is set up in the future where tech is not far from our own, where many people are just born with strange superpowers and alterations and oddities. The story is as always solid but somewhat gloomy and leaden, unsustainable but pleasant. The series is dense enough to make the viewers binge the whole show in about 2 days. The story in some way has become clichéd. From a fan’s view, this show has become way predictable and even more dreary and boring. As the show has always been, it focuses on the lives of students who train themselves to fend off super-powered corruption as specialized vigilantes and the show has been the same since. Unlike other shows like One Piece, The Promised Neverland (Season 1 and the Manga), Dr. Stone, Black Clover, and Blue Exorcist the premise of the show hasn’t changed much in these upcoming years and staying true to its storyline and unlike One Punch Man, it does not critique the concept of protectors and hero’s because it doesn’t really need to.Animations ~ 8The animations for the show have never let people down whether it be fight scenes or showing emotions they are impressively animated. Studio Bones does a phenomenal job at putting up with such clean and crisp visuals in its fight scenes showcasing itself as a powerhouse when it some to animations and art style from the makers of the studio that gave us the sweet and extraordinary FMAB (Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood), Ouran Host Club, Soul Eater and Mob Psycho 100, I expected nothing less, as they’ve always undergone a superfluous mile in their adaptations. The movements and show boarding of characters are more than impressive as they are drawn so vividly but some scenes show feel a little left behind as well as it gets messier and more intense which is a little painful to the eyes. However, there are other hero’s at the academy that the show visualizes that pick up the pace and the series is not bound to any infinite range of wacky story and pacing.Sound ~ 7The music for “Boku No Hero Academia” has always been uplifting and this season’s opening is no different from the previous ones as it stands out again “No. 1” by DISH. Although I like the ending more “Footprints” by the Peggies is a classic that sticks like a symphony in the mind, nothing short of “The Peggies ” although, I’ll always prefer “The Day” by Porno Graffiti as one of the best openings of the show.Character ~ 7Though the anime slams the nails when it comes to tough character designs out of the gate, the story revolves around the main character Izuku MIdoriya or Deku who’s not born with powers much like Asta’s from “Black Clover”. He is feeble, frail, and timid, who unlike the other characters yearns with every inch of his might to save people with just a grin and smile, like his idol “All Might”. ‘All Might’ who’s your classic anime superman justice campaigner, who is super strong and gifted with uncanny fortitude and is the world’s greatest hero. Instead of fighting with our main protagonist, he chooses him as a successor of his. Deku’s main thing is breaking through his psychosomatic barriers and physical boundaries to win by the skin of his teeth, and the message that the show delivers every time that “children have the power to change, remake and save the world.” Still remains.Overall ~ 6At the end of the day is indeed beautiful, though it has become shallow and predictable. From its first debut in 2016 my Hero Academia has been a huge success all over the world mostly around North America and the western parts of the world. The only thing keeping the show from dying is the sheer ubiquity of how big the franchise has become. A lot of people still love this series and me being one of them but one way or another I just don’t want to keep up with the anime anymore as I did before when the show was at its best in the prior seasons. Taking a look at the bigger picture, I realized how ordinary and unpretentious the show has become, it is undeniably overhyped like many other shows but it has its sincerity as well and it deserves almost most of it. I personally think the show is a huge accomplishment and has achieved so much all across the world but in the recent season I just don’t see it, and I sigh at the foundation of what the show could’ve become and not how much it has accomplished.If you’re looking for big emotional changes and fights and scenes where young boys put all their spirits into fists for the sake of honor and to make their dreams come true of being the best and fighting with their Nakamas, this show is definitely for you. illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi this is one show that needs no introduction whatsoever, a show that has seen both its fair share of both haters and lovers, from it being promoted by the makers of Naruto and being called “just a child’s shounen jump” the show has seen it all.Studio Bones as always has done a great job at the adaptation part but as a manga reading I look up to the anime visuals that bring life to characters, and somehow it feels like after every season the show is losing its edge completely.My Hero Academia is a well-made, standard shounen anime that have lived up to the expectations of many.Story ~ 6The world is set up in the future where tech is not far from our own, where many people are just born with strange superpowers and alterations and oddities. The story is as always solid but somewhat gloomy and leaden, unsustainable but pleasant. The series is dense enough to make the viewers binge the whole show in about 2 days. The story in some way has become clichéd. From a fan’s view, this show has become way predictable and even more dreary and boring.

It\'s showing how all the characters are improving their line of thinking and how they are honing their skills. The writer of...this story is showing you how everyone in this story matters to some degree and is giving most of them a chance to shine.

MHA is showing you how all the characters are improving to be able to help or be a BIG PART of those HIGH STAKES FIGHTS that will come after.SEASON 5 is really good people it is giving everyone\'s character development and showing their ""improvement"".

First half of the season is just a sparring session to remind you that some characters actually exist. In the second hald we are getting some backstories and rushed way of expandance of the ""bad guys"" group.Art: Nothing speacial. Even worse than previous seasons.Sound: It\'s fine.Character: ""Good"" characters are trying to kind of improve and learn new techniques but there is nothing interesting tbh. There is only one mildly interesting improvement from MC.Main ""bad guy"" will become overpowered towards the end of the season without any actual reason....Enjoyment: This anime is getting worse and worse with every season.

The artstyle in the manga is always progressing and is accurate to the things that are happening in the story, it's not longer so cutesy like before. The anime artstyle is still stuck in the mood of season 1, the colors are too bright, everything seem so weird, I can't feel anything when sad or important things are happening, it just seems like a caricature. Or maybe I FEEL smth but then it's cringe. If they animate the now latest chapters in this style I think I might just die of laughter. Please don't. "", ""Class A vs Class IdontcareB should have been skipped. Doesn't do anything to move the plot forward, the entire thing seems like a filler arc. As a Boku no hero fan who only watches the anime I'm very disappointed because this feels pretty much like a wasted season and I'll have to wait a lot for the next one.They have gone through much better training arcs in past seasons, not everything has to be high stakes but going with no stakes for an entire arc is just mind-boggling to me.And as a wise man once said: If you don't like my opinion about this show,...that's fine.

I started watching My Hero when it was about halfway through the second season. I\'ve been following it as much as I could since then; I love it. From what I\'ve read, a lot of people are torn on this season. Some say it\'s boring and bad, and others say it\'s far from the worst arc of the series. I believe that this season does what MHA does best, and that is character development. This arc shows so many characters and how hard they\'ve worked...to become stronger. It may not have that ""bad guy vs good guy"" feel to it like the other seasons (so far) but it doesn\'t mean the action isn\'t great. There\'s so much thought to the strategy of each team and how they work together. Also, towards the later parts of the first half, there\'s some BIG developments for a main character.

And a butchered, overhyped villain arc. That\'s My Hero Academia Season 5 in a nutshell.Previous seasons of My Hero have been decent all things considered; Season 4 being more mixed compared to the others with some disappointing lows, but also having some of the highest highs in the series so far. By comparison, Season 5 is completely unsalvageable.It immediately hits us with 10 episodes of filler that doesn\'t progress the story or develop any of the characters AT ALL. The premise behind Class 1A vs 1B is completely useless; forcing an already oversized...cast of our main 1A students going up against an equally oversized group of 1B nobodies that 99% have never been on screen or had a single line of dialogue beforehand. Not to mention that this arc is probably the worst take on the ""tournament arc"" trope I\'ve seen yet, in a show that already managed to pull it off in season 2. Whether a team wins or lose doesn\'t matter in the slightest, there are literally zero stakes or reason to care about whoever wins. It\'s just a obscenely long sparring match disguised as a showcase for the quirks of B-list characters that no one cares about. None of our main cast change or learn anything throughout these episodes, the only exception being Midoriya whom barely justifies this pointless arc by gaining one new power up. That\'s it. Everyone else has nothing to do throughout this entire filler arc.You can easily skip the entire first half of this season, as you will miss literally nothing.Next up is the Agency Arc. Aka, a blatant advertisement for the third movie that ends way too quickly, and shows characters and plot lines made specifically for a non-canon movie. It\'s only 5 episodes long and has our main characters do nothing for the entire arc. Sound familiar? It introduces some details that will set up actually interesting arcs down the road, but otherwise you can skip this one as well.And finally, My Villain Academia. The arc that was supposedly gonna change the tone of the show into a more serious and dark story. Before it aired, people described it as the ""edgy, dark, and violent"" version of My Hero, and praised it as the saving grace for the season. Shame it fell flat on it\'s mid face. Don\'t get me wrong, at least stuff actually HAPPENS here. But the execution is so poorly paced and weak. It\'s basically a bunch of mini-skirmishes with the villains that we somewhat care about vs. an army of nobodies that were barely built up and the show suddenly acts like we should care about. Sound familiar? x2Also the show spoils the end of the arc at the beginning of the previous arc, so you won\'t have to worry about having ""stakes"" or ""engagement"" in this show since it already tells you the ending before MVA even begins. The ONLY legitimately good episode was a flashback episode, where the show actually makes you feel emotional for our main lead in this arc. Everything else is woefully subpar, with this entire arc boiling down to ""defeat the bad guys = win"", and ""Why not be evil?"" for villains that were already evil and had no issue with their morality for the past 5 seasons. Except this time it\'s ""Why not be MORE evil?!?""*slow claps*Finally, it ends with the promise of another big arc coming, that will ""change everything"". Ah yes. The very same thing that MVA was supposed to be and failed. What a joke of a season.Both openings are terrible as well. The first one has a good song, but completely ignores Class 1B despite them being THE MAIN PREMISE of that arc. And the rest is Class 1A fighting thin air instead of showcasing any semblance of 1B.And the second is half assed to say the least. Not only does the song suck and doesn\'t fit ANY of the arcs with how cringe the lyrics are, but a majority of it focuses on the Agency Arc which ends 3 episodes after the opening starts. And MVA only gets small sprinkles of random powerpoint screenshots + a bare minimum logo change, even though it\'s the majority of the remaining show. As you can see, priority/common sense was thrown out the window for this season.All in all, My Hero Season 5 is a complete waste of your time.Even if you\'re a MHA fan, there is no reason for you to watch this garbage. None of the characters develop or do anything remotely interesting. It\'s 90% filler and 10% badly executed story arcs that had the potential to be amazing. And unlike Season 1-4, there are no highlights in this season. Not even a single sakuga fight scene to at least admire for animation sake, since they moved the entire animation team to work on a movie that no one asked for. The best you\'re gonna get is 5 seconds of 3D buildings. Gee thanks My Hero. It\'s a shame how far this show has fallen considering how much care and attention was given to S1-4. Nowadays we\'re lucky if Bones remembers to change the PNG logo for MVA.Do yourself a favor and skip this entire season.This gets a 1/10(but I\'d honestly give it a 0 if I could) cast of our main 1A students going up against an equally oversized group of 1B nobodies that 99% have never been on screen or had a single line of dialogue beforehand.

I finally feel free after all these years.I never understood the hype of My Hero Academia. I thought the first two seasons were standard, and the third I got a little more interested...in, but by the end of the third season and throughout the fourth season I just found myself not caring much for the show, if I ever had at all. There are too many characters for anyone to get development, Deku goes through the same character arc every season, and by God, I am tired of watch 12 episode long tournament arcs where NOTHING happens. That\'s what finally pushed me to drop this show so early on. The tournament arc that\'s currently happening in Season 5.Can anyone tell me what merit this tournament has or story relevance? I have no idea how it fits into any plotlines or character arcs besides just drawing out another useless and repetitive plot for 12 episodes to show off various superhero powers.I\'ve heard that the story gets better after this tournament, but you know what, I don\'t care anymore. I haven\'t cared about My Hero Academia in a LONG time, if EVER, and I don\'t want to force myself to watch 25 minute episodes where I\'m utterly bored and usually scrolling on my phone, as if watching MHA is some ungodly chore.

As a show that plays its cards incredibly safe and doesn’t try to subvert anything in the shounen genre, it’s pretty clear what MHA hopes to achieve in its lifetime (that’s selling movies if you haven’t realized already). But this season just goes to show that when you aim for mediocrity, you end up with subpar results. Drill that lesson into your hearts kids: aim for the moon so you can land amongst the stars, don’t be like MHA and aim for the stratosphere and end up 2m from where you started.If you have any...hope left for this series, I suggest you abandon it and save yourself from disappointment. This season alone indicated where Bones’ priorities lie with this series as a whole (movies so stonks go up).As with any MHA season, we can’t go without the classic flaws:1. Disgustingly long episode recaps2. Piss-poor pacing/storyboarding3. Unironically lengthy exposition dumps4. Lack of meaningful progress on character development and worldbuildingLet’s see how these flaws manifested this season.The 1st episode is a “why do you exist” episode. Was it necessary to reintroduce every character and their quirks and dynamics? It’s not as if we had sudden amnesia and forgot. Don’t hit me with the “it’s a chance to showcase side characters” too because you and I both know damn well that anyone who isn’t the main cast (Deku, Todoroki, Bakugo, Uraraka) has been completely shoved to the side at this point. And that’s one thing I never liked about MHA, the character development. It tries too hard to sprinkle in development for side characters, but since it’s done so half-heartedly it just feels like cheap filler content instead of a meaningful attempt at doing something. Either do something properly or don’t do it at all.The 1st cour. Class A vs Class B. Good animation for some of the scenes, but it’s wasted on content with poor pacing. The fights are overly drawn out, with each episode opening with a 5-minute flashback to the previous episode (I kid you not, EP 6 literally recycles the same recap from a previous episode). There’s also an issue of worldbuilding here with Class B, but I’m not going to open up that can of worms here. Ultimately, I don’t get how Class A, which has more real-world fighting and interning experience, decides to go easy and get their ass handed when it comes to “being aggressive” (Tokoyami vs Mushroom girl for example). The copious amounts of exposition dumps we got throughout this arc were dumbfounding too. MHA, and most anime in general, could do well to have faith in their viewers having more than 1 brain cell and an attention span greater than that of a goldfish.The 2nd cour. Hero work studies and MVA. Overall, the content here is much more interesting and watchable than 1st cour. Issues still plague the season such as--OH MY GOD OKAY IT’S HAPPENING, EVERYONE STAY CALM! STAY FUCKING CALM! WE’RE HAVING ANOTHER MHA MOVIE!!!! OMG! POGGERS! HERE’S AN ENTIRE “FILLER” EPISODE DEDICATED TO PROMOTING AND TEASING THIS MOVIE FOR Y’ALL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU WANTED. WE TOTALLY DIDN’T SWITCH THE STORY AND PACING UP JUST FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!Anyways, where was I? Oh yes. The same issues from cour 1 resurface here. Pacing, and now more so storyboarding too. Why were MVA and the work-study arc rearranged to the way it was presented in the show? So they could fit in the movie episode. Now we have this disjointed storyline that robs the viewer of any sense of suspense or danger. You teased Shigaraki powering up? That’s cool, but I’ve forgotten about it since nothing related is brought up again for the next 5 episodes. PLF is going to attack in 4 months with 100k plus members? Spooky. But numbers don’t mean shit to me. Giving names is. Telling me PLF has 5-6 elite villains, with quirks doing XYZ, who teamed up with the League of Villains, who also powered up, is infinitely more dramatic and suspenseful than the route we got. Not to mention awkward directing and cutting of relevant material during MVA itself. Shame on the studio.Overall, this season was a shitshow, but for different reasons than S4. The main complaint with S4 was the animation: MHA will always have copious amounts of exposition dumps. But this season, we’ve traded (somewhat) better animation for god-awful pacing and storyboarding. While there were a few bright spots and well-adapted scenes, it’s not enough to make up for a wholly disappointing season overall. It’s also been made pretty clear that all the MHA franchise cares about at this point is pumping out movies to milk the unfortunate die-hard fans of their money. Smoge.I’m not going to spoil future seasons, but all I can say is they do a great job of highlighting MHA’s biggest and most glaring flaw: god-awful worldbuilding and character development. If you’re a manga reader and would like to hear my views, shoot me a message. But all I can offer to anime-only fans is this: if you’re ready for braindead action boom-boom pow scenes, you’re in for a treat. But MHA as you know it will be dead after the next arc thanks to shitty writing. hope left for this series, I suggest you abandon it and save yourself from disappointment.

MHA, and most anime in general, could do well to have faith in their viewers having more than 1 brain cell and an attention span greater than that of a goldfish.The 2nd cour. Hero work studies and MVA. Overall, the content here is much more interesting and watchable than 1st cour. Issues still plague the season such as--OH MY GOD OKAY IT’S HAPPENING, EVERYONE STAY CALM! STAY FUCKING CALM! WE’RE HAVING ANOTHER MHA MOVIE!!!! OMG! POGGERS! HERE’S AN ENTIRE “FILLER” EPISODE DEDICATED TO PROMOTING AND TEASING THIS MOVIE FOR Y’ALL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU WANTED. WE TOTALLY DIDN’T SWITCH THE STORY AND PACING UP JUST FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!Anyways, where was I? Oh yes. The same issues from cour 1 resurface here. Pacing, and now more so storyboarding too. Why were MVA and the work-study arc rearranged to the way it was presented in the show? So they could fit in the movie episode. Now we have this disjointed storyline that robs the viewer of any sense of suspense or danger. You teased Shigaraki powering up? That’s cool, but I’ve forgotten about it since nothing related is brought up again for the next 5 episodes. PLF is going to attack in 4 months with 100k plus members? Spooky. But numbers don’t mean shit to me. Giving names is. Telling me PLF has 5-6 elite villains, with quirks doing XYZ, who teamed up with the League of Villains, who also powered up, is infinitely more dramatic and suspenseful than the route we got. Not to mention awkward directing and cutting of relevant material during MVA itself. Shame on the studio.Overall, this season was a shitshow, but for different reasons than S4. The main complaint with S4 was the animation: MHA will always have copious amounts of exposition dumps. But this season, we’ve traded (somewhat) better animation for god-awful pacing and storyboarding. While there were a few bright spots and well-adapted scenes, it’s not enough to make up for a wholly disappointing season overall. It’s also been made pretty clear that all the MHA franchise cares about at this point is pumping out movies to milk the unfortunate die-hard fans of their money. Smoge.I’m not going to spoil future seasons, but all I can say is they do a great job of highlighting MHA’s biggest and most glaring flaw: god-awful worldbuilding and character development. If you’re a manga reader and would like to hear my views, shoot me a message. But all I can offer to anime-only fans is this: if you’re ready for braindead action boom-boom pow scenes, you’re in for a treat. But MHA as you know it will be dead after the next arc thanks to shitty writing."", ""I am here to give a patient review on the latest season of MHA. In my opinion, verdicts need to be kept until a season's completion, so let this be a 10-episode-in update that lets you know that, dammit, they've done it again. Just as you think the plot is cooling and taking a slower pace on as the anime matures, they hit you with some ridiculously hype episode that puts a whole new layer over this anime. This latest episode was groundbreaking. If anything, watch the first 9 episodes just so that you can enjoy the pure bliss that follows.Sure, we could argue that...they could have fitted the first 9 episodes into half as many episodes as they did. But then I honestly would not have appreciated episode 10 nearly as much. I cannot tell you what the rest of the season is going to hold, but I can tell what it feels like. It feels like MHA season 5 is going to be a contender for the best anime of the year. they could have fitted the first 9 episodes into half as many episodes as they did.

I binged the first 4 seasons before season 5 started so I could enjoy the hype, but I was very disappointed. Other than introducing us to characters we've known for 4 seasons; the season started of strong with the first 2 episodes...then it was all downhill after that. There's still 19 episodes to go so I'm hoping that it gets better because I had high expectations and I've heard a lot of good things about the manga. But to be honest I expect this season to be a 7 at best. "", 'Four season and five years ago, studio Bones brought forth on this world a new anime, My Hero Academia, conceived with good animation, fun fights, and an enjoyable premise. Unfortunately, the intrigue has worn thin with the arrival of MHA season 5.For my reviews, I will dissect my opinion into 5 crucial sections, henceforth known as napkins.Napkin #1Story (2/10)Sadly, the internet has made the story and first third of the season not necessary. The training arc beginning the season and running nearly 10 episodes can best be described by the word pointless. We will see where the season goes from here,...but the goal of over a third of the season can better be achieved by a text card advising viewers to go to the wiki and search the names of the characters and their abilities.Napkin #2Art (5/10)The animation quality is average in terms of battle centered anime but mainly does its job in making fights appear coherent. Although nothing special, it’s as serviceable and acceptable as any piece from Studio Bones is as a minimum. However, it seems Bones was saving budget in the first few episodes for animating the posteriors of Asui and Uraraka.Napkin #3Sound (5/10)Much like the animation, the sound is serviceable and does its part. The opening and endings are acceptable, definitely not my personal taste. Had the opening instead been, just off the top of my head, Kyouran Hey Kids!!, I would have given the sound a 9.Napkin #4The characters (2/10)My biggest issue with the season and show overall is the cast, exasperated by the fact that the initial training arc spends time re-introducing characters in the most bland and unimaginative way possible. There is no need for the narrator to yell the quirks of the cast and remind the viewer of their names, this is the FIFTH season after all. The fact that I need to be reminded of the uncreative quirks and the names of the students is less a testament to the expansive cast and more a point on how bland and forgettable the supporting cast are. Aside from Momo, Jiro, Todoroki, Bakugo, and Deku the Hallmark greeting card, I could not remember or care less about any other character. Shinso presented the most intrigue in his character conflict, but will likely be discarded for the remainder of the season as he is not hot enough for the fandom to ship.Napkin #5Enjoyment (3/10)I did not.ConclusionWith the napkins on the table set, we see another table in the distance, filled with amazing animation, good characters, and a far superior power system. MHA season 5 unfortunately had the honor of following a season led by Jujutsu Kaisen, likely leading to why I failed to enjoy this season to such a degree. Regardless, watch JJK instead.Score: 4/10 Passable but has problems but the goal of over a third of the season can better be achieved by a text card advising viewers to go to the wiki and search the names of the characters and their abilities.Napkin #2Art (5/10)The animation quality is average in terms of battle centered anime but mainly does its job in making fights appear coherent.

I don't expect much from action anime tbh, just some interesting characters and a cohesive story with decent fights is enough to hold me over, but after 5 fucking seasons there has been little to nothing in terms of character growth, story progression or even time progression itself ffs. How the hell are they still in their first year as students after 5 seasons. The first 10 or so episodes are full of pointless fights between Class A and Class B. Most of the characters in Class A barely get looked at but now they have to compete with the even less present Class B for screentime? Not to mention that none of the fights had any actual importance to them, the biggest thing to happen from this arc was the black tentacles coming out of Deku's ass.

I can understand the superpower theme but in the entire series, there was not any explanation about how people gained their horrendous endurance, which allows them to tank hits someone like Endeavor or AllMight and not being burned to crisps or vaporized thanks to inhuman strength. Someone like Deku can use only 20% of his entire power, and if he goes above that, he can literally cirpple himself, so how the f... can anyone else tank hits stronger than that, just with their body. Where is the common sense of that? The world in this anime is quite like ours,...just enhanced with the Quirks, but Quirks do not give any special endurance, only special abilities, or mutations, like tail, enhanced attributes - like strength, or explosions, etc. so why people do not use weapons here? All of them are so squishy, so where is the logic here? The author didn't even try to cover this plot hole. That is why, anyone with even a half-brain would have an unpleasant time watching this trash. just enhanced with the Quirks, but Quirks do not give any special endurance, only special abilities, or mutations, like tail, enhanced attributes - like strength, or explosions, etc. so why people do not use weapons here?

Episode 9 definitely kicked things up a bit but I don\'t know if it\'s enough to redeem the season for it\'s horrible start.Let me start by saying that although I thought the Shie Hassakai Raid was the peak of season 4, the festival and Gentleman\'s fight wasn\'t bad or slow. It was decent.Season 5? First episode literally spends half the screen time describing every single one of Class 1A\'s members and quirks.

They pulled a ""flashback to a specific move that one character trained for that one time in his childhood that we are just now learning and uses it to save the day"" BS.  Just no.... Also, for the sake of squeezing in screen time of other characters during these fights, we go back to the classmates watching the fights on screen multiple times and have them describe what we just saw with our reptilian eyes right back to us while having that stupid ""hurr durr Vlad biased commentary"" sequence five million times an episode. It got old after the first time.Third, and I think this is the most heinous crime, they used their iconic soundtracks on letdown, unimportant episode climaxes to try and hype up the viewers. It felt like a poor attempt to bring excitement to already dull, drawn out fights where half the dialogue, animations, and actions of the characters were unnecessary or let downs.

The first half of the series shows the class vs class battle between Class 1-A and Class 1-B, and predictably, Class 1-A wins. This is by far the most boring arc of the anime. Watching it come out week after week is so boring, with the pacing being way too off. I...have heard that binging the first half makes it watchable, but seriously, this first half if a major snoozefest.

Like come on.The second half of this series does pick up quite a bit. The Endeavor Agency arc was quite a nice bit of entertainment, but it never had the same effect or energy as earlier seasons. Seeing the Todoroki family develop though was a nice touch, and made a character that is loved much more fleshed out. This was the highlight for this arc, and was much needed.Then the final arc arises: My Villain Academia (no seriously, that's what it is called). This arc is what the series should have been for this entire season. High stakes energy. Lots of action. Major story developments, but this time, it's for the villains. It's such a nice bit of fresh air because after 4.5 seasons, you kind of get tired of the same old school heroes. The characters and the plot are quite well executed for this final arc, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It finally felt like this was a real season of Heroaca. Unfortunately it was just an arc, and not a season. But the foreshadowing in the finale is definitely hyping up season 6.This fifth season of My Hero Academia just felt like a major rollercoaster of ups and downs. Although the first half was such a snoozefest, the villain arc definitely did redeem this season from the depth of low scores. And with the peggies and MAN WITH A MISSION performing theme songs within this season, we at least got some excellent tunes to listen to as well.So has My Hero Academia lost its once top-tier status?

Seeing the Todoroki family develop though was a nice touch, and made a character that is loved much more fleshed out. This was the highlight for this arc, and was much needed.Then the final arc arises: My Villain Academia (no seriously, that's what it is called). This arc is what the series should have been for this entire season. High stakes energy. Lots of action. Major story developments, but this time, it's for the villains. It's such a nice bit of fresh air because after 4.5 seasons, you kind of get tired of the same old school heroes. The characters and the plot are quite well executed for this final arc, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It finally felt like this was a real season of Heroaca. Unfortunately it was just an arc, and not a season. But the foreshadowing in the finale is definitely hyping up season 6.This fifth season of My Hero Academia just felt like a major rollercoaster of ups and downs. Although the first half was such a snoozefest, the villain arc definitely did redeem this season from the depth of low scores. And with the peggies and MAN WITH A MISSION performing theme songs within this season, we at least got some excellent tunes to listen to as well.So has My Hero Academia lost its once top-tier status? Yes. But was this season wholly bad? No, but it will never be the same as it once was."", ""I highly anticipated the start of this season, since I am a fan of this series. However as a manga reader, I find my expectations to be met with only disappointment. At first, I gave the season the benefit of doubt but gradually I decided to take a break while I was watching the joint training arc since I find myself to be burned out by how much Bones dragged out the training arc with endless amounts of flashbacks. Recently, I decided to see how the season is faring and I couldn't help but lose respect for Bones.Bones did a great job for the...past seasons and I'm sure we all share this sentiment until this season.(Might contain spoilers)First of all, I have no problems with the joint training arc. I am okay with the content in it since it is one of the last chill arcs of the manga until the final act that is still going on as of today. What I am not ok with is how they would drag the arc down with much padding.Next, why would you switch arcs?? I don't understand the logic behind it. I can't comprehend what gave Bones the notion that doing so might be a good idea. This just causes confusion for those who might only be watching the anime. Because the events of the MVA arc should have been first that's why the experience is tainted with the arc switch that had already happened.And also Bones, in my opinion, should stop making so much movies. I find it to be unnecessary in their part. I feel like it's better for them to be focusing on making the anime have the utmost best quality they could possibly give it. Then they made a filler with the girls that I might not have too much problem with had they not sacrifice cutting so much crucial manga content for the MVA arc.What Bones is doing is disrespectful to the original manga-- to the manga creator. I couldn't help but leave with a sense of disappointment that would never go away. Even if the next season does a fantastic job with the war arc, there would always be a part of me that would wish that this season turned out better.  I love the manga , but it is simply sad to see the state the anime is now. past seasons and I'm sure we all share this sentiment until this season.(Might contain spoilers)First of all, I have no problems with the joint training arc.

A huge portion of this season is dedicated to make us care about the villains, and also show how all bad guys are not a united front. Well, I still don't really care. I do realize that this anime is extremely popular and has to be edible for all ages, but now they are getting downright LAZY. This season was already cursed with the burden of having to build up the impending war, but wow it does a better job opening the...door for many of us to just leave and stop watching. The initial steam this series used to champion has now all but dried out. The fandom has fallen in love with the characters enough for this to probably be animated to conclusion, but this is a low point. door for many of us to just leave and stop watching.

After what melodramatic bullshit that was Season 4, Season 5 serves as a breath of fresh air, to see our Class 1-B pals again after almost two whole seasons of forgetting they exist. I was initially ecstatic because I consider Class 1-B to sometimes be more interesting than A (Class A literally has four relevant main characters to fight villians in ways adults can't do). My main issue with this season is that we still don't really get to see the dynamic that Class B has because half the time, the attention is always...focused on A and their long flashbacks and monologues that just seem to drag out the episode.Shihai is a character that seems to be quite interesting, and it would have been very nice to see him in action, but we have almost zero information on him besides his quirk getting to blend in with Tokoyami. A fight scene involving those too might have been incredibly interesting, but then we see yet another flashback based on Tokoyami with Hawks. My question is that why was this not in the arc where we actually saw the characters work with heroes? We saw filler with Yaoyarozu and Itsuka but none of actual story development with a well written character?This is the biggest problem with MHA in my opinion, making all these amazing characters but only using four regularly. The ones we get to see more of just have a single flashback later way after the arc they should have been in concludes. This causes filler, and lets B to not be able to be in the limelight at least once.Last season was the Shie Hassaiki arc and I still consider that arc to be the worst the series could provide (more on that on my blog in a few weeks). I was genuinely very excited to see more of B, along with seeing more character dynamics that we don't normally see but all we saw was Shinsho get to appear for once in a blue moon, and then quickly forgotten about.The animation, sound and character design have always been good and they are genuinely my favorite parts of the franchise, but the story is genuinely lacking.I regret to say this but I am officially dropping My Hero Academia until Season 6 starts, the manga is much more entertaining than this bullshit of an arc right now.I beg that we get an arc in the future that just drops all the crappy melodrama arcs and gives us a nice story based on character dynamics between the two classics, AKA the Forest Camp Training arc.I hope you enjoyed this review as much as I genuinely enjoyed writing it, until next time... focused on A and their long flashbacks and monologues that just seem to drag out the episode.Shihai is a character that seems to be quite interesting, and it would have been very nice to see him in action, but we have almost zero information on him besides his quirk getting to blend in with Tokoyami.

I'll start with my biggest issue, which is the artwork.The anime has had two previous incredible seasons, and I mean incredible. The art in the fourth season especially in the fight with Overhaul has been perhaps the peak until right now, and any manga fan knows Deku v Kacchan 2 has been incredibly animated, doing justice to Horikoshi's artwork in...the manga. Unfortunately, this season fails to deliver; This is exactly where I feel it failed to deliver the most as the art is lacking, the characters look off, and there are moments when you really wonder whether the artists have read the manga previously. I know anime and manga will never be the exact same, but it is upsetting to see the beautiful artwork of the manga transform into something that often feels like it's unfinished or not checked more than twice. I am well aware the season was under time restraints with COVID, but I would have much rather they focused more on making the scenes beautiful and accurate to Horikoshi's artwork than fluid if necessary.The next part of the review will have spoilers, so please proceed with caution!!The story is good, the first half feels a bit stretched out and certain moments have been taken out but it isn't to the point where it is quite literally upsetting. There were some foreshadowing-like moments that have been removed and scenes that were changed, but the biggest issue I had with the inclusion of an anime-only Izuocha scene after Deku manifests blackwhip and removing what I felt was telling of Izuku's actual fear of manifesting blackwhip. While I did feel the scene was nice, I do wish they would've more focused on the foreshadowing of Izuku being terrified with himself.The characters are fine, although it is quite obvious Bones has favourites. Bakugou is unfortunately not one of them, which is quite unfortunate as he is building up to be a big part of the story. Regardless, I am willing to overlook this as it is possible they simply didn't focus on the first half of the season as much as the second given it was a more relaxed arc, however, I do wish the same kind of attention was paid to everyone in the anime.The enjoyment is fine. It isn't the best season. It's probably one I'll skip if I ever rewatch it, or not watch entirely. It's not bad by any means, but it is also not up to par with what we've already seen.Overall, I give this season a 7/10. It isn't a bad anime and it's far from being a bad season by overall anime standards; However, by the standards Bones has already set for us with Season 3 and Season 4 in particular, and by the standards of the manga, I do have to say it falls quite flat.

To me, it was clear that they're showing more of the character's development, and including other characters with quirks as unique as the mcs quirks. The first arc wasn't boring - it managed to re-introduce a lot of people that I honestly thought were useless in their utility in battle.For a lot of people, though, this was a let down. I don't think it was - the fights were cool, the animation is better than the one in fourth season, and the arc felt way less filler-y than...the ones in the other seasons. Honestly, I believe this first arc is important because it not only introduced Shinso in the hero course, but it also showed a little bit more of the One for All quirk/story, which seems to be one of the season's main points. the ones in the other seasons.

The first half involves a reprieve in the form of Class A and Class B competing against teams of each other. The second half moves the plot forward once again — the class is split up into hero internships again and there’s a return to the League of Villains. To put it bluntly, the first half is an absolutely miserable experience before the second half steers the show back on-course.People might inherently not like the training/friendly competition parts of shonen anime, but I do. For a show like Hero Academia, I’m mostly here for the...characters interacting and seeing how many scenarios their quirks can work in. But this season does it so poorly. The most obvious annoyance is the constant recapping. Hero Academia is no stranger to copious recapping and flashbacks, but this this time it’s actually ridiculous. While not true all the time, flashbacks in previous seasons would accompany dialogue and bolster it. In the first half of Season 5, I swear that half of the runtime felt like flashbacks. It’s impossible to ignore how much time is wasted on them for no reason. Hell, a lot of them flashback to a moment that happened 5 minutes beforehand.Then a quarter of the first half was characters explaining what was happening on the screen and subsequently overpraising other characters. It’s the cardinal sin of showing and not telling, but how it was done here felt especially condescending. It’s the most childish Hero Academia has ever felt.The rest of the first half is actual fighting. The problem is that Class A doesn’t do much interesting with their quirks/interactions and Class B’s quirks are generally too weird to get invested in. Midoriya’s big One For All upgrade — which I’m not sure if I like yet — and Bakugo’s behavior felt like the only things worth seeing. It feels weird to say this, but I think I might recommend reading episode synopses for the first half. That way you know what Class B’s quirks are and what the generally happened. Anything that isn’t in a synopsis is either an annoying flashback you don’t need or a joke that falls flat.As an aside, Hotoshi Shinso (the Brainwasher) also comes back for some spotlight. This gave me some hope that his quirk would be explored more, but he’s pretty irrelevant.The second half of the Season is your standard fare of Hero Academia. It still has a lot of unnecessary flashbacks, but they’re less distracting. If you made it this far into the series, I imagine you’ll enjoy this half since it starts building up the next arc in the plot. Endeavor gets the spotlight…which sounds worrying but I don’t think it’s handled too badly. Then the League of Villains take over the show as we get several episode to see what they’ve been up to. The League of Villains has only been mildly interesting for me thus far, but I think this season finale started making me care about a good handful of them. This new information on them and their pasts would’ve been nice to have earlier so I could’ve started caring about them sooner, but I don’t think it’s TOO late. The resolution felt forced though.Overall, the first half wasn’t even worth watching at best and downright shook my faith in the series at worst. It’s a shame because it was really Class B’s time to shine when they needed it, but it let them down hard in my eyes. The second half proved that it was a temporary plunge, but it wasn’t enough to offset the bad taste in my mouth.

So what does Bones decide to do? Pad out more than half the season with the chaff, and leave little to no time (NOT EVEN AMPLE TIME) for the Villain arc.Plot wise, nothing was changed from the manga, and if anything they made the joint training arc a little more dynamic and fun. BUT WHY? An arguably...meaningless arc that exists only to display and show off the powers of characters that could've been explored much deeper and efficiently ALL THE WAY BACK in the tournament arc! Was the animation good? Yeah sure I guess. Did they explore Deku's connection to OFA more? Definitely and that's all good and fine, but 12 episodes of just straight up meaningless fights!? Come on Bones.But the inclusion of this arc would've been fine, if it wasn't at the expense of the Villain arc.ONE OF THE MOST if not THE MOST beloved arcs in the entirety of MHA for the way it shakes up the formula, and truly shows how the League Of Villains have grown from being complete losers to an actual threat, is SHAFTED to say the least. Not only is the preamble for the main body of the arc long and arduous in anime form (at least it felt that way), the animation for some of the most pivotal scenes is the animation equivalent of AFO's wrinkly-ass, preserved plum face. One of my favourite scenes from the manga is where Shigaraki tears through a crowd of civilians with his newly strengthened decay ability, so imagine my shock when that scene became down graded into a literal before and after shot in the anime, I mean the MANGA HAD MORE FRAMES! And before you say, it was out of their skillset or budget, there is test footage from other scenes in the arc that didn't make it in, that look 10x smoother than the final product, and from the movies we've seen them produce for the series, we KNOW for certain it isn't a skill issue. AND if it was a budget issue, WHY NOT DIVERT THE FUNDING FROM THE LESS VISUALLY DEMANDING ARC THAT CAME BEFORE!? Idk i'm not part of the industry and i won't claim to be or know what I'm talking about, but still, it just seems odd that such a widely beloved arc didn't get the love it needed.Conclusion, the visuals in this season are great, but just at the wrong moments.

But, it\'s basically become a one trick pony. Constantly putting the students up against each other in tournaments and low-stake threats.This season only had two highlights in the entire show. 1. Was Tomura Shigaraki\'s origin story. It was surprisingly gory and intense for what has become a pretty weak...children\'s cartoon. 2. Was Endeavor\'s family drama.

This is doubled in...how bad this is because we have to spend time with the most worthless nobodies of Class B, giving them equal screen time and consideration as we do the characters in Class A that are equally nobodies, despite entire seasons of screen time.It was...fine when it was the sports festival, namely due to some gorgeous animation in a handful of scenes. There\'s poor animation in this season, with all but one or two moments being reduced to characters floating in the air or standing still and thinking at each other.We\'re nearly a hundred episodes into a show, and we\'re spending an entire arc on the kids showing off moves we\'ll never see again when we could\'ve had this wrapped up in 3 or 4 episodes tops.

In fact, the main downside of season 5: the timing. It\'s just short and that\'s its main minus. It was noticeable that the screenwriter was trying to maximize the exposure of the villain characters, while still managing to colorfully tell everyone\'s story. I think the writers did a very good job of fitting all these stories into 25 episodes.Overall, I\'m grateful that the villain characters were...basically revealed and given backstories. You can only dream of that in a lot of shows.On a separate note: the episode about the Shigaraki family is delightful. When the episode ended I just went silent for a while, because it made a big impression on me.I think the show doesn\'t get worse with each season. Each season ""holds the bar"" high. As I\'ve said before, the only thing that could have made season 5 better is if it was 10 episodes longer.Otherwise, I don\'t regret watching it for a second.I\'m looking forward to season 6. basically revealed and given backstories.

Possibly it is just because my friend hyped it up to be a good anime that I was disappointed with it as a show but after it all I felt was...regret. I will admit there is one time that I did enjoy the show though and that is when the Intro is playing plus the soundtrack so if you just close your eyes maybe it will be a good anime.

I had such hype and high hope for it after an excellent season 4, but my hope quickly plumetted.Plot moving at a snail's pace, soo much time with nothing really happening, beside a build up to a grand battle that really fealt like a chore to watch. And sooo many new characters in this season, both from hero and villain side. I cant even keep track of all of them anymore. Its become such a clusterfuck of seconady characters. What is the point of so many, I dont understand.The only good parts of this season...is Deku's new power-up and some villain backstories, but unfortunetly Shigaraki's backstory and whole point of being a villain did me in. Badly written villains can completely ruin an anime for me, and I always kind of knew he was a badly written character right from the start of the anime. This season finally made me hate him as a character, whereas before I could just tolerate him somewhat.The whole backstory of 'my dad hated heroes, and tried to kill me after I killed my own familly, and then no hero helped my poor ass, so now I'm gonna hate heroes' is the weakest s**it I've ever seen. And this season is somehow casting him in light that makes him 'feel free to be a horrible person because he's somehow justified to be one'. What a pathethic excuse of a villain with no real reason to be bad, aside from ' muh feelings were hurt '. In that case, Todoroki should be a super villain, or even the main villain in the story, because he actually has a reason to be one. When you put them side by side with their familly issues, Shigaraki looks even more pathetic. And All for One's return and most likely betrayal on his 'beloved pupul' is so obvious I cant really even be hyped about it. I wouldve cared more if the ' main Villain' was better written, but he is an utter disapointment.I couldnt even finish watching this season because it was so bad. I might try watching the rest and the next season, but I dont really expect anything from this anime anymore.Giving some points for the animation, because animating this clusterfuk of characters mustve been hell, but overall I do not recommend this season at all. is Deku's new power-up and some villain backstories, but unfortunetly Shigaraki's backstory and whole point of being a villain did me in.

I really do. But Studio Bones has shattered my dreams of a good adaptation of the manga. The animation quality has been downgraded so bad, I was so hyped about MVA.

And this doesn't feel like one.I won't even talk about the dreadful pacing of the first few arcs, and the filler beach episode that was filled in to promote the movie. Oh, and they skipped Re-Destro amazing, spine-chilling introduction chapter of the manga, and straight up went to...the MVA war.

But no, fuck you Bones for not doing justice to one of the greatest arcs of the manga series."", ""Everyone can see the large elephant in the room here, this season felt stagnant and was a transition season for S6 in which this season was meant to build up the hype. There was controversy with arc rearrangement where essentially the Meta Liberation Army and Joint Training Arc were swapped around. However there were major high points in the season too, Shigaraki's Orgin being the peak. The Re-Destro storyline was cut off in this adaptation where the introduction in the manga was much smoother. Despite some short comings and feelings of stagnation this season does do one thing incredibly, make me excited for the future...war between heroes and villains. I haven't felt hyped for a new season of My Hero Academia since season 3 with the battle between All Might and All For One! With the reorder of the arcs I believe it was a smart decision by Studio Bones.The Joint Training arc was a complete waste of time; Bones really didn't lead with their best foot forward, it was soul numbing. There were some saving graces that made it have plot importance though, the first being Midoriya gaining further insight on the vestiges of previous One For All users. In the final fight of the arc Midoriya goes berserk, he becomes unable to control this new power that he learns via brainwashing by Shinsou is called Black Whip. Once Midoriya learns to control Black Whip for longer periods of time it'll be invaluable and the first step of many to inhabiting all of the previous One For All quirks. This is a super cool way to have Midoriya becoming stronger and allow for more variation in fight possibilities too. I'm excited to see how fast he'll learn them and what types they will be!The other thought-provoking character progression of this arc was Hitoshi Shinsou. With his seemingly one dimensional quick Brainwashing one would think after learning its weakness it's easy to avoid. However with the resolve of Shinsou wanting to become a hero, he progresses with a voice modification mask. How could one not root for Shinsou's story, I'd love to see him in 1-A.Nevertheless the negatives heavily outweigh any small gleams of positives. The pace is demonstrably immobile, slow as molasses. The Joint Training Arc could have been summarized into a few episodes, meaning time could have been spent on more important storylines. The fights were pointless ways of presenting how both 1-A and 1-B's powers have evolved while dragging them out to bizarre amounts of detail. Like I stated before, Bones stumbled hard face-first into a stagnant start of a season.The Endeavor Agency Arc is the awkward middle story in which Endeavor's character progression heats up! In terms of characters in My Hero Academia, Endeavor ranks top 3 for how well they advance as heroes/villains. Shigaraki ranks #1 in terms of evolution, however that's for later in the review. The Todoroki family is in shambles after Endeavor's feverish descent into attempting to surpass All Might at the expense of his family. Endeavor wants to be better and wants to be there for his family, I love the concept, it's eye-opening seeing a dysfunctional family mend their problems despite how difficult it is. The easy path for Endeavor would have been to avoid his family but he shows in this arc the only way to progress is not turning a cold shoulder. Natsuo, the second son in the family doesn't believe in Endeavor's atonement arc as a result he gets turned into a hostage by the villain Ending. Ending is obsessed with Endeavor's arrogant and ruthless image, he constantly pursues the latter hoping he'll be killed by Endeavor. Ending does anything and everything like having complete disregard of human life simply to attract his anger. However in the fight, Endeavor breaks down at the sight of Natsuo, this presents how he's changed as a man, no longer is he entirely merciless. This shatters Ending's image of Endeavor and ultimately allows the hero study group to figuratively surpass Endeavor and save Natsuo. It's a great example of showing without telling and paints a great picture into the deeper psychological implications of Endeavor. I'm excited where the Todoroki family storyline will maneuver into!The Meta Liberation Army Arc is the Joint Training Arc on steroids while having a story that's actually compelling! Everything boils down to Shigaraki Tomura's Origin. Just like with Shouto or Midoriya's origin it's the peak of the season. I adore the way it's portrayed, the build up the slaughter of his family where he gains his main motive as a villain in more ways than one. First meets with All For One, the first human to empathize for Shigaraki, using his families eradication as a means of stimulating Shigaraki's newfound hatred for heroes and began grooming him as his adoptive son. It's exhilarating putting the pieces together as his second motive for being a villain is put into full force. Shigaraki feels most at ease when he's able to use his quirk without holding back, to be liberated with the power of destroying everything he touches. To become the true Symbol of Fear and to join forces with the Meta Liberation Army. I love how it powers up Shigaraki in such a badass way while also connecting it back to the morals of true liberation.Another strength of The Meta Liberation Army Arc was the growth of other League of Villains characters like Toga and Twice. It's great how relatable these characters become from absolute dire situations that in turn makes instantaneous evolution. As an anime only viewer it's self-evident where Dabi's storyline is going with Endeavor, they even teased earlier on. Seriously that'll make the Todoroki family even more complex, I'm really excited for it. I find it comical how much I'm rooting for the villains in My Hero Academia, their transformation made that really apparent to me. With the League of Villains merging with The Meta Liberation Army, the Paranormal Liberation Front is profusely powerful! Throughout the series, Shigaraki has been lacking in the amount of support, he needed influence with numbers. The Paranormal War will have the heroes at a clear disadvantage and I'm all for it! The stakes have never been this high in My Hero Academia.The Arc rearrangement has allowed S6 to properly build up to The Paranormal War Arc. This feels like endgame material, deaths are on the table, though it's hard to tell if My Hero Academia has the gall to commit. There's potential for something surpass season 3's All Might vs All For One fight! Nonetheless, that doesn't stop this season from being mediocre because of the beginning. As a complete package this season was a mixed-bag. Instead of spending a whole core of a season on The Joint Training Arc it could have been condensed into a few episodes. This would have made the pace not be so sluggish and allow other storylines that people care about an opportunity to shine. Nobody wants a glorified montage to present what we already know about. But it showed off the progression of the classes quirks! Sure, but that's not worth an entire arc. Anyhow, both heroes and villains have improved and each side has played their chess pieces.

Now that I\'m following the show as it releases (and because the pacing is very slow), it\'s getting a bit distracting. Better time could be spent on the characters these episodes are already spending too much time on. There are already a significant number of other things slowing...the show down, like flashbacks and almost every character reacting to almost everything that happens. The payoff for a lot of it is either too small or nonexistent. The closest we\'ve gotten so far is the latest episode, though match 3\'s ending was also anticlimactic. I kinda feel like saying what bothered me specifically, so some spoilers are ahead.Match 3 has Todoroki fight the metal dude which seems like the worst matchup ever (but whatever, some weird BS about the dude sitting in an oven to train himself was given), and Iida shows off his speed and yet, somehow after running away for 10-20 seconds, the weird melty dude does a monologue and then with the help of the metal dude pushes over a tower that collapses on Iida. Several things here: first, Iida somehow hadn\'t cleared the distance from the tower yet which doesn\'t make sense; second, the two class B members wouldn\'t have known which way Iida had run off to or even if Iida would\'ve simply kept going in a straight line, thus would\'ve been merely hoping and guessing when knocking the tower over; third, Iida didn\'t turn to run out of the way of the tower when he noticed it falling; and fourth, the melty dude was planning on the tower collapsing on Iida so that when he passed out it would re-harden to its natural state, yet WHAT IF HE PASSED OUT BEFORE THE TOWER COLLAPSED? That\'s also weird how a lot of these matches has the kids engaging in some seriously lethal fights, like Todoroki possibly melting the steel dude with his heat, or when a huge metal tube literally fell on Todoroki\'s head/neck. That aside, the match ends with the weird cow-horn girl flying away with the people who passed out and simply waited for the time to run out which was just... lame. Especially lame after the promise of some good fighting, which this episode had none of. Sure, the visuals of Iida running for what, 5 seconds, was cool, but that\'s it. This was just the latest lame thing out of the matches, as previous fights also had anticlimactic finishes.That was a bit of a rant, but I\'m just hoping this format of 2 episodes per match changing, or at least there being some better fights to make the pacing worthwhile.EDIT: Finished the season, and it was fine. Not entirely exciting, nor entirely a disappointment. The best bit was Tomura\'s past and ""origin,"" though that was pretty brief. Other than that, nothing stood out.

Overall, it was okay.', 'I watched 4 seasons of mha when i was very new in anime world. But after watching most of the shounens I m really yawning at the moment.I hope it gets better cuz as mha fan I m really not enjoying it. I know I should not jump on conclusions this soon cuz there’s more to come. I would suggest to binge it rather than watching it weekly. Mha is more fun when u binge it honestly.Story is fine. I would really suggest you to read manga if u haven’t already.Fights, quirks still fabulous. MHA animation never lets you down. Emotions displayed well...as usual.I liked the music too.Overall my rating is 7 because I m not a hard scorer but I’ll definitely change it in future if show stands up my expectationsLets see how well it goes. as usual.I liked the music too.Overall my rating is 7 because I m not a hard scorer but I’ll definitely change it in future if show stands up my expectationsLets see how well it goes.', 'finally completed its first half, which adapted the Joint Training Arc from the manga. While the arc wasn’t nearly as satisfying as most of the storylines the anime has done so far, it had some good standout moments. And Bones’ astounding work with the animation this season combined with Yuki Hayashi’s moving soundtrack indeed elevated the source material that could have been duller than people made it out to be.My Hero Academia Season 5 started with a decent recap anime original episode which has been a tradition since the sophomore season and then went into the canon story with a shocking second episode featuring an...exciting reunion between the Todoroki family.

Personally, this was one of my favourite seasons. I purposefully waited until at least 20 episodes or more were out before I started and also went through the effort of rewatching Season 1-4.After rewatching them, I had a clearer picture of which seasons I liked and why and just overall had a total refresh of everything that happened.And that is why watching Season 5 through and through and very quickly helped me make a very easy decision. Easy 9/10 for me. The 2 seasons prior to this were also,...imo, extremely good and this one rivalled it. In my experience, MHA is just getting better and better as the story develops.Now in the previous ones, it was the action that made it a 9 for me. Personally, I doubt MHA will ever have a 10/10 season for me just because of the way the story is. I\'m aware that giving a brief summary of what MHA is about immediately gives off the impression that it\'s childish. Superheroes, villains, powers etc. I love anything with powers so I can admit that. But as enjoyable as it is, it\'s probably never going to be on the same level as something like Vinland Saga or Jujutsu Kaisen (just off the top of my head). It 100% has its deep moments and the fight scenes are really good but at best, it will be a 9/10.So although 9 is the highest I\'d give MHA, Season 5 really is in a category of its own for me. I\'ve seen complaints about most of the season being Class A vs Class B and I\'m ngl, yeah, some parts of it were honestly a drag. Characters I was hardly interested in had a whole episode to themselves and I had to force myself to push through those.But what absolutely made the season for me was the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I couldn\'t have imagined what was going to happen in this season and that\'s a huge plus. I think we started seeing it when it was Bakugo\'s turn to fight with his team and it just got even better from there. Todoroki has more air time, both with his family and with Deku and Bakugo, so relationships and friendships were also fleshed out a little more. Then all three of them get their own development individually, each significant in their own way.But the villain arc oh my God, it was easily my FAVOURITE arc of the entire season and maybe even show. Maybe I\'m just high off the feeling of having completed S5 but I\'m so glad I waited before bingeing the last 5 or so episodes.I\'m huge on villains that have a great back story, or even an interesting one. And that\'s something MHA excels in. When you can understand a villain\'s actions or even want them to win, that\'s when you know a show is doing a really good job. The writers especially. Before this season I did like Dabi (come on, who wouldn\'t?), Twice was funny, Toga was cute and I also liked the unconventional friendship they all had. But this season goes further and does exactly what I said at the beginning of this paragraph.Villain. Backstories. And I thought it couldn\'t get better. I was perfectly happy not having that much empathy for the villains, but the last I think, 5 or 6 episodes hit the spot. Whenever the story isn\'t focused on Deku or Todoroki or Bakugo (clearly my favourites), I kinda blank out and am just waiting for them to have screen time but THIS time, I was watching it straight without a thought of the heroes. I loved the villain arc. They fleshed out Tomura SO well, gave Toga a backstory, Twice a ""realisation"" of some sorts, getting over his trauma, and moved the story further. Tomura might just be one of my favourite characters.Not to mention I was kind of on edge the entire time, not knowing where Hawks stood. I liked that the season wasn\'t told in a linear fashion. Although the focus was on Class A and Class B in the beginning, there were hints of foreshadowing. I was confused at first but everything started to fall together and I really had no idea how everything came to be.And lastly, just because I feel like this has to be addressed, yes it kind of sounds ridiculous that they\'re only just now finishing first year 5 seasons and 113 episodes in. But looking at the bigger picture of things, it\'s unsurprising that a whole year has amounted to that. When you think about how events would span over 2 or so episodes, different character focus, character and relationship development, plot development, flashbacks, training scenes etc. it\'s kind of realistic. The entire year of Class 1-A has been extremely hectic not to mention the behind the scenes of the villain arc.I personally like that it has gone in depth. I would never attach the words ""slow-burn"" to this show, but it might come off as such when you think about 1 year = 5 seasons. It isn\'t a slow-burn. It is perfectly balanced and sometimes even fast-paced, which I love for an action anime.TLDR: Season 5 is ace, highly recommend. I enjoyed it A LOT, there is loads of character and relationship development, the villain arc is EASILY one of the best arcs I\'ve seen so far in MHA and Bakugo has character development.

Because, for the most part, this was a much-dreaded filler season, plain and simple. That, and even the good parts rarely measured up to their full potential.I\'ve never been one to jump on the MHA Hate Train. Personally, I\'ve felt that any problems that the show has had is because it\'s a Shonen, whether it be a grating stereotype personality or having far too many inspirational internal monologues. But for the most part, it was good,...featuring some fantastically buttery animation and steady character growth that made us root for the heroes and sympathize with the villains.But it has now become apparent that not only has the author of the manga hit a Writer\'s Wall, but even the critically acclaimed animation studio Bones are only concerned with cranking out as standard of a product as possible--and they don\'t even measure up to THAT middle ground half the time, resulting in a few agonizing animation errors here and there and cheap still-frame ""slo-mo"" moments in fights that make it evident how much the budget was cut so the third non-canon movie could look as good as possible.New characters are introduced and tossed aside to be totally forgotten about, whether they be all of Class 1-B (who were probably just made to sell more figurines) in the horrible first training arc which at least had the decency to develop three characters the smallest fraction possible over the entire 13-episode saga; or a particularly well-designed and saucy villain who ultimately gets virtually no screen time and turned to blue-red tomato paste by the yandere who I can\'t figure out why the fandom loves so much, Toga (another mark against her, but as long as she is alive, at least Twice is sane).And I have heard of the controversy around the second half of the season. It starts off strong with a growing mystery which switches to following the League of Villains as they prove themselves to All-for-One that they are his worthy successors. The biggest problem is the pacing--WHICH IS HORRENDOUS!!!! I\'ve read that the original My Villain Academia arc in the manga is far slower paced to properly flesh out the villains and their tentative friendship, but the episode which introduces this gigantic arc can\'t seem to wait to be finished, with dialogue almost literally piled up on top of another line. And of course many of those new villains who would have been excellent additions to the cast are totally wasted, whether it be the aforementioned Blue Journalist Waifu or the others who ultimately are veritable jokes as they\'re basically XP Boosters for the League of Villains to ""level up"" (the actual term used) because of psychological trauma causing them to panic-develop.You\'ll notice I hardly mentioned any of the heroes in this review, because they\'re almost non-existent. Bakugou had been relegated to Tsundere Brofriend and Ochako is Deku\'s ""cheerleader"" crush. The only hero I found compelling this season was Todoroki, who is finally starting to get over his hatred for his dad Endeavor as the man comes to the realization of how his desire to be the best ruined his family.There is very little good to say about this season.

Remembering all the lines i still from time to time rewatch some specific scenes.There were few down moments, especially one creative decision in 4th season...is something i really dislike, but overalll this show was amazing ride until this season.Saying it was a downgrade is understatement. First part already felt a bit like an downgreat compared to previous season but it alone thank to one character coming back and their interaction would still would be great, but then we got to second part of the season which gave me PTSD attack affter second season of different, very infamous, anime that came back few years ago.To describe it without spoiling too much, anime about Deku journey about how he became hero, following how from zero, he slowly trains to become someone who aspires to be, after many seasons of that, we have an arc of 'bad guys' coming back to fight with other (new randomly showed up whole army of) bad guys in pool of plot holes to just the main bad guys become super strong because reasons IN SPAN OF FEW EPISODES and of course whole army just joined the main group. Too bad all heroes were called up outside city and noone though it's weird or you know.... asked for at least support to not to leave city alone.... i guess i'm complicating stuff for no reasonFinally finished the whole season up until last episode after 2 years just to get with other seasons as my friend was really pushing the idea that next season(s) are better. I do hope and perhaps i will still experience some of those stunning moments but the hype for this show is gone and i really don't think it's coming back no matter what they will do is something i really dislike, but overalll this show was amazing ride until this season.Saying it was a downgrade is understatement.

The best character this season was Endeavor, an interesting take on the trashy dad trope.Just. Everything else, I don't remember how many episodes it was but can you please stop with the low stakes fights between characters I don't care about.

The first 10 episodes were amazing, the six that followed were fun and then everything died for me until the season finale.Visuals:absolutely stunning but did notice how inconsistent the animation isSound:1) not a fan of the OP or ED2) the seiyuus performed really well, bringing life to the show as usual3) Hiroaki Hirata\'s voice doesn\'t fit Re-Destro at all. Hirata is one of the greatest seiyuus of all time but this character needed someone else to be his voice. Bad casting choice....Story and characters:1) this season begins with a re-introduction of every character and their quirks. It\'s the 5th season, there\'s no good reason for this. It\'d be much better if instead of this re-introduction, a short recap/summary of last season was shown.2) Bakugou still steals the show with his constant rage and maniac screams. I love him!3) There\'s this plot thing that happens but what would be an amazing plot twist is immediately lost because everything is revealed from the beginning to the viewer. It\'d be soooooo much better to trick the viewer into thinking a character is actually bad and then BAM! PLOTWIST! The character is a double agent!4) loved the Tokoyami character development. One of the reasons why I love this show so much is because every single character, regardless of big or small their role is, gets the spotlight every once in a while and it matters.5) Too many Todoroki\'s family flashbacks hurt the 2nd half of the season6) I hated the villain arc. I could be in the minority here but I just didn\'t enjoy a second of it.7) There\'s a character whose quirk is... stress. STRESS! The more stressed he is, the stronger is gets and so he goes pale skin Hulk and... absolutely awful. Boku no Hero Academia\'s universe is so diverse and full of creativity and they couldn\'t come up with something better than a ""here\'s skinny dude that becomes a giant bodybuilder with stress"".All things considered, it\'s a 7/10 for me.

The path that the flame hero, Endeavor, is on hasn’t really clicked for me yet, and there were some pacing issues with that arc, but everything surrounding the main character, Midoriya, and his classmates has been as strong and enjoyable as usual. Plus, the direction S5 took the League of Villains in is almost great enough to completely outweigh my complaints....I’m stunned with how well MHA has built up Tomura Shigaraki’s potential as an antagonist worthy of his successor by finally, finally revealing his past, which is a horrifyingly dark reflection of Deku’s origins, and I can’t wait for the next encounter between the two protégés. Also worth noting is the action. S5 so far may not have had any big, truly earth-shattering moments like S4’s Overhaul fight, but that doesn’t mean it’s slouching in the slugfest department; there’s still plenty to enjoy as each set piece feels diverse and interesting, and the show balances it all with that impactful, heartfelt drama fans have come to expect from MHA thus far.

Like 3 mock team battles occured. And those even weren't that interesting. Comparing to previous seasons this just has almost to no substance.I have no idea what kind of half-assed approach the studio is taking...with this show.

The animation is definitely less impressive than it was in earlier seasons. The series may have peaked after All Might\'s final fight which is worrisome because that was in season 3. I thought Season 4 was bad, and this was enough for me to lose interest in the show. I may finish it when it concludes fully, but I do not like the direction they are moving in.The first arc in season 5 with the 2 classes competing was not as bad as I thought it would be,...but honestly they could have cut out 2 or 3 episodes from it. The show has always had a problem with pedestrian characters overanalyzing what is going on, and this was rampant here. Also Bakugo is still terrible even during his good moments. The series has completely failed to evolve him as a character. He still just is a overly angry child that yells about everything, and this should have been mellowed out already after his big character moment at the end of season 3. Mineta is definitely a bigger detriment to the show though.Now the biggest problem that most people will have is them doing the story out of order. This was apparently done to promote the movie, but they did a poor job because the episode that was supposed to do that doesn\'t tie in at all outside of a last minute cameo. A fine filler episode, but not a reason to completely mess up the order of events that occur. We know the conclusion of the My villain academia arc because the League of villains are shown with the Liberation army in a scene with Hawks. Just a dumb job by the show director to have that. The Endeavor training stuff was fine but kind of forgettable.The My Villain Academia arc honestly killed my interest in continuing the show at all. It confirms what I was scared would happen with this show. Shigiraki is just another boring, ""edgy"", goalless, chaotically evil, motivation lacking anime villain. The show even addresses that he really has no plan for what to do after they win whatever they are trying to win. This is one of the worst character tropes we see abundantly used in anime. For some reason Japan loves their cringey edgelord bad guys, but they are just so dull, and overused in anime. His backstory is just Eri\'s backstory, but with added drama about his dad. I don\'t feel bad for him I just feel bad that this was all the writer could come up with. They could shift the focus back to all for one at the end, but I would be surprised if they did that. Clearly they are setting him up to remove himself from the equation, and have Shigiraki continue on as his successor. Poorly written bad guys plague the majority of anime(especially shonen series), and I really did not want to see it again here. Toga is also confirmed to be bat shit crazy because of the nature of her quirk. She is popular though with the fans because of her look, and the people who like yandere types will like her. She sucks though, and Twice is the only member of the League of Villains who is actually interesting. They seem to have had him revert to his split personality self after the fight though which is disappointing because him moving past his trauma was one of the only good moments of that arc.MHA did not need to try to delve into darker themes, and the writer has done a poor job of it.

Not only that, but who spends almost half a season over the same fight and thinks viewers will enjoy that? Not me. It's even worse when most of the characters are glimpsed over besides a specific few. It does move on and gets Slightly better only to re-enter the...repetitive circle of same old again.

That's it.Sound (5/10): Also average, nothing special. I don't like the OP though, feels weird to listen to and is often skipped over.Character (4/10): Basically shows the same handful of characters and has them grow, sorta. After the first half of the season you can say goodbye to over half the cast basically, they rarely show up again if they do at all. Deku's the same. Bakugo's the same. Todoroki's the same.

The pacing was all over the place, for starters: the first arc dragged on endlessly, then they blew through the Todoroki family arc, then we got one (1) backstory episode/character development moment for Aizawa and Hizashi, and then we got to what must be the most interesting part, the MVA arc, only for it to suck as well.Personally, the tone shifts threw me off. I think that the A vs B arc could've been cut in half (in the manga, this part is...only a couple of chapters long) and they couldn't taken their time fleshing out the Keeping up with the Todorokis arc, as well as really driven through the emotional aspect of Shigaraki's past.I won't rant about this here since I have done that plenty with my friends, but I will say that I sincerely hope that season six is better than this, especially considering which arcs are to come. only a couple of chapters long) and they couldn't taken their time fleshing out the Keeping up with the Todorokis arc, as well as really driven through the emotional aspect of Shigaraki's past.I won't rant about this here since I have done that plenty with my friends, but I will say that I sincerely hope that season six is better than this, especially considering which arcs are to come."", 'Probably the weakest season of MHA. I think that for a few reasons. I am mainly attracted to this show for the hype moments. Characters ""breaking"" their limits. Yelling loudly while destroying villains or themselves. It\'s a good time. The slow character progression in the students and villains is a bonus. But this season barely had any hype moments. There\'s a couple of breakthroughs for the plot - like Black Whip and the evolution of the league of villains - but the filler in-between is so boring that it felt like a chore to get through. It\'s not offensively bad but it\'s such a step...in a different direction that I am pretty disappointed. I hope next season picks up and is a lot more interesting from moment to moment.

I am kinda tired with it already, it feels like it's all fillers and the plot is getting slower.

There\'s so much more action than we\'re used to, and the major story gets pushed forward a little bit. I\'m not going to lie, it feels like the writers are kind of ""making it up as they go"", as opposed to having a solid plan for the larger series, but that opinion is coming from someone who doesn\'t read the manga and doesn\'t know where any of this is going.Regardless...of any blemishes I could point out, this season is just awesome. There\'s nothing to really comment on as far as artwork goes, since you\'ve seen the artwork before.

Haha.', ""**SPOILERS**As an anime-only watcher of this show, I feel like I've seen one of the steepest declines in quality in shounen history over the past 5 seasons of MHA. This show started out with the promise of being a top 3 of the new generation, however with every passing season I've felt more and more disappointed in what has been brought to the table.This season has definitely been the worst yet - the only character development that has occurred has been development that is pivotal to the plot of the show, making a lot of the characters seem stuck in the past as other characters...progress in measly or nonsensical manners to drive the story forward. In terms of said story itself - it's shockingly boring. The first half of this season was spent covering the most monotonous fights with half of each episode being a recap of the previous and re-re-re-introductions of every character and their quirk. The fights were boring and uninspired for the most part and served little purpose to the story, or even to my enjoyment (minus Bakugo's fight, I did enjoy that one). I felt as though Deku's new quirk was also a good addition to this and made the fighting part of this season at least somewhat interesting, but it doesn't necessarily excuse how boring the rest of the show was.The second half of the show covered two topics - Todoroki's family dynamic and the League of Villains. I genuinely liked the covering of Todoroki's family and how him and his siblings are struggling to reconnect as a family to give us a better understanding and depth to Todoroki's personality. I feel as though MHA suffers from 2D characters (perhaps as a result of having too many to cover) and this was a nice breath of fresh air from the usual cookie cutter script MHA has as a shounen. The League of Villains mini-arc however was my most hated part of this season, but also my most liked. Shigaraki's backstory was the only reason I even bothered to rate this show above a 5, as the story telling, animation and script for this part was absolutely incredible to watch. The empathy brought forward towards his character in the scene where he gains his quirk was honestly tear-jerking; it was one of the few memorable moments in MHA as a whole which I really appreciate. However, the whole underlining plot of the merging between the two evil companies really just doesn't interest me, and watching the main villains suddenly gain upgrades to their quirks at the same time felt extremely unnatural and goes to show that MHA truly has some awful pacing at times.I personally wish that they had cut the class fights short and spent more time developing the villains/covering more important parts of the plot as said fights brought forward no development to any of the characters apart from Deku's quirk, and honestly I hope season 6 is a large improvement going into a much more important part of the story as I am very tempted to drop this show if it keeps declining in the way it has been. progress in measly or nonsensical manners to drive the story forward.

And, come the series’ fifth coming, those cries only grew louder as the season went along. Just...why was My Hero Academia Season 5 so unpopular among the fans? Was that view truly warranted? For me, at least, though issues exist, my answer would overall be a firm “no”.As with the prior seasons, the characters remain one of the strongest aspects of the story, carrying the events forward and giving them weight even when the plot fails (which we will get to later). By this time in the story, their personalities and selves have been firmly established, allowing us to enjoy them shining in situations and continue to aim for growing as heroes. Even side characters and antagonists aren’t out of reach for this attention in this season, getting more time to shine and room to showcase their personalities than prior events have largely offered.Much of showcasing these strong characters in their element can also be attributed to the absolutely stellar animation boasted by the season. My Hero has always had good animation from the very start, being animated by Studio Bones will do that to a show, but this season has moments on a completely different level that left me breathless seeing them happen before me. With animation so strong, personalities and determination can clearly shine through and elevate already superb moments with that energy of the characters we’ve grown to love.Another strong aspect of My Hero that continues to receive focus and expansion here is the world. Across the season we see aspects of it we are familiar with expanded upon while also giving rise to new areas of untread ground covered for the first time, widening our perspective on the world. It’s nothing mind-blowing or earth-shattering, but merely more of the same given in the past seasons, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing in of itself.Above all though, the show is still as fun as ever, providing a consistently good mix of action-packed fights, charming and funny character moments, and fantastic growth and development across the board. It’s simply a blast to watch, even with all the completely legitimate complaints that can be hefted against it, to make a very enjoyable experience overall.If there is one area that My Hero Season 5 is less than stellar in though, it’s the pacing. At this point in the series, the stakes have been built up to be rather high, so for everything to slow down so much and cover an entire arc worth of interactions that, while charming and full of character, do little to advance the story is, for lack of better word, disappointing. Even when we move on from this initial arc into the second half, the arcs remain generally low-stakes, which, while remaining informative, definitely does cripple the show’s momentum it had been building. This aspect permeates Season 5 through its entirety, at least, right up until the very last part.This point functions as a perfect transition to discuss the point of most contention in My Hero Season 5; that of the story arcs that make up its 25 episode run. And, for all the praise I have for the season, I can agree with this critique; Season 5 is, for most of its run, entirely carried upon the characters and their development, with the story on its own being generally subpar in its intrigue. If one doesn’t enjoy the cast and their interactions in the same way I do, I can easily see why this season would feel so lackluster compared to the previous ones.However, at least for me, all is made up for by the absolutely stellar arc covered by the last five episodes. Fantastic action, wonderful characterization, high stakes, and, most importantly for this season, an intriguing and fulfilling story on its own. All these aspects come together to form what I would describe as easily one of the best arcs in the entire show thus far. It really is one that can’t be missed.As the latest installment of a long-running seasonal show, comparisons are both expected and necessary, so how would I say Season 5 compares to the prior ones? Overall, taken together, I would likely still refer to this as the weakest season of My Hero thus far. Not to say I didn’t enjoy it or think it was good, but the other seasons simply had more of what good moments Season 5 had. Thankfully the final arc helps alleviate that somewhat, and setup for what seems to be an exciting Season 6.In conclusion, while My Hero Academia Season 5 certainly has a good number of issues in its production, I find the show’s strong character, heart, and incredible animation to be enough to still make it an enjoyable experience overall, one that still keeps me eagerly anticipating the future of the series.Grade - B+ why was My Hero Academia Season 5 so unpopular among the fans?

This season honestly could have been 5 episodes at max but they really stretched it and I'm getting bored especially with what's to come in the story next season could have been a great set-up and hype for the next arc but this all feels so unnecessary. The joint training arc definitely did not need to be so long, it just feels like a repeat of previous seasons just with shinsou added in now and the meta liberation army arc should have been the prime focus instead of...just being the latter half of the show.

It can be kind of boring, but I personally think it's fun. If you read the manga, you know shit's going down after this and especially in the latest arc, so I think this is one of the last arcs currently where they're all (kinda) happy and just having...fun being a high schooler.

You will learn more about the all for one and one for all. But after that there is a probably worst part of the my hero academia - class 1.A vs 1.B. Some fights were good that's true but it was really long, longer than it should have been. After 1.A vs 1.B we were getting ready for the  next arcs. (MVA,...). We have learned alot new things this season and MVA is the greatest arc of MHA and...it saved this season. If you will just sit through the first 12 episodes you would get really good pay off for your time. it saved this season.

Turns out it's filled with cut dialogue, cut expositions and cut characterization, it only BARELY follows the manga's footsteps when it comes to being an adaptation, something that is to uplift the source material at it's core, I am not going to meander around and curse all willy nilly and pretend I'm the smartest human being on this platform, but Adaptations do also have to understand the author's vision and uplift that vision higher, since anime...has more advantages than a manga does, but theres nothing we can do about it, since the art quality has been steadily decreasing and being much more inconsistent than season 4. The story took a downfall because the anime decided to just do whatever it wants honestly, and the characterization kind of.. I mean it's mediocre from the anime..Read the manga, honestly- There's nothing I can tell you other than that. has more advantages than a manga does, but theres nothing we can do about it, since the art quality has been steadily decreasing and being much more inconsistent than season 4.

I love how Horikoshi incorporates the large cast of characters in this world. It's no surprise that I was excited and awaiting this 5th season. However, I noticed a trend with the production and it may inevitably cause a downward spiral.Season 1-3 of MHA were arguably some of the best works to come out the last decade. Season 4 didn't quite live up to the standard that the previous seasons set albeit I still enjoyed it....This season is another story. If it weren't for MVA, I would have scored this a 5. People seemed to not like the Joint-Training Arc, but it's actually not that bad considering that there needed to be more focus on Class 1-B.The problem lies with the Endeavor Agency Arc. The studio placed it before MVA and it felt like it was dragged on, week to week. MVA wasn't adapted properly because of that arc. I understand that the studio was also producing a movie while in the midst of production for the season, but man I'm praying that this won't happen again during the Paranormal Liberation Front Arc during Season 6.

It's like almost one quarter per episode is either a recap of the last one or flashbakcs from protagonists. It's not always bad though, some flashbacks are necessary sometimes, but when you keep repeating stuff that we already know, at some point we'll feel a bit bored you know?Anywho, this season was amazing ! The characters have a really good development and our trio (Todoroki, Bakugou, Midoriya) is shining. Love the new techniques learned, the study work (sidekick training).And the suspense though... it was done not perfectly but really a...9/10 at most. The plot getting messier (you'll know when you watch) is getting my hype up.If season 4 got you a bit disappointed (It did for me) well you shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up! It's better and has more action than the last one.Openings weren't amazing but decent and same for endings. As usual the OST is god tier.I recommend ! 9/10 at most.

The next season is the one I am looking forward to that has the potential to be one of the best (or possibly the season after), so there is still hope.  Also, there was a ridiculously abrupt ending in this season that didn't have a...next season hype, and just had an average end of episode scene - just less interesting.This art style is goofy as hell.

The character development and interactions were more valuable when we saw endeavor on his path for redemption or even the MLA vs League of Villains Arc.While I understand the importance of seeing how far our heroes have progressed and how Deku comes to face with his new abilities, we've spent too many arcs covering similar themes and tones to the point where not all the heroes are that interesting. I wish fewer episodes were spent on...the A vs B arc and more time was devoted to the villains or endeavor.I write this view out of some form of disappointment carried from early on and yet an odd satisfaction from how the last few episodes have redeemed the season in my eyes from a 5 to at least a 6/7.This is just my personal opinion and it should in no way detract you from your own viewing experience.

In terms of direction, narrative, design, etc. Shows can often have it's creative staff seemingly coast in terms of creation, wither due to creative wear down of prioritizing one project, or prioritizing another leaving other works under directed. This new season into the studio Bones adaptation of My Hero Academia with it's newest season, while not awful, is one I feel befits this description in allot of ways.While it may follow the respective arcs of the manga it is adapting, there...becomes missing a certain brand of directorial adaptation flourish and personality that kept other seasons afloat.

ANOTHER IS TO REMOVE THE BLOOD AND WEIGHT THE SCENE.Overall to my heart this season is a 3, but technically not to say I'm blinded by the disappointment and devaluing their work (which actually I am, I won't deny it), I give a 7 for the production as a whole. for me something was so boring and Endeavor's face makes me feel strange at times, I I no longer knew if it was 2D, CG or anything else O-O'Not to mention spoiling all the suspense behind the Hawks being a traitor or not, something that remained for several chapters making us hate the Hawks while trying to understand his actions, here comes the anime, episode 1, presents the Dabi relationship -Hawks, episode 2, already explains that he is a double agent.The training part was fun, I won't deny it.

As a matter of fact, some of the best character development this season has had comes in the later half.  Speaking of halves, MHA is always a split of two arcs. One is always a school related arc, and the other, the type of arc that we watch MHA for in the first place. This season is no exception to this formula.Goodness me this first half is tedious. It's a slow romp through monotonous episodr after monotonous episode. I get it MHA, you have...to have a vehicle for character development. Why for the last two seasons however, have you chosen such garbage vehicles to get us there. It's bland, irritating and by the end of this arc, you will look back with only animosity towards what you just endured.Half way, we get a little arc breaker. It's sole purpose is still character building and I believe will definitely split the audience. Some people won't want this type of character building in MHA. The other side, like me, will feel that this had to come at some point in order to move forward appropriately with the pro hero roster of MHA. It's short, but definitely required in my opinion to set us up for season 6.Now for the final arc. Personally, I thought it was great. Introduced us to new characters, new quirks and smashed the door wide open for vast potential in season 6. Again, this is character development that was required at some point, especially after the events of season 4, and it was done very well. We really get the understand the true scale of the world of our antagonists and what the hero really have in store for them. For the ones we follow here, the development was really solid. We also learnt about how some of these characters can development further, or rather, the restrictions they had prior to this season 5 final arc.In summary, the first half is garbage. It really is, and the reason I had this on hold for over a year at episode 5. Though, if your like me and have watched a reasonable amount of anime, you already know that perseverance pays off....some of the time anyway. This is a prime example of perseverance paying off. My enjoyment may be enhanced however by the knowledge that season 6 is superb. Regardless, it was garbage, then good, then great but it should be fully appreciated before watching this, its sole purpose is clearly to build to something greater. to have a vehicle for character development.

Art style and soundtrack still kicking hard.  First few episodes are juts like fillers and boring because of how slow they progress and how relevant they were to the story.  It was so slow that I just decided the read the manga and catch up because I just couldn't handle waiting a week for an episode that progressed like 5 pages of the manga.  Animation did come in clutch and the VA's are certified af.  I feel like this season is gonna be kind of stale considering the content that's coming, and the...fact that they are lengthening this arch this long just makes me feel like the anime will not catch up to the manga. fact that they are lengthening this arch this long just makes me feel like the anime will not catch up to the manga."", ""I was having a hard time watching the first episodes and almost dropped it. Ever since the start it was just hard to see, nothing out of the normal and just some battles that wont be essential for anything at the future. After assimilating that this season will be a total drag I watched more episodes just because it will be an experience to see such a boring and not going anywhere season.As I was getting through the episodes as I expected there was nothing special about it but this internal disappointment was turning into a blessing when out of nowhere the show gets just...a little bit interesting. As a person with too much free time at that point I couldn't stop watching just there so I watched the whole season in a day like crazy. I admit there where times when it was just boring to see again but there is no blaming if they need to fill a bit more to get you anxious to see what the fuck is going to happen. To be honest I'm still excited about how this season turned to be. Even though this is again something normal ''again the main characters evolving with new powers and super strong'' it's what I want to see when I start watching an anime like this.I'm just going to rate it as very good because at the end it was actually very good.

I felt like the first few episodes were their attempt to give the supporting characters more screen time. While I would normally be okay with that, the pacing just wasn't doing them justice. Fights dragged on for way too long and the beginning-of-episode recaps were starting to get on my nerves. This section of the show just wasn't interesting enough for me and I feel like the writers knew that as they would periodically throw in bits and pieces of more interesting story beats, in what I see,...as an attempt to keep the viewers engaged.However, it's not all doom and gloom. By the time the tournament arc got around to the main characters of the show, things started to get much better and much more interesting. The episode titled 'Match 3' included Iida and Todoroki who ended up carrying the whole episode. Each character got really interesting match ups, each character got plenty of time to show off how they've improved, and the art and animation felt like it was turned up to 11 at the end. The next match was with Bakugo which was also fantastic but wrapped up pretty quickly. But even for how short it ended up being, I felt that they showcased Bakugo's character development really well. His development makes sense with his personality and it's not like he's suddenly Deku 2.0. Speaking of which, Deku's match was up next. This match ended up being less of a spectacle than the one with Iida and Todoroki, but it was equally interesting and important for its own reasons. This episode ends up indicating the direction of the show and what might potentially come in the future and was just as entertaining to watch as the others.By this point we're at around episode 12-13 which were fun to watch but aren't really anything special. Episode 12 was mostly just exposition dump but the second half was more fun. We ended up getting to see Bakugo and Todoroki back in action albeit for a pretty short scene. Episode 13 mostly just ended up being a Christmas episode which was funny considering it aired in the middle of June. I'm assuming this section of the story released closer to Christmas with the manga (I wouldn't know, I haven't kept up with the manga) but it still felt festive nonetheless.After this point is when the story really starts to pick up and I ended up watching the rest of the season in one go from this point on. The first few episodes focus on Class 1A returning to do more hero internship. We only really get to see Deku's group and Ochako's group, the latter being mostly a filler episode. Hawks' story beats also start getting really interesting at this point and even ends up crossing paths with Deku's group at one point just to drive home the fact that this is all happening simultaneously. Around the end of this arc we end up getting a deeper look into Todoroki's family issues and even some character development with Endeavour. With BNHA being a battle shonen anime, I know most people are expecting big action-packed fight scenes and high octane tournament arcs and not emotional yet realistic stories of interpersonal discourse with a broken family. But even with all that being said, I have to say that this part of the story is one of my most favorite moments of the entire show. We get to see the consequences of Endeavour's past mistakes as well as the emotional trauma that came as a result in the form of Natsuo, Shoto's older brother. Unfortunately, this is in fact a battle shonen anime and they had to shoehorn in a villain to wrap this section up. I say unfortunately because the villain here kind of sucks. He's supposed to be the physical representation of Endeavour's past coming back to haunt him but there's just no real emotional stakes beyond the ones forced into the fight (if you know you know). The villain has no real personality other than being a weird obsessive stalker and only really exists as a representation of Endeavour's own character development. Not very memorable but you can't win em all I guess.After that arc we get the real meat of this season, the thing that all the manga readers have been endlessly hyping up since the first episode of season 5: the Meta Liberation Army arc A.K.A My Villain Academia. If you've been around Twitter and saw the Doofenshmirtz glow up meme, this is where it comes from. At this point in the story we shift our focus over to the League of Villains as they now become the protagonists of the show for the rest of the season. Overall, I think this was a fantastic way to add something into the show that I've always thought was missing out, that being a proper showcase of the League of Villains on their own. Throughout this last leg of the season, one thing I kept repeating to myself was how nice it was to finally get some real dark story beats, they really didn't hold back with this one. Main standouts here are Toga, Twice, and most importantly, Shigaraki. I'm glad that they picked these three to develop more as these were the three that I thought could have had a little more character. Toga's section was honestly pretty heartbreaking at times but equally cathartic during the climactic moments. Twice's section didn't really do much to get him away from the very real comparisons between him and Deadpool but it was still very triumphant and suitably insane. Spinner also got a small section for himself as well but it really didn't do much to bring him out of the supporting character role. Dabi had a cool fight but that's all it really was. Then we get to Shigaraki. In the past, I found Shigaraki to be a really lacking character despite being one of the leading villains of the show. Up until now, Shigaraki was really around the same level of power and importance as the rest of his team while villains like Stain and Dabi stood out to me as being more influential. A part of me sees all this as being the point of his development but it was still an issue I had with the character in those earlier seasons. However, after seeing these last few episodes, I am happy to say that this issue has been addressed in pretty much the most direct way possible. I won't spoil the details of what that means but I will say that after those episodes, I can finally see Shigaraki as a true main villain of the show. The art and animation during these last few episodes also start going into maximum overdrive (seriously, the level of sakuga is insane). This was definitely the best arc of the season.Final Thoughts:Overall, this was a pretty good season all things considered. The beginning of it was a bit too slow and rough for me to be able to honestly rate this season as anything higher than a 7/10 but it does begin to pick up fairly early on. All of the arcs were interesting and never really took away from my enjoyment of the show for the most part. This is definitely one of those seasons that takes a bit to warm up but gets exponentially better once it does, so in many ways it's kind of the opposite of what I felt with season 4.Score Breakdown:- I give the story a 7. I won't bother with explaining why considering that's basically what I did with this entire review- The art is always fantastic but I felt it was just a bit better than previous seasons so I give it a 9.- The sound was perfectly fine on a technical level. Everything was well balanced, voices were clear, music wasn't overbearing but the sound design was pretty standard, nothing that really blew me away. This one's a 7.- The character development in this season was pretty great and I really liked how they handled it so I give it an 8.- I had a pretty good time watching this season, more than season 4, so I give it an 8. Any show that can get me genuinely hyped is always a good time.- Overall, I give this season a 7. If we're being exact here it would be more like a 7.7.

That being said, I can see why other people might like a tournament arc, so I leave it up to you to decide whether you count that as a positive or negative.The second thing I would say about this season would be that the earlier fights we\'ve seen just don\'t hold up. So far we\'ve had a single fight that ended up being strategic, and two fights that boiled down to ""overwhelming fire power"" - in spite of having a whole bunch of characters come out with interesting and mostly tactical abilities over raw strength. And example of this would be the fight involving Momo (a strategist), in which the final trump card is used at the very end of the fight when all other cards were countered - in spite of the trump card being somewhat obvious, considering the previous ability of said student didn\'t actually do anything, except hint towards the trump card. The fights are not ""dumb"" by any means and some of the characters really do show off some planning and strategizing, but somehow the fights still end on the note of ""large sweeping attacks"" instead of instances where we actually get to see planning taking the overhand.All that being said, the last fight in episode 8 was absolutely a very hype moment and I enjoyed my stay. Is it as good as e.g. the Overhaul arc? Not for me personally. Does that make the show bad? Nah, the strengths the show had are all still there, it\'s just that the weaknesses are highlighted a bit more this current season.

All until the last few episodes of the show actually, wherein the focus shifts from UA and all your familiar characters to fully focusing on what is in my opinion the best part of the show, that being the villains.I won't spoil anything but I will say my review went from a 5 to an 8 purely because of those last few episodes, so I...felt I had to recommend this show. felt I had to recommend this show."", ""Fifth season of the anime, the beginning was very slow, nothing interesting happens, it is mostly a transition arc until the last 5 chapters.

Maybe it was the tournament arc or maybe I personally felt that the animation was little downgraded.The first leg of the season was a simple tournament arc between two classes, which was interesting, but only at some parts. The second leg was much better with insights of Todoroki family and the anticipated Villains Arc.Although it was not a big letdown, the fith season of MHA felt as if it was pushing itself without any motive. Being a non manga reader, I just hope that the next season bounces back...with amazing actions and battles between the characters once again.My Rating : 7/10 with amazing actions and battles between the characters once again.My Rating : 7/10"", '*Spoiler warning!*Story/Plot 7/10 - In my opinion, the start of this season was pretty rocky. The first episode wasn\'t cannon and it basically just re-introduced the series, and then the first arc the ""Joint Training Arc"" was honestly pretty boring to start with. The pacing for the arc was weird, some parts were way too short while some went on for way too long. With that said, everything after that is pretty good. They switched up the placement of the ""Endeavor Agency Arc"" and the ""Meta Liberation Army Arc"" which bothered some people, but if you\'re an anime-only it probably won\'t be that big of...a deal.Art/Animation 7/10 - I think it changed from last season, not much to say though. It\'s fine I guess, some clips look a little weird though.Sound 6/10 - The same as any other anime, the voice actors stayed the same too, but the op wasn\'t the best.Characters/Personalities 7/10 - Everyone this season seems way more determined in their own way. The best example of this is how Endeavor is heavily determined to be a better person, and honestly, I think he\'s doing pretty well. His actions aren\'t justified one bit but he\'s trying to make himself a better person and atone for his actions, not ignore them. Bakugo is trying to become a better person in his own right as well, even if he shows it a ""tad"" bit differently.Enjoyment 6/10 - While I\'ve enjoyed this season a good amount, the beginning was pretty boring and it made me put the anime on hold for quite a while.Overall 7/10 - There\'s not much to say, it\'s pretty good. Season 4 is still better in my opinion but that may change, only time will tell! :) a deal.Art/Animation 7/10 - I think it changed from last season, not much to say though.

His actions aren\'t justified one bit but he\'s trying to make himself a better person and atone for his actions, not ignore them. Bakugo is trying to become a better person in his own right as well, even if he shows it a ""tad"" bit differently.Enjoyment 6/10 - While I\'ve enjoyed this season a good amount, the beginning was pretty boring and it made me put the anime on hold for quite a while.Overall 7/10 - There\'s not much to say, it\'s pretty good. Season 4 is still better in my opinion but that may change, only time will tell! :)', 'I don`t like what mha trying to show in this season.

Unfortunately, Season 5 does nothing to improve on the previous seasons missteps and has noticeably degraded in both story and quality.This season covers three arcs: Joint Training, My Villain Academia and Endeavour Agency.Besides My Villain Academia, which has it's moments, the other arcs are some of the more flawed stories in this series, so Season 5 already had it's work cut out for it.The first half of the season (which was made up of 13 episodes covering Joint Training) while having...a few great animation sequences, (emphasis on few) is ultimately unentertaining and feels like an elongated filler arc, despite the impact it's finale has on the main character.The second half is truly puzzling, as the two arcs have been swapped so that now the Endeavor Agency mini-arc is artificially extended through mind-numbing pacing and long flashback sequences that we've seen a million times before. To make matters worse, My Villain Academy has been squeezed into just five episodes.The cheap aesthetic to the animation never leaves throughout the season. This on top of the rest  of the changes make what was already a dull part of the manga even more harder to slog through. The only reason I can think as to why they swapped the last two arcs around was to coincide with the release with the third My Hero Academia movie, which takes place during the Endevour Agency arc.People have asked me if they should switch to the manga after hearing about the bad reception to this season. While I do think this is the poorest adaption of MHA we've gotten, ultimately nothing pivotal is removed or changed to the point of severity. I don't think this is bad enough to warrant reading a 300+ chapter manga that still has the same flaws in the plotline. It all depends on next season, which will be adapting the penultimate Paranormal Liberation War Arc, which will bring a close to this era of My Hero Academia.

Season 5 especially what is going on with the villain development is the base setup for what is happening in the manga and should be treated as such.

The season ends where it does because it's supposed to be the setup for the next season and...the finale going on in the manga atm.The entire show is also being carried by the villains at the moment. Deku is a boring protagonist with an interesting power that rarely to almost never gets the spotlight.

It's just the uneven pacing that places it lower than the previous seasons. The first 11 episodes went on really fast, with episode 10 finding its place as the best one till then. From a few episodes around then, the pacing starts to drop a bit, and we even get a filler episode: something enough to disappoint fans who just want to follow the main story. Plus. there were episode delays and just at the wrong time. Especially those till episode 17, where the anime focused more on the characters than any missions. However, the...pacing was back to normal soon after that, and we even got a Suicide Squad-esque arc in the last few episodes delivered with intensity subtle enough to blow someone's mind.Now, the main thing. Aside from the aforementioned pacing issues, this season was actually pretty good. The action sequences continued to stun, and the new opening music for this particular season stood out so much that I had to watch it every time I started an episode. Art was still pretty good, and the voice acting continued to hold the ground. However, this season didn't have a lot of humor unlike previous seasons that somehow had just the right amount of humor to compensate for the intensity, but that's just about fine. There were a number of emotionally charged episodes, which only went on to make this a strongly written anime in the long run.In spite of the one filler episode (I liked it, though) which wasn't really needed and some parts where it felt slower, this season was mostly entertaining and I enjoyed it throughout, due to which I give it a 10/10 without hesitation. Sure, it's not a perfect one and might turn out to be the least favorite when compared to the previous four, but it is definitely worth watching if you love the characters and the show in general.

That's setting it against the other seasons, which were mostly exceptional, to some extent.  However, much of this season feels like filler, even though we see moments that are important to the overall plot.  I'll assume you've seen the previous seasons for the purposes of this review.Story: The first half has Class 1-A facing off against 1-B, in groups of four with Hitoshi Shinsou joining in, in an attempt to see if he can use his abilities outside of his General course.  There are...minor plot developments mixed into that first half, so it's not like you can really skip it.  If you're interested in seeing the types of abilities that our main classmates have been working on, this might not be so bad for you.  The second half has three smaller arcs: One where we view 1-A doing another shorter work study, another with a character arc surrounding Shouto and his family and the last with the League of Villains and Meta Liberation army.  The work study simply has Shouto, Deku and Kacchan working under Endeavour and on it's own, isn't really anything special or moving.  When the plot moves to more personal matters around Shouto and his family, we learn more about them and while it's okay to learn the finer details about them, I'm not sure we really needed that.  It just feels like fluff.  The last arc is by far the best, and probably the only reason to watch this season.  The League of Villains pit themselves up against the Meta Liberation army, with wider plans revealed in the later stages of the season.  Mixed into there, we get to see backgrounds on Tomura, Twice and, to a lesser extent, Himiko Toga.  Again, they're fine, but nothing to super write home about.The story itself is really nothing special, and is honestly pretty disappointing considering the success of the previous seasons.  There are still tons of action packed fights and they do have their hype moments, but this is all mostly fan service at this point.  The developments of the last few episodes represent the peak of the season, but even that gets stalled because we have to watch through Tomura's past, which I felt stalled any pacing the series had.  (5/10)Characters: We still see our usual characters in all their glory and many go through different stages of development.  It's really hard to separate story from characters here because this season relied so much on watching stuff from the past, and doing that to this extent just dragged the pacing along.  Most of the character development comes through Tomura and outside of needing to watch his past, it's a worthy watch.  Re-Destro gets introduced into this season, the leader of the Meta Liberation Front and he's a decent villain, along with his various lackies.  Endeavor also attempts to work on his personality during the Shoto arc and shows us a side of him that he wants to reform.  My only gripe here is that I really don't want another arc about that family.By now, we know who our class of 1-A are, and they're an excellent cast.  New characters are strong and terrifying and other villains somehow get scarier.  They also briefly touch on Arie's situation, so I'll be eager to see if that goes anywhere next season too.  (7/10)Art: My Hero Academia always has some of the best action sequences to date with other sequences taking on that comic book vibe.  The consistency is very welcome.  Chances are, if you like the art style before, you still will and it holds its on with the best of them, outside anime involved with ufotable.  (8/10)Sound: Like with the art, nothing is surprising you here.  The OST has some great tunes, though I would hope they plan to expand some of their tracks later.  The voice cast still features some of the highest profile cast members that I've seen in recent memory and they're all amazing.  Eric Vale (Tomura) and Newton Pittman (Twice) go through some character developments and their VOs adept fantastically, especially the former.  Newcomer Mark Stoddard (Dr. Garaki) reminded me of the Gold Tooth Doctor in Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood (same VO) and he brings that menacing feel like he did before.  I wasn't huge on either ED, but both OPs were awesome.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: This is obviously a massive step backwards for the My Hero Academia franchise, but based on what we see here, I'll be very disappointed if the next season doesn't produce something big.  It's still got its moments, but there's gotta be more there for this season on its own to live up to the previous seasons.  And apart from the last fight, there just wasn't enough fun action here.

(6/10)"", ""The thing with a show structured like this is that the release schedule of an ongoing manga isn't always going to gel nicely with the release schedule of an anime series. So far, those schedules have matched up quite nicely; each series of 'My Hero Academia' has fallen naturally into a nice balance, with the arcs present in each series complementing themselves nicely, giving us a well-balanced show. Each season has had enough big, status-quo shifting moments balanced nicely with smaller character beats or fun moments of levity. It's meant the whole thing has fallen into a nice pace, and a good rhythm.The problem...is that those were always going to fall a little out of sync eventually, and one of these seasons was always going to end up being a victim of it. It seems that this is what we've got here.It isn't that what's there is anything close to bad. The Class 1-A v 1-B stuff was great fun, gave us a chance for some of the less important characters to get their moment in the spotlight, gave us a chance for our main characters to really show their development, and gave us some incredible fight scenes that used everyone's Quirks in some really fun and unique ways. The Work Study arc was fantastic, giving us great insights into these characters and giving them a good push forward in terms of development. Even the 'My Villain Academia' arc, which I personally think was the weakest section, had a lot of good fights and fleshed out our villain characters in some interesting ways.Where I think we fell into a problem is that what comes next is going to be big. Just from the last post-credits scene in the last episode, it's clear that season 6 is going to come in swinging some of the biggest events we've seen so far, and that meant that this season sort of had to spend its time putting pieces in place. It's a lot of characters getting in the right positions for what is likely to be some big plot and character developments next year, getting us to care about a few other people more so that twists hit harder, and setting up the status quo for the confrontation. And all of that IS done very well, and I definitely wasn't bored for the majority of it, but it definitely feels like a very practical season.It doesn't have those huge, story-shifting moments like previous seasons had; no All Might v All For One, no big confrontations with big villains, nothing that made a huge impact. Because all of that's going to come next year, and they just needed to get those pieces in place.But, for the most part, I actually can forgive it that; I've only taken a point off from the last season for it. And, to be honest, most of that is just that I thought the 'My Villain Academia' arc was pretty poorly paced and ending up dragging an episode or too longer than I would have liked. Overall, 'My Hero Academia' taking a little bit of a dip still leaves it as a pretty fantastic show, and it's done nothing to sour me in the story. If anything, it's made me all the more excited to see season 6 roll around and give us the payoff to all the set-up this season had to deal with. is that those were always going to fall a little out of sync eventually, and one of these seasons was always going to end up being a victim of it.

And all of that IS done very well, and I definitely wasn't bored for the majority of it, but it definitely feels like a very practical season.It doesn't have those huge, story-shifting moments like previous seasons had; no All Might v All For One, no big confrontations with big villains, nothing that made a huge impact. Because all of that's going to come next year, and they just needed to get those pieces in place.But, for the most part, I actually can forgive it that; I've only taken a point off from the last season for it. And, to be honest, most of that is just that I thought the 'My Villain Academia' arc was pretty poorly paced and ending up dragging an episode or too longer than I would have liked. Overall, 'My Hero Academia' taking a little bit of a dip still leaves it as a pretty fantastic show, and it's done nothing to sour me in the story. If anything, it's made me all the more excited to see season 6 roll around and give us the payoff to all the set-up this season had to deal with."", ""You better wait for the season to be finished, because right now, it just started to work on the next arc, which is supposed to move the story in a more faster pace, I half regret watching it from the start, since it doesn't give a thing except some character development and exposing a really big secret, other then that, nothing really big, you just get some hints of the upcoming arc which still building it.for me, this got to be the less exciting season from all of the seasons for now, which it could change of course if the second half is juicy...as hell, then I will edit my review (if I can) and add on the other half and make a complete review.Thanks for reading. as hell, then I will edit my review (if I can) and add on the other half and make a complete review.Thanks for reading."", ""Boku no Hero Academia 5th Season definitely didn't meet my expectations and I was a bit disappointed overall, I was moderately entertained throughout but it really felt like not a lot happened. There were 3 main arcs and I enjoyed them in descending order, which is wild to me because the first was meant to be just filler really and the third was supposed to be one of the best in the manga but I just wasn't that into it.The pacing overall felt quite dragged out in some parts and rushed in others, this season didn't have any climactic battles or big stand out...moments like all of the others had - although I will say I love the direction it's heading regarding Deku, and in the first arc he did have a few really cool moments but that's about it. The second arc really just felt pointless to me, there were no major events and it was just a bit boring overall. The third arc really just wasn't interesting to me, there were a lot of moments where I was really questioning the way stuff happened and how it would work in the bnha universe which really just made my annoyed for the majority.This all being said I think this season is still worth watching, and I just hope season 6 covers some more interesting material. moments like all of the others had - although I will say I love the direction it's heading regarding Deku, and in the first arc he did have a few really cool moments but that's about it.

It chooses to focus a distressing amount of the season on the worst arc in the season, it actively skimps on episode run-time to put in flashback after flashback. (The flashbacks were in the manga as well, but the anime drags them out so long you begin to realize they're doing it to drag out episodes and cut down on animation costs.) Besides that, most of it is standard BNHA until the last half. Admittedly, I haven't watched the last half of the season. This season made me so actively mad...it made me drop the show.I picked up the manga because it would at least respect my time. If I'm going to make the active decision to watch a show, it better give me a cohesive story, not just regurgitate things I've already seen.It's not like there are no good points in this season, it's just you have to wade through a swamp of garbage to get to it. I would suggest if you're so invested to BNHA at this point and you dislike this season, just read the manga. It's what everyone says about shows, but for once I feel as if it actually makes sense.

The main problem here is pacing. There are three arcs in Season 5, Class A vs Class B arc, Endeavor Training Arc, and My Villain Academy. Won't spoil too much about what actually happens in the arcs, but Bones completely messed up the pacing. For Starters, in the A vs B Arc, they decided to give each individual fight WAY more screen time than it needed. For example, the show structure would be: Introduce every single quirk we've already seen for FOUR SEASONS again, then start Fight 1. Spend the next 10 minutes of the next episode recapping what happened in...the last episode and show the conclusion of the fight. For the third episode they recap the entire first fight, show the powers of the next kids fighting, then set up the next battle. Rinse and repeat, which makes it a slog to get through.Next the anime decides to change the order of the show and go with the Endeavor arc. This was done to promote the new MHA movie, which I will not be watching in protest. Instead of taking one episode out of the season to set up the movie like they did with the first movie, they basically made this arc last 3 episodes longer than it frankly should have been in order to give more screen time to characters that would take place in that move. Overall a really boring arc.Finally we get to My Villain Academia, which was the best arc of the three to get adapted. The problem was the fact that they squeezed every bit of life out of the first two Arcs so that there was only 6 episodes left to tell this story. This led to the arc being rushed and content skipped over.Overall, this season had two boring arcs that got stretched out way longer than they should, and one actually good arc that got rushed. If the same sort of thing happens with season 6, I will stop watching the show. The content that is up ahead is too important to mess up the way they did this season.TLDR read the manga and don't watch this season. it was a chore to watch for 2/3 arc, and a disappointment for the other arc. the last episode and show the conclusion of the fight.

As probably the biggest mainstream hit, other than “Demon Slayer”, it is a manga adaptation with studio Bones in charge of the animation.Animation wise, “My Hero Academia” really hit it out of the park, the fights were absolutely amazing, the powers and their interaction with each other and the surroundings was really creative and enjoyable to watch, and the climax moments were as good as one can ask for (also due...to the amazing music and soundtracks that really took the fights to the next level). The wide variety of characters and powers with the vivid and bright colours really made it stood out. The world was well designed as were the backgrounds and places throughout the seasons.However, despite the amazing characters and animation, “My Hero Academia” ends up falling in a lot of tropes and stereotypes that make it lose that sense of uniqueness that other shows might have. The plot is good, especially the anti-hero ‘Stain’ arc but in many other moments and plot points it was pretty much a power of friendship, good defeats evil kind of narrative, which I’m not saying it is bad, since it appeals to a very big audience, but not my type of tea.Overall, “My Hero Academia” is an amazing show and what a true Shounen is at his best, it does not have the best written story or characters, but it makes up for that in awesome action scenes and fights. to the amazing music and soundtracks that really took the fights to the next level).

Before I really rag on what went wrong this season (which was most of it, for me), I wanna bring up the few things I found really enticing about where this story is at right now.One of the things I loved seeing in this season was the character work done with Present Mic and Aizawa....Without giving anything away here, I thought the changes we saw in their characters this season was brilliantly done in almost every way. It was the perfect drop of intensity to add to the culture at UA, and I hope it\'s something they run with in the future. On another character development point, some of Shigaraki\'s development was absolutely incredible. It did what a good shounen should do, which is hype you up for what\'s to come. I can\'t describe the specific parts that were done well without giving things away, but Shigaraki\'s development finally added a bit of spice back into Boku no Hero. It made you forget about the childish tone of it that we\'ve had for so long and introduced some dark themes that were really intriguing to see in the context of Boku no Hero. The last thing I loved a lot was the possibilities that were introduced with Midoriya\'s character and his Quirk. The tone set when his abilities were delved into during this season made me really excited to see what will become of them.Those three things are the only majorly positive thing I have to say about this season. I\'m not really sure what to talk about first, but I guess it\'s gonna be the overall layout of the episodes this season. None of it--besides the above mentioned items, of course--was even remotely engaging for most of the time. I know that may be an unpopular opinion among those that have seen this season because of the last chunk of episodes, but genuinely, everything from the first arc of battles at UA to the developments in the end were dull more often than they weren\'t. There were undoubtedly cool *moments* in there, but ""moment"" is the most generous word I\'m willing to use. It\'s like you get this scene with Twice that\'s really damn cool, but the rest of the episode and the following one seem like white noise. The beginning of this season was the worst of it, though, because it all felt pointless. Every week until that arc was over had me thinking, ""Why in the world are they focused on this right now? If this was gonna be a thing, it should\'ve been three seasons ago.""And the *development.* I don\'t even know if I have enough time to write about how the character and plot development in Boku no Hero has suffered within the last few seasons, but to sum it up through the lens of season 5: where did it go? I\'m honestly asking what in the world happened to the steady stream of character, ability, and plot developments that Boku no Hero used to have. It was never perfect, and it always has had its inconsistencies--especially with Midoriya--but this season just made it a joke. It\'s either characters coming in with new abilities out of nowhere (which is fine if it\'s done consistently, but it\'s not at all because they just have the ability without it ever being mentioned that they were training a new ability), or characters not being able to do a thing, and then when you see them for the first time after four episodes, they can suddenly do it. Worse than the character development, though, is the plot development. Boku no Hero is somehow moving slow as hell and way too fast without moving at all. Like, in terms of the heroes this season, nothing at all of importance happened to develop their side of the story as it connects to the villain\'s side. For the villains, an entire rise to power was covered in a handful of episodes. Yet, for all that, it felt like nothing happened this season. Which means, when the good stuff does start happening, it\'s going to feel like it came out of nowhere because there wasn\'t a proper built-up to it.At this point, Boku no Hero is trying to capture the audience with slice-of-life moments with the main characters and the novelty of difference with the villains, and it isn\'t enough to sustain its quality. One of these days, Boku no Hero could produce the type of content that makes all of us feel like it\'s the best in the genre, but for right now, it feels like it\'s forgotten it\'s original purpose. All the magic is gone, and its left a flat, boring surface with the occasional spark of intensity. Boku no Hero has a damn good story behind it, and I hope they start using it soon.

While I do know ahead of time that this season is going to be riddled with extreme pacing issues and incongruent story reorganizations which is a shame due to how well the prior seasons were handled, being very true to the structure of the manga which allowed for a far more consistent story being told; however I'm...immediately starting to notice some issues with the story within the first four episodes. While I'm not normally one to discuss the issues in pacing unless they are extremely glaring and are so off that it feels jarring Season 5 takes off to a far slower start reintroducing aspects of characters that I couldn't forget even if I wanted to; and this is something I've noticed in every season so far. While I would describe myself as a fan of the series this has always been very frustrating to me, spending so much time recapping things instead of being able to advance the story is extremely frustrating and in a way almost insulting to me. The character designs and quirks are all relatively unique, barring the handful of quirks that are explicitly similar to others, and nearly four years into watching this series I'm still being shown exactly who these characters are and what their quirks are. It's not like I've forgotten the abilities of these characters, so why am I consistently being reminded of characters that are overtly memorable but not the ones who have less of a focus in the direct story? This might not be an issue for other people who with other people, but it's been an issue ever present for me.While this might not be worthy of note, the fights are as always great. Bones is a phenomenal studio when it comes to raw animation prowess and it's clear where they put their budget in these fights. Utterly spectacular and bombastically over the top fight scenes that encapsulate the sheer spectacle that bones is known for.Now, the real problem in this season is the pacing. It's fucking insane in frankly not good ways whatsoever. The first half takes way, WAY too long with nearly half of the entire season being dedicated to what can be surmised at sports festival pt3, and the second half dealing with breakneck pacing, a rushed villain, and plot points that could have been executed with a masterful precision end up being sloppy.

The “My Villain Academia” arc is far more substantive, fleshing out the characters who are now clearly established to be endgame antagonists, but for me it felt a little like the vegetables I was forced to eat to get back to the stuff I actually wanted. I did however find it interesting to take the “sad backstory” framework previously used for the “Character: Origin” episodes, and hit you with the twisted, disturbing version for characters like Shigaraki.Overall this season suffers from feeling like the extended prelude to...something better, rather than one complete story, but for me My Hero is always inherently entertaining and fun. something better, rather than one complete story, but for me My Hero is always inherently entertaining and fun.', 'Note:heavily subject to changeMy hero Academia, arguably the most popular anime, shooting anime into the realm of mainstream.

That is that, after 25 full episodes, you're left with a sense that nothing really changed and not a whole lot even happened. That's not to say that My Hero Academia is just bad now. I believe it's less the fault of the story and more the fault of this seasonal format. While infinitely better than just letting the show run every week indefinitely and just doing filler whenever the anime starts to outpace the manga, it does leave these awkwardly paced...seasons and runs the risk of setting up plot points that don't pay off until next season or ending the season at an awkward point.When looking at this season in isolation it seems pretty uneventful, with the exception of the villains arc that kind of took over the second half. It's good that they're finally trying to address the villain problem this series has, that being that I don't care about any of them. By trying to give Mr Bad Touch an arc there's potential that I might care about him in the future. I think his motivations are kind of lame and played out, but maybe they'll change my mind about it eventually if he manages to do anything other than be a background character and look vaguely menacing. It's a testament to his affect on the story that I can't even remember his name.So this was a middling season, hopefully the series has more exciting stuff down the line but for now I give it a 7/10 seasons and runs the risk of setting up plot points that don't pay off until next season or ending the season at an awkward point.When looking at this season in isolation it seems pretty uneventful, with the exception of the villains arc that kind of took over the second half.

I\'m gonna review this Season by chopping into arc reviews and then some summarized paragraph at the end.Joint Training: Self-explanatory - arc where Class A vs Class B train to improve their skills and teamwork. Overall this arc was just alright. The first 2 fights were lame. Quirks were cool, nothing else. But I can say I genuinely enjoyed the last 3 fights. Very entertaining. Black Whip was adapted very very well. Uraraka, Bakugou, Lida, Todoroki, and Deku all had...good moments. Art was passable, but nothing special, the sound was good nice high-impact sfx. The setpiece was boring, all pipes? Really? The story was weak, but then again, this was just supposed to be an entertainment arc and to introduce the 6 quirks plotline. Elevated above the manga. 6.5/10Endeavor Agency: This arc is the most controversial in the series. Switching MVA with this arc in hindsight just only had one purpose: promoting the movie. The League of Villains combining with the MLA was a huge spoiler that kinda ruined the stakes of MVA. Anyway, on to the arc in itself. The big three of Class 1-a training under Endeavor.  Very short arc, the story was simple and nothing all too special. I thought learning more of the day-to-day of a top hero was somewhat compelling and the challenge of resolving an issue before Endeavour set a vision for the boys. The shining moment of this arc was Endeavor himself. Such a great character. His journey to atonement is something bones has captured well so far. He\'s just a dude who knows his mistakes will never be fixed and he needs to find a proper way to live with that and be a better man. Being a great hero doesn\'t make you a great father. It takes more than that for redemption. 7/10. Endeavor carries this arc.MVA: This arc is boiled down to: ""Good, but not as good as it could\'ve been"". So much content cut out., Spinner\'s character was ruined, and the Toga fight was underwhelming. Way too many still shots, it just takes away a lot of the life that the arc could have had. The art was just average too. But the good? Oh, there\'s a good bit. Shigaraki was amazing in this arc. Easily turned into one of my favorite villains. His transformation into a complete monster was a blast to witness, and the Re-Destro fight was an absolute banger. The VA absolutely popped off. As for his backstory, perfection. Not too much censoring and the OST and pacing were great. The art that episode was pretty good as well.

We can be grateful for that. good moments. Art was passable, but nothing special, the sound was good nice high-impact sfx. The setpiece was boring, all pipes? Really? The story was weak, but then again, this was just supposed to be an entertainment arc and to introduce the 6 quirks plotline. Elevated above the manga. 6.5/10Endeavor Agency: This arc is the most controversial in the series. Switching MVA with this arc in hindsight just only had one purpose: promoting the movie. The League of Villains combining with the MLA was a huge spoiler that kinda ruined the stakes of MVA. Anyway, on to the arc in itself. The big three of Class 1-a training under Endeavor.  Very short arc, the story was simple and nothing all too special. I thought learning more of the day-to-day of a top hero was somewhat compelling and the challenge of resolving an issue before Endeavour set a vision for the boys. The shining moment of this arc was Endeavor himself. Such a great character. His journey to atonement is something bones has captured well so far. He\'s just a dude who knows his mistakes will never be fixed and he needs to find a proper way to live with that and be a better man. Being a great hero doesn\'t make you a great father. It takes more than that for redemption. 7/10. Endeavor carries this arc.MVA: This arc is boiled down to: ""Good, but not as good as it could\'ve been"". So much content cut out., Spinner\'s character was ruined, and the Toga fight was underwhelming. Way too many still shots, it just takes away a lot of the life that the arc could have had. The art was just average too. But the good? Oh, there\'s a good bit. Shigaraki was amazing in this arc. Easily turned into one of my favorite villains. His transformation into a complete monster was a blast to witness, and the Re-Destro fight was an absolute banger. The VA absolutely popped off. As for his backstory, perfection. Not too much censoring and the OST and pacing were great. The art that episode was pretty good as well.

Yes and HOW! Is the story childish? No, it unfolds in an immensely sinister way that is on par with the dark storytelling in DC and Marvel and is almost reminiscent of ""Invincible"" most of the time except for the fact that the protagonist has absolutely no development.Midoriya is getting stronger and is always training, all well and good. But by the fact that the story practically calls him a prophet and hero, I only...see him achieving things that are graspable anyway. He never has to take real defeats, nor does he have to rise above himself. He talks, motivates himself, and wins. That\'s the pattern the anime follows (school games aside, since it doesn\'t matter who wins there).This takes away a lot of momentum from the whole story, as Midoriya far outshines all the other characters, even Bakugo and Todoroki seem like real sidekicks compared to him.Add to that the unavailable pacing of this season and the badly mediocre animations, and we have the grand prize.So what does this season deliver in itself? Of course, it starts with another tournament at school, or rather the duel between class A and B... ah how interesting. But actually, I found round 1 and round 4 relatively appealing, due to their faster pacing and more flexible animations. Round 2 of Team Momo was a disaster, I almost fell asleep watching it. All the while, I\'m a fan of the show, so Rest in Piece for everyone else. Other than that, there was nothing worth mentioning there at all.The family drama around Endeavor was interesting, but it was severely damaged by the slow pacing. Not to mention the Shigaraki arc that came afterward. In the manga, this arc had been an extremely new breeze that took the plot in a different direction and showed what was developing behind the scenes and what the villains were hiding behind their personalities.In the anime, however, it was slow pacing combined with drawn-out scenes and completely boring fights. At least you saw the authentic backstories of some of the characters. But the anime adaptation is a disappointment.On the part of the characters, there was no largely big change, except that the villains became stronger after being confronted with their trauma and past.[Animation 5 / Music 6]The animations have been pure mediocrity, combined with atrocious pacing, poor adaptation, and some eternally long scenes. The only moments of brilliance were in the first fight between Class A and B. And... Tenya Ida. What did they do with him? This season he carried about 90% of the budget only on his back.Intro and outro are relatively average and nothing special. The osts are mostly the same, though they suffer from poor and bad placements. Whereas in seasons 1 and 2 the osts were always on-point to push a scene, here it was just the opposite.[Conclusion 4]And thus ends the current last season. As a manga insider, I can say that EVERYTHING that comes after this season is on a completely different level. However, the implementation of this depends on the studio and I have little hope after what seasons 3-5 have delivered.Either way, as a shounen fan who just wants to enjoy the series, this season has also entertained me very well.

The animation has taken a noticeable hit. Scenes that could have been far more beautiful look much more stilted and generic. Even my mother, who is not heavily into anime noticed the stark difference. I really hope this is due to COVID affecting the animation schedule and nothing more. Despite this, the animation is not bad by any stretch, just not living up to the standards of the previous seasons.Further disappointment hits when you realize the season is largely just set-up for future events. The main heroes spend the...first half of the season training and improving their abilities slightly and we see more of Midoria and Bakogo's friendship, but very  little in the way of plot or inter-character relationship progression. I was actually surprised in the finale that it was, in fact, the finale. Nothing really happens in it and it feels more like a summary of things that have happened this season than any kind of climatic throw-down we've come to expect.The major saving grace of this season, and the main reason this does not get an even lower score is due to the last half of the season. The Character development for many of the villain characters we've been following is very strong this season. While the development shall remain unspoiled here, it's not quite good enough to keep Boku no Hero Academia season 5 in the 8 range I would normally give it.In conclusion, season 5 has a noticeable decrease in quality in animation and feels much more like set up for season 6 than a season in its own right. Hopefully the setup will pay off in spades whenever the show returns in full form. first half of the season training and improving their abilities slightly and we see more of Midoria and Bakogo's friendship, but very  little in the way of plot or inter-character relationship progression.

I don't think it deserves too much hype, but there are redeemable qualities that I'm not sure deserve to be hated either. So, let's get into the details, shall we?[ Visuals - 8/10 ]While I wouldn't say that the art is consistent with the other seasons - maybe it's just me but it looks different - it is consistent with the rest of the season and, as per usual, it is clean and smoothly animated. I do believe there...are a couple slide-show moments here and there -- most series have a handful sprinkled in even when they aren't long running but are instead seasonal --, but most of it is well-animated and lively. So, visually, I have no real problems with the show. It's not particularly experimental, which is another reason why I wouldn't give it a perfect score, but in fairness, this is battle-shounen, it's never gonna deviate too far from the formula in any way. That said, reliability isn't so bad either. As always, characters are expressive - with Deku sometimes a little too much - and the action is relatively well-done but, again, as always, the fighting choreography isn't anything that'll blow the competition out of the water (but in fairness, that actually can be justified considering the fighters are young and are only training here), but it's solid and nothing too boring.The openings and endings aren't particularly stand out or experimental, but seeing little Hawks clutching his Endeavour toy, or the hawk flying off into the sky from behind does tug a little at the heart strings if you are fond of that character. Similarly, the second ending has that melancholic feel with the rest of the characters too, and there's some nice lighting at the beginning of the second opening that help craft the hype and I always enjoy the simplified coloured backgrounds... they give openings charm and make it stand out from the actual content of the anime. The first opening though... isn't really worth mentioning. It's really just parts of the anime and I find that a bit lazy when nothing is done with it to make it look cooler.  The first ending is actually pretty interesting colourwise, reminds me of another one in MHA...  The second ending is largely good at any part that is not dedicated to Class 1-A, which is kind of unsatisfying because that leaves part of it creative and melancholy, and part of it kind of boring, to be honest?---[ Sound - 7/10 ]The voice acting cast is good as always, be it in the Dub or the Sub, but I feel in some places it could probably have been more subdued or stronger...? Maybe it's just me though. Subtletly in voice acting is not something I hear much across the anime board though, so it's nothing to penalise an anime for more than I would any other. Soundtrack-wise, the soundtrack, while not the most memorable, is perfectly serviceable. The sound effects are functional, the backgroung music works, even though it's nothing stand out -- at least, imo - and the openings and endings are a mix of good, genuinely hype-inducing music and as well as some relaxed but not  particularly interesting tunes. The former of which features more in he second half of the season, whereas the latter occurs in the first half... you can tell which half will be more exciting just from that.---[ Plot/Pacing - 6/10 ]So, we do get a bit of My Villain Academia that prevents this from behind completely dull and uninspired. And we do get Hawks and Endeavour which are two characters that I'm starting to like more and more as the series progresses, despite Endeavour's less than savoury past, but honestly? The pacing of the training and just how uninspired it feels with the match ups and the choreography... it just feels like a rehash of the tournament arc if I am being completely honest. I'm also getting tired of Momo constantly getting shown up by everyone despite being a Class 1-A student that got in on recommendations, being someone who is smart and should, by all accounts, have a pretty hax quirk. Granted, this was a good way to intrudce us to some other quirks and foreshadow the skill levels of all characters prior to the big battle happening currently in season 6, but somehow the execution renders all of this way less cool than I believe this could have been. There is no real tension, I don't really see there being any stakes, the interactions seem to be missing something that the tournament arc seemed to have much more of... I just can't put my finger on it, and the fact that female characters are still not being properly developed or used in ways that would suggest this shounen still cares about it's female cast... it leaves me disappointed because this is a fairly new anime compared to some. This is all just a whole bunch of foreshadowing with little plot or development of any kind, which makes me think some of the training could have been cut away from and instead we could have had some episodes in between training episodes dedicated to something, /anything/ else. Particularly those things which would have driven the plot further or built on existing characters.And speaking of...---[ Characters - 7/10 ]When you're in an already fairly saturated category of shounen filled with beloved entries such as One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, etc... you're going to have to find some way of standing out. Black Clover already stole the idea of having faster pacing, to distinguish itself and, arguably, has funnier comedic beats, but many of its characters, whether good or bad, are based on stereotypes. This is where My Hero Academia could have come in. It already devotes more to its emotional beats because it chooses to have slower pacing, but those emotional beats won't be all that memorable or all that worth it without solid characters. Now, My Hero Academia already has some fairly solid characters, but given this is a new season, you would have thought it would either take those characters to the next level or develop other characters more... expand on their personalities, backstories, etc. And to some extent... it does do that. But given how /much/ time is given to these characters it is disappointing how little is actually done with them. 26 episodes of a seasonal anime and a slower paced series, and we get more on characters' powers than their personalities and what actually makes characters likeable to most of us, except for the small portion that only care about two dudes beating each other up. (And we didn't even really get much of that here, so even that isn't there to give this season much appeal.)It should also be noted that while some people like the villains in this show, I'm not exactly as sold as I was with the elves (in Black Clover) -- particularly after reveals had been made - in a certain friendly rival of a shounen, so I wasn't as entertained by them, but it was still a refreshing change up from the status quo.The only reason why this is a seven and not a five or lower is because I am biased and love Hawks far too much. Yes, Hawks makes this season at least 20% cooler, fite meh.---[ Enjoyment - 6/10 ]The season dragged and without my faves it would not have been worth watching, BUT there were nevertheless still enjoyable parts of it. And it didn't feel like I was wasting time, especially since I knew what followed would be a large fight. Besides, at least MHA has /some/ idea of stakes some of the and this was just building up to that, with both the villains and the heroes growing much stronger than they had been - with Shigaraki already being a menace.---[ Overall - 7/10 ]Would I watch this season again? Well, unless I had to analyse it, talk about it, or only watched those scenes that involved characters I already liked... then probably not. But it wasn't a complete waste of time, it wasn't totally boring and the characters and plot weren't all terrible. They were just a bit... subpar compared to the rest of MHA. Still, there was Hawks, Endeavour, Bakugo, Todoroki, Aizawa, Shinso, etc. and I don't dislike Momo or Ochaco, no I like them, I just wish more could have been done with them...As for whether I think you should watch it: feel free to skip it, but it may leave you confused at certain parts, so it's best to give it a shot. If you really can't, then just skip to season 6, I'm sure most of the important details will be filled in flashbacks anyway...And you can always ask those who have watched season 5. are a couple slide-show moments here and there -- most series have a handful sprinkled in even when they aren't long running but are instead seasonal --, but most of it is well-animated and lively.

Not by far, but noticably better.The characters, both protagonists and, more importantly, antagonists receive way more depth than I ever expected. I fell in love with certain characters.One character in particular has been handled really well this season, and simply deserves a mention: (SPOILER) Endeavour was really not that important previously. But his character, his themes, are unexpectedly complicated for a shonen. Which doesn't say too much compared to other genres, but I had to mention him.(SPOILER END)The story seemingly pics up a bit more than in...other seasons, which is always good.Focusing a bit on side characters is equally as good.I personally enjoyed Season 4 more, but I wholeheartedly believe this one is the best yet.If you haven't yet watched MHA and you like shonen, you are making a big mistake.Recommended, 7/10. other seasons, which is always good.Focusing a bit on side characters is equally as good.I personally enjoyed Season 4 more, but I wholeheartedly believe this one is the best yet.If you haven't yet watched MHA and you like shonen, you are making a big mistake.Recommended, 7/10."", ""Personally, I felt like the tournament arc near the start of the season was almost a complete waste of time. Some of the backgrounds where CGI, which I don't entirely hate when done right, and they did okay. The animation was actually pretty fluid in the arc, which is fairly common in My Hero Academia anyways. The addition of blackwhip to OFA was handled pretty well. Skipping forward, we have the My Villain Academia arc was alright, but in the worst way possible. I read a little bit of the arc in the manga to compare it, and I could already this was gonna be...decent at best. It almost reminds me of the Berserk movie trilogy.

I do agree with other individuals where they state the art and animation can be sometimes poorly executed, as it can be rather basic, but it truly does highlight the fights which are shown throughout, for example, the fight between Endeavor and Nomu, and the battle arc of ""My Villian Academia"".I truly still favor the soundtrack which is met along with the series whether it being a battle, conversation between characters - it does sync up quite well despite me not usually liking the action base series. Of course, there were certain characters that were primarily focused on - such as Midoriya once again, the Todoroki family, and Shigaraki. Izuku mainly for his quirk fundamentals, the Todoroki family backstory gave more depth to each member, giving Endeavor an ounce of humanity he seemingly did not hold before and an explanation on how Shigaraki landed where he is today, all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the current pace of each of them.In conclusion, the fifth season of Boku no Hero lived past my previous expectations of what I held before, due to this, I am thoroughly excited for the following series and to get onto the manga. growth to the side characters, and of course, an extension on Midoriya`s quirk as he has finally grasped control of it.

This arc was quite entertaining as we were able to see new quirks from class B. Honestly some of them have very strong quirks that made me question why they didn’t make it to class A. Even more, class A squad members learned their quirks more and many showed new techniques. I got even more hyped as Midoriya-shōnen explored more about his One for All. He’s becoming much more powerful. Overall, even though I wanted some fights to last longer and more class A members to...show more of their quirks, it was a pretty entertaining arc.Then the second arc was where stuff got real. The first part was a drama in one of the families. Things became more personal to the characters and I was more invested in the character developments. Then, I really enjoyed the My Villain academia part. The background of many characters were intense and sad, and the power that evolved from their trauma became more threatening. This arc was so much better and more refreshing because of how real and somewhat disturbing the story was.Overall, a pretty good and entertaining season. 7/10 show more of their quirks, it was a pretty entertaining arc.Then the second arc was where stuff got real. The first part was a drama in one of the families. Things became more personal to the characters and I was more invested in the character developments.

This is due to the odd decisions taken that made the show needlessly confusing, the show goes back and forth throughout a period of a couple of months instead of having a linear progression, this is not the one or two flashbacks the story has two main arcs and beggining of the first one is stuck at the end of the season, and as far as I can tell there is no good reason to do this. If you simply rearranged the episodes I would probably rate this an 8.In any...case the Liberation army arc/Tomura Shigaraki background story arc/Hawks arc (the one that is split in half) is ok, youy certainly feel like they are building up for season 6.

It was always going to be a pretty mellow season overall which was to be expected considering where the anime story is compared to the manga.The first half of the season focused on the class 1A vs 1B training rivalry and mixes things up by bringing back Shinsou from the tournament arc. The second half focuses on Endeavour, the Todoroki family and finishes with the League of Villains vs the Meta Liberation Front.As usual, the team at Studio Bones did a great job with the animation. I...can imagine they were quite relieved to see that the action was pretty minimal this season which unfortunately meant fewer iconic sakuga moments for us, but a bit more polish to some of the other scenes.There was a bit too much filler, none of which improved or expanded the story in any way which contributed to the season's sluggish pace in the second half.I enjoyed the dynamic between Deku, Bakugo and Shouto. Their personalities bounce well off each other and it's enjoyable to watch them working as a team. Endeavour was also a pleasure to watch as he struggles yet starts to learn what it means to be the no.1 hero.The best part of the season was left for last with the focus on the League of Villains. Shigaraki's back story is somewhat predictable but lines up well with the story and the world's overall theme.Also, Toga is back so this show gets an automatic 10/10.There's not a lot to say honestly. If you like Hero Academia and have read the manga then you knew this was going to be a chill season.

I\'ve personally didn\'t care for them until now. The only mistake was the poor encounter between Shihai Kuroiro and Fumikage Tokoyami and nerfing...Kirishima for no reason.• SECOND ARC - ENDEAVOR: The end of it was pretty wholesome. It\'s nice to see the family grow some affection and forgiveness over time, but the arc itself was completely useless. Filler arcs in this anime are really unnecessary. I wouldn\'t care for filler episodes (like the couple about Tsuyu Asui) here and there but a whole arc feels like a waste of time. I would\'ve spent more in the My Villain Academia and given one whole episode focused only on Hitoshi Shinsō\'s past and current training with Eraser Head. Plus, if they decide to create an arc about internships they should\'ve at least focus in all of them, not just the main characters\'.• THIRD ARC - MY VILLAIN ACADEMIA: Loved the change in the main title screen, but the execution of the arc was disappointing. They\'re supposed to become more powerful, but Dabi didn\'t evolve at all, neither did Mr. Compress and/or Spinner. Then, Twice\'s backstory was already explained so it\'s a waste of time to go in more flashbacks about it, Himiko Toga\'s was a bit worth it, and Tomura Shigaraki\'s was interesting but repetitive. We\'re shown the exact same moment of All for One reaching for him in an alley several times, which was not even a new scene for this season. This arc should\'ve been longer and have a better struture, \'cause it didn\'t have any at all.ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: only about the ones I can say something in particular about.• ĒJIRŌ KIRISHIMA: The tough guy got knocked out seconds into the battle, after everything he\'s been through... Makes no sense that he\'s out so easily, so yeah that battle should\'ve been way more interesting, specially after Denki grew some brains finally.• SHIHAI KUROIRO: Too immature, lacks creativity towards his quirk. That battle should\'ve been epic and hinted at it too, but wasn\'t.• KATSUKI BAKUGŌ: Made the most significant progress, he is one of the things I would save from this season.ABOUT THE OPENING SEQUENCE: 「NO. 1」 & 「MERRY-GO-ROUND」The first one is a total masterpiece, everything about it is spot on, so my congrats to DiSH for creating this. It relates to the anime by telling that everything that was accomplished by those ""No. 1"" people or heroes is never enough since our training heroes have to always look forward to surpass them no matter how hard it is to do so. The animation was fun to watch but a bit basic and didn\'t spoil anything from the actual plot (hints here and there are always appreciated).The second one, as a singer myself, I skipped this one. Everyone can learn how to sing and be amazing at it, but the performance in this one lack technique and feeling, plus again it wasn\'t fitting for the vocalist\'s color. The composition itself is pretty good though. And relates on how the professionals are strating to let the new heroes take over and be the ones that do the rescuing and fighting. And in this case the animation was really poor overall.ABOUT THE ENDING SEQUENCE: 「ASHIATO」 & 「USO JA NAI」The first one ""FOOTPRINTS"" was an odd choice, lyrically has almost nothing to do with the plot. The animation was mediocre, just a bunch of pictures that were too effortless. Most fanart artists would do a better job. If you are not going to animate anything, then you should really pull off some amazing visuals, and they didn\'t.The second one ""IT\'S NOT A LIE"" was a really emotional and clever choice. The song seems like if Izuku was talking to Tenko, telling him that he is not actually evil, he\'s just traumatized and influenced by the wrong people and that he is determined to save him from that pain.

During the last match, where Midoryia and Shinso face off again, Midoryia manifested another quirk from a previous One for All user and, even...though he could not control it initially, somehow saves him and helps him win the match. Afterwards, they have to go into work study because Hawks discovered that a 100,000 man army is ready to take over and the Heroes need to be prepared. Because they can not go to their previous work studies, Bakugo and Midoryia decide to join Todoroki and work under Endeavor. They are then invited to dinner with the Todoroki family where tensions are clearly high. Endeavor's other son is kidnapped by another villain and Endeavor hesitates to save him while the other three jump into action. Endeavor then says that he will atone by moving his family to a new home and he will live by himself. Once that was done, we move into My Villain Academia where it was just a mess since the writers decided to try and cram 20 manga chapters into 5 episodes. For context, the provisional license arc that was 23 manga chapters was developed into 11 episodes in the anime. As such, the arc tried to cram too much information into too little episodes giving us an unsatisfying and a bit rushed conclusion to that arc.I understand that there is some build up that is leading into season 6, but, I don't think it was handled well, I believe that they should've dedicated a whole half of the season to it and then pick up the work study at the start of the next season. Hopefully season 6 will show improvement, but, I do not like to see regression which is what I am seeing here.Overall: 5/10 though he could not control it initially, somehow saves him and helps him win the match.

(It is on my list of to reads tho.) It was kind of boring to me but I also loved the arcs represented in it. Again, as someone who hasn't read the manga, I would say this was pretty decent work done for the story going forth. If I did read the manga, I'm sure I would have a different opinion. One of my favorite arcs seen in this season was the Meta Liberation Arc. Seeing more screen time with how they work together was almost like seeing a...group of friends working together which is essentially what they are for each other. They consider themselves family and its cool seeing how much they care for each other. This doesn't mean that I didn't like any of the other arcs shown either. I liked the background for Aizawa and Yamada with their lost friend.

As for the reasons, it progresses very slowly compared to the manga and the arcs are skipped.While many fans say that season 6 was made to be better, that doesn't change the fact that season 5 was the worst. And it made me very sad that they continued the mistake they made. The mistake they make is converting a normally good section to an elephants section. I watch the anime every week hoping it gets better but it...doesn't seem to get any better. My only reason to watch is to see season 6.Overall : 6 doesn't seem to get any better. My only reason to watch is to see season 6.Overall : 6"", ""SPOILER WARNING:This season had so much hype last year, but thinking back on its entirety, this was the anime's weakest season yet. My Hero Academia season five had a hard time living up to the expectations from the previous season and had problems along the way. While it covered a few of the less interesting arcs, its timing with the new movie made it worse. But if you think about it differently, it's a buildup for what's going to happen in the future seasons in production.The plot of the fifth season leaves off with the cliffhanger that sensed season four of the anime and...continues from there. I still don't like how there's a filler episode every time a new season starts. Studio Bones seriously needs to break that cycle. Then, it begins with the Joint Training arc, which wasn't too exciting but gave Class 1-B their chance to shine, which I liked more than the actual arc itself. That arc also gave another character who hasn't had more major appearances since season two his chance for character development, making that arc focused on the character development of the students that aren't Class 1-A. Then there's the Endeavor agency arc. While it focused more on the Todoroki family's background, it was too flashback-heavy at times, not to mention it went by too slow at times. Those two arcs are one of my least favorite arcs in the whole series, but the fifth season also featured one more arc, the My Villain Academia arc, aka the Meta Liberation Army Arc. The focus on the villains was clever as not only it gave some of the major villains more character development, but it was an intense buildup for what will happen in the next season.The story continues off from the previous four seasons, but the theme of season five was the calm before the storm. While the fifth season shifted the arcs around to match the timing with the third movie, it continues to give the students of UA more time to show how far they've come since the beginning of their first year. While the Joint Training Arc didn't have many significant progressions to the story, but it was nice to have a calm arc after the amount of tension season four created. The same can be said for the Endeavor Agency arc, but there was a moment at one scene that foreshadowed how Endeavor himself will cause a dark turn, but that only made it even more eerily. Finally, the My Villain Academia arc is the best part of the entire season. The introduction of the Meta Liberation Army and their collaboration with the League of Villains changed our perspective on how we saw the villains in this series forever. In general, season five barely had any progressions to the story at all, but I still liked how it still had its impact the moment those parts came up, and whatever it foreshadowed was executed well. On a separate note, adding an unnecessary filler episode in the middle of the season was a bad movie. It would've been better as an OVA instead of an anime episode.The characters themselves had a lot of development, as a heavy theme for season five's primary focus. Once again, Deku has powered up his give quirk into something crazier than before. While he's slowly becoming overpowered, Deku's character development seems to have slowed down as the anime was more on his growing powers than anything else. While Class 1-A's development as heroes in the making was enjoyable, the anime shifted the focus to Class 1-B and Shinso. The Joint Training arc showed that Class 1-B is also improving on their quirks off-screen and how they're not minor characters anymore. While Shinso finally achieves his goal of becoming an official hero student, which I like that it foreshadows him making more appearances in the future. The Endeavor Agency arc focused on the titular hero himself. I admit, I still dislike Endeavor for his abusive personality in the past. But his redemption arc is still respectable, and it's exciting to see how he'll eventually redeem himself as the new Number one hero and as Todoroki's father. Despite a majority of the season being focused on the heroes' development, the villains themselves surprisingly also received that treatment. The main antagonist, Shigaraki stood out of all the villains. Not only did it show his gruesome backstory and gave him a power boost, his development as a villain is incredible as not a lot of anime villains get that type of treatment. His progression from a manchild to a destructive villain deserves respect as it builds up against the long-awaited battle between him and Deku. The other villains also had their power and character development, which I liked, however, the Meta Liberation Army there was interesting but didn't stand out as much as the League of Villains, but I loved their character designs.The animation seems to have decreased in quality, which is disappointing at times. There wasn't anything too exciting going on, except for a few moments where the animation quality got better. However, the pacing might've made the animation average. Most parts of the fifth season were either slow or rushed, but it barely covered anything interesting until the climax of season five. Hilariously, the animation's quality was detailed in an insignificant scene, which I found odd Bones would do that nicely over the other moments. It could've been better, but Bones had worked on other projects like Vanitas no Carte, which made it difficult to reach the animation quality from the previous seasons.The music in this season gave me mixed feelings. The first cour's opening No. 1 by DISH// was the calm before the storm as it had more of an inspirational theme to it as it played through the eighth opening. As for the ending Footprints by the peggies, it was the first time I've heard them sing for a non-romance anime after Bunny Girl Senpai and Rent-a-Girlfriend. The song itself was beautiful, but once you read the lyrics, it ties in with what's going on in the manga, which I won't explain in the future. However, the second cour's opening took a while for me to like. The ninth opening, Merry-go-round by Man with a Mission felt out of place with the tone the fifth season had, but it eventually grew on me. I loved their second opening for Vinland Saga, but the ninth opening didn't match the overall quality of My Hero Academia. The ending however was more emotion-based and sounds like the anime is leaving its calm nature and will get intense in the future.Overall, season five of My Hero Academia was the weakest season of them all. Not only was the pacing terrible, but the change in arcs order and animation quality seems to only made fans of the first four seasons drop the anime adaptation as a whole. For those who watched through the entire fifth season, we were blessed with more character development on both the heroes and the villains, and I think that deserves respect. Finally, the arcs weren't exciting but were also saved by a decently adapted villain arc, which barely did the anime its justice. However, the emotional aspect of this arc was also present, and it was as powerful as it was in the manga. If it weren't for the third movie, this would've been a better season, but there's nothing we can do about that. However, with season six in production, My Hero Academia will be changed forever with the foreshadowing of a major confrontation with the villains shown in the season finale. continues from there.

It wasn't much better reading this arc in the manga however it was a dynamic enough moment in the plot that I didn't feel restricted to just those moments.

Everyone was gassing her up for a supposed brilliant moment, which didn't happen and her team lost anyways. I thought she was a talented student, show me the proof lol.Nah, this season was lame. I feel as though most people would be better off without it.

The first season was pretty decent as I would probably give it an 8. However, the latter seasons were so forgettable that I don't even remember half of the things that happened in the story. There was a lot of filler and it was kinda boring to be honest. I felt like Deku just used the same move over and over again expecting it to work every time. He eventually does make a new move but it is extremely similar to what he had before. I feel like the story would be a lot better if they had...more uniqueness to the story line. Idk, that's just my opinion though. more uniqueness to the story line. Idk, that's just my opinion though."", 'Let\'s face it, if you\'re still here by this point then you are invested and you are just asking yourself one thing: ""Should I continue?""The answer is Yes.While this season almost seems intent on illustrating all of the worst parts of this show ad nauseum, it does actually improve later on in the season, and the following season is already looking to be much better. In other words, this season is a setup for the next one. Does that mean that you can skip it? Honestly, in the first or second episode of season 6, they give such a good recap of season 5 in...the first few minutes that I feel like you could watch that and probably know what\'s going on. So why is this season getting an overall rating of 7?The answer is tautology. If you like this show, then you like this show. If you don\'t like this show, then you don\'t like this show. This is getting to be a recurring and redundant theme of my reviews, but the preexisting fans of this show will probably still find ways to enjoy this season even if it\'s possibly the worst one so far. On the other hand, why would anyone who hasn\'t watched the previous 4 seasons watch this one? So you see my point, fans of the show will still defend this season and I choose to join them.The mixed feelings is obviously a result of what I stated, that this is probably one of the worst seasons so far. The character development has hit a brick wall at this point, despite Deku continuously telling us that so much has changed. The characters act like cult members most of the time, and the emotional scenes are ham-fisted and boring.What really saves this show has always been the villains. They get some pretty nice screentime later in the season, which is all that saves it in the end. Here is hoping the villains continue being awesome in Season 6, or this show will be nothing but cuteness and Bakugo screaming. the first few minutes that I feel like you could watch that and probably know what\'s going on.

Even if I take other aspects of this season into account, this season was quality wise very well made, and it wasn\'t boring for me at all (except episode 16 which I \'fast forward\' watched).I see positivity in DEKU, more than any other character in this show. For his personality, his kindness, his attitude, his dedication, his goal, his resolve, I admire him...and wish to be like him.The above quote (ep.25 --17:48) made me so pleasant, that even without supernatural powers, I like this guy for his positive attitude towards life.---------------------------------------------------------------------------LESS SIGNIFICANT :The vibe hasn\'t changed & this season felt the same as its prequels. More characters, more friendship, more villains, more actions. I am satisfied with this.-- Every season of BNHA have some spine chilling episodes, and this season has more of them ; like DEKU\'s outburst of power which he couldn\'t control, which was a memorable scene for me.-- Then there\'s also BAKUGO and his \'rude\' way of interacting with others which is kinda adorable.-- I liked seeing ENDEAVOUR as a character, his manliness, his wish for atonement,...-- ENDEAVOUR\'s tensed family situation eased up! DEKU helps TODOROKI realize his feelings which was really heartwarming.---------------------------------------------------------------------------HIGHLIGHTS of this SEASON :1. SHINSO2.

The entirety of it was packed with action to the brim, there were major story developments regarding one for all and the final few episodes were an all out battle. I started this a 10:40, checked the clock for the first time and suddenly it was 17:08....It felt like 2 hours had passed it was that good. I\'m actually pretty excited for the next season. with the way this season has been built it makes the next season seem like it will be even better and even more action packed but with high stakes. Season 3 was a low that led up to this season being great and this season is leading up to something that will be even greater.My review may be a little bias since like i said i had low expectations for this. ""keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed"" but that also means that they will be exceeded far easier and make something out to be greater than it actually was.

A part of me can understand; the first arc is a lot of training and character development. But I really enjoyed it!

And that theme song makes me feel like if I work hard I can accomplish anything.In my opinion it was the second arc I was less of a fan of.

These are fun, short comedic skits between the cast and they make for a good and wholesome time. Although they are heartwarming, that's all there is to this.

Not that I don\'t like them. I just prefer said chibi episodic series\' main series, that\'s all. I was worried ""Sousou no Frieren: Marumaru no Mahou"" would be just another mediocre series, created for the sake of just existing alongside the main anime (in this case: ""Sousou no Frieren""). I was wrong. It\'s a solid chibi episodic anime.There are 12 episodes, each one dedicated to a different magic spell. What all of them have in common is being just short...and cute way to show funny gags happening between various characters from Sousou no Frieren. They naturally fit into the main series\' storyline, expanding it a little in a wholesome way. I like if such series go that way. Explaining things that did not appear in the main series is cool and always welcome, sure, but I don\'t think using funny chibi short stories is a good way to do it.The art is simple, the characters look chibi, and the animation isn\'t as good as in the main series... And that\'s perfectly fine. The audiovisual side of this anime is balanced and fits its general atmosphere. All characters look like good chibi caricatures of their official designs known from ""Sousou no Frieren"", and the animation is good enough to work as a tool for making gags or certain scenes look rather pleasant to one\'s eyes.In short, ""Marumaru no Mahou"" is a nice and fun way to spend several minutes of your time. While it\'s not obligatory to be watched in order to have better experience coming from watching the main series, I think that it\'s worth giving it a try, especially if you are a huge fan of ""Sousou no Frieren"". and cute way to show funny gags happening between various characters from Sousou no Frieren.

It\'s nice little heartwarming skits with little on the animation side. Stuff like this just shows how much they enjoyed the character interactions so much they had to make a little b-sides adventures thing. The other guy said there\'s no ""quality here"" but they\'re nuts. While it is true this isn\'t a standalone anime it is still of great quality. Even though the style is very simplified it still conveys great expressiveness and attention to the details that matter. In addition, each episode is only a little over a minute, so they...never overstay their welcome or overuse a joke. The only criticism I have is that it\'d be annoying in the future for a new viewer to know when to watch a given episode considering they\'re being released alongside the anime and as such feature characters that are present at that time in the main anime. I suppose you could just look at air dates for each episode but then that just adds a layer of tedium to what should just be a cute shorts series which is why I\'m rating it lower than the main anime. never overstay their welcome or overuse a joke.

I would always consume the latter with a dissatisfied expression and a hardened core. But alas, this cute and bite-sized series of shorts came by me.

However, if not, then I have so many questions for you starting from what even got you on this page to begin with.Countless popular shows come with this type of special like...some late wave of marketing and keeping the hype alive for more potential profit later, they all pass off as generic, filler that's just plain boring and slow. However, once a red moon, (or is it a blue moon? Pick your color) comes a special drop of shorts that really do sell a unique vibe, and this one is one of the best ones I've seen in recent memory.Cute Chibi animation, hilarious dialog, and short delivery made the watch feel like such a breeze that it wouldn't have hurt to have a dozen more episodes.
