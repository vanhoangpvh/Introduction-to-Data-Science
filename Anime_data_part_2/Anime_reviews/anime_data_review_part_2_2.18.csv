Kui Cheng Shoufu Cong Youxi Kaishi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/57663/Kui_Cheng_Shoufu_Cong_Youxi_Kaishi,"['Losing Money to Be a Tycoon presents a fascinating twist on the typical rags-to-riches narrative, it offers a captivating journey through the unconventional world of Pei Qian, an ordinary office worker thrust into an extraordinary situation, back to a time when he was still a broke college student . With its blend of humor, strategy, and unexpected challenges, this donghua kept me engaged throughout the series.At its core, the series explores the age-old adage of ""money makes money"" but with a clever and unexpected twist. Instead of striving for profit, Pei Qian finds himself navigating a world where success is measured by losses. This...premise sets the stage for a series of hilariously inventive schemes as Pei Qian grapples with the paradoxical task of intentionally losing money without breaking the “Fortune Conversion System’s” rules.The quirky ensemble of characters drives the show\'s humor through their dynamic interactions and the unintended consequences of their actions. Pei Qian finds himself perpetually thwarted by his overly competent and loyal team. His frustrations and schemes set the stage for much of the comedy. The characters\' genuine care for each other and their boss and their collective misinterpretation his true goals create a comedy of errors that is both amusing and endearing.Visually, Im impressed with its vibrant animation and expressive character designs. The series strikes a perfect balance between comedic exaggeration and grounded realism, creating a world that feels both fantastical and relatable. Each episode is filled with clever visual gags and subtle details that give off additional layers of humor and depth.I will say, it does get somewhat repetitive at some point in the series, but its comedic aspect has never failed to make me crave more. As someone who enjoys comedy, entrepreneurship, and all things gaming I found this donghua to be incredibly light and entertaining. DO NOT let the first episode deter you, it is the only episode where I felt slightly confused. After the first episode the mood shifts from ""information dumping"" to ""lighthearted comedy"" . premise sets the stage for a series of hilariously inventive schemes as Pei Qian grapples with the paradoxical task of intentionally losing money without breaking the “Fortune Conversion System’s” rules.The quirky ensemble of characters drives the show\'s humor through their dynamic interactions and the unintended consequences of their actions.

After the first episode the mood shifts from ""information dumping"" to ""lighthearted comedy"" .', 'Losing Money to be a Tycoon is a regression series where Pei Qian, who is stuck in a dead-end developer job, travels back 10 years to his university days and is granted a special power. In many series, this power would be a game changer in the regressor\'s life, but in Losing Money to be a Tycoon, it becomes a struggle and forces Pei Qian to stay on edge daily to meet his quota governed by this special \'system\'. As the story progresses, the stakes become higher as Pei Qian\'s company unintentionally grows to an insurmountable level thanks to his \'bad\' business decisions. Will Pei...Qian satisfy the conditions of the system, or will he fail his quota and be locked out from the system?Story & Characters: 7/10I\'m convinced this series exists out of pure spite against all the trashy tycoon regression system manhua that exist and also the game studio start-ups run by Gen Z. Losing Money to be a Tycoon doesn\'t fit the bill as your generic regression system donghua, which makes this series a breath of fresh air. Pei Qian focuses on the next \'big\' thing and tries to make it as worse as possible so that he can reap the benefits of failure from the system. With each project he works on, Pei Qian takes as many shortcuts and terrible design decisions to ruin the chances of success but ends up with fanatics following his every move. This style of development, although repetitive, is a recipe for great comedy, and it does not fail with its over-the-top colorful character reactions, outlandish internal monologue, and absurd character dialogues. Apart from the story, the characters are fairly shallow in depth compared to Pei Qian, but they aren\'t the main focus in this particular series anyway.Art & Sound: 6/10The art isn\'t too bad in quality; the animation is very poor and, in some cases, feels more like slideshows because only the mouth is moving - literally just the mouth is moving back and forth between two or three frames. The colors are more on the vibrant side, and they even use gradients and shading to a good degree on characters, so it\'s understandable why the animation is tanking. I am more than satisfied with the visuals since this isn\'t a series where action scenes are needed, and there isn\'t much importance in character movement apart from video games/close-up shots.The background music is very iconic; there is always a single theme song playing whenever Pei Qian makes a business decision that is very soothing to listen to when he breaks down his ideas for the next big thing. The voice acting is fairly decent but not high quality by any means, and the same can be said for the sound effects and music; they are very limiting in terms of variety and suitability.Overall & Enjoyment: 6/10I enjoyed this series for what it was, a light-hearted comedy with no unique plot or characters, and you should too. What they could have improved on is character development/retention; There were some very interesting characters throughout the series that were thrown out once they were done with satisfying the story. I think this is where it fails in comparison to series like ""Saiki-K"" which maintains its character connections throughout. Overall, it was a decent comedy series with a lot of entertainment factor behind it and even more potential to grow from season 1.

Kaleido Star: Aratanaru Tsubasa - Extra Stage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/428/Kaleido_Star__Aratanaru_Tsubasa_-_Extra_Stage,"['Have you ever measured yourself to someone else and felt inferior in comparison? Have you ever thought to yourself that, no matter what extremes you;d undergo, you’d never surpass your peers? Maybe it’s something small, like your neighbor Peter having more trophies on his PS4 account than you. Maybe it’s something big, something colossal, something life-altering, something that overpowers you mentally and emotionally. Whatever the case, an inferiority complex can be destructive to your well-being. You doubt yourself. You ridicule your own aspirations. Your engulf your mind with feelings of worthlessness. In the end, you longingly gaze at your peer’s monumental accomplishment before settling for...a second-rate replication of what they’ve achieved.That said, the Kaleido Star OVA has an inferiority complex.The original series integrated explosive, illuminating, all-consuming fervency with sophisticated, soul-searing psychological drama. It explored an array of ideologies and thematic elements while maintaining an aura of carefree innocence. It interweaved a melange of literary references, some blatantly obvious and others deceptively subtle, into the individual arcs of its characters, enhancing the cast as a whole. It presented each episode as something essential to the overall story and it always ensured that each episode would be notable in its own fashion. It was marvelously entertaining, structurally outstanding, and near-perfect in every facet. It was so for virtually all of its 51 episode run. In short, Kaleido Star showcased some impossibly high standards for the OVA to achieve.Whether or not the OVA reached the original series’ expectations depends entirely on how you feel about Rosetta (voiced by Serena Varghese). In the original series, Rosetta was an aspiring circus performer with prodigious talents that viewed Sora Naegino (Kaleido Star’s lead) as both a role model and a friend. Good-natured and charitable yet incredibly stubborn at times (almost as much as Sora), Rosetta came across as a likable character, if more than a bit generic. Sure, she possessed a few highlights (namely her staged showdown with Sora in her first appearance) and she performed fairly well as the centerpiece of a few episodes but at no point did you think that Rosetta could be the star of the show. After all, there have been plenty of occasions where someone else outshined her as a character,You can’t condemn me for being surprised at Rosetta headlining an OVA all by her lonesome.“Does Rosetta do well in this OVA?” you might ask. Well, I have to say that while ther are new layers to her personality that are introduced, it’s ultimately not enough to justify Rosetta being the OVA’s protagonist. The other characters fare no better. While the original series provided nuance, purpose, and development to its cast, the characters here are given barely visible slivers of screen time, tossed aside like a ragdoll in humiliating fashion. Leon Oswald, a tortured man of mystery, the infamous “God of Death”, Kaleido Star’s ultimate Byronic Hero, is briefly seen twisting his body in an unnatural position and uttering indecipherable noises while iconic characters like Layla Hamilton, Kalos, and Yuri Killian are resigned to a few meager lines. Outside of Rosetta, the only cast members that (sort of) matter are May (her sole contribution is criticizing Rosetta), the Fool (I’ll get to him later), and Sora. Excluding Rosetta, she contributes more than anyone else but ultimately Sora’s impact is hardly worth remembering.In the technical areas, the Kaleido Star OVA is a reasonable resemblance of the original. Its color palette is as dynamic as ever and the backgrounds are unsurprisingly stellar. Musically speaking, it’s a joy to listen to (The opening “Blanc et Noir” is particularly soothing). However, it’s not enough to compensate for the OVA’s shoulder shrug of a storyline. The plot is centered on Rosetta’s emergence as Kaleido Stage’s leading lady as well as the Fool’s backstory. While the OVA presents a few glimpses into the fan favorite’s past, it’s ultimately not enough to be compact. From what I’ve gathered, the Fool was a court jester in the Middle Ages that was driven to erase the sadness of his lover (a Rosetta look-a-like princess). For some reason, the Fool was forcibly separated from the princess and wasn’t able to fulfill his mission. What could’ve been a fantastic plot element is marred by a lack of developing anything beyond that point as well as an inability to create a resolution.“Cop-out” is the perfect word to describe the Kaleido Star OVA. It doesn’t care about characterization. It doesn’t care about a storyline. It doesn’t care about endings (The spiderweb scene (a classic deus ex machina moment) and the jarring conclusion is proof of this). It doesn’t care, period. To claim that this OVA falls short of the original series’ brilliance would be a glorious understatement. “The Amazing Princess Without a Smile” is deprived of so many positive qualities that a smile is the last thing it needs to worry about. a second-rate replication of what they’ve achieved.That said, the Kaleido Star OVA has an inferiority complex.The original series integrated explosive, illuminating, all-consuming fervency with sophisticated, soul-searing psychological drama.

If you look very very very closely you will see a lot of camera angles you have not seen before in the Anime. You can just look at the Opening and you will notice it. It's not about Kaleido Star anymore. It's about the sexualisation of the female characters in this OVA. Somehow the characters lost their usual feeling and I see a lot of people doing extremely strange things that are over the top or not so in character. The characters feel...used, not brought into the episode normally. And somehow the female body parts are very, very emphasized, even with Rosetta. The actual performance at the end is not even important. What the heck. You will get what you can get from 1000 other Anime this time. Boobs, ass, legs, and yeah the, don't do that with the male cast. This episode really disappointed me and is a disgrace for Kaleido Star. The directors should be ashamed. used, not brought into the episode normally. And somehow the female body parts are very, very emphasized, even with Rosetta.

Meng Qi Shi Shen: Huanxi Zhui Hun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51203/Meng_Qi_Shi_Shen__Huanxi_Zhui_Hun,"['I am a super-fan of the gourmet genre and try to watch all gourmet anime. It\'s a mixed bag. There are some older ones that really teach you about food, like Oishinbo, some that teach you how to cook and others are slice of life with some degree of cooking thrown in. The 3rd category describes this donghua. Honestly this anime is a solid 7/10 until the last episode which is an amazing 20/10 it elevates the entire season.The premise: a talented chef accidentally poisons herself. She is sent back in time to ancient China, waking up in the body of a woman who has...been kidnapped on her wedding day by bandits and set to marry a bandit lord! Unbeknownst to her the bandit ""Lord"" is actually an imperial prince spying on the bandits. Shenanigans ensue, with our heroine using her cooking skills to get herself out of many predicaments. I don\'t know about you, but if I lived in ancient times and someone came along who could make DELICIOUS food, I will admit I might also be easily bribed.Seasons 1 and 2 follow the same formula - an issue or misunderstanding, cooking fairy transformation, reveal of fantastic food, everything ends well. It\'s predictable but charming as we travel around China with the protagonist, watching her marvel at things and managing to cook food even when there are seemingly no ingredients worth eating. The mostly nice characters are wholesome, the music is lovely, the art is beautiful and all the food looks mouth watering. Everything is done well, as I said a solid 7/10.Then today I watched the last episode and to say it is a masterpiece of an episode is under-selling it. This episode is one of the best, most satisfying, conclusions to an anime I\'ve ever watched in 30+ years. Everything that I, as a viewer, wished for, they gave me. Food, Family, Friendship, Love. That. And more. This is the ultimate in Wish-Fulfillment (at least for a whole demographic of women). This had one of those ""spoil the market"" scenes that I\'ll remember for a long time after.  The enjoyment factor of this episode was so great, I had to add +1 to the 7 rating making this a 8/10.I am not joking when I say I cannot think of the last time I watched an anime finale this satisfying that at the end I was going awww, aaah and sighing in bliss.

In there She must survive war and others. Then She found a good man which is fallen in love with Her. The only one that She can do is cook. Almost all of the episodes are about cooking, so you're gonna watch a lot of food that has been cooked by Her. In this 3rd season, there will be a new character and you will see a legendary food competition...in the last 2 episodes.Art (9)The art of this anime is very good. I love the cooking and battle scene that they were using to make this anime. Not only that, but the food art they make are very nice and vibrant.

Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne,https://myanimelist.net/anime/142/Kamikaze_Kaitou_Jeanne,"[""A mahou shoujo show, a genre that might interest some, and chase off pretty much everyone else. KKJ might not give us any new spins in this highly niche genre, we can't help but love it anyway?StoryKKJ doesn't exactly provide anything ground breaking story-wise. It's standard mahou shoujo material. Like many other thieves you may find in other anime, Jeanne oddly enough tells the police beforehand she actually plans to steal something, and magically completes her missions successfully, foiling the police each time. While there is an obvious plotline, majority of the anime is fairly episodic. It follows a monster of the week pattern, so...each week (or should I say each episode) Jeanne seals another artwork, normally helping non-returning characters that have problems most likely due to the demons. The second half has the plot picking up, with new (and returning) antagonists as well as development of the romance between the two main characters. It's fairly standard, but interesting enough if you don't mind standard to begin with.AnimationUnfortunately, the infamous reused transformation scene is used in KKJ, and is quite frankly an annoyance to watch after the first time. Animation is also reused a lot when it comes to the demon sealing. The animation is bright and colorful, and this being based off a manga by Tanemura Arina of course means awesome character designs, at least for the thieves' costumes. An irritating number of still screens are also often used in KKJ, detracting enjoyment at times, simply because nobody likes to stare at a still screen when something else could be done. Anyhow, if you're looking for amazing animation, look no further, because it certainly isn't here.SoundNothing too special can be found from sound either. The opening and endings are fairly catchy, although perhaps a more slow song would have been more fitting for the first ending. Background music is quite forgettable, but at least there's nothing that ruins the scenes, proving that the BGM does its job. Voice acting is fairly satisfying, with Maron's VA doing an excellent job showing her strength, will and loneliness. Fin Fish's VA, while befitting her role, is fairly annoying to listen to however, probably due to the extremely high pitch.CharacterKKJ's characters would have to be its strongest point. Most of the characters develop throughout the series, especially the leads. Maron is a seemingly happy person, but behind it all is one who suffers from extreme loneliness. Chiaki is a somewhat trouble male who has a reluctance in engaging in any serious romantic relationship with another girl. The developing romantic relationship between her and Chiaki is pretty much the highlight of the show for the romance lovers, but it's quite predictable from the start how it would all turn out. There's more to Miyako then what appears at first, with this and the history behind some of the antagonists, make up for a fairly interesting cast of characters.Did I like it?If you're wondering whether I actually enjoyed Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, I didn't really. I'm a fan of the manga and thought the drama especially portrayed in it was brilliant. I was disappointed when I saw the anime had taken the mahou shoujo approach, with long and tedious transformation scenes, and pointless clashes between Jeanne and the police. I also hate monster of the week setups, as they prove to be far too boring and repetitive.OverallOverall, Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne is your everyday mahou shoujo. Complete with transformation scenes, flashy (and unrealistic) action, and a bit of romance here and there. Take that with some of the drama and twists presented in the show, an interesting cast of characters, and we have an anime the mahou shoujo lovers could waste their lives on for a while. each week (or should I say each episode) Jeanne seals another artwork, normally helping non-returning characters that have problems most likely due to the demons.

The manga have a better ending, though the anime already have a happy ending(i meant it you...are not new to anime you pretty much know all this kinds of anime leads to happy ending) but the manga ending is like even more happy or something?If you watch both, you will get a very detailed backstory for each main character.art : 10/10the art is PERFECT. it is so shoujo-ish, its exactly for girls. Now i would say that the manga actually have better art than the anime but... the anime\' transformation is awesome. so this anime is tittled \'kamikaze kaitou jeanne"",and you can kinda guess that it have somethings to do with theives. The main characters actually go through a transformation, which involve flashy lights and lots of turning and stuff. But in the manga its kinda dull, there\'s not really the process for transformation, like poof the girl has changed.sound : 9/10The sound i great, but its like average... there\'s no really good points and there\'s no bad points either...Character : 9/10the characters are awesome, there\'s a lot of backstory given for the girl, and a little for the guy. they have strong personality and there\'s so much of character development. But you know you can never have too much. Now in the manga, there\'s is more backstory given to fin fish. So it\'s best to read both manga and anime.Overall : 8/10i know it will be 9/10 if i don have a preference over what kinds i like, so it\'s just something personal. are not new to anime you pretty much know all this kinds of anime leads to happy ending) but the manga ending is like even more happy or something?If you watch both, you will get a very detailed backstory for each main character.art : 10/10the art is PERFECT. it is so shoujo-ish, its exactly for girls.

I love stories with adventure, fantasy, romance, drama, and especially comedy. This anime pretty much has it all. The characters are probably the best part about this show. They really know how to make you laugh and cry at the same time. I loved the romance between the two main characters, getting to see their relationship blossom was my favorite part about the anime.  The art style was never my favorite, however, after a few episodes I actually grew to really like the style the anime was drawn in. It\'s very unique, and it fits well. The story...is great as well, my only complaint is that it\'s a bit repetative. On multiple occasions I found myself thinking, ""I feel like they\'ve used this same clip for the same scene in at least 10 of their episodes"". None the less, I just laughed it off and enjoyed what the rest of the episodes had to offer. I would definitely reccommend this anime if you\'re a fan of sailer moon and other magical girl animes.

I love the plotline, and the characters have great personalities.The story and progress of the story is a little slow in the beginning, but Maron's past and her slowly evolving bond with Chiaki managed to keep me interested. Of course, her adventures as Kaitou Jeanne and the adorable Fin Fish, as well as the mystery around Kaitou Sinbad and Access rope you in as well.The second season is when this story really starts to get amazing, in my opinion. You start to learn more about Jeanne d'Arc herself, Maron and...Chiaki become closer, and the drama gets more intense as it progresses as you learn more about Maron's parents.

I don't understand why some people say that this anime is for kids. I think everyone can watch and enjoy this one. Honestly I believe that this is the best anime story ever. Of course there are some things that I don't like, Chiaki and Maron became too quick lovers, I think it would be better if Maron hated him a lot, and than got closer, that's actually the only thing that annoys me. Because Maron is a servant of god and Chiaki the servant of de the devil. I think if Maron wanted to kill him...it would make more sense, maybe that's why some people call this anime ''for kids'' because some things do not make any sense, but that's just one thing because this anime is still amazing and I think everyone needs to see it. it would make more sense, maybe that's why some people call this anime ''for kids'' because some things do not make any sense, but that's just one thing because this anime is still amazing and I think everyone needs to see it."", ""*Note- I've only seen about ten episodes, the first few and some random ones scattered among the seriesI went into this with high expectations...

It doesn't hold a candle to the manga. The story somewhat follows the plot of the manga, but it stretches it and adds to many unnecessary things that just don't seem to fit.

It taught me how to be strong and not be afraid of the mean people out there, not be afraid of not being accepted by the society, it helped me to know that if you want to get things in life, you\'ve got to be annoying like heck and get into people\'s heads! Before, I was a shy girl and was afraid of my own friends, which for some reason had recently happened this year. Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne helped me realize the strength I had accidentally let go inside of myself and this is why:Story:The...story was very original. The usual mangas and animes are all the same and based off of one story a mangaka had written. Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne was not like that and was a completely new flavor. I don\'t want to spoil the story, so I cannot get into the details completely well, but hehe, the anime fans out there should watch it if they want a great story that\'s not only romantic but it has great fantasy and good action (not the icky kind!), comique comedy (heh, to add more to the French!), all with a wonderful plot line!Art:The art was very interesting for the era of time. I am guessing Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne had came from around the 90s, so the graphics were pretty outstanding for that decade. The characters were actually more beautiful than what you\'d find in the usual and boring animes, if you can say that counts for art! It is known though that I always pay more attention to the story than the art, but this time, it was fun to look at both!Sound:BEST CHARACTER VOICES EVER AND I DON\'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THAT! The boys in usual animes always have an arrogant tone and the girls always sound so weak or if they are strong, they sound really violent with lots of muscles, but in this anime, it was just right! The main character, Maron did not sound weak nor too strong and Chiaki, the main boy did not have an arrogant voice, nor a sweet voice, he had a... well, I can\'t really explain it, but he had a wonderful tone! The production must have chosen carefully for the voice actors.Character:I think these are my favorite characters. Maron is strong, but not the boring ""I don\'t need any help strong"", Maron never backs down but is also friendly and can trust others and uses that to build her power. Maron is my role model, my idol, I aim to be like her in life! She is always positive and knows that even if she feels sorrow at one period of time, she knows that that\'s only releasing emotions and helps her become stronger by learning from her mistakes. Chiaki is also impressive as well. He is not those common annoying persistent players, nor is is a kind boy with a serious attitude, nor is he the arrogant jerk. Chiaki is something else that someone needs to know when they spot him in the anime. He has kindness and is a joker, but he doesn\'t overdo things. He has a serious side to him as well, but not those common types of ""seriousness"" you see in every anime. You\'ll know when you see him.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this anime since it was not just entertaining, but it also provided a learning experience for me like I had talked about in the very beginning. The drama was precise and perfect, there was not too much like watching Spanish dramas on Telemundo (I\'m not saying their bad, actually, some of them are kind of nice to watch), nor was there a boring amount like the common animes you would find nowadays. It was just perfect, truly perfect, nothing could be improved, not even those annoying characters now and then, you would even fall in love with the annoying characters (which are not really annoying, they just are... funny?).

Unfortunately, it feels like Chiaki is really just a side character in the anime and he's not there very often. It also takes...forever for Maron to learn that Chiaki and Sinbad are the same person and I think that just hinders the relationship that gets built. Weirdly in episode 33 at only about 8 minutes in, Maron says she can't trust him lately- this is weird because at no point in the show has he given her a reason not to be trustworthy. It feel like the creator was running out of time to finish the story and these last 10-15 episodes were rushed with information just randomly thrown in to relate it back to the manga.The Zen arc also felt forced and rushed. There was no character development and somehow he randomly already knew who she was and ugh. I am glad that he got to see his parents though!

Just like the anime, visuals and sound were on point, I think the fight scenes were well drawn and quite flashy. Basically every scene had its own sound track that matched it very well. I felt like the movie was a little rushed and the story was kind of loosely put together. There were things that didn't make sense in terms of relevance to the plot. I feel that the way that the movie was put together, there wasn't a balance in terms of fighting and plot development. Just like the anime, there was a lot of...explanation before any action could take place. Overall, it was alright. explanation before any action could take place. Overall, it was alright."", ""Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is one of the more popular Light Novel series to have come out within the past decade or so, spawning an anime adaptation by Studio Madhouse in 2014.That anime was also a gigantic piece of shit.Thankfully, this movie isn't so bad.That isn't to say this was a good or even passable film, however. It still suffers from flat characterization, holes and leaps in logic, pacing issues, and a major switch from one major object being a threat to another, with the first object being ignored entirely after the halfway mark, among other problems. It feels like a short filler arc...of the show, though thankfully issues carried from the show are largely subdued.Visually, the movie is passable. For one, they fixed the lighting issue to a decent extent, now I don't have to squint to avoid my eyes being set on fire from the needlessly bright lighting effects. The artstyle is as bad as ever though, and the CGI is both horrible and prevalent. The fights and overall magic were pretty bad as well. At the very least, we got to see characters in a variety of fashionable uniforms outside of their school attire, which was thankfully absent throughout the film. Studio 8bit, while doing a mediocre job by anime film standards, still has a far more visually appealing product that the original, which is the long and short of it all.Taku Iwasaki returns as the composer of the music for the film and it was far superior to his work on the show. There were two moments where the music did not fit the scenes, including a happy piano track halfway and an awful dubstep song during the big magic fight sequence near the start of the third act. The rest of the tracks sounded perfectly fine, with one vocal track near the beginning being probably the best in the movie, if not for GARNiDELiA doing another stellar performance with the ED song “SPEED STAR”. This is already a far cry from the amount of terrible tracks and times where the music does not fit the scenes in the original TV series. These audiovisual improvements did fix major gripes I had with the original to the point where it almost felt unfair as part of any enjoyment this film provided was fixing mistakes that should've never happened to begin with.Unfortunately, that's where any relative positives end, as the film is still a mess. There is this important character named Angelina, who has important relations with much of the relevant cast from the show. However, she wasn't in the TV anime and the film doesn't even establish their connection and instead assumes we already know, despite the fact that a large fraction of the audience of this film are only familiar with the anime, potentially leaving the viewer incredibly lost. Two groups of characters effectively on the same side fight to the death because they're too stupid to explain what is going on, and one of them named Siegfried has some sort of bad blood with Leonheart, that again, is not established in this film, leading to the exact same problems as with Angelina. There is a character who only exist to be an obnoxious sadistic psychopath knife-wielder for the sake of such a character trait, and he disposed of by an enemy who should be an ally hit because both sides are stupid they don’t communicate that they have the exact same goal and should be working in tandem to stop the big threat of this movie. As for the characters we’re already familiar with, they are still immensely flat and dry, and some characters don't really have a reason to be in the film due to sheer irrelevance, such as Mikihiko. This isn't entirely the film’s fault, as the 2014 anime showcased them as worthless garbage anyway, and oddly enough, the women largely feel the same in this film, not even feeling like individual character tropes like in the show proper. Thankfully, the worst aspects of the main sibling pair are subdued due to the limited runtime, however, they are still as generic and dull as ever, if not nearly as infuriating.There is this asteroid that is threatened to be in a collision course with the Earth, and this is established as the main threat due to scientists. However, that gets dropped halfway through the film with no resolution and instead it gets replaced by this satellite the researches were trying to move for some unexplained reason. Unfortunately, given that not many people have seen this film and this review is written without spoilers, I cannot go into further detail, nor can I explain any of the other problems with this film that require spoilers. However, there are a few that can be listed here, such as the sheer lack of subplots, the fact that it took Mayumi so long to realize that her plane was taken by her friends and that there was an important passenger with them (it took a day), the lack of consistency regarding magic being used with or without codes (since it has been established you need to use magic codes to use any form of magic), and that the scientists have no motivations for their actions beyond a one-off line of dialogue about the Navy accepting them. We aren't even made aware of their plans. Lastly, it turns it that some of the character graduated, but Tatsuya is the same age and no one has reportedly aged. This could also explain why Erika is somewhat of a different character than before, but then we’d have missed important character development; not like the series could even attempt such a thing.Ultimately, while this film was a considerable improvement from the 2014 Madhouse anime, it is still a lackluster film without much of an engaging narrative and a sheer lack of decent characterization, as well as an inheritance of some of the series’ major problems, even if it does attempt to at least subdue issues involving the production, the main duo, and the lack of cohesion with the music and the scenes back then. The third arc is where most of these issues come to a head, turning a movie that would have otherwise been classified as “so ok it's average” into a bewildering mess that just happens to be an improvement. Even fans of the anime could get confused as to what’s going on regarding certain characters, which is a large issue. You could say this review is damning with faint praise, but that’s the best thing this lackluster film deserves. Regardless, with all that said, I bid you adieu. of the show, though thankfully issues carried from the show are largely subdued.Visually, the movie is passable.

The artstyle is as bad as ever though, and the CGI is both horrible and prevalent. The fights and overall magic were pretty bad as well. At the very least, we got to see characters in a variety of fashionable uniforms outside of their school attire, which was thankfully absent throughout the film. Studio 8bit, while doing a mediocre job by anime film standards, still has a far more visually appealing product that the original, which is the long and short of it all.Taku Iwasaki returns as the composer of the music for the film and it was far superior to his work on the show. There were two moments where the music did not fit the scenes, including a happy piano track halfway and an awful dubstep song during the big magic fight sequence near the start of the third act. The rest of the tracks sounded perfectly fine, with one vocal track near the beginning being probably the best in the movie, if not for GARNiDELiA doing another stellar performance with the ED song “SPEED STAR”. This is already a far cry from the amount of terrible tracks and times where the music does not fit the scenes in the original TV series. These audiovisual improvements did fix major gripes I had with the original to the point where it almost felt unfair as part of any enjoyment this film provided was fixing mistakes that should've never happened to begin with.Unfortunately, that's where any relative positives end, as the film is still a mess. There is this important character named Angelina, who has important relations with much of the relevant cast from the show. However, she wasn't in the TV anime and the film doesn't even establish their connection and instead assumes we already know, despite the fact that a large fraction of the audience of this film are only familiar with the anime, potentially leaving the viewer incredibly lost. Two groups of characters effectively on the same side fight to the death because they're too stupid to explain what is going on, and one of them named Siegfried has some sort of bad blood with Leonheart, that again, is not established in this film, leading to the exact same problems as with Angelina. There is a character who only exist to be an obnoxious sadistic psychopath knife-wielder for the sake of such a character trait, and he disposed of by an enemy who should be an ally hit because both sides are stupid they don’t communicate that they have the exact same goal and should be working in tandem to stop the big threat of this movie. As for the characters we’re already familiar with, they are still immensely flat and dry, and some characters don't really have a reason to be in the film due to sheer irrelevance, such as Mikihiko. This isn't entirely the film’s fault, as the 2014 anime showcased them as worthless garbage anyway, and oddly enough, the women largely feel the same in this film, not even feeling like individual character tropes like in the show proper. Thankfully, the worst aspects of the main sibling pair are subdued due to the limited runtime, however, they are still as generic and dull as ever, if not nearly as infuriating.There is this asteroid that is threatened to be in a collision course with the Earth, and this is established as the main threat due to scientists. However, that gets dropped halfway through the film with no resolution and instead it gets replaced by this satellite the researches were trying to move for some unexplained reason. Unfortunately, given that not many people have seen this film and this review is written without spoilers, I cannot go into further detail, nor can I explain any of the other problems with this film that require spoilers. However, there are a few that can be listed here, such as the sheer lack of subplots, the fact that it took Mayumi so long to realize that her plane was taken by her friends and that there was an important passenger with them (it took a day), the lack of consistency regarding magic being used with or without codes (since it has been established you need to use magic codes to use any form of magic), and that the scientists have no motivations for their actions beyond a one-off line of dialogue about the Navy accepting them. We aren't even made aware of their plans. Lastly, it turns it that some of the character graduated, but Tatsuya is the same age and no one has reportedly aged. This could also explain why Erika is somewhat of a different character than before, but then we’d have missed important character development; not like the series could even attempt such a thing.Ultimately, while this film was a considerable improvement from the 2014 Madhouse anime, it is still a lackluster film without much of an engaging narrative and a sheer lack of decent characterization, as well as an inheritance of some of the series’ major problems, even if it does attempt to at least subdue issues involving the production, the main duo, and the lack of cohesion with the music and the scenes back then. The third arc is where most of these issues come to a head, turning a movie that would have otherwise been classified as “so ok it's average” into a bewildering mess that just happens to be an improvement. Even fans of the anime could get confused as to what’s going on regarding certain characters, which is a large issue. You could say this review is damning with faint praise, but that’s the best thing this lackluster film deserves. Regardless, with all that said, I bid you adieu."", ""[I watched Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo at CGV Cinemas Grand Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia on September 16th, 2017]Story: 7/10 (Good)the movie feels like a side story.

The audiences can obtain what they want to see in this movie, such as the impressive magic and action scenes. Although the story is common, the audiences can also enjoy in it.I believe what you want in this series is to watch the main character to perform lots of cool actions and enjoy the process showing how the main characters defeat the bad guys. For the material mentioned above, they are available in this anime. Besides Tatsuya and Miyuki, the anime gives chances to others characters...to perform their magic equally.As for the Art and Music, this anime gives common quality as other movie version does. It achieves fair scores on them. In the other words, these two factors provide the reason why I give this anime a overall grade, 7. They are not impressed on a positive side nor a negative one.Plot is the drawback of this anime. To be honest, the plot sucks compared to other original movies. However, as I said previously, this is a fan-oriented movie. The audiences are looking for cool things. They just want to see how Tatsuya beat enemies and nothing else. At this point, this plot of this anime does it duty. 5 is the highest point that I could give.In the end, for the fans of this series, I recommend this anime to you.

It gets crapped on for reasons that usually deserve distaste (OP, know-it-all MC that happens to have a sister and a plethora of other females all lining up to take him). However, the TV series crafted a lot of really enjoyable experiences with its tight-knit cast and interesting plot scenarios.With that out of the way, lets talk about this film.This film is, in my honest opinion, a complete waste of time to watch unless you are the up-most die-hard of a fan. The film accomplishes a...super long, drawn-out objective after meandering on for tens of minutes with the most dull conversation scenes.But first, lets talk aesthetics. I always liked the visual style of the TV series. I've seen people comment on how it looks “too clean and crisp”. This is a valid criticism; if you make something that hits both of these marks, it can look foreign and void of personality. I however do not hold this train of thought for Magic Highschool. For me, the series has a very distinctive look and feel to its world. It has a clear vision of how advanced the world is compared to our own, the color pallet is for the most part a set of cool colors, and pretty much every character looks unique.The film holds these values in-check which is a good thing. You can come off of the TV series and watch this film and it will fall almost perfectly in place visual wise. What will not mesh well however is the pretty abhorrent CG used in the film. CG characters and CG objects really clash with the other visuals on-screen especially when it is a moving object. Tanks in motion look fucking awful in almost every incident. Thankfully, the rest of the visual elements pick up the slack and make this film look good. It lacks that extra movie flair but is a step up from the TV series (which was already a pretty high bar in my opinion).The sound design is something that also (for the most part) stays consistent from the TV series. The sounds of guns, objects clashing, magic spells going off, and other things in the forefront of the action sounds right at home. The voice actors are...well they are what they were in the TV series (which means they were passable). It's not that the actors did a meh job; it's just that the TV series and the film doesn't fully utilize the great cast. They kind of are just there doing their lines. The music is a mixed bag. There are a couple really cool themes. However, there are enough songs that sound either out of place or just really meh that it left a bad taste in my mouth.Now we can finally talk about the meat of this film; the...”plot”. On first inspection you might find that the plot lies between Honoka's breasts. Nope, the plot is introduced as a sort of “Scientists going rouge” thing but it doesn't really go anywhere. The main...”Villian” is a scientist that...you know what? I still have no idea what the fuck he wanted. He just spouts out these cryptic lines all the time that don't mean anything other than “I don't care; just do what I said”. The last time we see him he is (what I am assuming) just knocked out. What happens to him? The film doesn't care.What does the film care about? Fan service. Yes I do mean sexualized fanservice but also fanservice in the way of “Hey viewer! Remember this character? Yeah there she is for 10 minutes! Look how fucking cute/hott she looks in that bathing suit! Ok now say good bye to them because the plot doesn't need them.” The TV series did a great job keeping characters relevant for the entirety of its running. The film however throws them in because...the studio is worried you will forget about them? Seriously only Tatsuya, Miyuki, Erika, and Leonhart really matter in this film. Everyone else plays a super sideline role.So things happen, Tatsuya saves some kids, the sideliners fight some “American” bad guys, then Tatsuya stops a falling thing from space. That's...pretty much the meat of the film. The first 40 minutes are wasted on meaningless fanservice shots sprinkled with some plot. This film was seriously a letdown. I was hoping it would provide us with some more badass moments but in the end it is all show and no go. There were no real set-piece moments, no real interesting methodical ideas or plot devices, no character development...nothing. Just an hour and a half wasted.This film joins No Game No Life Zero in the “film that wasted potential” bin. Please do not waste your time on this thing. Unless you absolutely need to see the characters do something new, stay clear of this mess of a film.Enjoyment: 3.2/10Overall: 2.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

I suspect that this was driven by the final viewing format more than a design for higher quality. But I can say that the movement and lines are much smoother and more natural.I am shooting for spoiler-free and that will be the largest challenge in this review. Let’s start with this is a good follow up for the series as it...continues the main cast and brings in more of the background of this world. Post World War III magic is the key to everything and our main Protagonist Tatsuya Shiba is as overpowered as ever with his super-powered sister Miyuki they are on summer vacation with the cast from the first season of the anime.It is safe to say that this is also a look into the world of the rich. The villa they are staying at is on a private island. They have maid staff and both a private plane and a boat. The quality of the food etc. is well above what we would call standard fare. For fun they fly over to an entertainment island venue I not really jealous but will admit to some envy. This is where they meet little Kokoa as she hides on the airplane they are using.Kokoa is a victim of human experiments and she is not alone. She explains that she and eight other girls are being used as part of a big machine. Tatsuya explains that it is probably a giant CAD and that the magic users are being forcibly linked. This has a danger of stripping the humanity of the person and turning them into nothing but a component to the tool. Human parts to a machine with no rights no life and no future.As you can imagine this is not going to stand and a plan is put in place to deal with the problem. We get cameo appearances from several of the graduates from the prior season with Mayumi Saegusa, Mari Watanabe, and Katsuto Jumonji all playing a roll in the rescue. We also get to meet the “Stars” Team from the United States a girl much like Tatsuya who has some tactical grade powers of her own Angelina Kudou Shields aka Lina.I will not go into the events of the story or the rescue from here as that takes all the fun out of it. If you enjoyed the overpowered type then this should work for you. If you enjoy watching a Brocon sister then this will work for you also continues the main cast and brings in more of the background of this world.

TL:DRs and pros and cons are at the top but for the absolute detail, read the whole thing. May contain a bit of accidental spoilers but most likely not.TL:DR: Unless you are extremely attentive to all the details, most of its shortcomings are acceptable. It\'s a genuinely pleasing movie that i would recommend. Lacks story and character depths but makes up for it with punchy bright fighting scenes and explosives. And also naked girls. I feel that this anime was more focused on the thrilling area rather than story thus. But...it was good enough to not make me bother too much about it.Who i would recommend to: Action and thrill seekers, people who want to have a glimpse of the series.Pros: Great fighting scenes, artwork and colour was on point, audio was great for most part, really thrilling and funny, more than sufficient to keep me attentive. Fanservice was good and not too excessive (really hot) Didn\'t felt like it lacked much.Cons: Lack of depth in character,  lack of focus in other characters (felt they were missing out), too focused on main character (feels like a one man mission). Story was shallow compared to the competition but generally average at best.Gribes (Little details):Some panning inconsistencies and frame rate dropping when panning across complicated scenes. Audio still falls for the issue of just blurring out BG sound and feels too focused in an open area. Slight softness in characters and fighting scenes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Full review)Story: 7In general the movie was fast paced, maybe just a little too fast on its feet to provide in depth explanation of what\'s going on but overall I didn\'t feel like it was too lacking. This anime felt like it was heavily relying on the fighting scenes and thriller so i wouldn\'t be too harsh on other areas.The motive of the series was clear right from the start and the dangers was shown without me being too confused. Typical comedy scenes that were actually funny, famservice wasn\'t really asked for but still nice i guess especially for the fans. I wish there was more depth in explaning pretty much anything that would have benefitted, felt most were just hurried over. For instance going in depth on what drove them into doing something like this (Mainly destroying the world) rather than a brief explanation. Really would have bring out the sheer humiliation and passion.The issue really comes in as I\'ll explain later, the excessive focus on the main character and just ignoring everything else. It felt like this whole movie was a one man effort. Impressive until you realized, wait a minute, what about the other few characters that agreed to help too. Major problem for that one as it\'s rather obvious. However most of it\'s shortcomings were sufficient enough and most of its shortcomings were covered by fanservice, comedy and the extremely good fighting scenes.Art: 9So this is where i focus on things like colour accuracy, smoothness of frames, artwork design, panning of scenes, POV  and also even boobs jiggle. A lot to cover. And i can say for 95% of people, it\'s pretty much on par with the best of the best.Colour accuracy was mainly spot on with night scenes giving a very accurate greenish blue tone and warm summer sun to portray a warm yellow tone. Slight quibble about miyuki\'s skin having a tad less yellow than i would like during the day but was still visible. (10/10)Smoothness and panning was for most part decent but falls under some of the common anime issues. Like panning through buildings often have a studder that may seem distracting after awhile. A common issue of 20fps or so. However panning between less complex objects like skies were butter smooth. Fighting scenes do have the slight studder but it wasn\'t too bad for me to get my head off. Great overall, slight problem in some scenes but are very common anyways in every other anime. (8/10)Focus shift between characters was a bit of a mix bag. There was a combination of a smooth focal change (like a camera, my favorite kind), slingshots (extremely fast panning) and ""pop"" (No animation). I wished the slingshot pan when the characters were agreeing to help the little kid out was a bit slower as it felt too fast and i sometimes struggle to focus. It was rather inconsistent as i do see these a lot of effort placed in the first half of the anime. However down to the second half, it was just basically ""pop"" left. Not a big deal but it feels maybe a tad bit lazier. (8/10)POV was the best part of it as i feel that the movie had extremely great POVs especially the first half. The night scene combined multiple POVs and did not just heavily rely on close up shots of the character that most anime just generally have. (10/10)Boobs jiggle i am happy to report is there to an extent. It was slightly stiffer (less jiggle) than what i would have call it natural for most scenes but in scenes that are intended for fanservice, it was sufficient portrayed without the ""nekopara"" kind of excessive jiggle. (9/10)Character artwork was mostly like the anime so it was great. Slight gribes about some characters having a really soft look when two or more characters are involved but really that\'s hard peeping. Most if not all of the characters were clean and sharp with clear edges and outline. (10/10)Sharpness of other details were plentyful but fast moving objects have occasional softness and blur. Like the fighting scene had soft edges but were plenty punchy and colourful. But then again most fighting anime suffer these issues. The numbers that pop up along with the blue glow when magic was used were also rather soft and could be a lot sharper. However for most objects, it was only having a soft outline but was still plenty sharp. Signboards and clothing was detailed and visible, maybe a bit lacking in texture but that\'s almost impossible to ask. Colour gradients may sometimes smudge a little bit. (9/10)Sound: 9This is where i focus on coversation, BG noise, music and sound effects.Most of the audio were spot on, the 1 point was again my gribe about animes having too much of that focus effect where there\'s no BG noise when the character is talking or the environment feels very small.Music was spot on, i was a bit amazed that the movie decided to use recorder music (was it? recorder or flute?) instead of the traditional light fluffy music that I am used to hearing in shopping scenes. Wasn\'t bad, in fact good, just surprised. Sound effects were generally punchy and loud with explosions having great uniformity but my gribe on the lack of echo as the explosion disspipates. Ice sounded sharp and crisp, sword sounded sharp maybe with a slight bit lacking in the extremely high end. The deep rumble of helicopter and the brrrrrt of the gun, the muffled rumble of the submarine, all well done. (10/10)Speech wise was well done. Although more exaggeration is really welcome like the spunds of desperation could have been a bit sharper and more distorted on the tone rather than a very clean voice but minor gribe. The crazy crackle was well covered with a slightly noticable faster speech compared to everyone else. Fighting scenes would have benefited from the slight exaggeration too, it all feels a bit too calm but still on par with the competition like SAO. The sound of fear could be a bit higher pitched and distorted when being asked to be saved and in other cases, a bit more distorted and softer. But these are minor gribes. The movie has well balanced speech with distinct difference at different time and scene. (Can tell the person\'s mood and scene just from listening) (10/10)Characters: 6Now here\'s my stance. I don\'t really care too much about characters in movies partly because if i want in depth coverage of every character, just watch the anime but it has to be decently covered.So most of the characters were sort of covered. I won\'t say too in depth but I\'ll give it to them, there were too many to cover. Characters felt quite shallow especially for crucial characters which needed that extra depth to really bring out things like sympathy (But then again, watch the anime for more depth) A simple backstory or reflection of what happened and what they\'ve gone through for some crucial characters (not necessarily main characters) would have sufficed. Decent but not great. (7/10)It also fell for the trap of focusing too much on the main character and just removing everyone else. That\'s one thing I am genuinely annoyed by but not too much to hate it. It\'s too focused on the main character. It felt rushed and not well covered. It often felt like a one man mission when there were many people were actually part of the mission. There was little coverage of what the other characters were doing. (6/10)It\'s interesting enough for first timers and for many of the 7 million fans out there, I am pretty sure you know the BG of every character. It\'s only good enough but not great.Enjoyment: 9Despite its flaws, the series was fast paced enough to not bore me but have some occasional lack of depth. The fighting scenes were intense, the comedy was really funny. It really is funny despite not being a comedy anime and it has enough action and thriller to keep me entertained. I never once felt like this anime was lacking. As enjoyment itself, only minor annoyance like a lack of depth was basically covered by the interesting fighting scenes i came to watch. And the fanservice just makes me forget about it. Of course but who dares to admit that even. Lmao. The only major gribe i had was too much focus on the main character.Overall: 8Great anime, on a technical aspect, it\'s a decent series, it does well as a movie and holds its ground. It\'s funny, it\'s active, it\'s thriiling. Issues like depth was bad but excusable since it\'s a movie and not an anime. I say, if you are a fan, this is a great movie that reflects part of it. For first timers, this doesn\'t reflect the series but a tiny snippet of it that makes you want to watch the anime. it was good enough to not make me bother too much about it.Who i would recommend to: Action and thrill seekers, people who want to have a glimpse of the series.Pros: Great fighting scenes, artwork and colour was on point, audio was great for most part, really thrilling and funny, more than sufficient to keep me attentive. Fanservice was good and not too excessive (really hot) Didn\'t felt like it lacked much.Cons: Lack of depth in character,  lack of focus in other characters (felt they were missing out), too focused on main character (feels like a one man mission). Story was shallow compared to the competition but generally average at best.Gribes (Little details):Some panning inconsistencies and frame rate dropping when panning across complicated scenes. Audio still falls for the issue of just blurring out BG sound and feels too focused in an open area. Slight softness in characters and fighting scenes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Full review)Story: 7In general the movie was fast paced, maybe just a little too fast on its feet to provide in depth explanation of what\'s going on but overall I didn\'t feel like it was too lacking. This anime felt like it was heavily relying on the fighting scenes and thriller so i wouldn\'t be too harsh on other areas.The motive of the series was clear right from the start and the dangers was shown without me being too confused. Typical comedy scenes that were actually funny, famservice wasn\'t really asked for but still nice i guess especially for the fans. I wish there was more depth in explaning pretty much anything that would have benefitted, felt most were just hurried over. For instance going in depth on what drove them into doing something like this (Mainly destroying the world) rather than a brief explanation. Really would have bring out the sheer humiliation and passion.The issue really comes in as I\'ll explain later, the excessive focus on the main character and just ignoring everything else. It felt like this whole movie was a one man effort. Impressive until you realized, wait a minute, what about the other few characters that agreed to help too. Major problem for that one as it\'s rather obvious. However most of it\'s shortcomings were sufficient enough and most of its shortcomings were covered by fanservice, comedy and the extremely good fighting scenes.Art: 9So this is where i focus on things like colour accuracy, smoothness of frames, artwork design, panning of scenes, POV  and also even boobs jiggle. A lot to cover. And i can say for 95% of people, it\'s pretty much on par with the best of the best.Colour accuracy was mainly spot on with night scenes giving a very accurate greenish blue tone and warm summer sun to portray a warm yellow tone. Slight quibble about miyuki\'s skin having a tad less yellow than i would like during the day but was still visible. (10/10)Smoothness and panning was for most part decent but falls under some of the common anime issues. Like panning through buildings often have a studder that may seem distracting after awhile. A common issue of 20fps or so. However panning between less complex objects like skies were butter smooth. Fighting scenes do have the slight studder but it wasn\'t too bad for me to get my head off. Great overall, slight problem in some scenes but are very common anyways in every other anime. (8/10)Focus shift between characters was a bit of a mix bag. There was a combination of a smooth focal change (like a camera, my favorite kind), slingshots (extremely fast panning) and ""pop"" (No animation). I wished the slingshot pan when the characters were agreeing to help the little kid out was a bit slower as it felt too fast and i sometimes struggle to focus. It was rather inconsistent as i do see these a lot of effort placed in the first half of the anime. However down to the second half, it was just basically ""pop"" left. Not a big deal but it feels maybe a tad bit lazier. (8/10)POV was the best part of it as i feel that the movie had extremely great POVs especially the first half. The night scene combined multiple POVs and did not just heavily rely on close up shots of the character that most anime just generally have. (10/10)Boobs jiggle i am happy to report is there to an extent. It was slightly stiffer (less jiggle) than what i would have call it natural for most scenes but in scenes that are intended for fanservice, it was sufficient portrayed without the ""nekopara"" kind of excessive jiggle. (9/10)Character artwork was mostly like the anime so it was great. Slight gribes about some characters having a really soft look when two or more characters are involved but really that\'s hard peeping. Most if not all of the characters were clean and sharp with clear edges and outline. (10/10)Sharpness of other details were plentyful but fast moving objects have occasional softness and blur. Like the fighting scene had soft edges but were plenty punchy and colourful. But then again most fighting anime suffer these issues. The numbers that pop up along with the blue glow when magic was used were also rather soft and could be a lot sharper. However for most objects, it was only having a soft outline but was still plenty sharp. Signboards and clothing was detailed and visible, maybe a bit lacking in texture but that\'s almost impossible to ask. Colour gradients may sometimes smudge a little bit. (9/10)Sound: 9This is where i focus on coversation, BG noise, music and sound effects.Most of the audio were spot on, the 1 point was again my gribe about animes having too much of that focus effect where there\'s no BG noise when the character is talking or the environment feels very small.Music was spot on, i was a bit amazed that the movie decided to use recorder music (was it? recorder or flute?) instead of the traditional light fluffy music that I am used to hearing in shopping scenes. Wasn\'t bad, in fact good, just surprised. Sound effects were generally punchy and loud with explosions having great uniformity but my gribe on the lack of echo as the explosion disspipates. Ice sounded sharp and crisp, sword sounded sharp maybe with a slight bit lacking in the extremely high end. The deep rumble of helicopter and the brrrrrt of the gun, the muffled rumble of the submarine, all well done. (10/10)Speech wise was well done. Although more exaggeration is really welcome like the spunds of desperation could have been a bit sharper and more distorted on the tone rather than a very clean voice but minor gribe. The crazy crackle was well covered with a slightly noticable faster speech compared to everyone else. Fighting scenes would have benefited from the slight exaggeration too, it all feels a bit too calm but still on par with the competition like SAO. The sound of fear could be a bit higher pitched and distorted when being asked to be saved and in other cases, a bit more distorted and softer. But these are minor gribes. The movie has well balanced speech with distinct difference at different time and scene. (Can tell the person\'s mood and scene just from listening) (10/10)Characters: 6Now here\'s my stance. I don\'t really care too much about characters in movies partly because if i want in depth coverage of every character, just watch the anime but it has to be decently covered.So most of the characters were sort of covered. I won\'t say too in depth but I\'ll give it to them, there were too many to cover. Characters felt quite shallow especially for crucial characters which needed that extra depth to really bring out things like sympathy (But then again, watch the anime for more depth) A simple backstory or reflection of what happened and what they\'ve gone through for some crucial characters (not necessarily main characters) would have sufficed. Decent but not great. (7/10)It also fell for the trap of focusing too much on the main character and just removing everyone else. That\'s one thing I am genuinely annoyed by but not too much to hate it. It\'s too focused on the main character. It felt rushed and not well covered. It often felt like a one man mission when there were many people were actually part of the mission. There was little coverage of what the other characters were doing. (6/10)It\'s interesting enough for first timers and for many of the 7 million fans out there, I am pretty sure you know the BG of every character. It\'s only good enough but not great.Enjoyment: 9Despite its flaws, the series was fast paced enough to not bore me but have some occasional lack of depth. The fighting scenes were intense, the comedy was really funny. It really is funny despite not being a comedy anime and it has enough action and thriller to keep me entertained. I never once felt like this anime was lacking. As enjoyment itself, only minor annoyance like a lack of depth was basically covered by the interesting fighting scenes i came to watch. And the fanservice just makes me forget about it. Of course but who dares to admit that even. Lmao. The only major gribe i had was too much focus on the main character.Overall: 8Great anime, on a technical aspect, it\'s a decent series, it does well as a movie and holds its ground.

The whole group were on their holidays having the time of their lives. When they went to visit the nearby Ogasawara Island archipelago, they met with an unexpected guest which turns their peaceful life around. Compared to the anime series, I actually enjoyed this movie much more.Story: 5/10The plot was pretty straight forward right from the beginning allowing you to kind of guess where the story is headed. The movie has a good pacing, with interesting scenes and minimal info dumps about how...Tatsuya magically knows everything and explains it. However, there is a scene that made me felt disappointed and confused seeing how the characters involved are not utilising their abilities properly. It just felt that the spotlight was forced to be on Tatsuya just because he is the main character.Art: 9/10The artwork I felt was fantastic allowing some of the scenes at the end to be mesmerizing. The artwork of the fighting scene I felt was topnotch and really captures my attention. The designs for the characters are pretty cool and they look great wearing clothes other than their uniforms. Won’t really say too much except that I enjoyed what I saw.Sounds: 8/10Personally to me some of the dialogues at the beginning were pretty pointless and doesn’t build up the story in any particular way. Tatsuya just had to say something that everyone is just going to disagree anyway. The voice actors for each characters were great as it doesn’t feels out of place or awkward. I won’t judge about the OST as I’m not really familiar with music although I did enjoyed it nonetheless.Characters: 3/10Most of the characters barely got enough screen time, leaving some of them just showing their face for the sake of the show and fan service because they are side characters. New characters were introduced but never really explained how they knew each other. They felt forceful just to have the actions scenes and conflict occurring as their motives wasn’t strong enough. However, the action scenes for the characters in the movie is enticing enough to make me crave for more of it. This is definitely the highlight for me as the supporting characters got a chance to shine for a moment. Finally, I got really confused that both Miyuki and Saegusa had an ability that they shouldn’t possibly have. Did they leveled up? How did they learn those particular skills?Enjoyment: 5/10Although I did enjoyed myself throughout the movie despite the few questions I had in my mind, I never did see any plot development for the future season nor do I see the characters grow at all. I don’t really see the point of having this movie without it developing itself. You can probably still enjoy this movie without watching the anime series because of it. Also there is one ending credit scene so remember to stay back.Overall: 6/10If you are a fan of an OP main character, don't mind some light bro-con, love irregular at magic high school then I would recommend you to try this out.

Plot holes are more than left and right, and a lot of things just don’t make sense, as it wasn’t properly explained.To make things worse the runtime of the movie could fit the size of the shows typical arc so it’s sad to see something I really enjoy in general fall so flat and just wishing there was more and better substance. The fights which occurred were pretty disappointing overall as it felt the short fights themselves could be solved if someone just spoke...a single sentence of explaining themselves.Though I will admit I loved the after credit scene which simply made me nostalgic for the original show.To sum up: Stick to the show.

Overall rating is a 5.', 'I\'ve been a fan of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei for quite a bit, even if I didn\'t read the novels and stayed with the manga and anime.First off, I\'ll be quick because other reviews go more in depth.This film is clearly NOT the direct following of the anime and doesn\'t appear in the manga, so it\'s a side-story which is quite enjoyable, taking place during the vacations.STORY:The story is ..ok?... but quite simple in the end. When I say simple, I also mean that you can clearly feel the shonen wibe behind the interactions and it\'s really easy to understand the story. (So it\'s quite...lighthearted without the ""POWER OF FRIENDS"" part of the shonen shows.... but lighthearted in the wrong direction, leading to situations with no sense at all because the logic disappeared in the stratosphere...)ART:The art is GREAT, you can\'t argue with that. It\'s not as good as Violet Evergarden or Ghibli films, but it\'s still in the right continuation from the series with overall better graphics, but a better spirit. You can feel that it\'s a movie and not a TV series with lack of time. The CGI is quite well used, or used in the background, so it doesn\'t scratch your eyes.CHARACTERS:The characters are like before (in the TV series), but with little to no character developpment for the ones we already get to see in the previous anime AND characters appearing way later in the novel/manga series (which will not be presented, so it\'s kind of laking for the people coming from the anime TV part).SOUND:The sound was ok, but not particularly good or memorable. It just did it\'s job without giving a special wibe or atmosphere, which is kind of sad.ENJOYMENT:The movie is nice. If you liked the anime series, you\'ll definitely like this movies... and if you are a big fan and you read the manga/novel, you\'ll probably like it even more.OVERALL: (8/10 for MAL, 8,2/10 precisely)This movie is laking a great sountrack and a better character introduction, but in the end, it was quite what I was expecting from a mahouka-movie. It wasn\'t a masterpiece, it wasn\'t GREAT in capital letters, but it was enjoyable... and more enjoyable than most of the current movies coming out in the regular cinema industry.People coming from the anime series ONLY will have scenes they don\'t understand, because they don\'t know the characters, which are introduced a bit later in the original series.If you liked MKNR, I definetly recommend you to give it a shot. The animation is still great and Tatsuya is present (without him, the movie wouldn\'t exist after all, he\'s kind of the main character).Hopefully, this quick review was helpful.(Note: for me, 7/10 is the average not of an anime which hasn\'t really hardcore flaws. If everything is decent, the anime will get an 7/10 from me. 8/10 is already way better and 9/10 is nearing the realm of masterpieces.) lighthearted without the ""POWER OF FRIENDS"" part of the shonen shows.... but lighthearted in the wrong direction, leading to situations with no sense at all because the logic disappeared in the stratosphere...)ART:The art is GREAT, you can\'t argue with that.

But while the anime is part of a overarching storyline, this movie is kind of a standalone thing. So you'd be wise to not expect anything important or very fleshed out characters or exciting storyline.Really though, I didn't really care for the movie storyline or new characters. But I think that's fine as it's within my expectations. If you did like the anime you're probably just here for the ride, the main cast + some Tatsuya/Miyuki/etc OPness. If you just expect that, the movie is...kind of alright.Sadly as a pretty short movie, you don't get to enjoy the character interactions very much, since the time is spent on the movie storyline. But you at least get to see the main characters in some form, even if they don't all get to do much.If you're an anime-only watcher though, you'll definitely be confused when flashbacks of the past are referenced, and when characters that haven't yet appeared in anime appear without any introduction, and you're expected to know them. However, it's not critical to the plot for this movie and it's ok to go in blind. They are also not major spoilers and should not hamper your enjoyment should there be a anime season 2. It does not change the level of enjoyment much, it's just a extra tidbit for those who know what it is. Just keep in mind that there will seem to be some unexplained minor things. Also, THE POST-CREDIT SCENE IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.-As a novel reader, I think the movie as a whole feels like a side story. As usual only the combat characters really do anything, but the starting is slice of life-y which is somewhat enjoyable. Those scenes of them just walking around weren't too bad. The new characters of the movie, and the main storyline isn't really well fleshed out at all - but it doesn't matter right? We're just here to see the characters move and do some moves. However I wouldn't say the combat is spectacular either, but still if you're a fan I think it'll be enjoyable as long as you don't expect to be blown away.-Overall, movie characters not really developed, but enjoyable if you don't care about that and just wanna see the main characters again. You might not feel like you get enough of them in this short movie to make it worth it though. Usual Tatsuya OPness though not so much of the badass factor I'm looking for. The shortness of the movie really makes it difficult to do much, so we pretty much just get a little of everything and nothing extra great.As far as movies go, decent art but music isn't particularly impressive. Movie characters not well developed despite being the trigger for everything, but works as a plot device to get our characters moving.

Erika and Leo are half-exceptions however let\'s not kid ourselves, Tatsuya on a large scale pretty much resolves EVERY problem in this movie and being the ""Magic Jesus"" LA dubbed him he destroys any tension of an imminent threat that the movie had setup for us. Now to this movie\'s defence, yes LA gets he\'s the ""main protagonist"" thus his screentime is somewhat justified not to mention some battles that doesn\'t affect Tatsuya like Erika and Leo\'s fight against some of the Elite STARS and Miyuki\'s role by the climax of the movie were somewhat unaffected by this, what LA just had a problem with is that he STEALS the screentime from the other main characters of this movie in the process of it because he\'s just so damn powerful in the first place!.In terms of animation done this time by 8Bit instead of MADHOUSE, the animation is very polished and bright in flavour of the TV series only to a bigger scale, the magic battles and it\'s aesthetics is also very well done showing off some spectacularly great effects, kinda expected from 8Bit for this one however LA will talk about something that irked LA because of this but that a bit later.The voice acting is overall consistent with returning voice actors from Saori Hayami to Kana Hanazawa, Satomi Sato, Marina Inoue, Yuuichi Nakamura, Yumi Uchiyama. With some new additions to this movie from Yoko Hikasa as Lina and Konomi Kohara as Kokoa did pretty well overall as well. Really not much to talk about with the voice cast really.So in talking about Lina, how did Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo handle their newer characters?, well Kokoa was nothing but the plot catalyst while Lina and the STARS to Tatsuya were used for some opposition and a bit of chaos to ramp up the craziness of the movie, LA was fine with Lina being in the movie if only to cause a bit of a wall for Tatsuya, Erika and Leo while yeah...LA had a problem with Kokoa as a whole of her being a ""catalyst"" to the entire movie and LA gets Kokoa purpose IS to move the plot along but yeah show stealer Tatsuya made short work of that anyways.For fans of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, the Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo is for what LA sees, is a 90 minute episode of one particular arc (and it\'s NOT an original work so this is canon). For LA personally, what with LA being griped about Tatsuya Shiba for MULTITUDE of reasons, the animation being one of the highlights of the movie. What LA really got out of this movie, though it\'s faithful both aesthetically and atmospheric to the TV series and everything, it also brought on for LA that this movie is really a ""spectacle over substance"" movie, you get a mission, exposition and prep over it then conduct and confront then resolve the mission...lots of gorgeously spectacle magical battles and explosions...but not much to ""say"" about it all and that\'s where LA thinks Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo falls flat on.Now in saying all this, is this just like the anime original movies with it\'s movie only characters that goes away afterwards, it definitely has hints of being so even if this is canon to the original source material, however Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo does for LA at least make the spectacle kinda worth the watch even with it\'s very flawed negatives.All of the elements of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Movie: Hoshi wo Yobu Shoujo, a spectacle over substance, a sins of the father anime series to movie problems and all, the movie is fine...it\'s fine...it\'s fine. and resolution, in which it involves a human experiment runaway by the name of Kokoa wanting to free her other ""8"", with Tatsuya accepting it, until some other factions comes into the loop, then well it becomes all chaos not long afterwards bringing our confrontation to not only the ""villain"" of this movie but the other factions with their own agenda to deal with and then the resolution to the movie shortly afterwards.LA will say this loud and clear for you about the ""sins of the father"" affecting this movie and that\'s the problem of Tatsuya Shiba himself, merely for the fact that he\'s is an overpowered main protagonist easily cuts the tension of MANY scenes in this movie, not the mention the fact that he steals scenes from his friends in the process of this movie for the sake of trying to protect them. Erika and Leo are half-exceptions however let\'s not kid ourselves, Tatsuya on a large scale pretty much resolves EVERY problem in this movie and being the ""Magic Jesus"" LA dubbed him he destroys any tension of an imminent threat that the movie had setup for us. Now to this movie\'s defence, yes LA gets he\'s the ""main protagonist"" thus his screentime is somewhat justified not to mention some battles that doesn\'t affect Tatsuya like Erika and Leo\'s fight against some of the Elite STARS and Miyuki\'s role by the climax of the movie were somewhat unaffected by this, what LA just had a problem with is that he STEALS the screentime from the other main characters of this movie in the process of it because he\'s just so damn powerful in the first place!.In terms of animation done this time by 8Bit instead of MADHOUSE, the animation is very polished and bright in flavour of the TV series only to a bigger scale, the magic battles and it\'s aesthetics is also very well done showing off some spectacularly great effects, kinda expected from 8Bit for this one however LA will talk about something that irked LA because of this but that a bit later.The voice acting is overall consistent with returning voice actors from Saori Hayami to Kana Hanazawa, Satomi Sato, Marina Inoue, Yuuichi Nakamura, Yumi Uchiyama. With some new additions to this movie from Yoko Hikasa as Lina and Konomi Kohara as Kokoa did pretty well overall as well.

Even though it had a separate story from the LN (or so I remember reading about it), I was hoping for some great story developments, considering where the LNs go and develop as I've heard. I wanted to re-watch the original series because it was a blast, it was very well-balanced for me, and triggered a ton of emotions, because of which - I wanted to see even more of the story, it kinda ended on a moment that I knew would develop further,...and it does in LNs anyways.But this wasn't really to my liking. Don't get me wrong, I love the anime, even to this day I search for similar anime to it. But the thoughts I had towards it after the ending were just mixed.Why I had mixed feelings?- The plot didn't really connect. I simply imply that the first season was to provide interest into the LN, and the creation of the movie probably means that you have read the LN beforehand, or they expected you to.- Because of the previous statement, if you don't like LNs, don't read them or just didn't read this one or such, you might get lost. New characters, new people, new information and some old information you probably have forgotten can be confusing and most likely will be.- It is more like a side-story because it is not really related to the main-story. This takes place at the time of the spring break - which basically means that this is more like an OVA, and it is, because of the time as I said, and the ending which feels more like an ending to an OVA before a second season. Except we don't get one. And it feels like a cliff-hanger because it just feels that there has to be the rest of it, it just covers the spring break.- Raises some questions that you might not be able to answer without reading the LNs, asking others or trying to find out by yourself somewhere.HOWEVER, I still advise you to watch it. If you're reading this, you are most likely are someone who have watched the first season, liked it, and wanted to see more. It still provides you:- Many action scenes, Tatsuya's godlike powers, strategies (although they're less in-depth than usual), onii-sama boners.- Great visuals, amazing quality. The fights are very well done, it is basically eye-candy.- The whole squad ready to accompany our MC in various fights and adventures. His knowledge on everything is what I love about him - he is versatile 'cause he has a huge range of practices and knowledge.I would also read the LNs if you were someone who likes reading - I myself am very curious and helping oneself to calm that curiosity is the best medicament for that. and it does in LNs anyways.But this wasn't really to my liking.

Stuff occurs but u don't know what is really happening, like who Lina really the movie gives her like no introduction but rather in the movie knows her, flashbacks of the prequel manga came like whoever didn't read that would be confused and weird polish.

I will say, that it kinda made no sense that this movie took place AFTER season two, speaking of the fact it came out around 3-2 years before season two even came out. In my opinion the better option would've been making a movie of the Reminiscence Arc which took place 3 years before season 1, talking about Miyuki and Tatsuya's relationship when they were younger. The art was basically the same as season 1,...just with some slightly better graphics, and cleaner details. It was still beautiful to look at though, but nothing changed THAT much.

As with such movies its completely self contained and doesn't really further anything in terms of overarching plot points or character arcs. Rather, it's a short story far away from everything else. This story is more focused on lots of cool and fun moments than on telling a solid story, wherein while it does have a reasonably solid story it's a pretty generic one that doesn't have that much complexity or depth to it. However, it does...have a lot of amusing moments that manage to pull in the entire cast from the main series, even though that does feel kind of forced, as well as a lot of great action and epic moments. The protagonist Tatsuya is still essentially invincible and able to solve any problem, but it feels like there was a different tone taken around that, wherein in the first season such moments were intended to wow the viewer, here it just felt like they were being portrayed as a matter of course, which I think minimizes such moments to a degree. The biggest, or rather strangest issue that I had with this anime is how it was released. This film was released after the first season, however there's an entire arc between the end of the first season and where this movie takes place, and that isn't just a superficial aspect but rather this film very clearly has references to events that haven't been shown in the anime yet, and straight up has characters that are introduced after the anime ends that are already familiar to the main cast, which is just a really bizarre choice because this is filler anyway and they had complete control of where they were putting it. Still, it's not that hard to follow whats going on due to the pretty simplistic plot, so that isn't that much of an issue, though for those that aren't familiar with the novels it'll spoil a few things that should have been twists in season 2.

Kamonohashi Ron no Kindan Suiri,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53879/Kamonohashi_Ron_no_Kindan_Suiri,"[""I recommend watching this if you can turn off your brain! With this you will be able to enjoy 100%!!!!! lmaoFirst of all, I don't speak English, so my English is a crap, so take that into consideration...It's going to be my first very very angry and pissed review, so it's going to be long, patience, I have a limit of stupidity that I can accept in stories... okay, let's get straight to the point? worth your time? Only if you can ignore all the stupid people living in the same place as this genius detective. Including his dumb partner, our other protagonist. Why do...I say this? After watching 6 episodes waiting for a change that never comes, I'm going to explain why I'm saying this!!!let's go. Things about the plot ahead!!So, I will talk about some things of the plot now, just read, if u want know the why I said these things..and if u dont worry about it go ahead.First, every time Kamonohashi solves a murder case, he forces the guilty people to kill themselves. How? speaking and with a magical eye or hypnotic look (hypinoze, power or whatever), we don't know how he does it or what it is, and neither does he, since he does it unconsciously and without wanting to, and therefore That's why he stopped investigating and solving cases, so he wouldn't kill anyone anymore.oks, thats great! We already know how it works right away in the first episode! and our dear other protagonist (TOTO) who witnesses everything also right? RIGHT???? (at least it should be like that)! got it? great!Even though our other protagonist is a talking donkey, he should already understand how this works after seeing it happen 3 times in front of him, right? RIGHT???????????? dammmm this guy is an adult and works as a detective! Did he pay someone to take his tests and solve all his work until he got to where he is now? wtf!! WELL! Even if that was the case, man, I'm not a detective or a genius, but hey, I got it the first time I saw it... and this motherfucker didn't understand how it actually worked until episode 5? wtf! damn it...So let's ignore the fact this protagonist is THIS STUPID for now and move on...and all the other people living in this world? Even when he clearly orders people to kill themselves in front of police officers, detectives, or ordinary people, everyone is seeing him doing it, and they clearly see the other person obeying the order.Then you ask yourself: oh, they saw him do that, so they're going to question him about it, right? RIGHT?????????????????????no! they simply completely ignore all of his actions from the point he enters this state, no one ever, I say never, questions him about it after preventing the culprit from committing suicide! except in the first episode when the other protagonist (Toto) does this.anyway, they never question this phenomenon happening in front of their eyes, clearly caused by him.Who the H E L L in the world wouldn't question something like that? WTF investigators, police officers and people live in this world are doing? THEY ARE BRAIN DEAD OR WHAT???? In other words, we have to accept that everyone simply ignores what happened every time as if it were no big deal (WTF?), and move on with their lives. FUCK THIS PIECE OF CRAP!And now the last point, which is another thing that really piss me off... (YEAH ANOTHER ONE)Great, we know that it induces people to kill themselves by talking to them and looking at them, we don't know which of the 2 actually affects the culprit or both (hearing his VOICE OR EYES contact). BUT!!!! we know that whenever the murder case is solved he enters this state to induce the murderer to kill himself!!! right? RIGHT?????????????????????So our big HERO TOTO, who knows what will happen in these murder cases..... what he says in the first episodes? Let's investigate I will stop you from killing people! great!? right???? RIGHT????????????????????? Yes!! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...... >w<so you think he will try find a normal way to stop it after saw how it works, right? RIGHT????????????????????? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...... >w<at last should be this way right? RIGHT????????????????????????????So we like normal persons, think: what could we do to stop him from killing people? What do you think TOTO is trying to do? what you think he is going to do after this? WHAT YOU! a normal person would do? (on my personal opnion we can try many things..) At the end of each solved case, put a blindfold on him so he doesn't see anything? a gag in his mouth so he doesn't say anything? try separately both of then, and later both at the same time to see which one solves the problem? leaving him handcuffed so he doesn't take them both off perhaps? And if it doesn't work, how about putting it out with a blow to the head then? Or what about a sleep aid? and how about the simplest thing? Is it just not letting him witness the resolution of the case in person? After all, he cant solve the case personanlly, so the person who ultimately solves the case in front of people is TOTO.SOOOOO, which of these things do you think our HERO TOTO tries to do???????YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!! is exactly what you think!!! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...... >w<none of the above!!! ._.He just acts every episode like he forgot about his power, and when he starts using it, he tries to stop him? NO! THIS... THIS IDIO...!! THIS SON OF BITCH, THIS MOTHER FUCKER!!! runs towards the killer to try to stop him from killing himself, after waiting patiently our dear brilliant detective to activate the power and say everything he had to say to the guy to kill himself!! he never tries to stop Kamonohashi from talking or doing that, even though this son of a bit.... is on his side every time... wtf... WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFThis insults my intelligence in such a way that it seriously offends and hurts me, the story is clearly calling me stupid.THIS CRAP BURN MY BRAIN CELLS EVERYTIME I SEE THIS PIECE OF SHIT...So if you care about inconsistencies like me, this will bother you! this will hurts u very very bad! ._.Now if you can ignore this to watch, there will be interesting cases, because yes! The cases and resolutions are cool to watch! and that's the only reason I keep watching it, but this whole plot full of holes hurts me.And you, what do you think? Answer me, I want to know what you think of what I said!PS: then why you recommend this crap? and why are u giving this a 6????????? welllllllllllll because like I said, the cases and investigations are really cool... and this is a fact... (but if u cast this aside, and u will get only BIG PIECE OF TRASH dam)! If it weren't for that, this anime wouldn't even be worth a 2 for the stupidity that we are forced to witness... I say this? After watching 6 episodes waiting for a change that never comes, I'm going to explain why I'm saying this!!!let's go. Things about the plot ahead!!So, I will talk about some things of the plot now, just read, if u want know the why I said these things..and if u dont worry about it go ahead.First, every time Kamonohashi solves a murder case, he forces the guilty people to kill themselves. How? speaking and with a magical eye or hypnotic look (hypinoze, power or whatever), we don't know how he does it or what it is, and neither does he, since he does it unconsciously and without wanting to, and therefore That's why he stopped investigating and solving cases, so he wouldn't kill anyone anymore.oks, thats great! We already know how it works right away in the first episode! and our dear other protagonist (TOTO) who witnesses everything also right? RIGHT???? (at least it should be like that)! got it? great!Even though our other protagonist is a talking donkey, he should already understand how this works after seeing it happen 3 times in front of him, right? RIGHT???????????? dammmm this guy is an adult and works as a detective! Did he pay someone to take his tests and solve all his work until he got to where he is now? wtf!! WELL! Even if that was the case, man, I'm not a detective or a genius, but hey, I got it the first time I saw it... and this motherfucker didn't understand how it actually worked until episode 5? wtf! damn it...So let's ignore the fact this protagonist is THIS STUPID for now and move on...and all the other people living in this world? Even when he clearly orders people to kill themselves in front of police officers, detectives, or ordinary people, everyone is seeing him doing it, and they clearly see the other person obeying the order.Then you ask yourself: oh, they saw him do that, so they're going to question him about it, right? RIGHT?????????????????????no! they simply completely ignore all of his actions from the point he enters this state, no one ever, I say never, questions him about it after preventing the culprit from committing suicide! except in the first episode when the other protagonist (Toto) does this.anyway, they never question this phenomenon happening in front of their eyes, clearly caused by him.Who the H E L L in the world wouldn't question something like that? WTF investigators, police officers and people live in this world are doing? THEY ARE BRAIN DEAD OR WHAT???? In other words, we have to accept that everyone simply ignores what happened every time as if it were no big deal (WTF?), and move on with their lives. FUCK THIS PIECE OF CRAP!And now the last point, which is another thing that really piss me off...

You\'ve (probably) heard of Moriarty the Patriot, Sherlock\'s most notorious antagonist who got his own awesome anime adaptation a few years ago. Now fiction\'s most iconic detective returns to anime in the form of Ron Kamonohashi, a genius eccentric detective with a villainous ability that led to him being forbidden from doing detective work.In these types of stories, the protagonist is an everyman like John Watson. In this case, we get Toto, a bottom-tier detective who gets all the cases Division 1 doesn\'t want to waste time on—the agency\'s ""trash bin."" It reminds me a bit of...Zootopia. I like that despite everything being stacked against Toto, he remains optimistic and dedicated. From his perspective, Ron also becomes more mysterious.Like an ideal detective character, Ron has Ranpo\'s ability from Bungou Stray Dogs, where he can deduce what happened immediately and solve a case as soon as he enters the room. Unlike an ideal detective character, Ron also has a secondary, more insidious ability. Without spoiling it, it\'s what leads to the title—with this ability, Ron is unable to legally perform detective work. It\'s a really interesting contrast that adds to both his character and the stakes, since Ron has to keep his detective work secret. It also sets up potential development for Toto, who has to build up his own confidence so he can present and take credit for Ron\'s work.Despite this intrigue and the stakes with Blue, the institute hunting Ron down, the OP is fun and light-hearted. And the ED is hauntingly beautiful. I know lots of anime watchers don\'t care about the OP/ED, but it\'s still part of the anime. So when it emphasizes certain themes or ideas that might be surprising, it stands out.Overall, I recommend this anime if you enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes stories and want something similar. Beyond the Mystery of the Week, there\'s the overarching mystery of Ron\'s ability, but the anime stays light-hearted and funny—Toto\'s gag-worthy reactions to Ron\'s antics are worth watching on their own. ^^ Zootopia.

It doesn't have the kind of swagger that Undead Girl Murder Farce did, and while neither show makes it particularly easy for the audience to figure out what happened (I'd say it's pretty close to impossible in both cases), this one just didn't feel like it had the strong wrap-ups to each of its cases that that one did. It also doesn't have the character-driven emotional elements that make the mysteries of The Apothecary Diaries so enthralling. I hate to compare this anime to other mystery shows, but it's just missing something to separate itself from the...pack even when its mysteries come together in interesting fashion.So, why did I keep watching? Two reasons: the pair of leads that headline this series, and the mysterious supernatural element that drives Ron's story. The former is pretty good. I'm not terribly fond of Ron's character, who is largely just quirky to be quirky (trying to emulate many idiosyncratic characters in a similar vein - more on that later), but I am fond of his partner Toto, despite his relative lack of background. I think they make quite the pair, with the latter functioning as a straight man who grounds the former and keeps his weird eye power from claiming more lives. I don't love that his role as last second lifesaver is the reason they came together, but their development as a pair is interesting, especially given Ron's isolation.As for the supernatural element... yeah, it's not working for me. It's essentially an uncontrollable Geass that forces the accused, at the point that they admit to their guilt or are completely found out, to kill themselves. It's interesting in a way because it gives a reason why Ron is not an active detective, but it's a pretty weak reason, especially as we find out that other characters are aware of this and... did nothing. Why Toto was the first to try to address it is beyond me. Why it exists at all is kind of perplexing. Turns out there's a conspiracy behind it that I won't spoil, but it makes very little sense, and the basis for that conspiracy is depressing.Again, relating back to Undead Girl Murder Farce, I had a problem with the episodes where Sherlock Holmes participates because it felt like the series and its characters could stand by themselves. They didn't need to lean on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but they did anyway. And while I won't spoil the mid-season twist here, it's similarly leaning on outside characters and I don't like it. I appreciate that very little of the series is driven by that element, and it certainly sets up some interesting antagonists for S2 (which I'll watch to see if this goes anywhere), but it's lazy writing, shorthand to explain why Ron and his antagonists are worthy of attention rather than just showing why they are.Overall, this series was at least an interesting watch. I enjoyed watching the murder mysteries play out and the central duo commands some worthy attention, but the central plot thread just doesn't work for me, at least not yet. The first season answers so few questions and introduces more. I'm hoping for better from S2. pack even when its mysteries come together in interesting fashion.So, why did I keep watching?

Begining is what left me a bad impression of this show. A guy who's been off the business for so long agrees to get back into business after this guy he's never met his entire life says he would care for him during the action. Truly a very cliche and an unrealistic start to the anime.  About 10 mins is wasted for this. The op detective guy is so boring he doesnt even tries to solve the cases. He literally knows everything. He sees a dead...body and immediately knows the history. He takes more time to explain the murder than the time he takes to solve the case. The mysteries arent mysterious enough, the main detective guy just doesnt lets it become mysterious. The explanation sucks for sure too. It did look like it had some supernatural aspect in the show but  it wasnt, which would have sucked in a detective show. They were just trying to become as unrealistic as possible by giving the main character the ability to kill criminals.After that they added something which I think would not fit in a detective themed anime,  a world class school that produces elite detectives and controls detective world. Ofcourse our main guy was top in the school. There's also a meeting between elite detectives that decide how things should go in detective world. The last anime that I saw where elites had a meeting was Mashle, which makes sense in a world and a story like that, but this is a detective anime. Elites pulling the legs of each other instead of solving cases. Detectives are supposed to solve mysteries and make it interesting for the watchers and not have political matters among themselves.I dont hate the other main character. I do like characters that arent gifted with talents and try hard but still cant produce any results. But the other guy is just so talented. It isnt even interesting to see what he does. The story doesnt even need to be streched for 20 mins, they could have fit 2 stories in a episode. Our guy clearly knows the criminal of the case that takes place in episode 8.  There is no any tension that you would feel when the detectives reach the crime scene and start investigating. No one understands whats going on when our op detective is blabbering about how Im so smart and I solved the case, and then theres one guy that pretends to have understood everything. He isnt even a detective at the moment and just enters the crime scene like its his house.Its more of a comedy, slice of life than mystery. Its not comedy because it has comedy but because its funny how this kind of show exists. The elite school politics is more mysterious than the detective guy solving cases, when that part isnt even the main theme of the show.EDIT: This opinion is just based on those three episodes that I watched. I dont know, things might have changed later on but I dropped the show. I know it doesnt make sense to say that a show is bad by just watching 3 episodes of it but we could say these are the reasons why I couldnt get past 3 episodes. body and immediately knows the history.

I refuse to elaborate further on that subject, figure it out.Plot: Last season we had an Undead Detective, and now we have the Detective who makes you Un-alive. Now that is a plot twist, if I've ever seen one. It is a mystery/psychological Anime that has a ton of comedy woven into it. Though, I'd not be surprised, if at some opportune moment we are introduced to the supernatural. For the moment though, this...seems to be a mystery of the week kind of show.Characters: So we have a 'strange' detective, a naive assosiate, a submissive boss, and a few corpses for characters so far. Nothing really stands out apart from that. Though, like Katekyou Hitman Reborn, I'd not be surprised if this BLUE organization turned out to be a covert community divided into factions, all looking to consolidate power, let's say like the organisation in Katekyou Hitman Reborn.Animation: The animation quality is standard, nothing much to complain about, since there really isn't much to judge from as of now. Though, on a separate note the character designs do indeed look unique. They have certain aura about them.Music: Again, decent, standard BGM, OP and ED. Nothing here to either complain or rave about.Enjoyment: Quite honestly I'm not sure what to feel about this yet. On one hand it has genuinely good elements to look forward to, on the other hand there is a hint of reservation about where this will go. On the whole, I'll probably give it a good 5/6 episodes, if it's good and for you, you'll be sure to find that out by then. seems to be a mystery of the week kind of show.Characters: So we have a 'strange' detective, a naive assosiate, a submissive boss, and a few corpses for characters so far.

This series is far from being perfect but it still managed to become one of my favorite animes with a couple of episodes. Does it something new? Maybe. Or maybe not. We will see. (Warning! This review contains mild spoilers!).Story 7/10Detective animes are nothing new, neither is the concept of seemingly impossible/complicated crimes with lots of tricks and moments that make you wonder: “Does it really work like this?” If your are looking for pure logic in this you won’t be finding it because...the detective tries to pressure culprits into killing themselves with some kind of power (and they would be willing to do so if it wasn’t for his side-kick. And please excuse me for calling him like this but it’s true). So logic is out of the picture here to begin with. But I get that in this case you will still like the cases to make some sense and I understand because I prefer such ones as well. It’s undeniable these cases have some flaws and issues but I’m willing to overlook them for several reasons. Anyway, the story got me interested enough to start reading the manga and you have to know that this isn’t my usual genre. It’s just an interesting concept and what’s more: interesting (and unusual) characters. Solving illogical crimes caused by some silly methods? Everyone can do it. But with style and humor? Ron and his side-kick are exactly what you are looking for (seriously, the humor in this series made me pause a few times just so I could have a good laugh). One problem I think this series will face is that the best part of the main story starts AFTER 13 episodes (much like with many animes). That’s why I’m already hoping for a second season with some portions of brown sugar syrup (if you watch it you’ll understand). Also there are aspects that are totally over-used in Detective series (especially anime) but I don’t mind them so for me they are a bonus that only make me roll my eyes slightly (yes, that’s possible!)Characters 9/10I wanted to give it a 10/10 because of… No, let me just give you the reason why I’m not doing this. It’s because one of the main characters Totomaru a police officer who’s not very good at his job (why did he choose to become a police officer to begin with? I’m wondering about that) and who is the personification of a generic character. And the reason I’ve started to like him has nothing to do with his character himself. Not that he’s horrible or a bad character. He’s actually alright but very, very plain. But somehow it still works. And even though I can only see him as a side-kick he’s very important also for character-development (it’s interesting to have a main character who acts like a supporting character but is still written as a main character). Maybe I’m not fair here and I have nothing against Tototo (to call him as Spitz would do) but if you watch it you gotta admit that even some of the supporting characters have more personality than him (but I do like the fact how he ‘counteracts’ Ron’s power and they become close friends). Speaking of supporting characters; I absolutely love them. Whether it’s Amamiya simping over Ron (can’t blame her) or Spitz being Spitz (I know I didn’t trust or like him in the beginning but that’s why I have regrets). Also in the most recent episode Dr. Mofu was introduced and it’s just so interesting to have a very clumsy surgeon. Nowadays it’s really refreshing to see a female character with a lot of brainpower who isn’t a total girl-boss but has other significant characteristics and strengths which can be useful (and maybe will be in the future?). It’s also nice to see the dynamics between the characters.But my most favorite part of this anime is probably Ron. Right from the moment he first appears in the series you’ll think: he seems like an oddball. And later you will realize: because he really is. With every episode (or even chapter) I love him more. When I first learned about his unusual “power” I was really skeptical and pretty sure I wouldn’t like him or last long enough to finish this series. But with each episode I’m convinced… maybe I’m not normal. There was one situation in the second episode I think will trigger some viewers but I wouldn’t blame this on Ron (but I don’t want to get too deep into spoilers. Also I’m not that far into the manga yet, so some of it is just speculation). I try to separate whatever happens to him after the culprit is convicted with his usual persona which isn’t from this world. He’s also the exact reason why I think Toto – while rather bland – still works as a character and I’m convinced Ron needs someone like him in his life in order to be stable (as it is). I really like and appreciate their friendship. Ron doesn’t simply have a unique personality and a sharp brain (is that even a thing?), he’s also best when it comes to mind-blowing entries. Oh, and most of the humor is thanks to him (for example in episode 3 he pulled out something very unexpected which made me laugh for a few minutes straight and if you think I don’t have a life maybe you’re right). He’s a rather refreshing character because he doesn’t have himself pulled-together but still manages to see through everything and everyone. So let’s just say that the characters of this anime are one of the best aspects and the reason why this series works despite some issues with the writing, lack of logic and even original storylines. The characters make up for it because they are original in their own way.Animation/VA 8/10Most of the time I like the animation and I think the color theme fits perfectly. I didn’t really feel the second episode but especially there this was something that impressed me very much so I think the studio did a great job. Same as with the voice acting and I feel like the cast is perfect. Especially Ron’s VA was probably born for this role. When I looked him up I realized he hasn’t voiced many characters I know but I’ll definitely keep an eye on him and his work since he’s very talented to pull off this eccentric character.Overall 8.5/9Right now I’m torn between giving it a ranking of 8 or 9 because the series itself isn’t anything mind-blowing but it surely caught my attention (for the right reasons). And I value great characters over many other aspects. Of course a good story is vital too but characters are always like the glue that holds them together and this is a perfect case of an anime like this. I don’t think I would have picked up the manga if it wouldn’t have been for this adaptation so I have to give it credit for this. There was some lack of explanation here and there which the manga provided much better in my opinion so at times it might be a little confusing. But hardy anything that couldn’t be overlooked. Again… if you’re looking for pure logic you’re wrong here. But if you are looking for a nice humorous show about an eccentric detective who doesn’t try to copy other existing detectives out there this is the right place/anime for you. Despite its flaws it has some interesting cases that sometimes convince with their simplicity. (The only thing that makes me somehow sad is that I would have wished for a crossover between “Detective Conan” and “Kamonohashi Ron no Kindan Suiri” some day but I know there is one specific reason why it’s very unlikely it will ever happen). Aside from this I’m enjoying it and it could be among my favorite animes of this season. the detective tries to pressure culprits into killing themselves with some kind of power (and they would be willing to do so if it wasn’t for his side-kick. And please excuse me for calling him like this but it’s true). So logic is out of the picture here to begin with. But I get that in this case you will still like the cases to make some sense and I understand because I prefer such ones as well. It’s undeniable these cases have some flaws and issues but I’m willing to overlook them for several reasons. Anyway, the story got me interested enough to start reading the manga and you have to know that this isn’t my usual genre. It’s just an interesting concept and what’s more: interesting (and unusual) characters. Solving illogical crimes caused by some silly methods? Everyone can do it. But with style and humor? Ron and his side-kick are exactly what you are looking for (seriously, the humor in this series made me pause a few times just so I could have a good laugh). One problem I think this series will face is that the best part of the main story starts AFTER 13 episodes (much like with many animes). That’s why I’m already hoping for a second season with some portions of brown sugar syrup (if you watch it you’ll understand). Also there are aspects that are totally over-used in Detective series (especially anime) but I don’t mind them so for me they are a bonus that only make me roll my eyes slightly (yes, that’s possible!)Characters 9/10I wanted to give it a 10/10 because of… No, let me just give you the reason why I’m not doing this. It’s because one of the main characters Totomaru a police officer who’s not very good at his job (why did he choose to become a police officer to begin with? I’m wondering about that) and who is the personification of a generic character. And the reason I’ve started to like him has nothing to do with his character himself. Not that he’s horrible or a bad character. He’s actually alright but very, very plain. But somehow it still works. And even though I can only see him as a side-kick he’s very important also for character-development (it’s interesting to have a main character who acts like a supporting character but is still written as a main character). Maybe I’m not fair here and I have nothing against Tototo (to call him as Spitz would do) but if you watch it you gotta admit that even some of the supporting characters have more personality than him (but I do like the fact how he ‘counteracts’ Ron’s power and they become close friends). Speaking of supporting characters; I absolutely love them. Whether it’s Amamiya simping over Ron (can’t blame her) or Spitz being Spitz (I know I didn’t trust or like him in the beginning but that’s why I have regrets). Also in the most recent episode Dr. Mofu was introduced and it’s just so interesting to have a very clumsy surgeon. Nowadays it’s really refreshing to see a female character with a lot of brainpower who isn’t a total girl-boss but has other significant characteristics and strengths which can be useful (and maybe will be in the future?). It’s also nice to see the dynamics between the characters.But my most favorite part of this anime is probably Ron. Right from the moment he first appears in the series you’ll think: he seems like an oddball. And later you will realize: because he really is. With every episode (or even chapter) I love him more. When I first learned about his unusual “power” I was really skeptical and pretty sure I wouldn’t like him or last long enough to finish this series. But with each episode I’m convinced… maybe I’m not normal. There was one situation in the second episode I think will trigger some viewers but I wouldn’t blame this on Ron (but I don’t want to get too deep into spoilers. Also I’m not that far into the manga yet, so some of it is just speculation). I try to separate whatever happens to him after the culprit is convicted with his usual persona which isn’t from this world. He’s also the exact reason why I think Toto – while rather bland – still works as a character and I’m convinced Ron needs someone like him in his life in order to be stable (as it is). I really like and appreciate their friendship. Ron doesn’t simply have a unique personality and a sharp brain (is that even a thing?), he’s also best when it comes to mind-blowing entries. Oh, and most of the humor is thanks to him (for example in episode 3 he pulled out something very unexpected which made me laugh for a few minutes straight and if you think I don’t have a life maybe you’re right). He’s a rather refreshing character because he doesn’t have himself pulled-together but still manages to see through everything and everyone. So let’s just say that the characters of this anime are one of the best aspects and the reason why this series works despite some issues with the writing, lack of logic and even original storylines. The characters make up for it because they are original in their own way.Animation/VA 8/10Most of the time I like the animation and I think the color theme fits perfectly. I didn’t really feel the second episode but especially there this was something that impressed me very much so I think the studio did a great job. Same as with the voice acting and I feel like the cast is perfect. Especially Ron’s VA was probably born for this role. When I looked him up I realized he hasn’t voiced many characters I know but I’ll definitely keep an eye on him and his work since he’s very talented to pull off this eccentric character.Overall 8.5/9Right now I’m torn between giving it a ranking of 8 or 9 because the series itself isn’t anything mind-blowing but it surely caught my attention (for the right reasons). And I value great characters over many other aspects. Of course a good story is vital too but characters are always like the glue that holds them together and this is a perfect case of an anime like this. I don’t think I would have picked up the manga if it wouldn’t have been for this adaptation so I have to give it credit for this. There was some lack of explanation here and there which the manga provided much better in my opinion so at times it might be a little confusing. But hardy anything that couldn’t be overlooked. Again… if you’re looking for pure logic you’re wrong here. But if you are looking for a nice humorous show about an eccentric detective who doesn’t try to copy other existing detectives out there this is the right place/anime for you. Despite its flaws it has some interesting cases that sometimes convince with their simplicity. (The only thing that makes me somehow sad is that I would have wished for a crossover between “Detective Conan” and “Kamonohashi Ron no Kindan Suiri” some day but I know there is one specific reason why it’s very unlikely it will ever happen). Aside from this I’m enjoying it and it could be among my favorite animes of this season.', 'Ron Kamonohashi’s Forbidden Deductions is pretty fun. I don’t have too much to say about this season other than it’s a fun buddy cop mystery anime. The dynamic between Totomaru Isshiki and Ron Kamonohashi is a lot of fun to watch and the mysteries that these two solve are engaging and always keep me invested every week. I really like how each new mystery in this season introduces an entirely new set of side characters which helps keep the interactions between the two main characters and the rest of the supporting cast fresh and exciting. This anime also introduces an overarching plotline involving some secret...organizations and all of this ties into the titular character’s special abilities as well as his backstory, and I’m really invested in it. I assume the second season will focus more on this storyline but this season primarily centers on building and strengthening the dynamic between Isshiki and Kamonohashi. The only major complaint that I have with this anime is that many of the deductions made when attempting to solve the mysteries are mainly from Kamonohashi, and at first I didn’t mind this since Isshiki was an inexperienced detective in the earlier episodes, but Kamonohashi constantly doing around 70-80% of the sleuthing doesn’t really help Isshiki grow and improve his skills, despite Ron giving him all the credit for solving the various cases throughout this season. Isshiki does see some subtle character development, but I’d like for future seasons to not have Isshiki depend on Kamonohashi so much and have him fully solve a case all on his own. Other than that, this anime is very serviceable in being a good mystery series with many fun twists and turns throughout the entirety of the show so far. organizations and all of this ties into the titular character’s special abilities as well as his backstory, and I’m really invested in it.

And rather than solely depending on synthesizing everything that\'s explained or spoken aloud, there are often visual clues that can slip by. It\'s one of the rare animes where they actually follow the rule of ""show, don\'t tell""! Just be aware that the mysteries are pretty fast-paced; rather than depending on stretching out mysteries to...keep viewers in suspense, cases are usually solved within 1 or 2 episodes while progressing the overarching plot in tandem.Is the show filled with cliches? Absolutely, and so much so that it borderlines parody. But the story-telling on display is a fine example that cliches don\'t inherently harm the enjoyment of a show as long as those cliches are well executed. Rather than turning up her nose at the classic detective tropes, its clear the source author just wanted to have fun with said tropes, and I think that\'s the perfect approach when watching this show: just have fun with it, and enjoy it for what it is. keep viewers in suspense, cases are usually solved within 1 or 2 episodes while progressing the overarching plot in tandem.Is the show filled with cliches?

The female mangaka best known for her series Katekyou Hitman Reborn!, which was featured in Shueisha\'s Weekly Shonen Jump as one of the top guns alongside the Big 3 at the time, is now, over 20 years later,...a franchise that I can recommend to anyone wanting to experience a true and pure classic Shonen series. But her later series of the sci-fi adventure ēlDLIVE which (for some reason) was also serialized in the same publishing company\'s Shonen Jump+ spin-off, garnered a teeny-tiny fraction of her previous juggernaut series, and even with Studio Pierrot\'s Winter 2017 anime, it really didn\'t do much for the community expecting something new out of the acclaimed mangaka.With the failure of ēlDLIVE, while sticking to the same publication platform, comes the brand-new gob-smacking mystery crime series in the form of Kamonohashi Ron no Kindan Suiri a.k.a Ron Kamonohashi\'s Forbidden Deduction, released in October 2020, with Diomedea\'s anime adaptation just 3 years later. And the series, despite the recommendation from Takarajimasha\'s Kono Mystery ga Sugoi! a.k.a This Mystery is Excellent!\'s winning mystery writers, with one of them (Sako Aizawa) praising the series as ""an ""authentic mystery manga for the new era"" with its fast pacing, as well as the tricks and logic used to identify the culprit"", the anime (and its manga source material) may not be neither bad nor garbage, but is rather bland and mediocre, and a draggy slog to sit through.What Akira Amano has done here in this series is to take the ever-so-loving tried-and-true formula of Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes and give it her take of the Shonen genre by mashing the personalities of both protagonist (Sherlock Holmes) and antagonist (William James Moriarty) into one person, and that\'s how we get the series\' titular character: Ron Kamonohashi, the aforementioned deranged private detective with an affinity to send culprits to their deaths once the confessions are sounded. This, coupled with the fact that he was involved in an incident where he was found guilty, resulted in his detective license being revoked and him being expelled from the detective training academy, thus isolating him in the process. His saviour, who would get him back into sleuthing, is the rather unremarkable Totomaru ""Toto"" Isshiki, assigned by his superior Amamiya of the Metropolitan Police Department. Toto looks the part of a typical police detective, though he\'s rather unrefined and looks cowardly at first glance. That is, until Amamiya requested him to look for Ron, to which he slowly improved his craft, playing the part of Holmes\'s assistant John Watson, sometimes becoming like Holmes himself, and setting the goal of avoiding Ron\'s supernatural killing instinct for the culprits.The problem with the entire series, as much as it\'s being marketed as a Shonen work, is that it\'s pretty much bread and butter when it comes to detective works. Sure, you have your usual evildoer group that landed Ron being the bad guy in the first place, but the cases are very cookie-cutter to the point that no matter how the case looks and feels, it starts and ends exactly one and the same. There are slight movements when it comes to Ron\'s overarching motive to sniff out those responsible for his expulsion, but it\'s very methodical and slow at the same time. Even the other characters that come onboard to both Toto and Ron\'s sleuthing campaign are really nothing special, made worse by the fact that Akira Amano chose to stick to the tried-and-true tropes of what works and what doesn\'t and doesn\'t even improve on her writing at all. It\'s just a shame that even in ēlDLIVE that the mangaka herself was entering into new territory that feels cheap but fresh, but in the case of Ron Kamonohashi, it looks as if she has just completely given up on writing a compelling work, the likes of which we\'ll never see the Katekyou Hitman Reborn! revival once again in time to come.The aspects where I have the least problems are with the production and music. In-house director Shota Ibata did decent with Diomedea on the production side of things, which looks good, but honestly, this is pretty much what I\'ve expected for anything out of the studio. The music is also decent, with Unison Square Garden and Hockrockb\'s OP and ED songs, though not particularly memorable.What\'s even worse is that we had a detective series in the form of novelist Yuugo Aosaki\'s Undead Girl Murder Farce last season, and I declared that as my new favourite detective series of all time, being a masterpiece work. So going forward, the detective sleuthing bar is quite high, and no matter how many seasons the production committee decides to pump out of this (since Season 2 has already seemingly been confirmed before the anime started), it\'ll never change my perception that Akira Amano\'s newest series, if you take it as anything BUT a detective-themed story, its comedy will definitely either be or not be for you.Be it as it may, Akira Amano has already lost her magic, and Ron Kamonohashi, is an abject failure on a crime-solving mystery level.

Sure, there are other mystery shows like Conan, Moriarty The Patriot that sorta has comedy here and there? but it\'s not entirely the main focus. Comedy is subjective at the end of the day but Ron\'s comedic moments does sit well for me which is okay in my bookThe characters are obviously a tons of fun and the dynamic duo between Ron and Toto (which is obviously a parallel of Reborn and Tsuna with a bit of Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson respectively) is arguably one of the best parts of the show.

If I consider this as a comedy and detective - it was quite good, I laughed a lot and tried to guess the mysteries with them (sometimes even simultaneously guessed which imo is not an advantage for the series of this genre).

While I often turn my brain off watching detective things so I can fully enjoy them cracking the cases, this anime didn't give me any thrill. I was basically able to guess all the culprits way ahead of time, and there was no interesting plot twist, until a certain one that had completely no foreshadowing.While Ron is probably supposed to be somewhat eccentric and funny, I thought he was mainly just incredibly weird. For Toto, I had hope that he would...grow into his own as a detective, but either there was not enough time in 13eps for him to do that under Ron's shadow, or he was never destined for character development.The cases were nearly all 1 episode ones, except for a particular few which were slightly more interesting. There are no connection between each cases, and were basically stand alone episodes. I thought the connection between each cases/episodes could've been done way better.Then there's the magic bit which I find annoying, why was magic even incorporated into an anime about sleuthing? And it's funny how Toto just can't help but wait until the last milisecond to do something about this everytime it happens.It was just up until the last episode that things started to get a little bit more interesting, but at this point, I have no motivation to continue on to season 2, where hopefully there is a more interesting plotline.But while I've gone on about how terrible this anime was, I still slightly enjoyed it as a time-passing thing, but only watch this if you really have nothing else to do or watch.

In fact anime has its positive parts but also some mistakes and cliché.First, there is some connection towards one of the famous detectives and stories from the books. I get the idea of the story and author who tried to build upon that, but I personally didn\'t find it fascinating. More like I had ""what? why?"" moment when there started being some hints around it. As it really didn\'t develop story any further and it\'s more likely just some base concept to build on....Which is a pitty, because even without that it could be a very solid anime.Second, it lacks of some funny moments. There are a few of them, not enough yet... Despite being a detective story, you still should have some level of humour in it.Third, detective stories on their own are nice, however, anime is skipping some important parts while searching for clues and such. When you make a detective story, you want to captivate reader\'s/watcher\'s attention and drag him into the story. And that didn\'t always happen here. Some stories simply didn\'t care about this aspect, some stories did it well.Fourth, main characters are really well built and it\'s creating a very funny yet serious duo. At first I thought I will find this boring, after all you have mastermind detective able to solve anything but can\'t be solving mysteries, on the other hand you have quite simple guy who isn\'t at his level but is something as his puppet.

Ron\'s strength and Totomaru\'s admiration create a unique and appealing dynamic at the core of the series.However, the anime stumbles when it comes to the mysteries presented. Unfortunately, they lack the excitement needed to captivate the audience. The cases Ron tackles, while attempting to be unique, end up feeling rather mundane and fail to bring the anticipated level of intrigue.The show aims for suspense but struggles to deliver, leaving viewers wanting more from the mysteries to keep them hooked. Additionally, the limited...cast of characters within the series contributes to a sense of emptiness, missing an opportunity to diversify and enrich the storytelling.In conclusion, ""Ron Kamonohashi\'s Forbidden Deductions"" has its strengths, particularly in character dynamics, but falls short in delivering thrilling mysteries. The unique cases, while attempting to be distinct, miss the mark, and a lack of diverse characters hampers the anime from reaching its full potential.

It\'s not a masterpiece, and doesn\'t need to be.If one watches it with the expectation of witnessing mind-blowing mysteries, they will be sorely disappointed. Most of the mysteries in this season seem rather predictable, but some end up having a certain twist, all of which are both believable and realistic. However, that is but one part of the show.Isshiki and Ron are two sides of the same coin : they are plagued by loneliness. The difference between them is that, while Isshiki mixes well with his colleagues and is mostly cast aside...by superiors for his lack of skill, Ron lives life as a recluse due to his past with sleuthing.Ron is basically an eccentric Sherlock Holmes... so he\'s basically Sherlock Holmes (he turns out to be a descendant of both Holmes and Moriarty so that\'s something). He goes about sleuthing with his own twist : he wishes to ""avenge"" the dead. He seemingly converses with the corpse, goes over everything that could have happened, and then it suddenly all seems to click together in a satisfying manner. It makes the viewer think, but also guides those who switch their brain off through the mystery.Most mysteries are covered in an episode or two, and that helps the series as it makes it incredibly well paced. Most main characters have their own personalities, and feel like actual characters rather than gimmicks made for comedic purpose. On that note, most of the comedy feels natural and is actually funny. Jokes are mostly non-repetitive, and are almost never forced.The compelling parts of the story are not massively explored : we don\'t know much from Ron\'s past apart from the Bloody Training Incident and the House of M is not prevalent in this season. However, the show focuses more on its existing characters, makes them build friendships and business relations, rather than rapidly expanding its cast in its overflowing ambition.The art in this show is not too different from the standard. While great, it is quite similar to other art styles of most other show. What it absolutely is, is polished. Most scenes are really well animated, and the character designs themselves are somewhat innovative. Sometimes, the music is standard. Other times, it is absolutely stunning, especially the violin sequences. Above all, music complements the scenes rather than making them.

Some of the plot feels very forced as well, just written up to advance the story/make the characters more legit..etc. However the show is fairly entertaining and has a good pace. It does incorportate some sort of a semi 'supernatural' element towards to the end with the underlying storyline. Not sure where they are heading with that but looking forward to see if they come out with another season. "", 'Promising Detective AnimeLooks good the synopsis. Always enjoy detective or cop anime where slice of life and comedy mixed well. Hope this is the case too.Another good thing about this cop or crime anime is the cases being showcased in the series. This breaks the monotonous feel of the series. The only thing constant is the development of the partnership plus a few supporting characters namely the chief of the investigation section 1.By the end of the series, you most likely would like to have another series to see how the partnership went. And hopefully the studio will grant that wish.

I mean, an illegal (ILLEGAL!) detective who rolls Nat 20s on the KYS gambit? It's insane. It's ridiculous. I adore it. The murders are contrived, often guess-able, and more likely than not you're not invited to be part of the investigation, because Ron takes one look and bangs it out, while Toto (I say, adoringly), blunders his way about like the empty-headed one-brain-cell dolt he is.There is much to criticise about this show.But....God, I loved it. It's so silly it works. The characters make me laugh. The plot makes me ask if the show is being for real. I gasp at the ridiculousness, the sheer 'now this is quality content' of it all. I would watch this again. I would recommend my friends to watch this. In for a silly time where you just giggle at the way Ron is being soo annoying, yet so competent? This is for you.

My only gripe with the show is that it does not really establish what the main conflict of the show is going to be until very late into the season.

I hope that this series will actually resolve the long term conflict of the...show unlike Detective Conan where he just stays a kid forever. show unlike Detective Conan where he just stays a kid forever."", 'For a crime-solving anime, it felt like I had to get a lobotomy just to get through the anime ""Ron Kamonohashi\'s Forbidden Deductions."" It centers around Isshiki (cool first name, by the way – mouthpiece character) Totomaru, who is pretty clumsy at his job as a detective, if I were to phrase it delicately, and our titular character Ron Kamonohashi, a world-class detective. Due to an incident in his past, he is unable to do what, as he puts it, was his one and only true calling in his life – to solve mysteries. With the pair banding together, we kick off the anime, solving...mysteries and making friends along the way.People watching this will be getting their conspiracy yarn out, linking Ron and Yuji (henceforth I will be referring to Isshiki Totomaru as Yuji because a. they have the same VA and b. Yuji, minus the monstrous strength and all the cool JJK powers, equals Isshiki) with the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. If you squint really, really hard enough, you probably made the connection. But oh baby, this anime really takes the cake for putting public characters like Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty at the core of this world inside the anime.So, if I go by the logic in this world, if I\'m someone who is really good at solving mysteries, I must be a descendant of S.H. Or if I\'m really good at doing crime rather than solving it, I must be a descendant of J.M. or the House of M, as the anime so eloquently puts it. I have to say, it sounds really cool on paper, and I believe it\'s genuinely a unique take. But the story has no depth to it; characters are all pretty surface level and bland, except for Spitz Feier. Man, I love everything about his character – his design, his story arc, and just how much of an overall goodboi he is.But getting back on topic, throughout the series, no one is shown to have developed any part of their character. Except for Ron, who we are told was a lone wolf in the past, I guess, and now he has friends. This development was indicated to us almost always verbally by Ron himself, telling Yuji he has no friends, and now Yuji is his friend, or Ron\'s instructor telling Yuji he did get along with his fellow classmates during detective college. And Yuji, I thought, somewhere along the way, Yuji would contemplate his role as just a mouthpiece for Ron to solve mysteries and would revolt against him, which would have been a huge leap for his personality to evolve. But it seems that he can\'t make that jump yet.In its 13th episode, it is revealed that the principal of the detective college was, in fact, an acquaintance of Ron\'s parents and reminiscing past events that took place which got Ron kicked out from college and barred from doing detective work. The episode wraps up when the principal believes in Ron\'s innocence and wants to reinstate him as a detective someday. Still, after hearing all this, Yuji just sits there, listening to this.I\'m a cynical person, and because of that, this type of character does not fly with me. I\'d imagine Yuji getting a slap in the face when a thought like Ron getting a detective license and flying off to other countries to solve mysteries worldwide and Yuji just stuck, racking his brains over one crime crosses his mind. I admit there were moments where the mouthpiece relationship between Ron and Yuji gets found out, and yet Yuji still remains the same. He does not worry about his abilities compared to Ron\'s, nor does he care about the credit received from crimes solved by Ron. At the end of the day, he just wants to help people and see the smile on Ron\'s face. Just incredible, isn\'t it? I won\'t be watching season 2. These are the things I\'m still curious about: 1) the cat, 2) the sparkling eye thing. I\'ll probably read the manga at some point for that.Hmm, this was such a shit rant. It\'s been a shit year for me. Anyways, if someone is reading, you should watch this. You should explore as many things that life can offer, and who knows, maybe you\'ll like it.

It felt like it was a very good and self-aware parody of the ""detective"" genre of anime that has been coming out.  The comedy was always on point, and even in the second half that didn\'t stop delivering.  The show\'s creators are great with comedy and slapstick.The issue is that they devolve into their own cliches and cease being a parody when they seriously bring up the House of M and Sherlock Holmes Bloodlines stuff.  They\'re not doing that in a...satirical manner, they\'re trying to drive the show with that plot.  At that point not only did the show enter groanworthy territory but it also started taking itself way too seriously.  It would have been much better off as a straight-up parody whose overarching plotline was also a parody, but they decided to go the ambiguous ""are we serious or are we joking"" route.I want to recommend it but I don\'t know if I\'ll keep going with the second season.  It seems like it could have been a lot better.  But it gets a 7 instead of a 6 because it has solid comedy that doesn\'t fail to deliver. satirical manner, they\'re trying to drive the show with that plot.

The leader of the prison seems to be very interested in Naruto, and I mentioned it before; it's because he's a Jinchuriki.Even in movies such as this, I'm always waiting for the big moment! A moment where I will be shocked and excited! But really, in this movie there were times that something very 'plot twisting' would be revealed, and I would think to myself “Oh, was that supposed to be a secret?” I honestly thought it was just common knowledge.The reason I didn't really love the plot to this was because it wasn't what I was hoping for. From the trailer, it gave the impression that this would be a very dark, mysterious film! Wasn't quite the same. Darker than some of the plots in Naruto, sure, but we've seen better. Not much mystery either.I would say the entire plot was 20% action and then 80% talking. The final battle of the movie was pretty exciting though, just something to look forward to!Art: 6 (Fair)Not quite to the level of being 'good'.I personally enjoyed the darker setting (literally darker), a lot of it took place inside of this prison with no lights except for the torch lights. Which added a nice touch for the so called Blood-Prison. There were times that the art look fantastic! The setting would be perfect, nicely detailed background and the characters blended in with it well. However, there were also times that I really felt like the art reached an entire new level of awkward. The characters would occasionally move very oddly, as though all their bones had been replaced with cartilage or they were being held up by strings like a puppet. The bodies just moved in weird ways sometimes.Majority of the art was just your average cel-shading / anime style shading. Nothing too spectacular or breathtaking.Sound: 7 (Good)One thing the anime Naruto does have going for it is the voice acting.Say what you want, but I think Takeuchi Junko does a fantastic job as Naruto, she has a great range of emotions and really captures moments beautifully!Now there's two new characters that appear in this movie that played main roles.First being Mui, our (supposed) antagonist of the movie played by Terasoma Masaki. He's been in a handful of shows, but doesn't often play main characters. He has a nice deep voice. One of the things that bothered me was the lack of emotion expressed for the majority of the movie, though that was a problem with the character and not the voice actor himself.Our other voice actor to look at is Sonozaki Mie, playing the role of Ryuuzetsu. Although she is also a fairly unknown voice actor, she does a pretty good job as Ryuuzetsu. But like Mui, Ryuuzetsu doesn't have much time to shine, at least for the most part of the movie. There are a few rare moments (more toward the end) that she gets to show off her talent of voice acting, but just her average talking was well balanced and wasn't at all annoying to listen to! I can't always say that for the girl characters in anime...Lastly the music! From my experience with Naruto movies, the music had never really stood out to me. Just felt more like background noise, nothing to add on to the scene. I can happily say that this movie did in fact have some nice music that went perfectly with the scenes. During a final battle you want the music to be exciting and intense! The songs used during the last battle were the ones that stood out the most to me, they really added on to the scene nicely!Character: 7 (Good)I'd go anywhere between 6 and 7 on character. There are times when I feel like a character progressed or revealed something interesting about themselves which made me like them more or at least became more interested in them.Naruto – We all know him and his character. A fairly happy guy, stays strong and optimistic most of the time and is all in all a great Shounen character. In this movie, Naruto was forced to act without the use of his Chakra (or at least a very small amount of it) which is quite a change from the other movies or the show. For him, when in doubt he creates about 5000 versions of himself. With the majority of his Chakra taken away, he can hardly maintain the use of one “shadow clone”. That's one of the things I enjoyed seeing in this movie, watching Naruto take action without his usual tricks.Mui – You know...I'd love to say he was a good movie villain, but when you think about it, he's just like any other bad-guy... just lacks a bit on the crazy evil side. Nothing flashy or unique about him. His goals and plans are no different than the ones we've seen in previous Naruto arcs. Not to mention, he's kind of a jackass in ways that other villains weren't. For example, taking the time to beat the snot out of Naruto and several other prisoners when they can't even use their full strength since their strength has been taken away from them. That just seems low, even for an evil guy. But some things are revealed later about his 'true intentions' and even then, it's not that unique.Ryuuzetsu – She was actually a much better character than I expected her to be. She stays beside Naruto for the majority of the movie, helping him out in any way she can, and surprisingly she wasn't a damsel in distress! A girl that can fight and doesn't cry over every little thing? Hell yes I want her in the movie!Enjoyment & Overall: 7 (Good)Even though parts of the movie were slow, it was definitely a step-up from the last Naruto movie! Better characters, better plot and better fighting than the 4th movie.Was it everything I wanted it to be? No, I was really hoping for a more intense movie. But all together it was a decent movie.If you're a Naruto fan, I'd recommend this movie to you. If not, then I doubt you would even consider watching it in the first place. But if by chance you haven't seen Naruto and just want to watch this movie for fun, I'd say that's most likely a bad idea, I can't guarantee you would enjoy it.I'm glad I took the time to watch it though, I hope that if you watch this movie you will enjoy it as well. isn't much to spoil anyway.Naruto is brought to this prison, and when I say in the middle of nowhere I mean out in the middle of the ocean on an island, completely cut off from the rest of the world.

This one is ok, but it has it's faults.Story - Naruto has been sent to prison for attacking the Raikage, well right off the bat thats just stupid, how would Naruto even know how to get to the Hidden Cloud Village let alone come up with an effective plan to attack the Raikage and succeed in killing him, how overpowered is the Raikage compared to Naruto? So some guy (Mui) put a seal on him and trys to suck his chakra out to...fill a box of dreams (...) and make a wish, well isn't that just dandy, why don't you throw in a magical cape which helps bowel disorders why don't you...You won't like the ending either, you'll just think the Hidden Leaf Village is stupid for not telling Naruto, he's not a moron as you all think. Would have been easier to just raid the prison.Art - Typical Naruto art, same as always.Sound - It's a good soundtrack better than the last films soundtrack anyway.Character - I'm only addressing the movie characters; Mui is a unemotional idiot who looks to be the main bad guy but turns out he isn't, no real skill except the seal which in my opinion is just underhanded, fight fair fool. Ryuzetsu looks weird and you can't really tell if it's a girl or boy at first, has a really useless jutsu which makes levitating fire lanturns which do nothing. Finally there's Muku which turns into a monster with no original design, looked like Timcanpy (D.Grey-Man) crossed with a Shinigami from Death Note, not scary and too overpowered for a movie character, shouldn't need anymore than Killer Bee to take it down (stupid box of dreams - like I care what it's real name is).Enjoyment - Prison idea was alright if Naruto was chasing a escapee from the Prison not if he was the prisoner, again does not make sense. Did not enjoy it.Overall - Meh, it's ok, but the plot could of been better if they did my above idea as it would of made more sense in the Naruto world.Positives - Good concept if done right.Negatives - Everything else.Thanks for Reading - AkatsukiBuzai - Kuroagi fill a box of dreams (...) and make a wish, well isn't that just dandy, why don't you throw in a magical cape which helps bowel disorders why don't you...You won't like the ending either, you'll just think the Hidden Leaf Village is stupid for not telling Naruto, he's not a moron as you all think.

Naruto the character is a privileged bastard in no place to tell other people how to live, but that's all he ever does in these. When he's surrounded by only movie-exclusive characters with no compelling designs or backgrounds, I couldn't care any less.I'm not sure if this movie...had any particular saving grace to make it better than The Lost Tower, but at least it didn't have anything as insulting as failing to have Naruto interact with his dad.

Plotwise, it was horrible.Admittedly, I derived my entertainment from the scrambling to keep it PG while leaving enough Freudian material to keep adults amused. ', ""**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**After the disappointing fourth Naruto: Shippuuden movie we move onto the next which I found to be an actual good Naruto movie.Story: (4/10)The story of Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 5 - Blood Prison begins with the Raikage getting attacked by a mysterious person who then reveals himself to be Naruto and after fighting for a bit he eventually eventually escapes from the Raikage. Later, Tsunade banishes Naruto to a far away prison with Naruto claiming that he had been framed. Once Naruto gets to the prison he will soon notice that there is a sinister plan brewing. One of the...problems I had with the story is how everyone in Konoha soon tells Naruto that it was their plan to send Naruto to this prison so he could discover if there is something going on in the prison but couldn't they have just sent some people over there to check if there was something over there instead of just sending Naruto to a prison and leaving him there for a few days until he figures that there is something happening. I found many things that didn't make any sense in the story. An example of that would be how Naruto leaves a shadow clone in his jail cell to gather natural energy for his Sage form even though there was a seal placed on him that intensely burns him if he ever uses any chakra in the prison and is it even possible for a shadow clone to gather energy if the host is using energy to produce the shadow clone? Another thing that didn't make any sense was how Naruto is still able to use chakra and move around even though he got impaled by the main antagonist and leaving him with a gigantic hole in his stomach but I guess this is a Shounen movie/anime so it gets a pass. One of the positive things about the story is how Naruto uses his Sage mode because he never uses that form again after the Pain arc. Another positive thing about the story is how Naruto finally uses some variety in his attacks in the fight scenes instead of just spamming Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan.Art and Animation: (6/10)The art in this movie is much more visually appealing than the art in the fourth movie. The animation in the movie was good and helped the action scenes be more impactful.Sound: (5/10)I really don't know what to say about the soundtrack other than it was generic and very forgettable. The voice actors did a good job voicing the characters like always.Characters: (5/10)I think that the characters had been much more well done than any other Naruto movie I have seen so far but there are some problems with the characters like how many of them were unnecessary and pushed in. An example of this would be in the final fight in the movie because all the characters from Konoha came to all fight the main antagonist. Naruto's shenanigans of trying to escape from the prison were fun to watch but they would show how much of an idiot Naruto is. An example of this would be in the scene when he is talking to Ryuuzetsu and she says that if he escapes he would have no proof of his innocence but Naruto says he doesn't care and jumps into the ocean which is being very violent with its tides and whirlpools it is causing which causes Naruto to nearly get killed but Ryuuzetsu jumps in and saves him. Ryuuzetsu who is one of our main characters in this movie is pretty well developed throughout the movie but she just lacked the screen time to fully be a good character. Two villains in the movie are actually somewhat well developed while the rest are just one dimensional.Enjoyment: (5/10)The action scenes were good and there was some character development in it.Overall: (5/10)Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 5 - Blood Prison is good for a Naruto movie and I think it is the best Naruto movie so far. problems I had with the story is how everyone in Konoha soon tells Naruto that it was their plan to send Naruto to this prison so he could discover if there is something going on in the prison but couldn't they have just sent some people over there to check if there was something over there instead of just sending Naruto to a prison and leaving him there for a few days until he figures that there is something happening.

Two villains in the movie are actually somewhat well developed while the rest are just one dimensional.Enjoyment: (5/10)The action scenes were good and there was some character development in it.Overall: (5/10)Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 5 - Blood Prison is good for a Naruto movie and I think it is the best Naruto movie so far."", 'This is the eighth Naruto movie, made around the time of the Kage Summit, after Raikage is introduced. The movie’s premise is quite absurd and it’s an easy way to dislike it in just the first few minutes. In fact, it is tormenting with the protagonist for so long, it is better suited for people who DISLIKE the anime and not people who are still fans. Seriously you guys, you must watch this only if you dig the idea of watching Naruto being molested by prison guards, ravaged by dogs, acting like a prison bitch, saved by useless girls, and constantly rolling over on mud...or stormy waters without having the slightest superpower… And that is why I liked it, lol. This is a movie made fo the haters and it’s great service. So please, consider all my remarks that follow as sadistic satisfaction out of a franchise that is now a joke.The movie begins with Raikage discussing with his personal team about a weird hidden box that can fulfill wishes. This will make you think it is the objective of this movie but trust me, it’s not. Immediately afterwards someone who resembles Naruto attacks them and although he fails, the whole scene makes no sense. He uses a sleeping gas that knocks out elite ninjas in seconds! If they had such a thing why didn’t they use it all these years more often? Anyways, as soon as the assassin escapes they all wake up immediately and stand up like nothing much happened and we get the first lol of the movie with what Raikage comments about this.“Forget about the whole box crisis that can destroy the world. Just change our priorities to taking Naruto to prison.”HAHAHA!The second scene is about apprehending Naruto back in Leaf Village. Anyone with even basic knowledge of what is going on with the show will immediately laugh at what Tsunade is commenting.“Hey Naruto, I know you are the hero of legend who saved our asses a dozen times but now we have this guy who resembles you so we must send you to prison. Don’t mind how every rookie ninja in the world can easily disguise himself to look like anyone he likes; we will just pretend you traveled half the world, killed several ninjas in three different countries, and returned here before dinner to just tell us it wasn’t you. Now get into that cage and cry like a bitch fool!”HAHAHA! (this later is proven to be a troll btw)The third scene is about him taken to prison, where his powers are stripped… and so are his clothes as he is strip searched for possible weapons he may be hiding in … hard to notice body areas. Yeah guards, molest that defenseless cute little gay boy!HAHAHA!The next part takes almost half the movie, as Naruto constantly tries to escape in order to prove his innocence … which by now is already taken by the guards, lol. And how exactly do you prove you are innocent by becoming an escape convict? Anyways, since his powers are drained in this place, he is incapable to even throw a punch before dropping on four and twitching like his tummy hurts. And as he is constantly trying to escape he ends up being beaten like a bitch by the warden, tied up on a torture table, ravaged by guard dogs, and almost gets drowned and is saved by a girl, which as we all know is the most useless creature in the Narutoverse. What a lovely way to see that gay ninja getting his ass served on a plate every 5 minutes.HAHAHA!Now this prison is one weird place. First of all, there are no prison uniforms; all the convicts still wear their regular ninja uniforms. So even if we pretend Naruto has a wardrobe full of identical clothes, in this place he is wearing the same clothes for months. He must stink like a pig, unless the clothes magically mend and he has out of screen baths. DON’T DROP THE SOAP NARUTO! The security of this place is a complete joke, as Naruto manages to get out of his cell three times in ten minutes. It took longer to do that in those old Jrpgs I used to play. And the punishment for trying to escape is just spending a few days in isolation, where he shits and pisses in a 3X3 room. Priceless! And his beard (or whiskers) doesn’t grow not even an inch all this time. I bet he doesn’t even have beard to grow yet. Or his balls didn’t drop. Anyways, in that isolation instead of learning the hard way not to try to escape, he instead grows even more restless to get out of this place. Nice reform system they have here. He also conveniently learns by a passing-byer that by beating the warden his powers will return. Oh the great things one learns in prison, only to return after his release as a law-abiding citizen.Oh, speaking of law-abiding, all inmates in that place are ninjas who failed in a mission and were accused by their villages of being soft or traitors for that. So practically everyone in there is an assassin who failed in killing all the defenseless women and children his superiors ordered him to off and was caught afterwards. So imagine Naruto’s face when he is surprised to hear how people are imprisoned for NOT killing more children and women.“What are you talking about? We are ninjas; we do not kill people. We only save nations by beating bad guys!”Fifteen years in the field and that dumbass still has no idea what the hell his profession is all about! Not to mention all the hundreds of ninja assassins he fought all his life.But anyways, his constant determination to escape makes the rest of the inmates to get to like him and clap their hands after he gets his ass served a dozen times but still keeps trying. And it is really funny to see how he thanks them for that by getting on top of a table and dancing like a gigolo. Seriously, this movie constantly zooms on his ass shaking like a fat, hip-hop dancing, black woman. Especially when he is on his knees and in pain because of the sealing of his powers. He takes a doggy style pose and shakes his bottom like inviting all the sexually deprived inmates to come pay a visit to his colon. Priceless.Now the news about how they can get out of this place spread and suddenly everybody attacks the warden in hopes to beat him and get his powers back to escape. The warden is one weird guy; despite knowing he is targeted by a hundred desperate inmates he calmly has walks in the prison yard and freely allows anyone who has the guts to attack him. All the rest of the guards in the meantime just look surprised at how useless their security is at stopping riots.There is another lulz scene, regarding one of the inmates turning out to be a woman pretending to be a man. Naruto finds that out after she saves him and her wet clothes reveal her body figure. She punches him in the face because Sakura is not around to do it in this movie and threatens him not to tell anyone about it. Yeah, it must be kept a secret, it’s not like the prison guards did a strip search when she first entered this place.HAHAHA!Ok, here comes another anecdote. Turns out that box in the beginning of the movie was in the possession of some scheming bad guys, one of which was… the warden! And this entrapment was just a ploy to bring someone with huge chakra close to the box so they can open it with Nine Tails. So the joke is that if Naruto had managed to escape, he WOULDN’T have managed to prove his innocence.HAHAHA!And then the second half begins, which has some of the most elaborate plot twists and epic fights in the whole franchise. Seriously you guys, up to now I was laughing with how bad it is and now I was thrilled with this sudden turnaround. The battle with the major bad guy was awesome and I loved how there weren’t useless underlings to waste time in secondary battles. Naruto goes frog-fox and summons that huge toad and kick ass, while the villain could predict all their moves by reading their minds, while a doomsday devise in the background is sucking up people in horror. IT WAS EPIC I TELL YOU!Although still quite naive in overall, it gets better along the way and ends with a bang. Though it still feels completely cheap in how they managed to beat the villain. Imagine three people whose chests where impaled with clear through with spikes the size of your foot still running around and fighting without any problem at all. Lol, the undying kitsch of shounen strikes again! Oh, and don’t miss the end credits, as they include important scenes as well. Nice touch there; made it more mysterious this way.As always the production values are quite good and the animation fluid, making it a hundred times better than the tv series. I must say it is by far the most enjoyable Naruto movie yet. Although not always for the right reasons.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5nzKw-XIxw or stormy waters without having the slightest superpower… And that is why I liked it, lol.

There were some good moments that I liked about the movie and the plot was ok.The movie was basically about how Naruto was framed for a crime and was sent to a prison called blood prison where he learns he was framed by someone to use him in order to get what he wants. So I think that ok plot nothing that interesting and I enjoyed some moments in this movie as it did hype me up for the fight. Art was fine as it just like the anime and the sound was fine except for...that long violin sound or whatever it was near the end of the battle as that just annoying to hear but everything was fine. They're not that many characters that were interesting as they either died or just forgotten so nothing really so special about characters.The movie was fine, some good moments, art and sound were fine and the movie somewhat entertaining.Story 7/10Art 7/10Sound 6/10Character 7/10Enjoyment 7/10Overall 7/10 that long violin sound or whatever it was near the end of the battle as that just annoying to hear but everything was fine.

That is what I would say to describe this movie in one sentence. To start off, the plot didn\'t really make any sense to me. Why would Naruto even TRY to kill the Raikage (Ik it wasn\'t him but yk what I mean.) Second, why would you send him to a prison in a different place? I mean most criminals either get killed (especially for something like that) or sent to a prison in there respective village. Yes, I know it was ""high security super scary prison"" but come on that\'s stupid! Besides the plot, it wasn\'t...really anything super cool. The part near the end where Naruto\'s friends and Tsunade (I think Tsuande) came to save/help Naruto was fine. But, I feel like they should\'ve already known he wouldn\'t do that. The art was fine, not great, not terrible, they didn\'t really change that much in that department. The personalities stayed mostly the same except for the fact Tsunade for SOME REASON thought Naruto would do that. I didn\'t really enjoy it all too much, it was really goddamn boring. Overall, I personally feel like it\'s a 4. Nothing great about it, pretty typical movie. .-. really anything super cool.

On the other hand the reason why I gave it \'8\' and not any lower, is because of the fact that it was a interesting movie, because it shows you how people are like when they are in a prison or shows how friendly they are, though it may not be the same in real life >.> it just gives you a feeling for those that has to stay there, to repent.anyways, like i said i was really looking forward on this movie, because of the fact that its the very first movie that I saw, with a ninja on a prison >.OV pretty unique if you ask me.the others ""art"",""sound2,""Character"",""Enjoyment"" there all the same as Naruto, once i make the review for it [if naruto ever finishes D:].... that you dont agree with me, I still thought that they should have a better plan then going to battle straight away in the first 2 minutes of the movie.

The leaf village was too quick to disregard Naruto as a criminal. They know him, and he had alibis. I don\'t buy the ""it was a secret mission"" excuse. Sounds like they\'re just trying to cover their own butts. That\'s not how you treat a comrade, fill them in. He could have died.The prison concept was interesting in itself, never heard of prisons in Naruto. Would\'ve been interesting to explore the concept of the prison through a new character, but it is Naruto\'s name in the title, of course he\'s gonna be there.The film immediately broke the rules of the prison...by allowing Naruto to create a clone on his first night, but I\'ll give it credit as a way to show Naruto\'s strength.No explanation of where Naruto got shuriken to save himself from falling when he tried to escape.Didn\'t like the one scene that has the villain walk underground and talk to himself for no reason other than to expose himself as the bad guy.Never expected the word \'Transvestite\' to come out of Naruto\'s mouth. Not mad, just surprised.The box is like the Philosopher\'s stone of Fullmetal Alchemist, or the stone of gelel from a previous naruto film. It\'s a monkey\'s paw that is not worth it.Not sure if it\'s a male prison or the agent is just the only female there. If it is a male prison, how did the agent get past the full body inspection?No standard prison uniform. Everyone is wearing what they walked in with.No explanation of the box\'s origin. I did appreciate the toad giving some background, but it wasn\'t much. Mostly reiterated that it\'s old and evil.Most action I\'ve ever seen from the toad. by allowing Naruto to create a clone on his first night, but I\'ll give it credit as a way to show Naruto\'s strength.No explanation of where Naruto got shuriken to save himself from falling when he tried to escape.Didn\'t like the one scene that has the villain walk underground and talk to himself for no reason other than to expose himself as the bad guy.Never expected the word \'Transvestite\' to come out of Naruto\'s mouth.

Orange: Mirai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34136/Orange__Mirai,"[""This movie was not worth the time it took to watch. Even though it was only one hour, I regret even acknowledging it for that amount of time.This review contains spoilers from the original orange:So the movie starts off with a 38 MINUTE RECAP OF ORANGE! You could have condensed this movie into a twenty minute OVA and it would have been the same thing!So forty minutes into this amazingly interesting story, an original story begins about the future where kakeru and Naho end up together. Which sounds great but of course we aren't going to start the original story that way NO!...WE ARE GOING TO START IT WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE PSEUDO-SCIENCE OF THE TIME TRAVELING LETTERS. Yeah remember the black hole Bermuda triangle bit, that everyone agrees is one of the worst plot holes in any anime ever. Lets put emphasis on that for five minutes.After that there is only 15 minutes left in this movie, there is no way in hell they could possibly make it original or good at this point. And I was right the next 15 minutes is just how much it sucks that Suwa didn't end up with Naho.And that's the entire movie. I gained nothing from it, and I only hope no one else has to endure the hell I have. WE ARE GOING TO START IT WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE PSEUDO-SCIENCE OF THE TIME TRAVELING LETTERS.

His friends try to snap him out of it by saying he\'s a nice person and that she fell for him naturally. Ok, I\'ll take it (not...a very good reason though)... Then by the end of the movie we see the two of them waking up from the ""dream"" we just watched. Not only do they seem distant from each other and sad, but Naho just dreamt she had a child with Kakeru, and that she was happy with that... which pretty much confirms what he was saying earlier. Had Kakeru been alive, none of it would\'ve happened. Ouch.Having that route ruined, at least I\'ll get to see Suwa move on in the timeline where Kakeru is saved, I thought! Nope.Suwa\'s idea of happiness there is seeing Naho and Kakeru together... well, okay. But what about YOUR happiness? He\'s still alone 10 years later... and is smiling at how close Naho and Kakeru are... talk about NTR.The best part of the movie was seeing Hagita and Azu finally get together, that was fun.Animation and sound were pretty much identical to the anime\'s, not much to say there.The scene where they\'re watching the sunset together was nice too, but I consider everything else not worth watching. a very good reason though)...

Orange. Orange.You know when I first saw this show, I didn't really care for it. I used to roll my eyes when people gushed about it because I couldn't figure out why it was so well liked.This movie has given me a new found respect for the show because frankly it made the show and its events make a lot more sense. It also helped that I went though the show again before watching the movie.Now from here on out, there's spoilers so you are warned. Most of the movie is flashback of events from the new timeline of the story from...Suwa's point of view. What really shines is the last like 25 minutes or so that's basically epilogue.Spoilers:It begins with Kakeru asking Naho to go to a shrine with her and she says yes. They pray together and the other 4 are there as well, but not with Naho and Kakeru. You find out that this is where Suwa actually convinced Naho to be with him. The show made it seem like in the original timeline, she started to fall for Suwa before Kakeru's death after he confessed at New Years. That wasn't the case. While she was always very close to Suwa, she didn't start falling for him until the second time he confessed and basically proposes to her. Past Suwa says he's a horrible person for taking advantage of Naho while in a fragile emotional state after Kakeru's death. The others try to cheer him up and say he's a good guy and was only being Kakeru's substitute. In my opinion, that would have been true for new timeline Suwa. If Kakeru had still died then he would have been Kakeru's substitute, but only because of the influence on this timeline brought by the letters. Original timeline Suwa did it for his own selfish purposes and nothing more. In the show, Future Suwa even says that if Kakeru had lived, Naho would have rejected him. (Sorry, SuwaxNaho shippers, the only conceivable timeline where Naho would be with Suwa is one where Kakeru dies.) Free from this, Suwa is now able to walk down his own path. Skip ahead to 10 years in the future. They all meet on the same hill and now Kakeru and Naho are married with a child named Haru who loves Uncle Suwa. They laugh and have a good ole time at a picnic. It ends with them looking at the sunset and them all agreeing to all send letters to a 3rd timeline where Kakeru will tell himself that he's happy and to not let the depression burden him. It doesn't show if they actually send letters though. Jump back to the original timeline where Suwa awakens to find Naho crying. Now at this point with the fact that original timeline Suwa was guilty about how he got Naho, it shows that their marriage might not be as great as it showed in the show. Naho is crying because she was dreaming about Kakeru. The way she says it, she might have been dreaming about the new timeline, but that's not clear. Suwa says he was dreaming about it as well then looks annoyed and goes back to sleep. Not even bothering to comfort his wife as she sobs. I had this theory that people blasted me for. I believe that Future Naho still had feelings for Kakeru and she regretted not being able to reconcile with him. I think this movie adds credence to that theory. It ends with what I assume to be the 2nd timeline where its morning of the first day of school at Naho's house and you see a future letter waiting for her.End SpoilersAll in all, this was a pretty good epilogue movie for a decent series. Answered a lot of questions for me as well. This will probably get pounded by Suwa fans, but it makes sense that Naho and Kakeru are together. They were destined to be, not Suwa and Naho. Suwa's point of view. What really shines is the last like 25 minutes or so that's basically epilogue.Spoilers:It begins with Kakeru asking Naho to go to a shrine with her and she says yes. They pray together and the other 4 are there as well, but not with Naho and Kakeru. You find out that this is where Suwa actually convinced Naho to be with him. The show made it seem like in the original timeline, she started to fall for Suwa before Kakeru's death after he confessed at New Years. That wasn't the case. While she was always very close to Suwa, she didn't start falling for him until the second time he confessed and basically proposes to her. Past Suwa says he's a horrible person for taking advantage of Naho while in a fragile emotional state after Kakeru's death. The others try to cheer him up and say he's a good guy and was only being Kakeru's substitute. In my opinion, that would have been true for new timeline Suwa. If Kakeru had still died then he would have been Kakeru's substitute, but only because of the influence on this timeline brought by the letters. Original timeline Suwa did it for his own selfish purposes and nothing more. In the show, Future Suwa even says that if Kakeru had lived, Naho would have rejected him. (Sorry, SuwaxNaho shippers, the only conceivable timeline where Naho would be with Suwa is one where Kakeru dies.) Free from this, Suwa is now able to walk down his own path. Skip ahead to 10 years in the future. They all meet on the same hill and now Kakeru and Naho are married with a child named Haru who loves Uncle Suwa. They laugh and have a good ole time at a picnic. It ends with them looking at the sunset and them all agreeing to all send letters to a 3rd timeline where Kakeru will tell himself that he's happy and to not let the depression burden him. It doesn't show if they actually send letters though. Jump back to the original timeline where Suwa awakens to find Naho crying.

It takes place after the main series and brings us a look at what we all wanted to see at the end of the TV series.Orange is a series where time travel is a predominant part of the plot. It allows for speculation and creates an overall very emotional watch in the form of regret and changing the future to make a better outcome. While the plot device causes holes, it works well to create tension and suspence if you...can get passed it.The production quality of Orange: Mirai is as expected. A familiar yet, unique art style that works well with the characters and environments. The camera is superb once again with great angles and sometimes incredible shots! The character designs are the same as before and there are a few times when there are slightly lower quality facial features, just like the show. But I digress, the animation was once again, consistent and of high quality. The environments are also truly beautiful and immersive, one of the highlights of this film and the show.The characters have already been well developed at this point and the film continues to do so even more up until the end where we get to see what we wanted the whole time. Everything is tied in a great big knot by the end of Orange: Mirai which I am happy about. The anime ending is good and it works, but the ending here truly gives us a great sense of satisfaction and tear inducing happiness.In conclusion, this is well worth the watch if you are a fan of the series or if you are hungering for an even better continuation with a statisfactory ending. The one gigantic thing I took away from this.. is a quote.""Hanging in there, living, is the toughest thing there is."" can get passed it.The production quality of Orange: Mirai is as expected.

The one gigantic thing I took away from this.. is a quote.""Hanging in there, living, is the toughest thing there is.""', ""I may never write here again, but after seeing some reviews not recommending the movie, I decided to talk a little. If you've already watched Orange and loved the anime, I urge you to keep reading, otherwise I appreciate your attention this far. This is not a review, but I want to write this text with all my heart.I remember watching the anime weekly, and every time I ended the day crying, it was an anime that left a deep impression on me and remains one of my favorites. Because of that I was afraid to watch this movie, look, only after more than 5...years did I get the courage. And I really don't regret it, having waited these years made me watch with a feeling of nostalgia and happiness to see them all again as if it were the first time.One of the things I like most about anime, which I wanted in real life, is a group with very strong friendships, and here we find a group that is very loyal to each other. It's such an honest relationship, always thinking about each other's well-being. I wish that one day I find myself in a place where I belong, like Kakeru.Seeing the Naho-Suwa-Kakeru relationship is something indescribable, I hate falling in love, and last year I confessed, even though I knew I would be rejected I wanted to express my feelings, but I wanted the friendship to continue, like in Orange... But this it didn't happen and nowadays we pretend we don't exist in each other's lives, and that hurts me and will hurt for a long time.Orange's story is simple but charismatic. Art is not incomparable, but it is perfect. The songs fit the context of the anime, and I listen to them routinely. The atmosphere of the whole set is beautiful, and each scene etched in my heart the feelings that Orange makes us feel.I just wanted to say that Orange is a very special anime for me, and I hope that you who are reading this feel the same way. Thanks for your attention so far, I don't know much what to say about the movie, that's why I said it wouldn't be a review, because I can't convey all my feelings with just words. Please just watch and feel, it's a pain I'll never forget, and a happiness I'll try to seek. Have a great day! years did I get the courage.

Have a great day!"", '<W A R N I N G; Spoilers ahead> the original anime series included.I found this movie completely awful and it brought nothing but pain & sorrow to my eyes (and heart). I mean the anime was also pretty fucked up to begin with, but the movie is so much... worse.One thing the movie does is to show a bit more of the process of sending the letters and how the 26 yo versions of themselves are feeling after Kakeru\'s death etc. But that\'s about it. It was also cringe at some parts as it made me facepalm lots on multiple situations, but let\'s not...get into that just yet.But, as a Suwa fan (and not only), it sucked. I honestly watched this to bring me some closure about that ending, but it just made it more messed up instead. If the anime finale can be called a win-win for the both lead MCs, the movie just throws that into oblivion. We learn that at the end of the anime, Naho ends up with Suwa (in the ""original"" world, the one in which Kakeru dies); Naho ends up with Kakeru in a parallel world.Let\'s talk about the original world first. Suwa keeps acting really as if he commited an atrocious crime marrying Naho when she was vulnerable after Kakeru\'s death (pretty sure few years passed in-between those events but plot). He keeps repeating that he stole Naho from Kakeru and that he\'s a really bad person. In the end, it\'s not as if Naho is handicapped (or is she??) and she can\'t decide for herself, it\'s not like he compelled her to marry him against her will. Still, they don\'t seem happy together at all. Suwa knows that Naho would have chosen Kakeru over him at anytime; he deserved so much better considering him and Hagita were the only likeable characters. Takako and Azo were decent, I guess, they weren\'t developed at all so there\'s not much to be said, I guess. Kakeru and Naho were really annoying and made no sense at all (almost) all the time, especially Naho.Now about the parallel world... Seems Naho and Kakeru are married and they have a child. Suwa is single, and his happiness, aspirations and pretty much life plainly resumes to Kakeru and Naho\'s relationship. Hey, at least their baby likes him, heh. Right, because that was what I wanted to see.I swear, the one and only good/funny part in this movie was Azu and Hagita finally getting together. Naho cries more times than you can blink, we got used to it, but here\'s taken to the extreme. The Bermude thing theory still left unspoken, almost as if it didn\'t exist anymore. The parallel universe showcases all of them looking at the orange sunset, but with no regrets this time because they managed to save Kakeru.Now, on to the real shit. And that\'s the ending of the movie we\'re talking about. I start by saying that I was expecting something else. Both Suwa and Naho have had the same dream in which Kakeru is saved. You may think that now that they know the letters have reached their purpose, they feel a bit of relief and have a closure of some kind and maybe enjoy their lives together. Buuuuut, that\'s not about it. Instead, Naho seems melancholic, sad, depressed???. From my point of view, because we can only speculate her feelings solely based on her facial expressions most of the time (very few cases she explains what she\'s actually feeling, not much introspection tho), it seems she wished she had been in that alternate universe, basically regretting her whole life for the past 10 years. Of course she starts crying again (how couldn\'t she spare this occasion!?); Suwa doesn\'t even try comforting her anymore, she just leaves her be. He seemed as if he was grieving on his own, blaming himself for ""stealing"" Kakeru\'s life, taking advantage of his death... things like this, whatever. In this case, I don\'t get why he married her in the first place, but that\'s a tale for another time.One scene that really conflicted me and made my mind go woosh as it didn\'t make any actual sense to me was the one from the car in which Naho tells Suwa she would have still married him even if Kakeru was still alive. Come on... You can\'t do this (she still did it). Not only that\'s a big lie she was aware of, that sounds like insulting someone\'s intelligence to me. Naho also said she was ""thrilled"" when Suwa confessed to her on New Years, but it\'s later shown that she pushes him away, saying she likes Kakeru, rejecting him. Another wtf-facepalm worthy moment. Only made me feel pity for Suwa, a g a i n, poor guy.One thing I feel it made me give this movie +1 point was the part about future Suwa telling his past self to choose his future as he pleases. That was one of the only scenes that I actually enjoyed in this mass of shame-worthy scenes for Suwa. (As the movie is supposed to be focusing on Suwa\'s point of view regarding all that happened and also his feelings; at least that\'s the way I tried to think of it).All in all, to me, it was a really really bad experience and I felt it was not worth my time, the only thing doing is putting salt on the wound. Guess the anime ending was slightly better (I didn\'t like that either, but... I feel I could accept it more as it was more opened to everyone\'s preferences).Almost had a stroke at some parts and was overall left with a bad taste.Well, I didn\'t intend on writing a novel here, but it looks like I (almost) did. Guess that can\'t be helped. Just wanted to blow off some steam that has accumulated once watching the Orange anime (really). And, to my disappointment, this movie amplified it.If you really want to complete this series (good luck, you\'ll need it), there are just a few parts of new content as half of the movie is just recap of the anime. But you\'d be better off without watching it, trust me. get into that just yet.But, as a Suwa fan (and not only), it sucked.

I am not even going to get into details, because more than 50% of the movie was basically a recap of the anime and things we already knew. I was expecting more of what happens after the anime, either on the real world or the parallel world. We do get to see some glimpse of what happened in the parallel world (with Kakeru being alive, married to Naho, even having a baby with her and Suwa being the favorite uncle), but that scene...alone, as good as it was, does not make up for the waste of time the whole movie is, if you already watched the anime. I am going to say though, that I am going to keep preferring the parallel world (even though Suwa is a great person).It is not a bad movie, but I would recommend that if you did watch the anime, start the movie at least half way through and save you some time. alone, as good as it was, does not make up for the waste of time the whole movie is, if you already watched the anime.

It feels like a bad attempt to bring everything to happy ending but we already had our happy...ending.

Not only did the movie show Naho ignoring basically everything Suwa did for her, the movie shows that Suwa doesn't get a happy ending in either timeline. They shatter the idea that Naho, despite being married and having a child with Suwa in the first timeline, truly loves Suwa. At that point I still held hope for the second timeline. However, that was even worse. The movie you simply...sit there and watch Suwa suffer and endure throughout the movie. sit there and watch Suwa suffer and endure throughout the movie."", 'Ok i finally watched this movie after really enjoying the tv series.I was definitely intrigued to watch this due to the new scenes that would be added which would show the future post the ending of anime.Suwa was also my favourite character so seeing it from his persepective would be interesting however.....This movie thouroughly disappointed me .I mean for one, 40 mins of Recap seems a bit excessive especially in a 1 hr movie so we barely get 15 mins of new content before credits take the last 5 mins.Also the movie basically showed how suwa\'s life would basically suck no matter what...decision he took.In the timeline where he got naho and kakeru together, he\'s reduced to the uncle who always babysits the couple\'s kids and can just stare at how his crush is leading a happy life with her husband.i could\'ve still been okay with it if the timeline where naho and suwa got together was a happy one for him but it seems that\'s not the case at all.  it all but outright states that they aren\'t in a particularly happy marriage. It was already known that this suwa feels extreme guilt about ""exploiting"" naho but naho\'s feelings were left ambiguous for the viewer to interpret, in this movie it pretty evident that this naho still has feelings for kakeru and pretty much just settled for suwa. so the end result is a loveless marriage for the most partwhere both can\'t be happy, suwa because of his guilt and naho due to her lingering feelings for kakeru.this raises the question as to whether suwa\'s guilt is actually guilt or a coping mechanism for the fact that no matter what, his wife doesn\'t love him like she did kakeru.Maybe he sent the letters to himself and made himself appear a selfish bastard to his past self just so the past version will not end up in this depressing future where he is in a loveless marriage to his high-school crush who cant love him and since there was a chance kakeru would survive this time due to the others letters he would end up having his heart broken since the future version knows for a fact that no matter what he\'ll always be a substitute to kakeru and in any timeline he is alive he\'ll always get rejected so this way he escapes the pain of heart-break with minimal pain while not resenting naho or kakeru for it .So maybe future suwa set all of this up through his letters so that past suwa will end up in the best possible future for him, one where he isnt in a loveless marriage or have his heart broken at realizing naho would never love him and not even resent kakeru for being naho\'s lover at the same time.wow so i ended up creating a full theory on this movie.So basically to summarize, i didnt like how they showed how suwa\'s life would suck either way and also how it kinda ruins the anime for me.So i really can\'t recommend this movie to anyone unless they wanna see a bad epilogue and recap that ruins the anime even the kakeru x naho moments are too less and lacking a lot. decision he took.In the timeline where he got naho and kakeru together, he\'s reduced to the uncle who always babysits the couple\'s kids and can just stare at how his crush is leading a happy life with her husband.i could\'ve still been okay with it if the timeline where naho and suwa got together was a happy one for him but it seems that\'s not the case at all.  it all but outright states that they aren\'t in a particularly happy marriage.

If you LIKE the anime but not the kind of like that you want to watch it again, don\'t.The movie is more like an explanation of how the letters got into the past, what happened after they save Kakeru, what they write in the letters. I personally like this movie for I always wonder about those many things (especially how the letters are sent to the past) after I watch the anime. I have watch the anime again...and still loving it. If you\'re not the type that enjoys watching after stories for 1 hour, don\'t watch. I suggest you find spoilers or ask someone about the movie and what happen in the future etc etc.I find that the movie is much more heartbreaking that the anime. Why? Because it tells the ""truth"" from another person, Suwa, point of view. How big he actually involved in making this happen and how sad is his love story. and still loving it.

Suwa\'s regrets is a focal point in this anime movie both form his past and future self and him thinking he\'s a ""horrible person"" to Naho is given light due to him taking Naho\'s weakness and Kakeru death for this to his future self but seriously even for LA, LA can see that Suwa is a bro for the entire series through and through blaming himself. He is thee BEST character in the series and even though he beat himself up (past and future), his actions speak louder than words and LA can easily say that his perspective is one of the better directions for this anime movie. Hell in one of the differing timelines, we still get to see Suwa as having a happy life and supporting Naho and Kakeru and their all friends by the end of it.Orange: Mirai\'s flaws, ok let LA start off with the LA\'s statement of ""LA\'s weirdest plot twist of 2016"", well Orange: Mirai brings this up in greater detail from the anime series (instead of the stupid conversation that kickstarted the catalyst of the anime series) and LA STILL found this plot twist baffling as Hagita pointed out that it\'s almost an impossibility for it to work, LA gets the sentimental value of the future selves doing this as to reduce their regrets however it\'s just sound soo stupid when said out loud and this time the movie actually showing them doing it verbatim to how the letters were delivered. The framing device though LA did defend it, LA just has to say for the majority of the anime movie is just the repeat of the anime series\' most important moments condensed HEAVILY but just given Suwa\'s perspective for ""something new""........even though Suwa was a main character in the anime series anyways and he too got ALOT of screentime anyways. Next would be that Orange: Mirai\'s flaws weren\'t necessarily ""fixed"" with this movie as it were given the magnifying glass to all the flaws in greater detail, so LA would say that this is a ""sins of the father"" kinda deal that Orange as a series just can\'t fix anyways.The animation done once again by Telecom Animation Film and the voice acting was like the anime series\' flavour as per usual, so there really wasn\'t much changed from the consistency of the animation (with some rare derp moments) and the typical voice acting from the anime series. technically LA would call Mirai a 65 minute episode of the anime series\' finale if anything due to how the production was the same as the anime series.Orange: Mirai like it\'s anime series has it\'s flaws both from being linked to it\'s anime series as well as it\'s own flaws of it\'s framing device and heavily recapping the condensed moments of the anime series. Suwa was the best thing in this anime movie and seeing his perspective in things both from his past and future selves gave us a better insight to him as a character as well as his sacrifices and regrets he had to do which made him out to be a great character.LA says watch Mirai if you want proper closure to Orange, but if you thought the anime series\' finale was good enough and you just didn\'t care about Suwa then LA says it\'s ok to ignore this movie.Does LA regret watching the anime series OR this movie?, no as much as the melodrama was annoying at times and drilled in HARD, Orange definitely had it\'s good to great dramatic moments that shined through with it\'s greatest themes of regrets shown in full force in both good and bad spectrum and showing us Suwa\'s perspective during Mirai was enlightening to say the least however Mirai\'s plot given LA the chance to show in detail Orange\'s more shaky story moments only showed for LA that Mirai itself can\'t run away from it\'s own flawed and somewhat crazy logic if it tried to and was only digging itself deeper. looks at the perspective of Suwa with the framing device of recapping the events of the original series to bring us up to speed, for once LA can defend the recapping of an anime series into an anime movie to aforementioned bring us up to speed and that the framing device of this entire movie is based on Suwa\'s accounts to the anime series so the recapping makes sense to do (not to mention it lasts 10 minutes in a 65 minute anime movie).LA does have several problems with Orange: Mirai but those a bit later, for now since the anime movie\'s focus is one Suwa, we do go into depth to Suwa\'s thinking in the anime series as well his regrets given into better detail in this movie.

This hour long episode is a wonderful recap/ova. If wanted you can skip the first summary of Orange episode 1 - 13 you can skip the first 10 minutes. However this final episode then goes on to explain many things that had previously gone unanswered, such as how the letters came to be as well as Suwas view on the situation which really helps settle any sadness I had for him. It isn\'t shown if he has a new love as an adult in his new life, however I don\'t think we need to see...that. Both futures end happily for Suwa, as he is both times surrounded by people who love and adore him. In the end the real reasoning of the title ""Orange"" is explained (spoiler) as everyone comes together, from both futures, to experience the same view.I have never related so much to an anime. If you have ever felt regret or hopelessness, this will resonate with you. You see the future selves didn\'t know whether or not the letters would reach their past selves, but all they needed was hope. It brought them together and helped to bring them peace.

They all came flooding back along with my love for the animation of this show.The movie helped to conclude the show while stirring up conflicting emotions for the characters.  The only complaint I have about the movie (and the show honestly) is the reality of what depression is.  Granted, this is a movie about people that can write letters to their past selves but the show suggests that if you just spend more time with a person and show them...how fun life can be, that this will cure depression.  Regardless of this minor flaw, I still liked the overall movie.  Too many feels but so beautiful. how fun life can be, that this will cure depression.

You get to see how he made his choices and in the begining it's a little recap of what you've seen in the episodes. You'll only get to see new scenes when you're half in the movie. I gave it a 7 overall because I really enjoyed watching the episodes and because you only get to understand why ''orange'' got its name in this movie. For those who wanted to see Kakeru and Naho's future together, you'll see your wish come true. Well,...that's pretty much all have to say. It was worth watching it if you wanted to know more about how things were going to end with the main characters and if you were fine with just watching the 13 episodes then you don't need to see the movie. The story is very touching and I garantee that after watching both of the serie and the movie you'll learn a life lesson..I'll definitely show it to my kids one day :)PS: Also, this is my first time writing a review so I hope it was clear and that I was able to help you answer some of your doubts or questions. that's pretty much all have to say.

Without the famous “more or less”.  I chose to love this anime, because sometimes, what is being shown works.  And I really don\'t know why some people hate this show so much (giving scores like 3, 5 or 6).  So, the film is basically a sequel to the 1st season, answering one of the most frequent questions that people asked at the end of the last episode: how the letters arrived at the past versions of the characters.  It is also a...continuation of the story of the friends, but in Suwa\'s view.  A warning: the first 30 minutes of the film are just flashbacks (a recap of the events of the anime), so if you don\'t want to see it, just skip it.  This time, I will not give spoilers in this review, so check it out first.  Anyway, I give an 8/10 score, and now I will try to explain: how ridiculous it is to hate Orange:1 ° - Many people try to make meaningless comparisons between Orange and NTR (Netsuzou Trap); clearly something ridiculous, because I don\'t know how people like these have the courage to compare NTR (one of the worst animes ever made, with one protagonist cheating on the other) with Orange.  Ah, but: Orange has betrayal too???  OF COURSE NOT!!!  See my review of Orange (the anime, not the movie), for you to see all my justification, saying that ""betrayal in Orange"" is a complete fallacy.  And if you still think that way, I would like to have the chance to give you a huge ear tug, because these people (who think that way) deserve to have their ears hurting a lot, in my opinion.  If I was rude in my review, forgive me.  But there are people who, when they don\'t like something, use such futile arguments that my eyes even hurt when looking.  This issue of betrayal is basically my nose.  And this is also like the brain: many have it, but for some, it doesn\'t work properly.  Ichigo Takano did a good job in Orange: beautiful and dazzling animation, and a story that portrays youth in a very nostalgic way, are things that are not lacking in Orange.  Clearly, it\'s not perfect: sometimes, character development can sometimes slow down, but it\'s not the worst.  Now, to say that there is betrayal (and that it is an anime that can be compared to NTR), I\'m sorry, but you looked at Orange with the wrong eyes, and your vision dazzled while watching.  Please re-watch, because that opinion does not match with the reality.

Imagine my surprise that I like this movie so much that I can safely recommend this over the anime.*The animation quality is definitely of higher quality. After all, this is a movie and that is to be expected.*It is technically a sequel as it is said to cover parts of volume 6 of the manga. But much of it is recycled scenes from the anime series without the annoying and boring parts. Since that is the case, even if you didn't watch the...anime series, you can still watch and enjoy this movie.

You might gain some appreciation of the events thanks to this, which is another reason I did not find the recycled scenes repetitive.*The scenes that take place after the anime only start at the 40-minute mark. Understandably, some people may dislike this fact. But I reckon that the execution is good enough.In fact, this movie has salvaged the story for me. The anime felt meh, but this one is more enjoyable to watch.*If in the anime series, the word orange had a sad meaning, it has a more positive connotation in this movie. I won't spoil it. Just watch it.*The reason why I cannot possibly rate it much higher than 7 is that the mechanics of how the letters travelled from the future to the past is ridiculous. If you're just watching it for the feels, you can safely ignore this aspect but some people don't.Also, I wish it could be longer because there are only 20 minutes of new scenes.

Paniponi Dash!: Danjite Okonaeba Kishin mo Kore wo Saku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5419/Paniponi_Dash__Danjite_Okonaeba_Kishin_mo_Kore_wo_Saku,"['The premise for the episode is as ridiculous as almost anything in the series.  Several of the students at the school have recently failed a major exam, and are going to be required to retake it.  But, they can get out of it, if they win a game of Kick the Can, which for the purposes of plot is the same as Capture the Flag.  Becky leads the defending team while Rei heads the attacking students.  Hijinks ensue, betrayals occur, and the ending is as deadpanned as always.  Also, pretty much every major character from the anime’s run makes an...appearance in some way, and some of the minor characters get cameos.At its core though, PPD is a parody anime, so it’s never going to take itself too seriously.  And if you haven’t been keeping up with anime much in the last few years, you’re going to be left a bit in the dust.  You’ll see references to Strike Witches, Gurren Lagann, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, and even video site Nico Nico Douga.  The episode stands alone well enough, but if you’re paying attention, you’ll get a bit more value out of your time.  The level of fanservice has also jumped a bit, so if you like that sort of thing, have at it.The animation of the original work was pretty good already, but the OVA still makes everything look a little bit prettier.  As a parody, the art style occasionally shifts, both for scenes and for simple background objects, and all of that is handled nicely as well.  The OP and ED used are from the anime, so there’s nothing much new there.  The background music is pretty subdued, and this series really relies on sound effects rather than music for scenes.  As I watched the English dub of the series, I like the Japanese voice actors better for the most part, though I kind of Rei’s amateur VA, Carlee Gabrisch, from the dub.So, bottom line.  If you like Pani Poni Dash!, you need to go watch this.  If you like parody animes, this is a solid choice.  If you’re not sure about either, this is a good way to enter the series and see if it’s something you might enjoy. appearance in some way, and some of the minor characters get cameos.At its core though, PPD is a parody anime, so it’s never going to take itself too seriously.

Ouritsu Uchuugun: Honneamise no Tsubasa,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1034/Ouritsu_Uchuugun__Honneamise_no_Tsubasa,"[""**THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS**I’ve never actually been compelled to actually sit down and write a review, until now. I simply cannot fathom how a seriously flawed movie such as Wings of Honneamise could have pretty much universal 9s and 10s here on MAL.For the positives: the animation is top tier and holds up even today; on level with works such as AKIRA. The art and design also seems to have had a lot of care taken into them, with distinctive designs for especially the clothing and vehicles. The sound for the film is also great, although unfortunately, apart from a few pieces of music,...such as during the OP, the soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired, and fails to swell the emotions. The film also has one scene which was nothing short of phenomenal -- this would be Lhadatt flying an airplane for the first time. In this scene, the sense of sheer speed from the airplane is conveyed better than I have ever seen done in any anime, and I was yearning for more scenes like this, however, unfortunately it is the only scene in the film like it. Even the climax doesn’t match it in my opinion - while the climax itself is undeniably well-choreographed, it felt undercooked, i.e. out of a 2 hour film, only a mere 7 minutes is dedicated to this scene, and this honestly isn't enough to build up the tension.I can’t deny that the film has a lot of relevant commentary on political corruption and war; however this doesn’t necessarily make for an engaging movie, which leads to my biggest gripe with the film. There are few thrills to be had, which would be fine, but it needs to engage the audience in a different way such as with compelling characters and character development, that make you care about each scene that is happening. Unfortunately, this is the area in which Royal Space Force is lacking the most. While the characters can be amusing in a comedic way, they rarely reached the status of becoming truly likeable which is what would make a movie like this shine.Lhadatt, who starts out of a character with absolutely no interest in space travel, (so little in fact, he arrives late to a dead comrades funeral), runs into a girl who spends her free time preaching on the streets. After a meeting with her, he suddenly has all the motivation in the world to actually do something. I'd perhaps get what the movie was trying to do if this motivation was a gradual thing, but here it comes out of nowhere, and it makes you wonder why the words of this girl had such a profound effect on Lhadatt.It does mention in the prologue that he had always wanted to fly, but it doesn’t exactly give a lot of explanation as to why he lost this desire; and giving his character a complete 180 twenty minutes into the film cheapens the development that he could have had, and makes him seem more of a joke than when he actually didn't care about anything.Later on in the film, Lhadatt does go through a small crisis over whether or not it's morally right to fly into space when people on the ground are starving. Which is an interesting dilemma. However Lhadatt doesn't seem to come to much of a rebuttal except running away from his problems and seeking refuge with Nondreiko so he can rape her.Now the main girl of the film, Nondreiko, similarly offers very little character development or reason to like her. Her main characteristic is that she is shown as a devoutly religious girl, however there’s no debate or discussion occurring with her beliefs.A tragic event happens to her midway into her film, which she brushed it off, stating that the church would help her, depicting her strength of character and belief. However, I was expecting during the film for her to crack and have her beliefs be tested, (provide some actual conflict, due to the shit the world kept giving her), but when Lhadatt finally returns her generosity during his crisis by attempting to rape her she didn’t snap at all but rather forgave him, and pushed the blame onto herself. Strong character development, yes.Additionally, the child she takes care of, Manna, is annoying as fuck. While her unwillingness to smile is funny at first, it grows tiresome very quickly, and becomes borderline frustrating. However, at least when she does finally smile, due to Lhadatt, there is some symbolic nature, but it's ultimately a pretty poor development, especially when it comes right off the heels of trying to rape Nondreiko.Meanwhile, the movie is trying to convince the audience that these characters are struggling in the face of condemnation; everyone thinks the Royal Space Force a joke. However, it doesn't do much in the way of making us actually want to root for these people for a good portion of the movie (besides the inherent fact that space travel is awesome.) They're often displayed as incompetent, unenthusiastic shmoes.The other side characters, while amusing, are also complete baboons. The movie constantly tries to build up ideals only to destroy them later on. For example, during a chase scene, where Lhadatt is trying to be assassinated, his friend, rather than help him, yells at Lhadatt to stop following him, as it was putting him in danger. A character, who supported Lhadatt during the tussle with the pilots has to sully that integrity for comedic affect by acting like such a cock here. Here is a scene that could have been serious, and further shown the resilience and comradery of the characters ends up divulging into silly comedy, made even more stupid when the assassin appears to be an old lady.There is enjoyment to be had with this film, I wasn't particularly bored at all during the film, but I wasn’t exactly thrilled either, with the truly exciting moments coming few and far between. Ultimately, its true let down are the disappointing characters. This definitely isn’t the pinnacle of storytelling or anime, especially considering other films surrounding its release. However, it does hold historic merit as it is Gainax's first film, and because of this I can recommend it to those who are interested in other Gainax productions. For others that only have a casual interest in anime or a plot of this kind, you won't be missing out if you skip this one. such as during the OP, the soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired, and fails to swell the emotions. The film also has one scene which was nothing short of phenomenal -- this would be Lhadatt flying an airplane for the first time. In this scene, the sense of sheer speed from the airplane is conveyed better than I have ever seen done in any anime, and I was yearning for more scenes like this, however, unfortunately it is the only scene in the film like it. Even the climax doesn’t match it in my opinion - while the climax itself is undeniably well-choreographed, it felt undercooked, i.e. out of a 2 hour film, only a mere 7 minutes is dedicated to this scene, and this honestly isn't enough to build up the tension.I can’t deny that the film has a lot of relevant commentary on political corruption and war; however this doesn’t necessarily make for an engaging movie, which leads to my biggest gripe with the film. There are few thrills to be had, which would be fine, but it needs to engage the audience in a different way such as with compelling characters and character development, that make you care about each scene that is happening. Unfortunately, this is the area in which Royal Space Force is lacking the most.

I'd have to say that, based on its current 7.8 rating, it's slightly underrated.  I myself would call it a masterpiece, but keeping other people's tastes in mind, I give it a conservative 9/10.  (See bottom for a quick summary)STORYWhat makes this movie stand out is its spot-on storytelling.  For me, there's not a single dull moment from beginning to end.  Fans of action may be put off by instances of character development in the middle, but the movie always picks...up and gets right back to forwarding the plot.  I myself found the character development engrossing and mostly believable.  (I also think it was crucial to let the viewer feel out the world of Honneamise by developing the main character, but that's just my opinion.)  The movie has such good writing that it wouldn't have mattered much if they glimpsed over the side characters, but they're given their own time in the sun, and it adds a nice touch to the realism.Speaking of realism, the alternate universe of Honneamise is so finely tuned that you'll hardly catch all the details on your first viewing.  The world will seem so familiar that you'll want to connect it back to our world.  I think that's what the director intended, because I felt invested in the unfolding events of the movie, as if the history of Honneamise were somehow my own.Most importantly, the ending of this movie is epic.  And that's all I'll say, because I don't want to give anything away.  If you're watching this with your enjoyment meter at 5 or 6, PLZ try to make it to the end.ARTThis movie had an insane budget - I think that's all I have to say.  It has great art and fluid action scenes.  Sure, it's a little dated (which is why I gave it a 9), but you can't ask for anything that much better even nowadays.SOUNDThe score is amazing.  It's far-above-par soundtrack is one of only two anime soundtracks Ryuichi Sakamoto (of The Last Emperor fame) composed (source: fatalist17 on Youtube).  However, its sound is fresh from the 80s, and some people may not like it.  Still, it shouldn't get in the way of enjoying the movie.  Also, the seiyuu is excellent!CHARACTERI've already talked about character development when I talked about the plot, but let me just repeat that the main character's easygoing nature was easy for me to relate to, and really helped me immerse myself in the film.  I'd have to say every character is believable, even stereotypical stock characters like the quirky scientists.  I gave the movie an 8 because there were two characters who annoyed the heck out of me - but that may be just a personal grudge.  I won't say who, because I don't want to bias you before you watch the movie.ENJOYMENTA great story.  Solid characters.  Awesome artistry and soundtrack.  A nice dose of action.  The very recipe for enjoyment.  Now, enjoyment is subjective, but I still can't see how anyone would NOT enjoy this unless they were only in it for the action.OVERALLThe production values (art and sound) for this movie are phenomenal!  They really tried to make the characters believable - I found it easy to root for the main character.  Of course, the storytelling is what really brings this film together.  If you like well-rounded works, this is a must-see.  If you get bothered by things like the slow scenes in The Godfather, you may not enjoy it as much, but I still highly recommend this masterpiece. up and gets right back to forwarding the plot.

It is clearly made for adults, not due to vulgarity or gratuitous violence, but due to its moral ambitions and its seriousness.STORYAhead of its time. Amazing storytelling, a cut above almost every other anime out there, save for maybe Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon. The young director of this film really knew his stuff.ARTThe art style is a bit old, but by no means is it bad. It is extremely detailed at times, and the animation is very fluid and stunning. I'd say it's around AKIRA quality.SOUNDSadly, the weakest link...in WoH. The music, while trying to sound otherworldly, fails to enhance the scenes most of the time. There are two memorable songs, though, near the end.CHARACTERSome of the best character development you'll ever see in an anime. This is the kind of movie that even non-anime fans will like.

I don't know why the rating is so low. Seriously, go watch this movie. Buy it even, it's not that expensive on VHS.

I went in to this movie on the backs of dozens of glowing reviews expecting to be, if not blown away, at least in agreement that this was pretty good.It absolutely was NOT. This movie is unique in that no scene has ANY effect on the ones after it.None of the characters are developed at all and none of them have any identifiable motivations.The main character suddenly goes from a bored, lazy guy to CAPTAIN GUNG HO SPACE MAN. With NO explanation as to WHY.I simply cannot fathom the praise for this movie. It is simply awful!

That's it though. sake please, PLEASE stay away from it.I wish I did.The only positive thing I can say for this movie is that is has some fairly high quality animation. That's it though."", 'Overview:Wings of Honneamise is a great film, but it also has some serious flaws. For me though, an anime can do lots of things wrong if it also does some things really well. Wings is a loveable underdog story. It\'s an anti-war film. It\'s a coming of age movie. It\'s a steampunk, alternate history retelling of the early Space Race from the POV of the Soviet Union. It also has at least 2 plainly stupid scenes that detract from the film and have no business being there. It can be more than a little sappy and it is happy to trade realism for emotion, which...I will explain later in this review. This was written by a 23 year old kid with no writing experience, who after this dedicated his career to writing and directing pure schlock like Mahoromantic Robot Maid. I will warn you that this film is NOT like Mushishi or a Yuasa anime where it has an ironclad defense and is impermeable to critic snark. It is however worth your time!Plot and characters: (Spoilers ahead! Skip this next section if you don\'t want anything spoiled!)There is a Cold War brewing between 2 super powers in this alternate dimension. Honneamise is an authoritarian, poor, industrial power while its rival is a wealthy and powerful democracy called ""The Republic"". The government of Honneamise wishes to create a space program and send the first man into space in order to uplift their people and score a propaganda victory. However, they have a shoestring budget and most people don\'t even believe that human spaceflight is possible. A hero is needed who is willing to throw safety to the wind in order to achieve a truly beautiful feat for all Mankind. Our hero is a man named Shirotsugh Lhadatt. Yeah...this is an alternate history so everyone has silly fantasy names like Zap Rowsdower. I\'m just going to call our hero Yuri Gagarin because this film leaves ZERO doubt of who he is supposed to represent.Just like the real one, our Yuri at first is an aimless youth from a nowhere town. He comes from nothing, but he has big dreams and balls of steel. One day he meets a highly religious woman, which is seen as unusual because Honneamise cracks down on religion and is very dismissive of faith. This woman gives Yuri a new sense of purpose in life and now he starts to take his job as a Cosmonaut seriously and has an unquenchable thirst to reach the stars. All appears to be going well, but tragedy strikes and Honneamise\'s chief rocket engineer is killed in a freak accident. This is seemingly a reference to the death of chief engineer Sergei Korolev during the middle of the Space Race. Nothing will deter Yuri though from his dream. Yuri becomes a famous celebrity and is used as a propaganda figure by Honneamise, always forced to smile big in public despite how he may actually be feeling. He is also promoted to the rank of colonel. You know, just in case there are 5 people left in the theater audience that haven\'t figured out who he is supposed to be.Now we get to last 3rd and things get a little rough. Yuri gets increasingly frustrated with Jesus freak, because she ain\'t given none. One night, he just loses control and flat out tries to rape her, but she knocks him out with a statue. The next morning, he\'s a bit embarrassed and tries to apologize for the whole rape thing, but she says it is her fault for not putting out. She says that Yuri is a nice guy and deserved her body, but she was being selfish. Yuri is forced to accept her apology and she walks off. She is a little passive aggressive for about 10 minutes and then it\'s like the scene never happened. Yeah... I can see why Ebert wasn\'t very gentle in his criticism of this scene. Next we follow up with another stupid scene. The dastardly Republic decide that Honneamise must not be allowed to win a propaganda victory and send an octogenarian assassin to kill Yuri! The old man at first tries to kill Yuri with a pistol, but he has the worst aim in the history of anime. Then the old man tries to run Yuri over with a street cleaner, which is only slightly less silly than the steam roller from Austin Powers. Our hero kills the old fucker with a knife and we enter the final act.Honneamise is FINALLY ready to launch the rocket, but the Republic refuses to see them succeed. You would think the Republic would pool their superior resources and send their own guy into space. They would probably end up beating Honneamise to the moon, but that would make too much sense. Instead they decide to launch an all out invasion of the Soviet Un- I mean Honneamise and try stop the rocket from taking off! Yuri rallies ground control to launch the rocket anyways and the Republic is so awe struck by this beautiful moment that they throw down their arms and stop fighting! Yuri reaches the heavens and sends a transmission to Earth telling Mankind to stop fighting and unite as one. If we can send a man to space, then we can accomplish anything! Yuri then begs God to forgive Mankind for our many sins. His beautiful act of courage, determination, and heroism achieves a level of redemption for Man. This is an anime that essentially ends with Yuri Alekseyivich Gagarin becoming the Second Coming of Christ and rocketing for our sins!Art:The art and animation is actually quite spectacular for 1987. The chief animator on this product was Hideaki Anno, so they were in good hands. He restrained himself from adding giant robots to this film, but I could have done without the full frontal nudity and giving Christ freak such massive boobs. I know you love titties Anno, but this was NOT the right time! Unless the scene was intended to be erotic...which would actually make it even worse.Sound:The music adds well to the powerful emotion and both English and Japanese dubs are spectacular. I personally like the Enlglish dub thanks to the presence of Bryan Cranston, who plays Yuri\'s best friend. If your casual buddies start getting bored by this film\'s run time, you can start adding Breaking Bad quotes every time he\'s on screen.Overall:Is this the perfect anime? Well...no. However, I would rather love something flawed with lots of heart and soul than something immune to criticism that feels boring, cold, and sterile. This anime has some truly beautiful moments. Yeah the rape scene and old assassin scene were dumb and should have been cut. Yeah the Republic\'s reactions to Honneamise\'s space program made little sense and weren\'t realistic. Yes, the level of Russophilia is SO high this film is probably banned in Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltic States. Despite all of this, it\'s a good film and I\'m NOT a Gainax fanboy.Now. Let\'s end this review with a good old Church of Gainax hymn!What would Yuri Gagarin do if he was here right now?He\'d make a plan and he\'d follow through!That\'s what Yuri Gagarin\'d do!When Yuri Gagarin was in the OlympicsSkating for the gold,He did two salchows and a triple lutzWhile wearing a blind fold!When Yuri Gagarin was in the alpsFighting grizzly bearsHe used his magical fire breathAnd saved the maidens fair!(Guitar rift) Yuri!

So above it, in fact, that their lifelong mission is to break through the sky and take mankind to the stars!  And they’re so enthusiastic about that...  Well, that they have no drive whatsoever.  It’s unclear why they...joined the royal space force...  Perhaps they wanted a taste of military pay checks without having to actually fight...  But the general attitude among the base is one of blasé apathy, as the entire squadron would rather meander around the red light district than attempt to make any progress towards the heavens, to the great chagrin of their often disrespected superiors, who want nothing more than to kick their butts into shape.  For a while, it looked like there was no hope for the program.  Enter Shirotsugh ""Shino"" Lhadatt, a cadet who grew up with dreams of soaring above the clouds, and eventually, the atmosphere.That starry-eyed boy has grown up into a literal and figurative space cadet, plagued with ennui and depression at his lack of direction and overall dissatisfaction with his life.  Even the death of a comrade fails to affect him, much as he pretends otherwise.  This all changes when he meets a pretty young woman handing out religious pamphlets in what can only be described as a more modern version of Sodom or Gomorra, and the idea of acquiring God in his life does pique his interests, if only a bit.  They hit it off, and her amazement at his profession inspires him to volunteer to be the first man in the history of the world to enter orbit!  That’s all well and good, but surprise surprise, space training is no walk in the park.  There are several road blocks standing in his way, from harsh physical conditioning to the hassles of team work, to shadowy figures on both sides of the ongoing war who are trying to sabotage or straight up assassinate him for his efforts.  For that small step for a man, they’ll have to take a giant leap of faith if they’re ever going to have a chance of reaching the heavens.It should go without saying that not all Gainax anime look like masterpieces.  That’s not to say any of them have necessarily looked bad, at least not so far from what I’ve seen, but several of them have looked a bit on the mediocre side.  Wings of Honneamise is NOT one of them.  To be perfectly honest, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a 1980’s era anime that looked as good as this one does.  The animation is smooth and consistent, peoples’ movements are graceful and almost feel natural, even if certain shots do feel like you’re watching an animation flip book.  The level of detail in the visuals is insane, from the elaborate backgrounds to the well-thought-out lighting and shading techniques, even all the way down to the gravity of a person plopping down on a bench, which bends ever so slightly from the impact.  Facial expressions are also on point, highly expressive while never going off model.  There are no short-cuts taken, at least not from what I can tell, and there was clearly a very high budget that went into it.The artwork carries a very retro style...  Once again, this is the eighties...  And character designs skew more towards realism than exaggeration.  While the color palette wasn’t really bright or lively, it still worked very well as a complement to the film’s gritty, down to earth tone.  A lot of imagination went into the little details of this world that’s intended to be alternate to our own, from fashion and the technology of the times to architecture, and even the way the lines are painted on the road.  This all speaks to the show’s highly distinctive design, which is consistent all the way through, and just feels right, like yeah, this is how an alternate version of Earth who’s culture revolves around war would look, with nothing...  And I mean nothing...  Feeling anachronistic or out of place.  Studio Gainax obviously put a lot of effort into creating this world, and I have no doubt that their brainstorming sessions went way beyond what ultimately wound up making it to the screen.  This would prove to be a double edged sword, as it does make the story’s landscape feel more immersive, but it also leaves out a lot of details, and makes me feel like there’s a lot of necessary world-building that got dropped.Having said that, it still looks beautiful, in it’s muted, downtrodden and poverty-stricken kind of way, carrying a bittersweet taste alongside the stunning visual quality.  You get the sense that the people are making due with little resources and money, and that’s not just true of the many civilians that show up and move fluidly in the background of certain scenes, but also surprisingly of the Space force’s uniforms, which look goofy and low budget yet still more than prideful.  I wouldn’t go quite so far as to say that it’s dripping with layers of atmosphere like diebuster was, but it comes pretty close without going over the top, and there are a few certain scenes that are simply amazing in their presentation...  Particularly, there’s the scene midway through with Shino flying a plane for the first time, soaring through the air above the clouds in such  a way that could almost be considered to reach Miyazaki levels of quality.  It does occasionally feel like they were a little lacking on the inbetweening, as some shots do feel a little choppy, but that’s an easy enough problem to ignore, especially with the rest of the product looking so beautiful.The music was okay,but aside from a few standout tracks, it was pretty generic.  I also don’t want to spend too much time on the English Dub, as the Japanese track is vastly superior and will obviously get my recommendation, but still, if it’s English you’re looking for, the dub is okay.  There certainly nothing overtly bad about it.  There are a ton of appearance by well known voice actors in it, including over a half a dozen minor roles played by Steve Blum, and they even have Bryan Cranston playing Shino’s best friend, Matti.  You know, the slightly taller and slightly rougher looking guy who...  Does stuff?  Arnie Hanks has also had a relatively long career, although most of it has been live action TV work.  Wendee Lee shows up in a brief cameo before taking on the role of Manna, an orphaned girl who barely talks throughout the story, but she still plays her like someone who doesn’t talk often and isn’t fully comfortable in their own voice.  They all take part, they all put in their work, and they do a fairly good job, for what’s often considered to be the Dark Days of anime dubbing.But the two actors who get the most screentime are the ones playing the lead roles.  Robbie Matthews, or more accurately, David Allen Thomas, has done barely any anime work, as the majority of his output has been video game roles.  He’s playing a very subtle character, and thus is putting forth a very subtle performance, hitting all the necessary points of his character’s development.  He obviously used a fake name, which was common practice at the time for union reasons, but the reveal of his actual identity didn’t shock me nearly as much as the church girl Riquinna’s voice actor did.  Melody Lee, when I did a little digging, turned out to be Patricia Ja Lee, a former Pink Power Ranger.  I’ve heard good work from her...  Most notably in an episode of Cowboy Bebop...  And she’s also done a lot of cringey roles, like in Lucky Star and the live action Haruhi skits.  Her work as Riquinni blows even Bebop out of the water, as she dances on the line of an incredibly nuanced character, one who preaches and tries to save people, even when her own struggle for survival has led her down some dark paths.The acting in this dub is great, and it would be even better with the help of good writing, but alas, that was apparently a bridge too far.  Well, maybe that’s not fair.  The writing isn’t really bad, per se, and you won’t have many complaints with it if you’re just watching it on it’s own with the subtitles off...  Except for one little part that I’ll get to in a minute...  But if you actually know what the original dialogue was, you may feel cheated over the lack of subtlety and constant unnecessary changes.  For example, right before attempting to go into space, Shino gives Manna a message for Riquinni, and it gets changed from “Tell her i’m leaving, and can I bring you back anything” to “Tell her she changed me, and I want to repay her.”  Either way, Manna asks for him to bring back a star, either for her or for Riquinni.  But the worst part is the ending, which takes a more or less okay monologue about not corrupting our home to speech about how hey, once we get into space, there’ll be no reason to fight anymore!”  Which has to be the most pretentious explanation of war that I’ve heard since Aldnoah Zero.  The dub’s fine, but I highly recommend the sub.So, there’s a certain comparison I’ve been making about Studio Gainax for a few years now, and even though I’ve been doing four years of a theme month in it’s honor, I haven’t found the perfect opportunity to talk about it until now, as I believe it to be the crux of this movie’s problems.  In my opinion, if Studio Gainax were an American director, it wouldn’t be Michael Bay...  It wouldn’t be be Quentin Tarrantino...  It would be Zack Snyder, the man who rose to fame with Watchmen and then proved to us all what a joke he was by making Sucker Punch, but he firmly cemented what kind of filmmaker he was with last year’s Batman vs. Superman.  Like Gainax, Zack Snyder is someone who you can call many things, but lazy and uninspired are not among them.  He believes in his projects, he pours effort into them, and he really, really wants them to be good, but he just isn’t as talented as he would have to be to pull off the scope of his ambitions.  He respects great writing and profound ideas, but he doesn’t understand them.I feel that this is the best way to describe Studio Gainax, a production company that’s all heart and little brain, who dreams of creating awe inspiring, emotionally impactful anime, but often bites off more than they can chew and winds up losing focus on the story they’re telling.  A good example of this would be the religious symbolism in Evangelion, which shouldn’t be that difficult to use, I mean hell, Death Note used it well by complete accident, but no, it just winds up leading to a confused and muddled mess of an ending that only really kind of stands up under a literal interpretation of the events.  Even their attempts at tackling depression and existentialism digs them into a hole so deep that they have to pull an emotional deus ex machina out of their asses just to reach a satisfying conclusion.  That’s not to say they can’t put out great work...  With shows like FLCL and Gurren Lagann, simple ideas and elements were pulled off so well that the products didn’t even NEED good writing to support them...  But from what I’ve seen, it’s been the problem for most of their work.  They know the what, they know the how, but they never truly manage to grasp the why.So how does this relate to Wings of Honneamise?  Well, if there’s one thing people like to trumpet about this movie, and I will give them this, it’s that they did a really great job writing the main character.  Shino has a complete character arc, and I’m sorry, but talking about it is going to go into some spoilers.  At the beginning of the movie, he’s depressed, he feels empty and unmotivated, and he knows he shouldn’t feel that way.  He meets a religious girl in the middle of a street of utter depravity...  Which is a little touch i’ll also admit I really like...  And he begins to find a renewed purpose through religion.  Faith in something greater gives him faith in himself and his mission, and when his faith in the former is challenged, the latter pulls him right back up before long.  He grows as a person, from a deadbeat louse to a model soldier and pilot, and in the end, when he reaches space, he realizes(in the sub, at least) that mankind can’t run from it’s problems, or it’ll just keep on making the same mistakes, spreading it’s sin wherever it goes.  Change comes from within.On the surface, this seems like a great message, and it even ties into his arc.  It’s a great resolution to his conflict.  The problem?  Well, once all that’s said and done, the only thing I have left to say is...  So what?  It’s great for the character, and it teaches something to the audience, but consider this:  He’ll have to come down eventually, or he’s going to die, whether from starvation, suffocation, or hypothermia.  While the movie went into great, and hell, almost too much detail on how the spaceship was being built and how it was going to fly, I don’t recall anything being said about the return trip, which has to happen.  And even if he does manage to get back safely, it’s still not going to satisfy the people who criticized the royal space Force for wasting potential war and/or food money on a pointless endeavor.  In fact, they’ll probably be even more pissed off, since they’re likely going to need even MORE money for their next trip to the stars. I’m also having a hard time believing that their accomplishment will end war, because even though the rocket blasting off was shown to shock fighting soldiers into freezing in their paths, what does reaching space have to do with poor foreign relationships?If anything, their enemies will be either jealous of them, want to fight them even harder to obtain their technology,  or they’ll become afraid of what an enemy with space travel possibilities can do to them, forcing them into action.  I also don’t see what good Shino’s speech is going to accomplish, because while I don’t THINK it’s ever explained what the two countries are fighting for, but there’s usually some kind of reason for fighting to take place, and whatever it is, no logic is going to cause warring powers to lay down their guns and start getting along.  Yeah, Shino went into space, and gave everyone a lecture, but once he comes down, everything’s going to go back to the way it was, both for him and for his country.  He hated being a celebrity before the flight, now it’s just going to be worse.  He’s going to become the most famous man on the planet.  I don’t see his flight changing Riquinna’s life, unless he marries her and shares his wealth with her, and the odds that being back on Earth with his space faring days behind him will drive him back down into a brand new cycle of depression are disturbingly high.And that’s where Gainax’s true failure lies.  They were so focused on writing out Shino’s character arc that they didn’t stop to think about the bigger picture, and the effect that his accomplishment would have on the world they built.  It’s fine if you don’t think about it, but when you do, Shino’s big moment just feels like an empty, pointless blip in a long timeline of life just generally being shit.  I legitimately can’t see a sequel to this movie feeling realistic without him coming back to Earth, and eventually committing suicide over the fact that his life dream has already ended, and his life’s purpose has already peaked.  For a story that strives towards one goal, one symbol of impossible hope that’s meant to inspire it’s audience, nothing is really accomplished, which just ends up making the overall experience feel empty and bleak.  Would it be like this if there was a tighter focus on the main character, and the war was left out of the story completely?  No, I don’t think it would be.  But on that note, there’s a lot of stuff in this movie that should have been cut out.For starters, while Shino and Riquinni are pretty well written, everybody else...  Literally everybody else...  Gets the shaft.  Shino has a lot of friends...  The big doofus, the long haired short dude, the best friend who does stuff, and while I promise you they all have names, you won’t know them, and if they even say them...  I can’t remember...  You won’t remember them.  They might as well not even be in the movie.  That would at least make the training montages(yes, plural,) a little shorter.  There’s also a character named Doc, who only has three scenes, is actually kind of likeable in two of them, but then he dies offscreen leaving no impact whatsoever.  That’s a named character dying.  There’s a lot more pointless characters, but what’s even more damning is the pointless world-building, as the ongoing war does nothing other than to add some tension to the launch, and the attempts at assassinating Shino and Matti are nothing more than filler.  With so much going on, and so many problems happening with this fictitious world, the stakes for Shino’s space trip feel a lot more paltry than they would if all that material were just left by the wayside in the first place.  At two hours long, this movie didn’t need to be more than forty-five minutes.There’s also a controversial scene where Shino tries to rape Riquinni, and while a lot of people think of it as the single blemish that keeps this movie from becoming a masterpiece, I honestly don’t mind it so much.  I mean, it bothered me the first time, but...  We’ll get to that.  People tend to think that it comes out of nowhere, that it makes a good person character look like a misogynist asshole, it’s sexist, it seriously undermines the religious aspect of the story...  I disagree on all counts.  That’s not to say it was important, or that what it accomplished couldn’t have been achieved better through other means, but it’s really not as bad as everyone says.  First of all, and I’d never try to make excuses for a sexual assailant, this didn’t come out of nowhere...  The catalyst was just way too subtle.  See, Shino has tried to become more than friends with Riquinni, but was rejected, and he took it like a champ, respecting her and continuing to come to her for religion and deeper meaning.  But then he finds out something about her that flies under the radar of a lot of viewers, including myself on my first viewing...  She’s a prostitute.Now, obviously this is a situational thing, as she’s just selling her body to put food on the table for herself and Manna, but in Shino’s disenfranchised mind, the same religion that’s keeping him away from her hasn’t been keeping her away from other men, so for that one brief moment, he becomes beset by jealousy and entitlement, and sees her as less than a person.  I know rape is a thing that deserves to be demonized, but it’s important to remember that while it’s definitely a bad thing, good people do it, too.  No matter who you are, you can make a mistake that will affect you and another person for the rest of your lives, because even good people can succumb to poor judgement.  Now, don’t get me wrong, humanizing rape does NOT excuse it or defend it, it just teaches you that yes, even YOU could rationalize yourself into performing terrible acts, so don’t ever think of yourself as above them, or you’re more likely to wind up doing the same thing Shino does.  Thankfully, he stops himself.Riquinni also defends herself, justifiably so, which is where I really don’t get the sexism criticism.  She doesn’t just blush, turn her head and ask him to be gentle, as a FUCKING TON of anime would have her do, she clocks him for it.  If anything her apology for using violence to defend herself says a lot more about the effect religion can have on people than it does about gender politics.  In any case, like I said earlier, this is the event that challenges his faith in a higher power, which he recovers from thanks to his faith in himself and his mission, and this could have been achieved in a number of ways that DIDN’T involve rape, but the reason I think it doesn’t work, and the reason I think it makes people so damned uncomfortable, is because, as I said, the reveal of her turning to prostitution is way too subtle.  the visual of her pouring money out of her boot just isn’t clear enough to explain what’s going on, so yeah, that is a huge problem, but is it the single blemish on an otherwise masterpiece?  No.  Not even close.Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise is available stateside on many different DVD releases, including a Pioneer release, a Manga Video release, a couple of imported versions, and most recently, a Maiden Japan release, and chances are you can find it online for cheap.  A four minute pilot to the movie, commissioned by Gainax two years prior, has not been released stateside, at least as far as I know.  You can also view the film on Hulu.Wings of Honneamise is considered by many to be a Gainax classic, an untouchable masterpiece with a very important place in anime history.  I don’t disagree with that last part, as pretty much all of Gainax’s early work has been highly influential on the medium, but I kinda feel like squeezing the brakes on calling it a masterpiece.  Yeah, the animation is almost unrealistically great, and Shino’s character arc does offer a compelling character study, but aside from the few things that I do agree are noteworthy about it, I just don’t think it’s a very good movie.  The pacing is garbage, the scenes feel like they could have been shuffled out of order without losing very much impact, and there’s almost no attempt at foreshadowing a lot of what should have been important events.  I do respect Gainax for it’s ambition and creativity...  Well, back then, at least...  But as writers, this movie carries a lot of the issues that have always plagued them.  Their work may be important, it may be influential, but it benefits heavily from peoples’ nostalgia.   Case in point, this movie may have looked beautiful, but it was so full of pulp and badly focused that I could barely manage to stay awake.  I give Royal Space Force; Wings of Honneamise a 4/10. joined the royal space force...  Perhaps they wanted a taste of military pay checks without having to actually fight...  But the general attitude among the base is one of blasé apathy, as the entire squadron would rather meander around the red light district than attempt to make any progress towards the heavens, to the great chagrin of their often disrespected superiors, who want nothing more than to kick their butts into shape.

It’s great for the character, and it teaches something to the audience, but consider this:  He’ll have to come down eventually, or he’s going to die, whether from starvation, suffocation, or hypothermia.  While the movie went into great, and hell, almost too much detail on how the spaceship was being built and how it was going to fly, I don’t recall anything being said about the return trip, which has to happen.  And even if he does manage to get back safely, it’s still not going to satisfy the people who criticized the royal space Force for wasting potential war and/or food money on a pointless endeavor.  In fact, they’ll probably be even more pissed off, since they’re likely going to need even MORE money for their next trip to the stars. I’m also having a hard time believing that their accomplishment will end war, because even though the rocket blasting off was shown to shock fighting soldiers into freezing in their paths, what does reaching space have to do with poor foreign relationships?If anything, their enemies will be either jealous of them, want to fight them even harder to obtain their technology,  or they’ll become afraid of what an enemy with space travel possibilities can do to them, forcing them into action.  I also don’t see what good Shino’s speech is going to accomplish, because while I don’t THINK it’s ever explained what the two countries are fighting for, but there’s usually some kind of reason for fighting to take place, and whatever it is, no logic is going to cause warring powers to lay down their guns and start getting along.  Yeah, Shino went into space, and gave everyone a lecture, but once he comes down, everything’s going to go back to the way it was, both for him and for his country.  He hated being a celebrity before the flight, now it’s just going to be worse.  He’s going to become the most famous man on the planet.  I don’t see his flight changing Riquinna’s life, unless he marries her and shares his wealth with her, and the odds that being back on Earth with his space faring days behind him will drive him back down into a brand new cycle of depression are disturbingly high.And that’s where Gainax’s true failure lies.  They were so focused on writing out Shino’s character arc that they didn’t stop to think about the bigger picture, and the effect that his accomplishment would have on the world they built.  It’s fine if you don’t think about it, but when you do, Shino’s big moment just feels like an empty, pointless blip in a long timeline of life just generally being shit.  I legitimately can’t see a sequel to this movie feeling realistic without him coming back to Earth, and eventually committing suicide over the fact that his life dream has already ended, and his life’s purpose has already peaked.  For a story that strives towards one goal, one symbol of impossible hope that’s meant to inspire it’s audience, nothing is really accomplished, which just ends up making the overall experience feel empty and bleak.  Would it be like this if there was a tighter focus on the main character, and the war was left out of the story completely?  No, I don’t think it would be.  But on that note, there’s a lot of stuff in this movie that should have been cut out.For starters, while Shino and Riquinni are pretty well written, everybody else...  Literally everybody else...  Gets the shaft.  Shino has a lot of friends...  The big doofus, the long haired short dude, the best friend who does stuff, and while I promise you they all have names, you won’t know them, and if they even say them...  I can’t remember...  You won’t remember them.  They might as well not even be in the movie.  That would at least make the training montages(yes, plural,) a little shorter.  There’s also a character named Doc, who only has three scenes, is actually kind of likeable in two of them, but then he dies offscreen leaving no impact whatsoever.  That’s a named character dying.  There’s a lot more pointless characters, but what’s even more damning is the pointless world-building, as the ongoing war does nothing other than to add some tension to the launch, and the attempts at assassinating Shino and Matti are nothing more than filler.  With so much going on, and so many problems happening with this fictitious world, the stakes for Shino’s space trip feel a lot more paltry than they would if all that material were just left by the wayside in the first place.  At two hours long, this movie didn’t need to be more than forty-five minutes.There’s also a controversial scene where Shino tries to rape Riquinni, and while a lot of people think of it as the single blemish that keeps this movie from becoming a masterpiece, I honestly don’t mind it so much.  I mean, it bothered me the first time, but...  We’ll get to that.  People tend to think that it comes out of nowhere, that it makes a good person character look like a misogynist asshole, it’s sexist, it seriously undermines the religious aspect of the story...  I disagree on all counts.  That’s not to say it was important, or that what it accomplished couldn’t have been achieved better through other means, but it’s really not as bad as everyone says.  First of all, and I’d never try to make excuses for a sexual assailant, this didn’t come out of nowhere...  The catalyst was just way too subtle.  See, Shino has tried to become more than friends with Riquinni, but was rejected, and he took it like a champ, respecting her and continuing to come to her for religion and deeper meaning.  But then he finds out something about her that flies under the radar of a lot of viewers, including myself on my first viewing...  She’s a prostitute.Now, obviously this is a situational thing, as she’s just selling her body to put food on the table for herself and Manna, but in Shino’s disenfranchised mind, the same religion that’s keeping him away from her hasn’t been keeping her away from other men, so for that one brief moment, he becomes beset by jealousy and entitlement, and sees her as less than a person.  I know rape is a thing that deserves to be demonized, but it’s important to remember that while it’s definitely a bad thing, good people do it, too.  No matter who you are, you can make a mistake that will affect you and another person for the rest of your lives, because even good people can succumb to poor judgement.  Now, don’t get me wrong, humanizing rape does NOT excuse it or defend it, it just teaches you that yes, even YOU could rationalize yourself into performing terrible acts, so don’t ever think of yourself as above them, or you’re more likely to wind up doing the same thing Shino does.  Thankfully, he stops himself.Riquinni also defends herself, justifiably so, which is where I really don’t get the sexism criticism.  She doesn’t just blush, turn her head and ask him to be gentle, as a FUCKING TON of anime would have her do, she clocks him for it.  If anything her apology for using violence to defend herself says a lot more about the effect religion can have on people than it does about gender politics.  In any case, like I said earlier, this is the event that challenges his faith in a higher power, which he recovers from thanks to his faith in himself and his mission, and this could have been achieved in a number of ways that DIDN’T involve rape, but the reason I think it doesn’t work, and the reason I think it makes people so damned uncomfortable, is because, as I said, the reveal of her turning to prostitution is way too subtle.  the visual of her pouring money out of her boot just isn’t clear enough to explain what’s going on, so yeah, that is a huge problem, but is it the single blemish on an otherwise masterpiece?  No.  Not even close.Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise is available stateside on many different DVD releases, including a Pioneer release, a Manga Video release, a couple of imported versions, and most recently, a Maiden Japan release, and chances are you can find it online for cheap.  A four minute pilot to the movie, commissioned by Gainax two years prior, has not been released stateside, at least as far as I know.  You can also view the film on Hulu.Wings of Honneamise is considered by many to be a Gainax classic, an untouchable masterpiece with a very important place in anime history.  I don’t disagree with that last part, as pretty much all of Gainax’s early work has been highly influential on the medium, but I kinda feel like squeezing the brakes on calling it a masterpiece.  Yeah, the animation is almost unrealistically great, and Shino’s character arc does offer a compelling character study, but aside from the few things that I do agree are noteworthy about it, I just don’t think it’s a very good movie.  The pacing is garbage, the scenes feel like they could have been shuffled out of order without losing very much impact, and there’s almost no attempt at foreshadowing a lot of what should have been important events.  I do respect Gainax for it’s ambition and creativity...  Well, back then, at least...  But as writers, this movie carries a lot of the issues that have always plagued them.  Their work may be important, it may be influential, but it benefits heavily from peoples’ nostalgia.   Case in point, this movie may have looked beautiful, but it was so full of pulp and badly focused that I could barely manage to stay awake.  I give Royal Space Force; Wings of Honneamise a 4/10.', ""MainThis is a real treat for people who are into vintage anime! Wings of Honneamise [WoH] is very much like a Miyazawa anime [Nausicaa, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Castle] except instead of dealing with fantasy WoH is sci-fi.Art-StyleI love the art style, the animation and the character designs. I have the lower-grade fansub version and I know that WoH was just released in Hi-Def and Blu-Ray so I can only imagine how awesome it looks now! But in all honesty, as with Akira, I don't think you would have been able to tell this show was from the 80's were...it not for the music score or some of the tell-tale character designs but animation-wise you would not be able to tell. The animation was not jumpy and there was no looping or any of those tricks. I think the best moment in art and animation culminates at the final launch scene, which was a very beautiful scene! This being a sci-fi anime.you will see a lot of machines and technology but it's no Robotech, Transformers or Gundam, there is no transforming into humanoid looking mecha or any of that and that's why I really liked this show. I love Robotech and Gundam Seed but after a while everyone tries to be like those shows and originality goes though the door, everyone tries to deliver the sleekest, newest, &quot;fantabulously&quot; awe-inspiring mecha......boring! Honneamise pays homage to old-school technology by looking backwards and gives you realistic machines with all the metal, smoke and cabling that goes along with it not to mention the bulky flight suits....a little less glamorous but awe-inspiring art nonetheless.SoundIf you are as old as I am, I think you will say that the ending is probably the most memorable thing when it comes to the music....which sounded like Nu Shooz's &ldquo;I can't wait&rdquo; And that is why I say the music gives it away as an older anime. The opening theme was actually not that bad it was a dramatic piano composition, which didn't sound too dated at all.I watched this show in English and it was very good voice acting on the English side, this was probably supposed to have been for theatrical release or something.StoryThe story is a very subtle one. In the beginning there may not even seem to be a point to it all......and maybe there still isn't! But the moral of the story from what I've gathered is probably about self-awareness. Honneamise starts out small about an introspective and possibly lonely young man who thinks about the insignificant mediocrity of his life and from there it slowly progresses into something of a much grander scale: the science of man. The progression of a country, the conscience of mankind, mankind's place in the world and then our world's place in the universe. So it's about awareness but not only awareness it's also about perspective, personal drives and ambitions.There is also a lot of God-talk, which at first made me apprehensive because it started with the female lead and that little kid always praying and stuff and then it seemed to be contagious because now the main guy was praying all the time.....and I thought &ldquo;oh gawd, what have I gotten myself into?&rdquo; But it's all good and it does seem to serve to add another layer to the story and further accentuates the perspectives between the characters and even the main guy's perspective in this cosmos.Cast/CharactersAs I said before, I loved the character designs they looked very unique. A lot if not most of them are drawn with a high forehead and more realistic chins and jaw lines. Some were more pronounced and squarish and others were softer and rounded. There were also a lot of variations of realistic looking noses instead of just the hint of a line and some shadow.This is just my opinion, but I think that sometimes it's important to have characters look like us so that we can have that human connection with the character, sometimes when the characters are too stylized or glamorized we lose that bond and are no longer able to empathize with them. These characters looked human both in face and body styles. I also think a lot of work was done with wardrobe and set design and you did get the feel of being in another world, place and time. I especially liked the official military dress clothes which was very colorful and unique it did not look like it was borrowed from any other actual culture, I'm always impressed by these types of originality.Worth it or NOT?Again I think this would be a real treat for anyone who's into vintage anime or perhaps an anime sci-fi aficionado. Or maybe even if you are looking for something that not super fantastic or filled with mecha or you have watched all of Hayao Miyazawa's anime and you want to see more stuff like that. There are many reasons to watch this show, either way I don't think you'll be unhappy with this choice.....especially if you have the HD/BluRay version. it not for the music score or some of the tell-tale character designs but animation-wise you would not be able to tell.

Every single little detail is tailored and customized towards showing...a place that is both different and similar to the one we currently inhabit,and it is all done in a manner that does not vaingloriously attempt to draw the eye,but rather allows it to freely wander about and see what there is to see-and there\'s a lot to see. In both mechanical,architectural and character design the artists behind this production excel.The characterization in this movie is done in a similarly careful,subtle and artful manner,letting you realize things about the characters not by their dialogue or even their actions,but by the implications behind said actions and words,that can be seen in many ways and at many angles,all of which equally valid,thus allowing the viewer to again savour the movie at his own pace and discretion,while also making the motion picture incredibly rewatchable due to it.And the themes...oh boy...Maybe I like the themes so much because they speak to me personally,but in this movie some of the most under-represented struggles of mankind come to light-that of the disillusioned post-modern young man-tormented by expectations he himself has set upon him and never truly able to break out of his own pre-conceived notions of what is success,what is happiness and what is prosperity-all things he seeks to accomplish,but never truly reaches towards,because he is never sure what he is even trying to come to hold-this terrible cycle repeating over and over leaving the person more and more tired and unwilling to go on each time. Shirotsugh Lhadatt is the subtly characterized,plain-looking incarnation of this struggle as his once reasonable ambitions to become a military pilot get turned into soot as he realizes he\'s not good enough,then realizes he has nothing else to aspire to(and all this before the movie even starts) and yet he has to do something with his life-and so joins the Space Force. The supposed ""ascent to greatness"" of Shiro is followed throughout the movie,but the absolute genius of Yamaga\'s writing is that Shiro never recovers from his horrible self-destructive depression at the beginning of the movie,but just tries to push through,despite and in spite of it,just because he knows-not in his heart,but in his mind(for his heart keeps weighing him down) that he has to go on and do his duty to his homeland-that he is finally needed. Yet through this journey he is pursued by the vestiges of his sorrow-in the face of Riquinni Nonderaiko who he knows he should fall in love with and treasure,yet is ultimately bored,repulsed and disgusted by. Who he tries to rape,simply because it\'s expected of him to advance things romantically with the girl he\'s met,and that he should like her. Yet inside he\'s too tired to fall in love. Life has broken him,so he,acting on autopilot tries to force himself onto Riquinni,yet realizes that what he\'s doing is a pointless motion in a series of pointless motions that his meeting and befriending the girl had been. It would be good to mention Riquinni\'s religion just simply because it plays to some of the auxiliary themes of the movie-the depersonalization of human beings in post-modern society. Riquinni is shown over and over to preach to people that their disregard for God and their selfishness is what is making society such a miserable place,and while it can clearly be seen that she\'s fanaticized and not perfectly in her right mind,the selfishness and lack of reverence for higher powers of Honneamise\' humanity can be seen over and over in what they do,and can be confirmed by various other characters\' actions and words in later and earlier parts of the movie. Shiro in turn is faced with either becoming a part of this humanity or choosing his own path-yet he\'s incapable of choosing either,and ultimately in the end of the movie fakes a motivational speech,just so he doesn\'t embarrass himself in front of all mankind.With that out of the way the movie does have a few minor issues-the first is that the soundtrack is ultimately unmemorable and while well-performed not so well placed and not interesting enough to coin and define parts of the movie with its\' presence(which leaves the actual scenes to speak for themselves instead,so it\'s a fair tradeoff). The other issue this movie has,that ultimately also plays more to its\' benefit is that the narrative is not conclusive,not concise and ultimately disjointed-but this plays to make the movie appear more like a real thing that could have happened in a real place,instead of an artifice of pretentious stagecraft. But due to it,one does not enjoy the movie overmuch while watching it-always confused and unsettled by the brisk shifts in tone and theme that alternate wildly and violently,often without immediately noticeable logic,which makes this movie\'s first watch feel a bit alienating. But then again once the movie is finished one can see all the threads and plot points come together to weave a truly unique picture and show things seldom shown properly and realistically in cinema. a place that is both different and similar to the one we currently inhabit,and it is all done in a manner that does not vaingloriously attempt to draw the eye,but rather allows it to freely wander about and see what there is to see-and there\'s a lot to see.

I like flying. My biggest wish is to fly toward Venus, toward Mars, which is really flying. - Yuri Gagarin the first man to go into orbit around the earthOn my quest to watch every available Gainax work I first stumbled upon Ouritsu Uchuugun or Royal Space Force. A social commentary on various things but most of all our role in the universe, and what our role has been until this very moment, quite surprised that unlike other works like gunbuster or EVA not much is known about this little gem.StoryThe story isn't hard to...follow we're lead to believe that we're in some alternate world of the present where Japan is working on a space program, the only one in the world and their plights in raising  the staff of the force, the public's less than favorable attitude towards the program itself and foreign interest in the technology. The film does a good job of emulating a cold war esque atmosphere, but frankly tries too hard to drive the point home with some pretty unnecessary action scenes that could be used to flesh out the side characters. But surprisingly the show deludes you into thinking that the movie is about the RSF, when it's really about something much deeper and much more interesting, and with each of the scenes we see the MC change and attain some new state of being allowing for a very character driven and interesting exploration of the human condition. The conflict explored is simple and yet hard to answer: Should we favor progress and move forward no matter what the costs, or should we halt progress and work on our current and immediate happiness that is already far out of reach?ArtThe art is very good for its time, the animation is slick and the various backgrounds fit the current on goings extremely well having an almost akira like feel to it whether it be a bustling city, a frantic carnival, a country side home or a chase scene through downtown. Gainax is already my favorite but I am pretty amazed at the quality of the animation. Though with that said it still is extremely dated so you might be put off by the retro feel of it which to be perfectly honest makes the show to me more enjoyable.SoundSadly enough the soundtrack is only okay, there is nothing that stands out except maybe the ending theme, the music sometimes feels out of place and does not really fit with the atmosphere at all, however sound just like art is pretty subjective so you might like it. Objectively it's not of bad quality itself, however, I felt as though it really didn't fit the movieCharacterNow this is this shows double edged sword, the main character is extremely well explored while the side characters felt lacking in something which is to be somewhat expected in a movie, but I don't like them being just one of the RSF guys. We learn a little bit about each but never everything, we know why our MC is in the RSF but have no idea why any of the others have joined, although when you focus so much on the MC it's not really easy to focus on the other characters, which leads me to my next point. Sometimes I felt as though show assumed I knew what was going on and just went on with it. At points I found myself thinking why is he doing this? And shouldn't he react more to this? Fortunately that was it, I found myself rooting for the MC because how far he had come from the start of the film, you could say he had made a complete 180 and become someone worth respecting, save for some questionable scenes that I'll leave you to Judge.EnjoymentWell being a Gainax fan I was hyped from start to finish, and since space exploration is something I hold dear to my heart I found the show extremely enjoyable subjectively. I say subjectively because that's how I felt at the end of the show, not what the show actually is. Treat the overall score as a middle ground that's probably closer to the average and my score as someone said. ''RSF IS REALLY COOOL!''Bonus info. Apparently gainax is planning a sequel, get hyped for that!OverallIf you enjoyed EVA, or if you like scifi or even if you've just ran out of ''muh symbolism anime'' to watch. Definitely give this a try it is more than worth your time. follow we're lead to believe that we're in some alternate world of the present where Japan is working on a space program, the only one in the world and their plights in raising  the staff of the force, the public's less than favorable attitude towards the program itself and foreign interest in the technology. The film does a good job of emulating a cold war esque atmosphere, but frankly tries too hard to drive the point home with some pretty unnecessary action scenes that could be used to flesh out the side characters. But surprisingly the show deludes you into thinking that the movie is about the RSF, when it's really about something much deeper and much more interesting, and with each of the scenes we see the MC change and attain some new state of being allowing for a very character driven and interesting exploration of the human condition. The conflict explored is simple and yet hard to answer: Should we favor progress and move forward no matter what the costs, or should we halt progress and work on our current and immediate happiness that is already far out of reach?ArtThe art is very good for its time, the animation is slick and the various backgrounds fit the current on goings extremely well having an almost akira like feel to it whether it be a bustling city, a frantic carnival, a country side home or a chase scene through downtown. Gainax is already my favorite but I am pretty amazed at the quality of the animation. Though with that said it still is extremely dated so you might be put off by the retro feel of it which to be perfectly honest makes the show to me more enjoyable.SoundSadly enough the soundtrack is only okay, there is nothing that stands out except maybe the ending theme, the music sometimes feels out of place and does not really fit with the atmosphere at all, however sound just like art is pretty subjective so you might like it.

Girl changes his world view and he undergoes some kind of deep seated change. Very standard stuff, just with a heaping tablespoon of religion and moralizing.Honestly though, the art is so outstanding. It more than makes up...for the above shortcomings.There is only one scene that I can say nearly broke me, near the final act of the movie the main character. He outright sexually assaults the female lead in a scarily accurate sequence that turned my stomach.This isn't some James Bond guy kiss girl, girl slap guy, guy kisses her again and then they're into it.This was full on, push girl naked to ground and pin her limbs so she can't escape.It was frankly disgusting and ruined the entire tone the movie was going for, even during the climax of the movie I couldn't get it out of my head.I guess I'd say watch this movie but that scene alone was such a dozy I don't know what to think.Apparently a sequel has been in some level of development for the last 20 years, though I can't say I'm interested in exploring this setting again. for the above shortcomings.There is only one scene that I can say nearly broke me, near the final act of the movie the main character.

The costumes, backgrounds and even the car design are all 'believable' alternative entities to our own. In my opinion, this film is worth watching even if only for those elements, but on top of that it has a great plot, and utterly believable characters.Absolutely perfect. "", ""Rewatched _Wings of Honneamise_, which was as excellent as I remembered. I noticed a number of things this time around that I hadn't the first time, like the protagonist employing his sword training in dealing with an assassin - echoing the general theme of him drawing on the training & space program he had previously considered useless. I also think I understand his attempted rape better: throughout the movie appear dichotomies between peace & war, good and bad - the space program is peaceful but used to spark war, technology is what lifts up man but also used to hurt and kill, etc. The protagonist...befriends the woman and orphan, but the motivation to love can also be the motivation to desire. befriends the woman and orphan, but the motivation to love can also be the motivation to desire."", ""Royal Space Force is one of the most unique animes I've ever seen. It's certainly flawed, and narratively it didn't really come together for me, but it has this outstanding quality as a pure creative endeavor that allowed me to enjoy it regardless.The art is just spectacular. The level of detail, vividness, and imagination is something rare and special. The strongest part of this movie, for me, was probably its visual design. How often do you get to see a unique and thoroughly imagined alternate world portrayed so faithfully? I wish the story had told us more about that world. Unfortunately, most things are left...fairly vague and unexplored. There's a lot of untapped potential here. Longform storytelling is hard, and I think this film would have been much more effective as a short, rather than a feature-length.The relationship between the two main characters has some interesting subtlety, but is never really explored, like pretty much all the characters themselves. I was disappointed by how distant all the people in this film felt. I had a hard time relating to anyone, and never felt like I really knew or understood anyone's motivations. For a film going for more of a serious and philosophical tone, this seemed like a big oversight. The philosophy itself was presented in a fairly ham-fisted way, as well. It would have been more compelling if they could have illustrated their points more, instead of having characters yak about them. Oh well.One other lacking aspect was the music. Loud, clunky synthesizers drag down otherwise perfectly fine moments, or create a confusing tone. One thing that puzzled me about this film is the tone itself -- I wasn't ever sure how I was supposed to be feeling at a given point in the story. Some scenes seem to be a weird mashup of screwball comedy and serious drama. A strong feeling of ennui pervades Royal Space Force, dampening the enthusiasm and fighting spirit that might otherwise shine through in a film about an underdog space program. Perhaps I'm missing the point of what they were going for, but I just had a hard time figuring out what exactly that point was, aside from the obvious: war is bad, humans have the capacity for evil, human priorities are often inverted. These are fair points to explore, but this film just stays on the surface, and never really explores them, simply presents them over and over again.I had a hard time figuring out how to rate this. I loved the visuals and the worldbuilding, and didn't like much else. But there's a certain je ne sais quoi to Royal Space Force -- you can feel the creative energy behind it, and the world is rendered so compellingly that it's a pleasure to exist in it, even if the story taking place there isn't that great.

But make no mistake, the film is only okay at best.5/10Story: At its core, Honneamise no Tsubasa is essentially a 2 hour anti-war/pro-religion commercial. It does nothing truly different or revolutionary for it to be called a gem or underrated. Most of its themes are barely touched upon or are just flat out underdeveloped. War, corruption, and religion are the primary subject matters. Honneamise no Tsubasa...does very little to expand upon on how truly terrible war can be. It takes these themes and leaves them undercooked. There are a few scenes where you might notice that things such as war and corruption have affected the world, but these moments won\'t stick with you. You\'ve seen these themes done better in other anime/manga or even in different forms of media. The story overall just feels unfinished.8/10Art/Animation: Excellent. The film still holds up to this day. I can\'t lie I absolutely love me some classic animation. I yearn for this style to make a return every day, but that\'s just simply not going to happen. The world is very detailed, it has its own flair, meshing steampunk, cyberpunk with a dash of light fantasy ala Studio Ghibli. It almost feels like an estranged sibling to Miyazaki\'s Nausicaa. If there\'s any reason to like this film, it\'s definitely the art.6/10Sound: It\'s fine. The music and voice acting are just fine. The music won\'t stick with you nor will the voices, but what\'s there is passable enough.5/10Characters: This is a mixed bag. First, you have our protagonist, Shirotsugh ""Shiro"" Lhadatt. He\'s lazy, aloof, and kind of relatable to be honest. Shiro wanted to be a pilot, but he, unfortunately, couldn\'t make the cut due to poor grades so he eventually lost all motivation and joined the RSF (Royal Space Force). The RSF is an organization not unlike our NASA. Overall Shiro is at most, a harmless character. He\'s not someone you would want to follow around but at the same time, it could be much, much worse. He\'s eventually motivated in a somewhat unrealistic way. He goes from lazy, cynical loser to motivated shounen protagonist fairly quickly. It\'s not odd for a character or a real life person to become quickly motivated. Sometimes, all you need to do is talk to he right person. But the problem is that his original motivation is tossed aside. What could have been solid character development is replaced by different motivation that originally has no ties to his character.Next up (oh boy) is Riquinni Nonderaiko. Riquninni is the typical religious nut (that\'s not an insult) and the reason why Shiro became motivated. Now Riquinni\'s reason for existing is questionable. At first glance, you might think she exists as a romantic subplot for Shiro, but you would be wrong. I honestly have no real answer on why she exists other than to be a plot device to motivate Shiro and have his morality questioned(?). There\'s a scene where she loses her house. This could have been a good moment to have her faith questioned but, no, she just forgives and moves on. Then there\'s another moment *SPOILERS* where Shiro tries to fucking rape her. She fends him off and the next day Shiro tries to bring it up and SHE JUST FORGIVES HIM *SPOILERS END*. In short, Riquinni wants to have her cake and eat it too. She wants to lecture everyone and have unshakable faith without any impactful character moments because she\'s always in the right and anyone who doesn\'t see things the way she sees them is wrong. I guess the movie director is a Christan? She isn\'t relatable, she isn\'t well written or developed. She is dumb and unrealistically naive.As for the rest of the characters? They\'re forgettable but enjoyable. There are many scenes where  Shiro\'s friends are quite fun to watch. You have a few charming and whimsical moments. If you take away anything from this film it\'s the entertainment you get from watching Shiro and his friends pal around and of course the art.Overall: This film just felt undercooked plain and simple. Any of its themes it tries to convey are done in mediocre fashion at best.

The film has its own surreal little world set in a time that\'s something like the economic expansion following the WWII era. In this world the ""Royal Space Force"" are a group of people...who aim to put a man among the stars. They\'re treated like some kind of joke, as a matter of fact even their own people are lethargic about the idea of going to space, but that\'s only until one of their men volunteers to do it. Shirotsugh Lhadatt\'s feelings towards space travel are changed when he meets a young religious woman following the death of a comrade, and she becomes the first person to express a genuine interest in his work. The bond between them sparks some kind of motivation in Shiro to take his job more seriously, and seemingly everything goes uphill from there.The art and animation is spectacular. For those who know them well, studio Gainax\'s animators had a thing for working quite effectively even when they were on a budget in their early years (e.g. the Daicon opening animations). Their skill shines mostly for the first time here - beautiful carefully crafted backgrounds along with fluid and detailed motions and an expressive art style make this one of the most visually appealing films around.The soundtrack is its biggest flaw. Some may like it and some may not, but it\'s jarringly louder than the rest of the film and it\'s almost reminiscent of banging on trash cans at times, and that killed some of the enjoyment for me since a soundtrack is such an important part of a film, especially one full of excited emotions like Honneamise.I can\'t say I liked any of the characters in particular, but they\'re good. Just about every role carries a sense of some importance that contributes to the integrity of the whole thing.Overall, Wings of Honneamise is a spectacular, enchanting watch and you won\'t regret taking two hours of your time to see it. who aim to put a man among the stars.

For me, there could be nothing better than flying.""Royal Space Force is the debut film of the legendary studio Gainax. Probably best known for their later success (and massively overrated mess) Evangelion. Originally a box office flop it later went on to become regarded as a cult classic due to the success and reappraisal it had on home video. Taking place on an alternate world where a disengaged young man, Shirotsugh, inspired by an idealistic woman named Riquinni, volunteers to become the first astronaut, which becomes a decision that draws them into both...public and personal conflict.Royal Space Force\'s collective approach to filmmaking, its deliberate rejection of established anime motifs, its visual complexity, and the general lack of professional experience among its staff were all factors in its chaotic production while increasing uncertainty about the project led to what has been described as an attempt by its investors and producers to ""fix"" the film before release, imposing a late name change to The Wings of Honnêamise, and a lavish but deceptive publicity campaign that included misleading advertising and a staged Hollywood premiere. Although receiving a generally good reception among domestic anime fans and the industry upon its original 1987 Japanese release, including praise from Hayao Miyazaki.The retrospective failure of this film means that Gainax would later thrive in other projects but looking back on this film is a treat to see, just how different they started out, and it has thankfully stood the test of time. Brought to life by a team of relative unknowns at the time, including a pre-depressed Hideki Anno, Royal Space Force is a slow burn but a treat from start to finish.Originally starting out in life as a 10 minute OVA, the film developed from the original pilot into what we see today, it remains a gorgeously animated piece with the major highlights being in the hyper-detailed background work, with almost every frame a painting. However, what truly sold this film for me was the amazingly crafted musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto and crew. The development of the music throughout the film showcase a changing society from it\'s use of woodwind and orchestral elements at the beginning to the re-composed Main Theme with the use of synthesizers.There is one major drawback which they thankfully cut from the original home media release but later reinstated on Blu-ray to present the film uncut. The almost 30-second long scene of attempted rape which is so massively disjointed that it baffles me as to why they turned a much more family-friendly film into an edgy teenage one with that single moment. But in the end, it\'s done in a better light than a lot of films nowadays.Overall, Royal Space Force is a gorgeous slow burn with beautiful animation and music, well worth your time.""Dear God, please give us your mercy.

We\'ve spoiled the land, we\'ve fouled the air"".A technical achievement if there ever was one, I couldn\'t take my eyes off the screen. It doesn\'t feel like a stretch to call Honnêamise one of the most elaborate and creative settings of the medium. Yeah there\'s its own currency, unique architecture and transportation, but there\'s also its own units of time and length, as well as neat little...background details for eagle eyes, such as vandalised posters of Shirotsugh in protest against the Force and its funding, which has created an increase in unemployment and homelessness. Scathing is the film\'s critique of militarism - its industry, its consequences, and its apathetic proponents. In Shirotsugh, we see a contemplative everyman in search of purpose, and a vessel for which ""the hero"" can be deconstructed. The guy wants to live in a peaceful world, forms genuine connections, and ultimately accomplishes the impossible. However, he represents the economic inequality which surrounds Honnêamise being the Force\'s poster boy, he has to overcome the reality that he\'s a marked man, I mean shit, he attempts to sexually assault the woman he mutually resonates with and is immediately regretful. Speaking of which, the woman in question, Riquinni, and the young girl she looks after, Manna, provide immense warmth to the experience, even during moments of tragedy and at their most vulnerable. The soundtrack is also fucking top-notch. I could see this thing being an annual rewatch, I most certainly want to listen to its audio commentary, not only as some form of elucidation, but as a substitute for reading the film\'s comically long Wikipedia article. background details for eagle eyes, such as vandalised posters of Shirotsugh in protest against the Force and its funding, which has created an increase in unemployment and homelessness.

The guy wants to live in a peaceful world, forms genuine connections, and ultimately accomplishes the impossible. However, he represents the economic inequality which surrounds Honnêamise being the Force\'s poster boy, he has to overcome the reality that he\'s a marked man, I mean shit, he attempts to sexually assault the woman he mutually resonates with and is immediately regretful. Speaking of which, the woman in question, Riquinni, and the young girl she looks after, Manna, provide immense warmth to the experience, even during moments of tragedy and at their most vulnerable. The soundtrack is also fucking top-notch. I could see this thing being an annual rewatch, I most certainly want to listen to its audio commentary, not only as some form of elucidation, but as a substitute for reading the film\'s comically long Wikipedia article.', 'Spoilers I guessHow the story is structure and how the story is told reminds me the 80\'s, in that it is too long.  Even the Movie ""Never ending Story"" was only 94mins  so no excuses but whatever.The animation is very good at least and being 1987 it is even better than some of today(2020)\'s anime looking at you Real 3d Girl.Here\'s the Spoilers: A different reviewer said the characters won\'t developed enough.  But that is very wrong because in fact they were very developed.  Riquinni the religious ""nut"" stood her ground meaning she never stop...being who she was.  One reviewer said she should lose her faith after she lost her home but  why should she lose her faith plenty of people who arent religious lost their homes too maybe they should get some faith.  She never fell for Shirotsugh BS.  Shirotsugh started as a scumbag and finish as one too.  He saw a street preaching pretty 17 year old girl and thought he could run game on her and lose that V-card.  He even tired being nice to her kid(abandoned kid she is taking care of because she is a saint) to get some points with her.  When he saw they lost their electricity i thought he will pay the bill, nope.  When she lost her home I thought maybe he\'ll ask them moved in with him, nope.  She wouldn\'t have move with him just like that without a ring but I was like this world sucks why not ask her to marry you, she is a religious nut but a good person she opens her legs the kid has a mom and dad.  Shirotsugh was looking for a booty call i respect that, that\'s how the character was written, that\'s who he is.I might get some heat for this opinion: The rape scene not so bad he did stop himself it\'s still wrong of him but he did stop before anything and he was knocked out.  She did forgave him she was not only smiling at him but she was leading him on in the whole movie come on.  Making him food calling him at work, she was looking for that ring/husband.Enjoyment: the only enjoyment i got was analyzing the characters after the movie was done so 5 meaning average is fair i right a lot of anime 5. being who she was.

Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34262/Oushitsu_Kyoushi_Heine,"[""The Royal Tutor: A show that most expected to be shounen-ai or a rip-off of Ouran Highschool Host Club, but actually wasn't.*SPOILER FREE*Story: 8/10Heine Wittgenstein is the new royal tutor for four of the princes of Grannzreich. The princes have pushed away their previous tutors, but Heine strives to make a bond with them to show them that a teacher should be someone they can trust and depend on. Overall, the whole idea and execution of this was pretty heartwarming, and if you like that kind of stuff you'll likely find this series enjoyable. Underneath this, there is a mystery plot and some really...nice backstory elements that are revealed as the show goes on, and, by the end, they come together in a great way. At the same time, the plot isn't anything new or groundbreaking, it's just the execution that made it stand out.Art: 10/10Not too much to say about my rating besides I simply liked how it looked. The shading was pretty unique and the art style itself is very neat, so it was something I looked forward to each episode. Also, a big part of the art style: Chibis. EVERYWHERE. At least once in every episode (If not more, with exception to some serious ones) the art style switches to a chibi one, which you will either find adorable or highly annoying. Personally, although I was annoyed at first, I ended up liking it because it adds to the character's personalities in some scenes. So, be warned, CHIBIS.Sound: 9/10Again, not much to say here besides I liked it. The music went well with the setting and story and made the series even more enjoyable. On occasion, there were some sound effects that were overexaggerated, which came off as weird, but not annoying.Character: 9/10Initially, each prince has their own quirk that makes them stand out and easy to remember. Although they may seem one-sided at first, there is a lot more to them that is revealed as the series goes on. Overall, character development was one of the best parts about this because it was clear and understandable. Some backstory is tied into this as well and it's all done in a great way.Enjoyment: 9/10I looked forward to new episodes of this anime, but it was kind of slow at first, so it may be a hit-or-miss thing. It's definitely not the best I've seen but it kept my interest with a decent story and nice execution.Pros:- Average story with an interesting plot- Each episode adds to the personality of characters and character development is portrayed really well- Pretty art and nice music- Nothing seemed rushed and everything flowed together smoothlyCons: .- Plot reveals can be slow at times- Seemed like the series was going nowhere for a bitOverall: 9/10I definitely recommend watching this series, it's heartwarming and has great with characters with equally great character development.

No unnecessary side-stories, so If you like the idea itself, you definitely should don't have to worry about wasted potential.Characters have very diffrent personalities, althrough they may seem a bit exaggerated, but I didn't found any of them annoying or tiring and felt their emotions.The graphics itself is very...adorable, however you may be tired of many chibi artwork. But scenery is made really well.The music is very average, so don't expect excellent soundtrack of this one.Summarizing, this anime is truly something, what should gain more attention.

It\'s a lighthearted character driven slice of life story, focused on self-improvement so each of the princes can become worthy candidates to the throne. The characters themselves are unfortunately fairly simple, but still have enough depth and charm so that I wouldn\'t describe them as being one-dimensional. All of the princes have easily memorable personalities and flaws due to this simplicity, so given the show is only 12 episodes long, being simple may be a necessary evil. The dialogue was kind of bland, I\'m not sure what is was about it but it felt...like what a character in a book would talk like rather than a real person. All of the plotlines themselves are also very straightforward and mostly predictable, but despite this it was all really wholesome, and didn\'t bother me all too much. To my surprise there\'s actually an underlying plot behind all of this, which was fairly enjoyable, although I would\'ve preferred if there was a larger emphasis on world building as there seemed to be some potential.The show\'s humor was decent; I don\'t think it tried too hard to be hilarious, just enough to keep you entertained. A lot of the verbal jokes were on a similar caliber to ""look the tutor is short"" and ""that ostrich thinks you look like a girl,"" but I did actually enjoy a lot of the visual humor like when Heine turns into a pouty chibi.On the technical side of things, if anyone actually cares:The animation is good, although not impressive.The art is nice, but the artstyle is fairly generic. There were maybe 2 or 3 character designs that made a good impression on me.The music is fitting, but also fairly unnoticeable, and doesn\'t stand out as anything special.Overall I say while it isn\'t a standout show in any regard, it\'s quite wholesome, and more or less enjoyable the entire way through (maybe with some minor cringe at parts). I don\'t recommend going out of your way to watch it, but if you think you\'d enjoy a wholesome slice of life I wouldn\'t recommend against it either. 6.5/10 like what a character in a book would talk like rather than a real person.

It is rather calm, slice-of-life anime that centers around the meticulous balance between teaching academics and teaching life lessons.The only problem that I have with this show is that... I don\'t think it\'s going to be anything groundbreaking. The first three episodes have been rather formulaic from the standard world-building and ""character development"" that occurs at the beginning of any show. I put """" around character development because this show tries to convince the viewers that its characters are unique because of its use of ""individual interviews"" that give a...more personalized understanding of each character. However, when you step away from that perspective, these characters becomes nothing more than cookie-cutter stereotypes floating around in anime. These somewhat cliche characters coupled with its rather slow narrative progression creates a rather average first impression.Luckily, this show is held up by decent artwork contrasts between the chibi artwork and the serious 3D character models. They work well to speed up the pace of the show and make light-hearted interactions that hide this anime\'s, so far, weak plot. The sound is nothing extraordinary either. I do enjoy the light piano motifs throughout the show, and the VAs are not that bad either, I really enjoy Keisuke Ueda\'s performance as Heide. The rest of the cast does a solid job as well. I would not expect any breakout performances from this rather young group of VAs though.Overall, the show has the potential to go somewhere. The plot has a solid foundation, and the characters have fit within their archetypes. It is all about the execution of its story that wrap this all together. At its best, this show would be around an 8/10, and at its worst it would be a 3/10. The show has room from growth, but not the ability to be fantastic because it is about as formulaic as a 5 paragraph essay. I hope that this show breaks out of its mold soon, or else, this show is going to be forgotten within this anime season. (6.5/10) more personalized understanding of each character.

(6.5/10)', 'Don\'t be tricked by my seemingly low score, I\'m very stringent when it comes to scores and to earn a 10/10, it has to be flawless, one of the best things I\'ve ever seen, to get a 9/10, it has to be at least so enjoyable that I can\'t stop watching as if spellbound with no(to me) bad parts. To reach an 8/10, it\'s still extremely good without any striking/notable boring or crappy/irritating parts, a show that I got pretty immersed into and are kinda sad ended because I would\'ve wanted to see more.Sure, there were bad parts about it too, like the fact that...it\'s a bit overly simplistic with illogical conclusions to many things, it just wouldn\'t work out like that if it was real. The story itself was fairly shallow too and it\'s fairly slow-paced. Then there\'s the art, where my main complaint is actually the ways this author chose to draw children, at least ""noble"" children, the little princess looks pretty damn creepy, she doesn’t even look like a living thing, she looks more like a very disproportionate(even when it comes to anime) doll, I think the colours used also makes it feel even more unnatural. Whoever drew her should learn how to draw young children properly and not try to make them look cuter by making their eyes literally fill half their faces. No matter what people say, when it comes to characters like the princess, looks DO matter if we are to like them. Well, she\'s not even important and like the rest of the female characters, is almost never shown since the main focus is the princes and the teacher.However, it was nothing that major. It wasn\'t supposed to be a very realistic story in the first place. The drama is well-placed and so is the comedy. The comedy doesn\'t stand out too much, but it did make me laugh now and then. It\'s a fairly slow show but it has a very peaceful feeling, calming me down without boring me, like a cup of tea after a busy day. What stands out the most in this show is probably the characters themselves. Most of them warms the heart to some extent, they\'re pretty fleshed out and feel real, something many anime/manga/novels fail to do nowadays. They\'re not restricted to simply one or two personality traits which they show every time, no, they can display many types of emotions and feelings and they can do things outside of their main trait. They feel pretty human, being vibrant and lively. We can also see them clearly developing as they mature and absorb the teachings of the mc.Honestly, it\'s a great show. When I first saw it, I was pretty much against watching it since it had the same vibe as some other shows that I wasn\'t fond of and also seemed to be more akin to a shoujo anime than anything else(like the fact that there\'s almost ONLY guys and the art style too), but I couldn\'t have been more wrong. It\'s a heartwarming, slightly humorous story with some light drama about the relationship between a teacher and his students(not so much about the studying itself, at least not the studying we\'re used to, being more about experiencing things and learning stuff that they\'re bad at, like expressing emotions, learning how to handle fear against studying, learning how commoners live etc). There might be no notable girls, but that\'s simply only because romance was never even a slight element of this anime. It would remove the focus from what matters if females were running around and disturbing the teaching and relationships, it would also force the author to juggle with more balls instead of focusing on what he\'s supposed to do. I feel like it was the correct decision to not include any female presence.Give it a try, watch at least an episode or two before deciding if it\'s to your liking or not, it\'s not the type of anime that you can watch a few minutes of and decide that it sucks, it\'s not nearly high-paced enough for that. it\'s a bit overly simplistic with illogical conclusions to many things, it just wouldn\'t work out like that if it was real.

I didn\'t expect too much, going by the opening and the premise, but was pleasantly surprised along the way.Story - 8/10The story starts out pretty bland, a man is sent to the royal palace to teach the four princes to be able to become the next king. The first very generic Harem - feeling is destroyed after 2 or 3 episodes, where it becomes clear that there\'s more to it than what it seems. The story development is relatively confusing at the beginning, almost as if the creators didn\'t really know where to go with the story...- OR they tried to hide the actual storyline under a bunch of comedy and schooling activities. However, because of this, the anime does a great job keeping its viewers coming back - it drops very clear but subtle hints that you will find out more in the episodes to come and still leads you astray to not find out what exactly it could be.This, on the other hand, leads to some instances being a bit over the top and blown out of proportion (that might only be my opinion though).Art - 10/10I am very weak to art that is both fluffy and sexy at the same time. I love the play on light that\'s going on with the characters\' eyes and hair. Moreover, nothing seems out of place, no weird hair or eye colours, no outlandish clothes or whatnot, there\'s not even the typical ""conspiciously light patch"" (something in the picture is drawn differently, so you know it\'s gonna move).The colour schemes are all very nice and in harmony, also, to a certain degree, realistic.And the landscape, well... I can\'t be impartial here. I\'m from Vienna. I can clearly see that the whole Anime is blatantly based on that city, and Austria in general (honestly, just google pictures of the Hofburg or the Opera, you\'ll see). Needless to say, I found it hillarious.Sound - 8/10Sound is something where, the less I have to say, the better it is. I can easily give a high rating when I didn\'t notice the music at all. The thing that annoyed me here was that, apparently, there exists a total of 1 song for everything, and that got boring after some time. Other than that, hey, no complaints.Charakter - 9/10Character development is basically the center of this anime. The princes have very different personalities and problems, and Haine tries sorting them out and/or learns to deal with them. Much like in a Harem.  But there is noticable development, the characters are not just your usual tropes - they show more and more actual personality, which makes for a very believable setting.Enjoyment - 9/10Yes. I did. A lot. It\'s fun - it\'s cute - it gets you into the story. Even though it\'s nothing ground breaking or world changing, it\'s very nice, and structured extremely well, not too fast, not too slow.Overall - 9/10I would definitely ask you to watch the show. As a bonus, read up on Vienna as a city, then the anime gets immensely pleasing. It\'s nice and fluffy.IT\'S REAL FLUFFY.

However, because of this, the anime does a great job keeping its viewers coming back - it drops very clear but subtle hints that you will find out more in the episodes to come and still leads you astray to not find out what exactly it could be.This, on the other hand, leads to some instances being a bit over the top and blown out of proportion (that might only be my opinion though).Art - 10/10I am very weak to art that is both fluffy and sexy at the same time. I love the play on light that\'s going on with the characters\' eyes and hair. Moreover, nothing seems out of place, no weird hair or eye colours, no outlandish clothes or whatnot, there\'s not even the typical ""conspiciously light patch"" (something in the picture is drawn differently, so you know it\'s gonna move).The colour schemes are all very nice and in harmony, also, to a certain degree, realistic.And the landscape, well... I can\'t be impartial here. I\'m from Vienna. I can clearly see that the whole Anime is blatantly based on that city, and Austria in general (honestly, just google pictures of the Hofburg or the Opera, you\'ll see). Needless to say, I found it hillarious.Sound - 8/10Sound is something where, the less I have to say, the better it is. I can easily give a high rating when I didn\'t notice the music at all. The thing that annoyed me here was that, apparently, there exists a total of 1 song for everything, and that got boring after some time. Other than that, hey, no complaints.Charakter - 9/10Character development is basically the center of this anime. The princes have very different personalities and problems, and Haine tries sorting them out and/or learns to deal with them. Much like in a Harem.  But there is noticable development, the characters are not just your usual tropes - they show more and more actual personality, which makes for a very believable setting.Enjoyment - 9/10Yes. I did.

This is my main show for the season.------------------------I came for the art, I stayed for the character development.*This is not a yaoi/shounen-ai.Story: Starts with a base plot of introducing the mysterious new tutor to the four princes. After that is just wonderful, progressive character development in a slice-of-life setting with a royal twist. Seeing the characters improve is what keeps the show going. Also, light-hearted and silly humour. The story acts as more of a background so the episodes don't directly connect one after the other, giving it a more relaxed pace. A fun and energetic show that leaves...me wanting more each time.Art: The animation is actually beyond my expectations. I find that normally, shorter anime are susceptible to falling short in terms of quality but it's pretty good so far. The art itself is great! The style is pretty detailed, but the colouring stands out even more so. I think it's the shiny hair and eyes that get me. The backgrounds are also well-done, and give you a sense of the privileged lifestyle the princes live. Overall there is good consistency.Sound: So far the background music is good, but not as outstanding as the OP and ED, which are fun to listen to. The voice actors are doing a great job of matching their respective characters' energy and emotion.Character: The tutor's background is shrouded in mystery so far, but he remains humble and compliments the princes' personalities. Supporting characters also help with driving the plot. Each prince is unique in their own way. They start off with somewhat cliche traits, but the reason I've become attached to this show is because I got to see them develop and grow. This will become evident through observing their background and interactions. This is the show's greatest strength in moving forward and keeping my attention.Enjoyment: If you're into silly, light-hearted shows with satisfying character development and not-so-heavy plot then give this show a try.

Heck, even the tutor himself learns a thing or two by the end, albeit not as much as his pupils.Art:Excellent, for an anime. The character designs almost try to mimic the illustration styles of light novel illustrators. The backgrounds are equally vivid and detailed.Sound:Unfortunately the weakest point of the series.

I had read the comments of said listing to find out it wasn't yaoi but I still decided to look into it. From the cover art, I felt it was visually appealing and upon reading what it was about, I felt it could be done well or be total trash.So I took the gamble, and give this show a try. Now, I was going to attempt watching it subbed, as I do most anime, but I had not been up to...speed to reading subs as of late to when I found there was a dub, I decided to give that a shot so that I may also give my thoughts on that as well, as many people wish to know how dubs turn out.So, I think I will talk of that first. As far as dubs go, this was fairly well done. The voice fit nicely, and none were grating on the ears. If you saw the face, it was often the voice you'd think would be there. I will admit that at times, the voices did sound strained, it was mostly when the character should be shouting but were holding their voice back in a more controlled tone. When you think of the setting of the story, it does make sense. Royalty needing to control their emotions so as to not show their true self. So, aside this little bit, I still think it fit in some extent.If dubs had a rating section, I'd give it a 9.Now onto the show itself. The story was very engaging, it often had me on the edge of my seat and waiting for more. I wanted to learn more, about the princes, and the royal tutor himself. Even the King, who was a character all of his own and not simply a slid in side character, so to say.Story has been giving a rating of 9.The art was very appealing to the eye, having stunning effects and yet keeping a simple and yet elegant touch. I have to say I found myself admiring the hair, both in design and color. As an artist myself, it has inspired me to try and do a similar style.Art has been given a rating of 10.The music and effects of the show are very well done. I have to say that I did find myself either humming or singing along with the opening. It fits splendidly with the tone and feel of the show. And it didn't get tedious so that one could listen to it every episode it comes on.

I hope this review has helped in your choice to watch it.~Crusnik speed to reading subs as of late to when I found there was a dub, I decided to give that a shot so that I may also give my thoughts on that as well, as many people wish to know how dubs turn out.So, I think I will talk of that first. As far as dubs go, this was fairly well done. The voice fit nicely, and none were grating on the ears. If you saw the face, it was often the voice you'd think would be there. I will admit that at times, the voices did sound strained, it was mostly when the character should be shouting but were holding their voice back in a more controlled tone. When you think of the setting of the story, it does make sense. Royalty needing to control their emotions so as to not show their true self. So, aside this little bit, I still think it fit in some extent.If dubs had a rating section, I'd give it a 9.Now onto the show itself. The story was very engaging, it often had me on the edge of my seat and waiting for more. I wanted to learn more, about the princes, and the royal tutor himself. Even the King, who was a character all of his own and not simply a slid in side character, so to say.Story has been giving a rating of 9.The art was very appealing to the eye, having stunning effects and yet keeping a simple and yet elegant touch. I have to say I found myself admiring the hair, both in design and color. As an artist myself, it has inspired me to try and do a similar style.Art has been given a rating of 10.The music and effects of the show are very well done. I have to say that I did find myself either humming or singing along with the opening. It fits splendidly with the tone and feel of the show. And it didn't get tedious so that one could listen to it every episode it comes on.

I more would like to see...more, rather than only see it again. more, rather than only see it again.', ""This was my favourite anime of the season and is pretty high up there overall. While at the beginning I thought it would be lacking in plot and just be about cute princes the plot development was great and kept me on the edge of my seat.More into the plot I've given the story a 10 as, the backstories of each prince and Heine himself are great, they actually make sense in terms of storytelling and characterisation while allowing the plot itself to develop. The underlying issue about who is trying to sabotage the princes and the lack of knowledge about Heine's past keeps the...story interesting.The storyline allowed each character to develop while viewers gain insight into their past and the challenges they must overcome.  I really loved this aspect as not many anime choose to have a holistic focus on so many main characters. In terms of each character individually, they were all very well fleshed out and character relationships were great. Due to this I've also given characters a 10.I've given the art style an 8 because while it was good to look at, and tied the story together it was nothing amazing. Even so, the character designs and overall aesthetic looked great.For me the sound was a 7, I'm basing this mainly on the introduction and ending songs as there wasn't much music throughout, or not that I noticed much. Both introduction and ending song were great and I encourage viewing them, they fit with the theme of the anime and worked very well. What drags this score down is the lack of sound elsewhere. While I typically don't focus on sound and did't notice anything bad about in the anime sound wasn't really used to change the mood.I really enjoyed this anime, watching it was fun and the numerous cliff hangers made waiting for each new episode a challenge.

I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible.First off, don't let the fact that it has an all male cast taint your view. This is not yaoi or shounen ai.The story is pretty simple, there are four prince brothers who are in desperate need of an education before they are eligible for the throne.The story starts when their latest tutor shows up, will he leave in a hurry like the others before him? or will he be able to do the impossible and mold these young men into proper candidates...for the throne.I really loved this show. It has stunning visuals that use light reflection in such a beautiful way. The background art is beautiful, the characters all have their own unique look. There is also a good amount of chibi used in the humorous moments that really sell the scenes.So if you are looking for something fun to watch with a good amount of humor and some emotional moments, you should give it a try. for the throne.I really loved this show.

Who would guess that? This anime has very straightforward plot. We first get to know all of boys. And the plot is wandering about the same thing (one of our princes has a problem and Heine is there to help to him overcome it) in almost every episode. This got boring after second prince. The main ""antagonist"" was very weak and I don\'t even know if i can call him like that. Even though connection between Heine and ****** was obvious from the...very beginningit was something refreshing in this story. I liked the flashbacks. And for story that\'s it. Nothing amazing, but it wasn\'t too bad either.I don\'t have much to say about animation. It\'s average. Chibis were cute. I didn\'t see any mistake in artwork.It has nice opening to listen, the ending doesn\'t stand out either. I don\'t remember hearing any background music. It\'s just blandIn section of characters there isn\'t anything new. Heine is the new royal teacher in the palace. He isn\'t discouraged by behavior of boys.His attitude reminds me a little of Koro-sensei, because he has different method of teaching for all of his students. His characteristic feature is the appearance, because he looks much younger than his real age and he\'s considered a child by  people he is meeting. It was at least a few times part of joke. And it started to bore me after second time of mentioning it.The least favorable character for me is Leonhard. He is 15 years old, but is acting like a child. He annoyed me a little. Next is Licht - I actually liked him, because he really cared about others and worked really hard. He wanted to be independent and didn\'t want to rely that much on others. Burno at start is arrogant and I didn\'t like fact that he judged people by fact if they wentto university or not. Of course he changes after he meets Heine. Kai is misunderstood by people at first, cause his communicating skills are very low, but he overcomes it later in series. His bond with sister and pet is really adorable and cute. The last one is Victor - his bond and friendship with Heine was really heartwarming. I probably like him the best. The characters are black and white. Their personalities are just like thousand of others. Even though they changed after meeting Heine it\'s just too predictable. very beginningit was something refreshing in this story.

But as it went on, I started to enjoy this a lot more then I thought I did.. Yes it does have that ' fan service' feel too it, but don't be scared to try this out, its not cringy, every episode was entertaining, there wasn't any boring filler episodes.. Every episode will make you...smile, laugh and cry.The most part of this anime I have to say I loved the most, where all the characters. none of them fell into a shadow  of another, all characters where equally interesting, every prince had there own unique personality. I thought I knew who my favouite prince was, but after competing it all, I just cannot decide!Of course the main character Heine's was just fantastic. He showed very little personality, but he just gave so much..This anime will give you a lot of feels, and make you appreciate things more and to also judge less! smile, laugh and cry.The most part of this anime I have to say I loved the most, where all the characters. none of them fell into a shadow  of another, all characters where equally interesting, every prince had there own unique personality.

I think the plot can be a bit slow moving and a bit repetitive with the -prince has a bad trait-> Heine helps to fix said trait->Heine acknowledges prince for who he is->everyone gets closer- in the beginning but each episode focuses on the adorable personality issues of all the characters and Heine has a past himself that we dive into.I don't think the art is anything too spectacular, but there is definitely nothing wrong with it and this anime's focus isn't to have the most beautiful scenes in anime. The focus of this anime is character growth...and it is definitely meeting that goal! and it is definitely meeting that goal!"", 'When I was scoping out the Spring 2017 Anime line-up, The Royal Tutor didn’t really hit my radar. From the synopsis and the preview graphics that had been released, I honestly thought it was going to be a very cheesy show with some strong boy-love vibes. As a person who doesn’t usually go for the boy-love genre, I wasn’t interested in it at all. But something about it, and I have no fricking clue what, told me to at least watch the first episode so I could confirm my feelings. I’m really glad that I listened to that tiny, not-so-weird-at-all-little-voice-in-my-head because this series ended up...being surprisingly decent.When I began it I got a very strong Ouran High School Host Club aura from it. You’ve got four boys who very quickly get unique names via our Heine-sensei, and they each have a relatively tropey persona. Initially, this made me very hesitant in watching the second episode. No offence towards Ouran, but this trope is so fucking overdone that I didn’t want to deal with another show that revolved around it. Luckily, my fascination with the mysterious tutor outweighed my frustration and I continued onwards.My expectations for the show started to grow, but didn’t really turn into anything fantastic as I watched. Mid-way through the season when we still hadn’t learned anything about the Royal Tutor’s past, I began to feel highly sceptical about the writing. I knew that we were running out of episodes and time for a good, fluid explanation of how a teacher could also be so skilled in combat as to equal a highly-seasoned warrior. There were some very vague hints, but not much else to go on. I also found there to be a slight imbalance on the attention given to each of the four boys, where a couple of them received a lot more screen time than the others. These two aspects actually filled me with a bit of anxiously negative anticipation. I’ve seen it many times before. A show starts off wonderfully, but then it overreaches and falls terribly short in its execution. Luckily, that didn’t really happen with The Royal Tutor.While it’s far from being a glorious masterpiece, it has a decent number of facets that make it quite an enjoyable anime series. The first are the characters themselves. We get to learn about each one of the boys and why they are so vehemently against tutors and education. The reasons aren’t superficial. They are laced with insecurities and bad experiences. Occasionally a reason for one son will seem minor in comparison to another, but it just adds an empathetic dimension to their personas that makes you want to root for their success. I like that these boys aren’t perfect. Their flaws make them that much more engaging.The tutor himself is someone who reminded me of Onizuka from the anime series GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka. He is a man who took the time to understand the underlying issues that kids have in order to better tackle them with a fitting solution. Heine and Onizuka knew that kids aren’t going to respond to a one-size-fits-all solution. Each kid is different with unique issues and problems. To help said kids, you really have to be willing to get to know them and distinguish them as individuals in a way most people don’t want to deal with.Remember how I mentioned earlier I was worried about the imbalance of screen-time for the boys? It turns out that some of the boys needed the extra attention because their problems needed that extra support. It also played very well towards plot progression because the imbalance was created to fit the unique issues and insecurities that each of the sons were going through. For example, one of the kids is a very shy and timid person with a fearsome outwardly appearance. He wasn’t shown nearly as much as I had hoped (he became my favourite character because I could relate to him like you wouldn’t believe) because of this demeanour. It wouldn’t have made sense for him to be sprouting up all over the place, unlike the youngest brother who’s a social whore.The themes in the show were also a bit comforting. Most of it had to deal with accepting yourself for who you are, even if other’s can’t accept you. It was dealt with in a positive way that doesn’t negatively portray awkward social skills, or fetishise issues involving a lower intelligence, etc. etc. I like that the changes that the boys make are gradual instead of just being an instant fix as soon as they comprehend the lessons they’re learning. There’s also a bit of focus on not judging anyone by their appearance or initial mannerisms because there’s a huge chance that you will be wrong about them, friendships come in all shapes and sizes, and soft things will always be cute.All of these elements made for a pleasant watching experience, however, it does have its faults. The humour, while being kooky and a light-hearted means at softening tough topics, is really predictable at times and felt cheesy and out-dated. The story in its entirety is of average quality and can make you feel pretty indifferent about whether you’re having a good time or not. Although I do like the characters, nothing within the The Royal Tutor truly made me anticipate the next episode with impatient, passionate glee. I felt so apathetic about having to wait a week for new content, or when the content finally did arrive I’d watch everything else before really getting to this. The only thing that I was super fricking curious about was Heine’s past, which was a small bit of a let-down because the morsels of clues left in the wake of one episode to the next made it sound like Heine would have a really badass history. Instead the truth was disappointing and anticlimactic.The animation itself is pretty much typical; nothing extraordinary or breath-taking. It’s clean and seemingly well-developed. I found the outdoors scenery to be more pleasant than the interiors. There are a lot more details that go into creating the environment and atmospheres amidst nature than within buildings. We see this with the mansion, or palace, as it just felt like an atypical reproduction of a European mansion that seems quite standard in anime with such structures. Within a local café in town, we get a similar situation. The café does look to be quite large and it is nicely presented, but it doesn’t encapsulate the same sort of attention to details that the natural atmospheres do.Mid-way through the series, we do get a whisper of a small plot that’s being hatched to affect who will inherit the throne if and when the king passes on. This is something that felt extremely out of place to me for multiple reasons. Firstly, it randomly just pops up at the finale of an episode or two and then isn’t brought up again until a few episodes later. Secondly, when it is brought up, it’s only for a couple of minutes; not nearly enough to make any sort of impact. It makes one last appearance during the final episodes, and it honestly felt like the only reason it was tossed into the series to begin with was to add some tension and intrigue to the plot.Overall, The Royal Tutor is a good, fun average anime to check out. The cast is engaging and you can’t help but feel for them in certain situations. The story is very chill and simple, as is the animation and music. But if you’re in the mood for something that’s going to blow your mind, or totally make your jaw drop, then this anime is not for you.6 tortes outta 10! being surprisingly decent.When I began it I got a very strong Ouran High School Host Club aura from it.

OK...  Lets start with my review.Story - 8A Royal tutor is hired to teach four spoiled princes. Well not unique or original. We had Great Teacher Onizuka and Denpa kyoushi before this.Art -  7The art is decent. well.. Good for a comedy anime. the chibi moments were funny.Sound - 8OP-ED was okay....Voice acting is really good considering the fact that most of main characters are voiced by fairly new voice actors and those who have not voiced many roles.Music-7OST is composed by Keiji Inai. The man behind the soundtrack of ""Is it Wrong to pick girls in a Dungeon"" and ""Heavy Object"". The soundtrack is decent for a comedy anime and fits the atmosphere perfectly.Characters - 8I really like the main character. he\'s kind of overpowered. All four Princes have their own unique personalities and get good development throughout the series. which is quite surprising coming from comedy anime.Enjoyment - 9Overall I really enjoyed this series. Even though it\'s tagged as a comedy it has equal amount of good drama. This series is a mix of Barakamon, Denpa Kyoushi and G.T.O...  If you liked any of those then I recommend you watch this.

I never thought that I will like this anime this much.The main focus of this anime is definitely its characters. Each character is very relatable. Although their personalities are still pretty cliche but I still love it. I didn't find any characters in this anime to be annoying. Every character has their childish side and this anime shows how they develop to become a full noble prince.The OP and ED theme are both catchy enough. The visuals are nothing special. The dance sequence by the voice actors for the ED...theme is pretty well choreographed and fluid. For an idol fan like me, they did impress me.The art and animation done by studio Brain's Base is spectacular and detailed. They put a lot of effort into the last episode and I love it.The ending for this series is very satisfying and the developments given to the characters didn't went to waste. Although the ending is predictable, nevertheless they still did a good job at executing it,I highly recommend this anime if you like anime like Assassination Classroom or you just want a heartwarming SOL anime. theme is pretty well choreographed and fluid.

Good job on choosing this one to have available to stream, Netflix.If you're studying to become a teacher, want to find an anime with basic Japanese vocabulary, or even something that you could watch together with your family, this is a really good one. Yeah, you might be slightly offput by how they are the typical type of characters you'd normally see in animes, but yeeIt's heartwarming, really cute, and has a necessary antagonist to progress the story revolving around the four quirky princes...in line for the throne and the royal teacher Heine. I can't stress enough how cute it is. I would have loved to fangirl over them if i was watching this 10 years ago. in line for the throne and the royal teacher Heine. I can't stress enough how cute it is. I would have loved to fangirl over them if i was watching this 10 years ago."", 'Hey folks, this will be a review for Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine. It\'s not often to find a good teacher anime as of late. Many shows have tried the super teacher theme, and very few have done it right. This happens to be one that has.The story revolves around 4 princes and their royal tutor. As the royal tutor he is charged with treating the kings 4 children equally, and grooming them for the throne. The show is episodic, each episode has its own issue which generally relates to a certain princes issue. Each prince has his own personality and strength and our MC Heine reaffirms...their strength while twisting their weakness and making it work for them.Though each princes story was entertaining it was a bit bland on the world building. The fact that they are princes mattered in the most loose since. I knocked a few points off because I felt the world around the princes didn\'t matter, which clashed with the main theme a bit.The art was great. The soundtrack wasn\'t up my alley.The characters are what make this show. Heine our main character is the main source of comedy. He is a ""Full grown adult"" but has the appearance of a child. He\'s the mysterious super teacher archetype character but they don\'t go overboard making him crazy or fantastical. The princes all have their own personality, but describing them here would be a spoilers. I however really loved how they handled them.Overall I enjoyed this anime. I don\'t think Ill watch it again unless a season 2 comes out, which is possible. However I really want to hand it to the people behind the series. To write a story so its interesting, yet to not overstep you bounds and turn it into a crazy mess is rare. Each character was believable, and you get attached to them in a natural way. The side stories that crop up feel well thought out. The ending wraps everything up yet it also allows you a hope for a season 2. The comedy though thin was a well placed. The drama not overbearing, which I cant praise enough.In short I suppose the biggest strength of this anime is that it felt like it was a completed idea. You don\'t really wonder if they had different writers or a change in sensibilities along the way. If you like the first episode you\'ll like the rest of the show.TLDR: Pretty good. Enjoyable characters, good pacing, solid story with a solid ending. Give it a shot. their strength while twisting their weakness and making it work for them.Though each princes story was entertaining it was a bit bland on the world building.

Truly one of the best I've seen in my short time in watching anime; and with no boring qualities.Story: Simple concept; a tutor comes in to teach 4 young princes about what it takes to be a king but also make sure it's to their unique ways. At first, I thought it was quite simple and didn't think that it would go very far, but the more I watch, the more it just became something so invigorating and exciting to see what the princes will learn; the lessons Heine taught to the princes can even apply to how...we live our everyday lives and it shows how it just works so well. Even when delving into past events to show what happened between Heine and Viktor, everything made sense and answers all the looming questions.Art: The art is quite unique to someone who enjoys a more traditional style, but it just becomes the norm the more you watch and you just enjoy all those beautiful details; the backgrounds are spectacular, the characters look very unique yet charming, and even subtle things like the eyes can look so scary yet bring so much light to the character, which fits perfectly with this show.Sound: I never once had problems with how everything sounded. The music is calming and charming, the voices in both sub and dub are very well done, and I never once had trouble with what I listened to; this is coming from someone who is sound sensitive, so this means a lot to me.Character: I've never had a single problem with any characters in this show; even the villain characters were well done.Heine is very stern and quite childish, but he was also fair, kind, and never looked down at them like they were stupid while learning from the princes themselves.Leonhard started as cold, dumb, and very much a tsundere, but he grew to be a strong, caring, creative, and fun-loving prince who could make the town better.Bruno started as a cold-hearted genius who looked down on everyone, but the moment he worked with Heine and saw him as a master, he grew smarter but also uses said intelligence to teach others and improve the kingdom.Licht was viewed as a playboy that always loved to mess with girls and doesn't want to do his responsibilities, but later shows his serious and intellectual side that really goes out to make the townsfolk happier in their hometown.Kai was always the quietest and very scary, but as he showed himself more and shared his kindness, he easily became my favorite character and would be a perfect king.Viktor also has his own charms as a king and father, but once you see his past and meeting Heine, you really learn how much good he did to the town; he's not a perfect father, but he's the father the princes deserve.Even the minor characters, from Adele and Maria to Ludwig and Maximilian and even Rosenberg all bring something important to the story and none of them were every pushed too much into the background.Enjoyment: Once I started watching, I just couldn't stop and before I knew it, I was already at episode 7 before checking; I haven't had that occur like that since my first time watching Shimoneta or Ouran High School Host Club, so you know that's a good show. My only complaint is that this should've been a 24 episode thing cause it went by so quickly and by the time I wanted more, it was almost over; so if another season is made, I'll be on it asap.Overall: A pretty much perfect anime that I would rewatch again and would very much recommend to someone wanting a new comedy but with an old-time feel. I truly hope for another season because there's so much more that can be done with Heine and the princes. we live our everyday lives and it shows how it just works so well.

Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10469/Sayonara_Zetsubou_Sensei_Special,"[""Sherlock Holmes x Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Is simply brilliant.This whole OVA left me in despair. Why? because the animation was so good, the story was funny, and the whole cast was here again. It made me remember why I love this show. So when it ended, I was in despair, THE ANIME ENDING HAS LEFT ME IN DESPAIR!Also, it's a Sherlock Holmes type Detective theme, so that just means more brilliance. "", ""English is not my native language. Sorry for any errors, or redundancy.This is my first review on MAL.First of all, I have to say that I really like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei manga. Also, Shaft is my favorite studio. And this special episode highlights the best quality of both the manga and the excellence of Shaft's work. It is the best of two geniuses; the immense creativity of Kouji Kumeta (author of the manga) + The whimsical direction of master Akiyuki Shinbou.Unlike almost everything that concerns the franchise, this Special has an easy-to-understand comedy. The episode is split into two parts. In the first and most...brilliant of the two, we have a parody of Sherlock Holmes, but in the peculiar style of this franchise. This first part has an unbelievable amount of twists. And as a bonus, finally we can clearly hear Chiwa Saito's voice acting as Meru Meru. If you read the manga, and don't want to see the same story again, there's no need to get desperate! The first half is an original Shaft material. This crazy Sherlokian story doesn't exist in the manga.The second half gives us a grandiloquent Broadway-style musical. I just love this second part. That's because it highlights the characteristics I love most about Shaft, creativity and boldness. The animation is much more consistent than the one presented in the anime. The lyrics of the song presented in the musical are very creative. And most of all, the voice actors are excellent. I'm a big fan of japanese voice acting, and for me, there's no other studio that excels as much in that regard as Shaft. In this particular episode, it is worth highlighting the combination of Ai Nonaka's comic voice and Marina Inoue's powerful voice in a very funny musical.To me, this was easily the best of all the episodes produced by Shaft. In addition to being the episode with the best animation, it's also the episode that most shows how brilliant the franchise voice acting is. For those who watched every season of the anime but never looked for the manga, I recommend reading at least the last 25 chapters of the manga. The end of this work is something that cannot be expressed in words. It's a grand, beautiful and insane ending. If you got interested in knowing this ending, prepare for despair. brilliant of the two, we have a parody of Sherlock Holmes, but in the peculiar style of this franchise.

Senki Zesshou Symphogear G,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15793/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear_G,"['Okay, gather around and hear the song of my people. The two top reviews for this are a 5 and a 6? What in this show is a 5 or 6? Not a single damn thing.""Musical Bitches Symphogear"", as it\'s named on my PC, was one of my most complex human-anime relationships. On one hand, it was helmed by the man who brought me Wild Arms, my favorite RPG series of all time, and some of the people behind Oban Star Racers, one of my all time favorite pieces of animation. On the other hand, it was a hastily-made, awkward and janky show that had...no idea what it was doing other than attempting to ride on the Madoka hype train.When ""Symphogear G: The Musicvengeance"" was announced I remember exclaiming ""NOOOOO"" because of how dumb the first series ended. But then episode 1 aired, and I watched it. And I was deeply confused.Week after week, episode after episode, I sank deeper and deeper into confusion until I realized it was probably the most fun thing I watched in all of 2013, next to Kill la Kill.Symphogear G is pretty much a soft reboot of the series. It comes in swinging with a big, fancy animation budget that did not exist in season 1, took out all the bullshit whiney drama and school stuff, and really came into itself as a fast-paced action series about J-pop singers with super robot powers. It introduces an actual villain, a rival set of characters, has an awesome new OP, and a plot twist at the end of every single episode. It\'s a fun, rollercoaster ride of a show that knew exactly what it was doing.It not only surpasses the original, but it simultaneously redeems it.THE STORY picks up from where season 1 left off, I guess. Our yellow girl, blue girl and red girl are going around doing rocket punches and super missile attacks against swarms of fodder enemies while staging extremely elaborate J-Pop concerts. All is normal.And then there\'s a new team of evil, rival Symphogears! Holy shit! It\'s like Sonic Heroes, but AWESOME. And then there\'s a mad scientist who wants to do evil shit in between the scenes where he\'s ham acting and making hilarious faces! INTRIGUE!The original story was all about the Symphogear girls being these bleak final guardians of humanity against goofy-looking fodder ""Noise"" creatures, and if they sang too hard, they died. But it was also about them being pop stars and with super powers activated by singing J-pop. This new story pretty much ditches all of the former and just makes the show fun by playing up the latter. It focuses all of the drama on the characters facing off against each other and fighting evil and stuff, like it really should have been in the first place.Not to say that much is retconned; the plot is also laced with tons references to the original series. There\'s a kung fu training montage and everything!THE CHARACTERS are very enjoyable.Hibiki, who was once a whiny pacifist dealt a cruel fate, is now a hotblooded hero who knows kung-fu, uses it, and also does super rocket punch attacks. She\'s always positive and kind of badass. Real classic shounen hero here.Tsubasa is still ""the Mizuki Nana character"", but is no longer an emo swordsmistress in mourning who hates her status as a human weapon. Now she\'s just the older sister/straight man of the trio and acts all cool. She also has a motorcycle.Chris is no longer an emotionally abused rival girl looking to repent. Instead, she\'s a super moe, food-loving, out-of-shape, hot-blooded, missile launching, gatling gun-shooting, huge-breasted waifu. She is the best girl.AND THEN THERE\'S CHIEF GENJURO, who still has LION HAIR, still goes ""GUNGNIR-DATO?!"" and still TUCKS HIS TIE INTO HIS FRONT POCKET. But this season, HE SINGS TOOIN CHINESEAnd then there\'s the Chief\'s assistant, and Tsubasa\'s manager. I don\'t know his name, as he is a minor character, but he\'s important to mention here because he embodies everything this series does right. In the first season, he\'s Tsubasa\'s manager and Genjuro\'s assistant guy. In this season, he\'s a fucking /ninja/. Who can walk on water and solo a room of mobsters.  Why? Because it\'s /awesome/.But WAIT! There are new characters too!Maria Cadenzavna Eve: The Shadow the Hedgehog of the series. The rival. She sings like Tsubasa, has the same powers as Hibiki, and has the same breasts as Chris. And has the spear from the dead girl in the first season!Kirika-DESS: Maria\'s #1 sidekick-DESS. She ends all of her sentences with DESS. She has a giganto scythe, penchant for violence and is awesome.Shirabe: The foil to Kirika, she\'s a calm, quiet loli for the people who thought the show needed at least one flat-chest girl, I guess. However, she makes buzz saws and giant robots, so she\'s pretty darn cool too.DOCTOR VER: Doctor Ver is my favorite character behind Chris. Every scene he\'s in, he\'s making some sort of stupid face, laughing maniacally or doing some comic book villain shit like summoning a giant fortress or mind controlling the innocent. This guy is classic, endlessly entertaining and everything a villain should be.Next, let\'s talk about THAT ANIMATIONSeason 1 looked bad. This one looks great. The art is crisp and smooth, background graphics are nice, the CGI is much improved, and several really dumb looking things from season 1, like Hibiki\'s berserker mode, actually look cool now. The fights are fast-paced, well-choreographed and full of visual flare. And explosions. They\'re probably the best fight sequences I\'ve seen in a series in a long time, actually.Better yet, each and every girl now has a redone transformation sequence that you can find a lot of gifs of. Important, high-level stuff for this kind of show.Oh and the MUSICEvery girl has a set of songs, all six of them (and more!?). The soundtrack is double or triple the size of the original series\', and it\'s overall better. Songs are varied and well composed. There are even combat duets! And since the OSTs sold a billion copies, we\'re confirmed for season 3!!IN CONCLUSIONThis series is honestly a better magic fighting girl show than Kill la Kill, with a cast that\'s almost as strong, dynamite production values, and a blazing fast pace to carry it all forward. I don\'t think there\'s a single aspect of this series that\'s worthy of a 5 or a 6, let alone the whole thing.The plot is no more stupid than Code Geass R2.The presentation is on par with the highest budget action series of the last few years.The characters are more waifu-worthy than your average moeblob infested ecchi shows.The soundtrack is better than Love Live.So what is wrong with Symphogear G, when it has all of the ingredients to make a mainstream weaboo success?

Who knows? Anime fans are stupid, I guess.', ""If you've watched the first season of Symphogear then you have a good idea of what to expect from this series; poorly developed characters, a completely bonkers plot, bad drama, bizarre plot twists and general all round silliness. However whilst that may be the case, this series is superior to its predecessor in several key areas, making it a significantly more enjoyable watch. In fact, whilst this series still suffers from the multitude of flaws and failures of the first season, there is the possibility that you may even enjoy it.The visuals are far more consistent than they were before, there will be no scenes...with absolutely atrocious animation or badly drawn faces, and all the fights are competently done, although the budget is still noticeable limited. This is very noticeable with the art, the backgrounds lack detail, are usually completely bare and are nothing in the way of eye candy. The character designs for the girls are diverse and have a lot of charm, whereas those for everyone else have much less thought put into them. If they had more money to pump into the show all of them would have looked much better. At least they have their priorities right with focusing on the female characters.The soundtrack also is an improvement upon the last season, there were a couple of insert songs that may catch your liking, both of which were sung by Takagaki Ayahi, the seiyuu for Chris, who is by far the best singer in the cast. The lyrics for the songs (if you your subs provide them) are incredibly cheesy and are often funny because of that, they rather fit into the spirit of the show. The other seiyuu aren't bad singers, and some of their songs are also pretty nice, however it is Chris that runs away with it.The characters are much more likable this season, and the developments of the characters (notably the three new ones introduced), whilst clumsy and lacking subtlety are markedly better than the random character developments of the last season. The characters are really weak, however despite this they are still quite endearing, to the extent where some of their annoying habits become lovable quirks. In all they are much like the show, really poorly written and lacking any depth, but that's just a strange part of their appeal. Sadly, for all my back-handed praise, they are not characters that you will forever remember, if not for the character designs they are entirely forgettable. They lack the depth to leave a lasting impression. Additionally some of the characters still manage to be annoying on occasion, however those events are few and far between.The plot is disappointing the sense that it does not reach the ludicrous moon-shattering events of the first season, it does somewhat make up for it by being much more cheesy. In any case, whilst slightly more grounded, the writing is still horrendous. For one it managed to make the fairly simple plot convoluted to the point where it was unclear what exactly was going on. Additionally serious plot twists which are sporadically introduced get either dismissed or resolved easily and are instantly forgotten about despite the fact they should be major events, and even some major points which build up throughout the series are effortlessly resolved out of nowhere. The antagonist is also an atrociously written character, his motives are beyond cliché, his actions are inane, and his personality is one dimensional and he has only two emotions, hysterical or cocky. Despite his amazing seiyuu he is an incredibly irritating character towards the end, he was far inferior even to Fine in the first season.So whilst Symphogear has improved in most areas, it is still a very poor show on paper, and indeed if you cannot ignore bad writing, and cannot let go stupid things, then I do not recommend this show, because you will be in for the same experience as you had watching the first season. However if you can embrace Symphogear for the incredibly earnest and cheesy show it is then you may have an enjoyable experience watching it. You will find that there are plenty of things to laugh and smile about; one scene in the latter half had me in fits of laughter, and another near the begging had me smiling at how lovable Chris was despite everything. Having watched the first season you should know well by now whether you will be able to enjoy the show or not even if this season is considerably more enjoyable.Overall, I will say pretty much the same of this season as I did the last; if you can embrace this for the earnestly silly show that it is then you should be able to have some good fun watching it with its somewhat unique appeal. However if you cannot abide watching an anime that does almost every single technical and literacy aspect wrong, then I simply cannot recommend it, because you're going to have a rough time. with absolutely atrocious animation or badly drawn faces, and all the fights are competently done, although the budget is still noticeable limited. This is very noticeable with the art, the backgrounds lack detail, are usually completely bare and are nothing in the way of eye candy. The character designs for the girls are diverse and have a lot of charm, whereas those for everyone else have much less thought put into them. If they had more money to pump into the show all of them would have looked much better. At least they have their priorities right with focusing on the female characters.The soundtrack also is an improvement upon the last season, there were a couple of insert songs that may catch your liking, both of which were sung by Takagaki Ayahi, the seiyuu for Chris, who is by far the best singer in the cast. The lyrics for the songs (if you your subs provide them) are incredibly cheesy and are often funny because of that, they rather fit into the spirit of the show. The other seiyuu aren't bad singers, and some of their songs are also pretty nice, however it is Chris that runs away with it.The characters are much more likable this season, and the developments of the characters (notably the three new ones introduced), whilst clumsy and lacking subtlety are markedly better than the random character developments of the last season. The characters are really weak, however despite this they are still quite endearing, to the extent where some of their annoying habits become lovable quirks. In all they are much like the show, really poorly written and lacking any depth, but that's just a strange part of their appeal. Sadly, for all my back-handed praise, they are not characters that you will forever remember, if not for the character designs they are entirely forgettable. They lack the depth to leave a lasting impression.

Well, this usually applies to superstars in the music industry. In fact, people who become famous in the real world are often idols that others worship and follow as a legion. However, the concept doesn’t just stop there, not in Symphogear G at least. The superstars in Symphogear G aren’t just armed with talent but also with super powers as they take the fight against a mysterious force that threatens to wipe out their existence.The journey...continues with Hibiki Tachibana and her friends in this sequel known as Symphogear G. Taking place approximately two months after the first season, she is joined by new characters along with her partner and friend Tsubasa Kazanari. As the second season blasts off, we get to see more of that explosive atmosphere in the world of Symphogear that shines brightly. Or does it...By this point now, it’s clear that Hibiki and Tsubasa have become great friends and comrades. But we also can’t forget about Chris Yukine, a mysterious girl with an even more mysterious ability. The trio stands as a hope against the alien force known as the ‘Noise’. Similarly to season one, they try to save people and fight off the Noise in order to protect their home. However, there’s a problem: the ‘Fine’.Unlike the previous antagonists from the previous series, ‘Fine’ stands as a primary terrorist group with unknown motives. What we do know is that they have the weapons. They have the intelligence. But most importantly, they have the ambition to carry out their twisted goals. While mostly remaining in the shadows with little background, we get to witness how far they go to follow their ambitions in this season. As far as weapons go, Symphogear takes on a more magical girl battle theme with duels between magical girls. This is because Fine not only possesses Noises but also Symphogear users of their own. It puts Hibiki’s team at an unusual rivalry as they are forced to battle skilled users with abilities that matches against their own, if not greater.As far as character goes, they largely remain the same with little change. It isn’t very refreshing to witness their relationship either as the trio contrasts greatly with their personalities. In essence, they are a team but their character dynamics aren’t very compatible. It also stretches towards Fine as well with our new characters such as Maria, Shirabe, and Kirika. This trio poses as a serious threat in this season but often times gets irritating to watch. Why? Well, that’s because it seems like these girls are in this organization to carry out their tasks but often seems regrettably doing so. At the same time, these girls may look normal but are treated abnormally as in the state of test subjects. It’s difficult to be sympathetic with them either because the deeds to carry out with the actions as their proof. Oh, and the trio’s relationship isn’t very heartwarming either.Season 2 does start out with an explosive atmosphere though. It doesn’t drag out in the beginning and gets straight to the point. Their powers also offers an intense challenge for our main protagonists. From there and out, the series bounces between an endless struggle as we also get to witness a mastermind behind the scenes manipulating various events to get what he wants. It’s about as cliched as it comes with the mastermind giving off its mad scientist outlook, ambitions, and his psychopath-like laughter. What doesn’t create much delight though is why Maria, Shirabe, and Kirika continues to follow their orders. They are test subjects so essentially, they are living weapons of war. However, they are also girls with a future especially with Maria and her idol status. At any rate, the frustration of putting up with these girls’ absentminded actions is quite a turnoff.If you want action though, there is action and plenty of that. It wastes no time with it as the majority of the main cast displays their variety of abilities from the get go. And just like the previous season, the girls all go through their transformation scene presented with doses of fan service. For whatever reason, the character also yell out their attacks for some aesthetic purposes. I guess in a way, it shows off their flashy tactics but at the same time becomes bothersome to witness after having to do so on a basis.Perhaps what’s most awkward and twisted is the number of plot twists going on in the series with seemingly no concrete purpose. Well, the purpose is there but hard to justify in a rightful manner. This can apply to several of the characters and even the antagonists themselves. The plot twists doesn’t stop there though as we also learn about Fine’s master plan and what they have in stored for the world. But the catch later comes with the organization’s core members. In many ways, I find it nonsense and revelations spawning out of nowhere. Additionally, it’s hard to sympathize with the antagonists after everything they’ve done.The artwork fits within the science fiction them at least. The girls are designed with battle gear with their armor giving off a dangerous vibe. Unfortunately, most of the characters are designed to look generic and just the way you might expect them to be. It doesn’t stop there with the transformation scenes plastered with fan service. There’s even a case where our mastermind uses fan service itself as a weapon that’s laughable. The Noise themselves also doesn’t look very appealing but does give off that otherworldly look.Soundtrack wise, Symophogear easily demonstrates the strength of this show as one of its more defining features. After all, the girls infuses their battle skills with their voice. The main opening song Vitalization"" by Nana Mizukiin has that feeling of intensity as well as some foreshadowing of the events. Throughout the series though, there’s many other songs played during the action scenes reflecting a core theme of this show. In terms of voice acting choices, I would give Ayahi Takagai with her role as Chris Yukine. She demonstrates that feeling of both hope and despair throughout the series that balances her role well. On the other hand, I find Hibiki’s voice to be irritating with her overzealous cheerfulness.Overall, this series is far from great but at the same time not a total disaster. The planet the characters inhibits though are in a disaster so be prepared for some battle tendency. However, with the plot being all over the place, the word ‘disaster’ could also be factored in with that as well. Symphogear G is just another sequel of connecting series together to conclude a brand new story.

As far as sometimes sequels go, not everything always works out.', ""lol, I could care less for the dogpile of deus ex machina that comprises the story itself but damn this show is sexy! buy the blu-rays they come with awesome extras lol!Story 7/10Well, maybe the most entertaining part about watching the show is to come up with some sharp comeback for every shit that happens *cough*hibiki's past why did you just make it up!*cough* but that's what makes it so great anyway. The story flow seems to be much smoother compared to the 1st season. Every episode leaves you with a cliffhanger so you'll want to know what happens next. Also, a lot of the...story is based right off of the 1st season so you'll probably love the creators if you watched the 1st season. I cried to that episode where Chris-chan gave a performace ;_;Art 8/10Better than 1st seasonSound 9/10FUH-FUH-FUH-F-ROLICKING Elements Gardeni mean, you probably can't be a symphogear lover unless you were also a music lover xDCharacter 10/10Hot! I mean, Chris-chan was really orgasmic material. even more so than in 1st season o_OEnjoyment 10/10I just want to cry to every loli in the show lol. I love them I could care less for how the show ends but I hope they're all safe in the end ;~; cause that's really what matters anyway lol.Overall 10/10It's actually kind of amazing how well thought out the series is even though it's mostly planned out by one guy lol. I mean, you probably shouldn't have too much expectation for the story since it's mostly being planned out by a musician anyway but then at the same time you can really notice sometimes that hes a real story writer lol. I mean the amount of emotion the story conveys is just phenomenal. Its way too hot to watch without switching on the air conditioner on top of having a fan spinning in max speed in front of you.. story is based right off of the 1st season so you'll probably love the creators if you watched the 1st season.

While it had great music and moments of heart pounding action, it also had some quality issues from a low budget, a string of horrendous writing, and poor character development, all coined together in what looked like haphazard direction.Fortunately, Symphogear G fixes these problems while maintaining the original feeling of bravado from the first season, and it can even be considered, dare say, a great show.The increase in production and quality can be seen from the very first...episode of Symphogear G. It opens with a fluid battle scene, then as reminiscent of the first season, throws one of the most explosive and amazing looking concerts akin to the ones you can see in AKB0048. Unlike the first season that seemed to have blown all their budget in the first episode then used chump change to gear the rest of the show, the animation for Symhpogear G does not take a sudden drop in quality and stays consistent for the most part, save for moments here and there.In addition, Yoko Hikasa, Ai Kayano, and Tomokazu Sugita, all talented and well-known voice actors come to play an additional role in the show. Especially with the addition of Hikasa and Kayano who contribute songs to Symphogear G along with the previous returning main cast (Aoi Yuuki, Nana Mizuki, Ayahi Takagaki), the show presents a powerful amount of song pieced together with well-orchestrated music. Fans should be returning to this season for some wonderful music; and Symphogear G very much over over leaps expectations. The only unfortunate part is that while there are great pieces of music in the show, there is only really one concert scene in the entire show. Though visually and audibly orgasmic it may have been, there's a feeling of disappointment that other songs did not receive the same treatment.The writing and characters becomes the biggest improvement in Symphogear G. This season takes three months after the first one, where the main cast learns not every problem has been solved from their previous encounters and now face a new terrorist organization that can also use Symphogears. The plot is actually built from the very ground up and manages to reveal the story along the way for viewers to speculate on how events unfold, unlike the first season that seemed to make plot devices up as the show went up and felt like nonsense at the very end.  Symphogear G seems to have learned that plot twists are endearing devices to hook viewers up to the show, and it does quite a lot of it this time around that will want viewers to move on to the next episode as quickly as possible. Some of the twists are somewhat obvious and easy to figure out, but nevertheless they succeed in giving the proper emotional impact needed to move on with the show.What really shines are the characters in this season. With the melodramatic infighting between the main characters of the first season out of the way, Hibiki, Tsubasa, and Chris finally form what looks like a real team. Their interactions and relationship development are vastly improved, and the first few slice-of-life aspects at the start give a real endearing feeling. The new antagonists of the show; a crazed madman voiced by Sugita and can control the Noise, an elderly commanding woman, and three Symphogear users, are also given much screen time during the show. During their time, much of their character and motivations begin to change and develop as they attempt to fulfill their plans which have questionable morals. Strangely, they are actually given so much focus that the antagonists themselves begin to feel like the heroes. Apart from the crazy madman voiced by Sugita, whose main appeals seems to being insane and making over-dramatic expressions (Which Sugita really does well actually) to entertain the views, the other members of the terrorist organization have so much of their own internal struggles that the viewer may end up wanting to support them in the end. Coupled with their own character songs which are equally enjoyable to listen to as the songs of the main cast, it becomes very difficult to not like the antagonists. Not many shows can achieve well-written villains that manage to gain the sympathy of the audience, but Symphogear G manages to just this. The obvious problem with this however is that fans coming from the original show may feel like the main cast do not get enough attention. Strictly speaking, this is not true as the main heroes, especially Hibiki, are given their proper development and own internal struggles. However, there may be some fans who feel the main focus should be on the protagonists rather than a shared one with the antagonists, and miss the slice-of-life aspects of the show that are gone after the first few episodes at the start.In conclusion; Symphogear G fixes many problems from the original show while maintaining the silly quirks from the first season (Such as Hibiki punching a train in to a group of enemy Noise) that fans enjoyed. It comes with a bigger budget and actually presents its own original story that will keep the viewer going. Certain fans may feel it loses appeal because the slice-of-life aspect is toned down, but Symphogear G definitely will find a warmer reception with the overall audience.Sadly, the original show may have already lost a chunk of the audience that was interested in it. Those who finished the first season, were disappointed by it, and are wondering whether to watch G or not should definitely give it a shot. episode of Symphogear G.

It has: emotionally riveting character moments (especially, between Hibiki and Miku... the ""Tokyo Tower scene"" and after ""Miku\'s transformation"" are specifically powerful in their execution—); imaginative/off-the-wall/mind-blowing action sequences, a compelling cast of villains, and a stunning finale, that had my jaw on the floor! Symphogear G is what happens when the protective muzzle is placed to the side, and all of Satelight\'s magnificent, craziness is able to run amuck!⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis season immediately hooks you in with the enigmatic trio of adversaries:...Maria Cadenzavna Eve, Shirabe Tsukuyomi, and Kirika Akatsuki! All the while, Hibiki is struggling from an incurable sickness, the shard of ""Gungnir"" buried in her chest causing intense health complications. To thicken the plot even further, Miku is manipulated by the evil Dr. Ver, becoming the user of the relic, Shénshòujìng, the ""God Beast Mirror""! This season climbs into the depths of a Bermuda Triangle-like, alternate dimension... summoned from relics of Atlantis! In other words, the type of daydreams you have as a kid, while bashing your action figures together!One aspect that made this series more fantastic than the first is that there were really high stakes: Hibiki\'s health, Miku\'s life, Chris\' struggle to properly integrate into their group, and Maria\'s obligation to her younger siblings and handlers! This season also begins to dive into Hibiki\'s unfortunate home situation and survivor\'s guilt. The more the season goes on, the more it is revealed that Maria and younger, adopted sisters are in an exploitative, abusive situation. Dr. Ver even beats Maria, when she tries to stop him from potentially killing millions of people!I thought that it was really satisfying that Miku\'s laser cannon was actually able to have the ability to detoxify Hibiki\'s ""Gungnir"" and thus, prevent her from dying! What a sweet couple! I also thought that Kirika and Shirabe\'s ""infiltration"" into their school was really funny and cute, as well as Chris being asked to sing on stage, showing Chris\' growth and her fight against her aversion towards music! Really great season, words alone do not do it justice!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Katsumi Ono (director), notable works:* Beast Saga* Girly Air Force ✅* Hataraki Man* Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle — Rhyme Anima* Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu* Master Mosquiton \'99* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! 5D\'s* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! Arc-VCommentary: Haven\'t watched many of Mr. Ono\'s discography, but his choreography in the Symphogear series is awe-inspiring! After the first season, I was unsure of whether I could get attached to any of the characters, but the later seasons are a Herculean fusion of some of the coolest action scenes in ""Dragon Ball Z"" with a slice of sweet, saccharine shōjo-ai! I play the mobile game for ""Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle,"" so now, I\'m super stoked to try out the anime adaptation!

I think that Ms. Yūki strong personality translates well in the case of Hibiki Tachibana, a cute girl that is strong-spirited and has a cosmic punch, that is practically unrivaled! Hibiki reminded me of my best girl in Girls und Panzer (""Miho Nishizumi"") and for the most part, tries to her best to keep the peace. Aoi Yūki did a wonderful job at making her cute, charming, relatable, and a fighter!

PreCure (""Tsubomi Hanasaki"")! Ms. Mizuki conveys the anguished, yet distinguished nature of Tsubasa\'s character in a very charming and likable way! Over the span of the series, we deeply sympathize with her feelings of grief over her dead girlfriend, Kanade; as well as the struggle that she has, when pitted against the corrupt system that her wealthy family has implemented. Great character, great seiyū!Ayahi Takagaki as Chris Yukine, notable roles:* Kuro, Ao no Exorcist* Kotoha, Arata: The Legend* Suiren, Battle Spirits: Shōnen Toppa Bashin* Daina Kurogami, Beyblade Burst* Roana Dan, Blade & Soul* Nene, Canaan ✅* Takuto Tatsunagi, Cardfight!!

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!Yuka Iguchi as Miku Kohinata, notable roles:* Arisa Hoshigaoka, Arata naru Sekai: World\'s/Start/Load/End (""World\'s End"")* Maria Takayama, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (""Haganai: I don\'t have many friends"")* Mako Nakarai, Bokura no ✅* Honoka Sawada, Chibi☆Devi!* Yashiro Hoshimiya, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (""Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl"") ✅* Shima, Devidol!* Sherry and Chelia Blendy, Fairy Tail* Tamaki Irie, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Mako Reizei, Girls und Panzer ✅* Suwako Moriya, Hifū Katsudō Kiroku: The Sealed Esoteric History ✅* Myne, Honzuki no Gekokujō: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen (""Ascendance of a Bookworm"")* Naeka Fujiwara, Kamen no Maid Guy* Kaga, Tenryū, Tatsuta, Tone, and Chikuma — Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅* Shizume Seo, Kara no Kyōkai ✅* Natsuko Ishikura, Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Luea, Lady Jewelpet* Chinatsu Morikawa, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS* Rinna Fuwa, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation* Subaru Konoe, Mayo Chiki!* Tsukihi Araragi, Monogatari (series) ✅* Kaede Mizumo, Nyan Koi!* Mitsuba Sangū, Owari no Seraph* Crusch Karsten, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ✅* Maho Misawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Yū Sonda, Sakura Trick* Hibari, Senran Kagura ✅* Astarte, Strike the Blood* Norie Okazaki, Tamayura* Yuzuha Aigae, Tenshi no 3P! ✅* Mea Kurosaki, To LOVEる ✅* Librorum Prohibitorum Index, Toaru Majutsu no Index (""A Certain Magical Index"") ✅* Aiko Andō, True Tears* Mirei Shikishima, Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid* Aoi Yukimura, Yama no Susume ✅Commentary: Despite everyone\'s dislike for Index\'s voice in ""Toaru Majutsu no Index,"" I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi\'s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character! Superb seiyū!Yoko Hikasa as Maria Cadenzavna Eve, notable roles:* Hana Suguruno, 7 Seeds* Hibiki Tenshō, Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel* Nanako Saeki, Aku no Hana ✅* Tio Clarce, Arifureta Shokugyō de Sekai Saikyō (""Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\'s Strongest"")* Tomoe Udagawa, BanG Dream ✅* Farnese de Vandimion, Berserk ✅* Fighter, Bikini Warriors* Erica Blandelli, Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō ✅* Kiyono Amahara, Chu-Bra!!* Ayano Kōsaka, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Sakura Sakurakōji, Code:Breaker* Kyōko Kirigiri, Danganronpa ✅* Sakie Satō, Demi-chan wa Kataritai (""Interviews With Monster Girls"") ✅* Brioche d\'Arquien, Dog Days* Hina Tachibana, Domestic no Kanojo* Freya, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅* Ao Gennai, Frame Arms Girl* Kei Kugimiya, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Aya Akabane, Gokujo* Miu Osawa, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Kurumi, Hal* Emi Yusa, Hataraku Maō-sama!

In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in ""Rokka no Yūsha"" and Nanako Saeki in ""Aku no Hana"" are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria\'s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!Ai Kayano as Kirika Akatsuki, notable roles:* Akari Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Futaba Ōki, Amanchu! ✅* Mikono Suzushiro, Aquarion Evol* Anya Dostoyevskaya, Aria the Avvenire* Kaga and Atago, Azur Lane* Hana Mutō, Captain Earth* Kanade Ōe, Chihayafuru ✅* Ponoka, Choboraunyopomi Gekijō Ai Mai Mii ✅* Anna Clément, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Mikan Tsumiki, Danganronpa 3* Maihime Shirayuki, Dokyū Hentai HxEros* Mimi, Flip Flappers ✅* Megumi Sakura, Gakkōgurashi!

She\'s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She\'s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!Toshino Nanjō as Shirabe Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Sonia, Berserk ✅* Naoto Miura, Clockwork Planet* Koko Tsukishima, Da Capo* Gankyō Kūrubiyūtei, Joshiraku* Eri Ayase, Love Live! ✅* Matsuri Sengen, Mahō Shōjo Taisen* Robu, Neko no Robu* Panpaka, Panpaka Pants Movie: Bananan Ōkoku no Hihō* Nene Kurio, Penguin Musume♥Heart* Akiho Senomiya, Robotics;Notes* Lise Hohenstein, Schwarzesmarken ✅Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she\'s sweet, smart, and insightful!

Often, he would have such overwrought moments of maniacal insanity, that it would be as entertaining as a Takehito Koyasu performance! Despite John Wayne being an awful human being, his reoccurrence in the later seasons were always vivid and adroit at entertaining the audience.

Reminiscent to Grace from ""Macross Frontier"" — with such a powerful propensity for villain roles, it\'s difficult to believe that Ms. Inōe once played Belldandy (""Aa! Magami-sama!""), the paragon of virtue! Great seiyū!Conclusively, Senki Zesshō Symphogear G is the first time that the series ventures into skull-exploding levels of grandiosity! The conclusion of this season ends so strongly, it makes the viewer believe that these girls can take on any obstacle that comes their way! Through this world-bending voyage, we are able to reach a tenable catharsis and realize that the girls are larger-than-life, cosmic heroes that love each other very deeply! Wonderful season, I give Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) a solid 7/10!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆ Maria Cadenzavna Eve, Shirabe Tsukuyomi, and Kirika Akatsuki! All the while, Hibiki is struggling from an incurable sickness, the shard of ""Gungnir"" buried in her chest causing intense health complications. To thicken the plot even further, Miku is manipulated by the evil Dr. Ver, becoming the user of the relic, Shénshòujìng, the ""God Beast Mirror""! This season climbs into the depths of a Bermuda Triangle-like, alternate dimension... summoned from relics of Atlantis! In other words, the type of daydreams you have as a kid, while bashing your action figures together!One aspect that made this series more fantastic than the first is that there were really high stakes: Hibiki\'s health, Miku\'s life, Chris\' struggle to properly integrate into their group, and Maria\'s obligation to her younger siblings and handlers! This season also begins to dive into Hibiki\'s unfortunate home situation and survivor\'s guilt. The more the season goes on, the more it is revealed that Maria and younger, adopted sisters are in an exploitative, abusive situation. Dr. Ver even beats Maria, when she tries to stop him from potentially killing millions of people!I thought that it was really satisfying that Miku\'s laser cannon was actually able to have the ability to detoxify Hibiki\'s ""Gungnir"" and thus, prevent her from dying! What a sweet couple! I also thought that Kirika and Shirabe\'s ""infiltration"" into their school was really funny and cute, as well as Chris being asked to sing on stage, showing Chris\' growth and her fight against her aversion towards music! Really great season, words alone do not do it justice!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Katsumi Ono (director), notable works:* Beast Saga* Girly Air Force ✅* Hataraki Man* Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle — Rhyme Anima* Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu* Master Mosquiton \'99* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! 5D\'s* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! Arc-VCommentary: Haven\'t watched many of Mr. Ono\'s discography, but his choreography in the Symphogear series is awe-inspiring! After the first season, I was unsure of whether I could get attached to any of the characters, but the later seasons are a Herculean fusion of some of the coolest action scenes in ""Dragon Ball Z"" with a slice of sweet, saccharine shōjo-ai!

I think that Ms. Yūki strong personality translates well in the case of Hibiki Tachibana, a cute girl that is strong-spirited and has a cosmic punch, that is practically unrivaled! Hibiki reminded me of my best girl in Girls und Panzer (""Miho Nishizumi"") and for the most part, tries to her best to keep the peace. Aoi Yūki did a wonderful job at making her cute, charming, relatable, and a fighter!

PreCure (""Tsubomi Hanasaki"")! Ms. Mizuki conveys the anguished, yet distinguished nature of Tsubasa\'s character in a very charming and likable way! Over the span of the series, we deeply sympathize with her feelings of grief over her dead girlfriend, Kanade; as well as the struggle that she has, when pitted against the corrupt system that her wealthy family has implemented. Great character, great seiyū!Ayahi Takagaki as Chris Yukine, notable roles:* Kuro, Ao no Exorcist* Kotoha, Arata: The Legend* Suiren, Battle Spirits: Shōnen Toppa Bashin* Daina Kurogami, Beyblade Burst* Roana Dan, Blade & Soul* Nene, Canaan ✅* Takuto Tatsunagi, Cardfight!!

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!Yuka Iguchi as Miku Kohinata, notable roles:* Arisa Hoshigaoka, Arata naru Sekai: World\'s/Start/Load/End (""World\'s End"")* Maria Takayama, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (""Haganai: I don\'t have many friends"")* Mako Nakarai, Bokura no ✅* Honoka Sawada, Chibi☆Devi!* Yashiro Hoshimiya, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (""Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl"") ✅* Shima, Devidol!* Sherry and Chelia Blendy, Fairy Tail* Tamaki Irie, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Mako Reizei, Girls und Panzer ✅* Suwako Moriya, Hifū Katsudō Kiroku: The Sealed Esoteric History ✅* Myne, Honzuki no Gekokujō: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen (""Ascendance of a Bookworm"")* Naeka Fujiwara, Kamen no Maid Guy* Kaga, Tenryū, Tatsuta, Tone, and Chikuma — Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅* Shizume Seo, Kara no Kyōkai ✅* Natsuko Ishikura, Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Luea, Lady Jewelpet* Chinatsu Morikawa, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS* Rinna Fuwa, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation* Subaru Konoe, Mayo Chiki!* Tsukihi Araragi, Monogatari (series) ✅* Kaede Mizumo, Nyan Koi!* Mitsuba Sangū, Owari no Seraph* Crusch Karsten, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ✅* Maho Misawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Yū Sonda, Sakura Trick* Hibari, Senran Kagura ✅* Astarte, Strike the Blood* Norie Okazaki, Tamayura* Yuzuha Aigae, Tenshi no 3P! ✅* Mea Kurosaki, To LOVEる ✅* Librorum Prohibitorum Index, Toaru Majutsu no Index (""A Certain Magical Index"") ✅* Aiko Andō, True Tears* Mirei Shikishima, Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid* Aoi Yukimura, Yama no Susume ✅Commentary: Despite everyone\'s dislike for Index\'s voice in ""Toaru Majutsu no Index,"" I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi\'s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character! Superb seiyū!Yoko Hikasa as Maria Cadenzavna Eve, notable roles:* Hana Suguruno, 7 Seeds* Hibiki Tenshō, Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel* Nanako Saeki, Aku no Hana ✅* Tio Clarce, Arifureta Shokugyō de Sekai Saikyō (""Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\'s Strongest"")* Tomoe Udagawa, BanG Dream ✅* Farnese de Vandimion, Berserk ✅* Fighter, Bikini Warriors* Erica Blandelli, Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō ✅* Kiyono Amahara, Chu-Bra!!* Ayano Kōsaka, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Sakura Sakurakōji, Code:Breaker* Kyōko Kirigiri, Danganronpa ✅* Sakie Satō, Demi-chan wa Kataritai (""Interviews With Monster Girls"") ✅* Brioche d\'Arquien, Dog Days* Hina Tachibana, Domestic no Kanojo* Freya, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅* Ao Gennai, Frame Arms Girl* Kei Kugimiya, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Aya Akabane, Gokujo* Miu Osawa, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Kurumi, Hal* Emi Yusa, Hataraku Maō-sama!

In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in ""Rokka no Yūsha"" and Nanako Saeki in ""Aku no Hana"" are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria\'s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!Ai Kayano as Kirika Akatsuki, notable roles:* Akari Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Futaba Ōki, Amanchu! ✅* Mikono Suzushiro, Aquarion Evol* Anya Dostoyevskaya, Aria the Avvenire* Kaga and Atago, Azur Lane* Hana Mutō, Captain Earth* Kanade Ōe, Chihayafuru ✅* Ponoka, Choboraunyopomi Gekijō Ai Mai Mii ✅* Anna Clément, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Mikan Tsumiki, Danganronpa 3* Maihime Shirayuki, Dokyū Hentai HxEros* Mimi, Flip Flappers ✅* Megumi Sakura, Gakkōgurashi!

She\'s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She\'s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!Toshino Nanjō as Shirabe Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Sonia, Berserk ✅* Naoto Miura, Clockwork Planet* Koko Tsukishima, Da Capo* Gankyō Kūrubiyūtei, Joshiraku* Eri Ayase, Love Live! ✅* Matsuri Sengen, Mahō Shōjo Taisen* Robu, Neko no Robu* Panpaka, Panpaka Pants Movie: Bananan Ōkoku no Hihō* Nene Kurio, Penguin Musume♥Heart* Akiho Senomiya, Robotics;Notes* Lise Hohenstein, Schwarzesmarken ✅Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she\'s sweet, smart, and insightful!

Often, he would have such overwrought moments of maniacal insanity, that it would be as entertaining as a Takehito Koyasu performance! Despite John Wayne being an awful human being, his reoccurrence in the later seasons were always vivid and adroit at entertaining the audience.

Reminiscent to Grace from ""Macross Frontier"" — with such a powerful propensity for villain roles, it\'s difficult to believe that Ms. Inōe once played Belldandy (""Aa! Magami-sama!""), the paragon of virtue! Great seiyū!Conclusively, Senki Zesshō Symphogear G is the first time that the series ventures into skull-exploding levels of grandiosity! The conclusion of this season ends so strongly, it makes the viewer believe that these girls can take on any obstacle that comes their way! Through this world-bending voyage, we are able to reach a tenable catharsis and realize that the girls are larger-than-life, cosmic heroes that love each other very deeply! Wonderful season, I give Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) a solid 7/10!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆', ""After a heavily criticized first season, the second season seems like giving a new life for Symphogear treeline.Story got B+ for improvements over first season's fatal failure and new villain as well as brand new storyline (tactical betrayal which is quite uncommon for the magical-girl themed).Art also got B+ also for its improvement. Most of the scene are quite well-drawn and the settings are changed dramatically by incorporating first season's place into forbidden area. Probably done to increase thrill halfway through the seriesSound got A. All songs are perfectly set for each seiyuu's voice capability. No more rubbish songs and no more imbalance quality. Ayahime's...voice is the most notable here, her songs are the most varied in the series: from heavy-metal class in Bye Bye Lullaby to ballad(?) in Classroom MonochromeCharacter got A for brand new design and new characters. Its development also solid and full of twists done in rapid succession for one cours anime.Enjoyment got A- for its near-yuri relationship and lack of major fanservice slightly reduced the mark for the enjoyment.Grand score: A. In my scheme: 80 credit points (perfect score) and 968/1000 points voice is the most notable here, her songs are the most varied in the series: from heavy-metal class in Bye Bye Lullaby to ballad(?) in Classroom MonochromeCharacter got A for brand new design and new characters.

In my scheme: 80 credit points (perfect score) and 968/1000 points"", 'So remember in LA\'s first season review of this anime series, that LA said this ""Senki Zesshou Symphogear you may be a season filled with and built on a foundation of inconsistency, but if anything the appeal to this season and in the future by in large this series\' appeal is for it\'s wacky batshit crazy mech-suited idol battles and of course...it\'s music."" Well, this season clearly learned from what it did wrong and was a HUGE step up.The plot for this season is a streamlined yet chaotic self-contained story with the newer characters told on the synopsis and you know what?, the plot being...self-contained immensely helped remove almost all the inconsistencies from it\'s first season. The plot LA mentioned already is chaotic yet it\'s one huge story to do with the newer Symphogear characters and villains with some references and plot structure from it\'s previous season to really for what LA will say in this one statement about G is this, ""it\'s an UP TO AN ELEVEN from it\'s previous season"" with all the good reasons to.If LA will say about the plot, it like it\'s first season, it has some plot & character beats similar to Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A\'s but it\'s similarities fade quite early on.In terms of the characters, by all means even the characters, even the newer cast members do get their spot on the limelight, due to how complex yet streamlined the plot gets, the main cast and minor characters do evolve with this new story, sure LA said that most of the main cast are stereotypical, but G helped give most of the main Symphogear users more development outside their personalities, as such Tsubasa personality inconsistency is no longer there but given something of a protector warrior personality with tsundereness here and there, Hibiki got the most evolved character development from this season with something of a ""trying to protect people by utterly going beyond your limits"" and Chris given her past deeds to come back and bite her in the ass, as for the villains, they cept one are actually sympathetic villains with some contrasting and similar beliefs to the main cast Symphogear users and are more or less welcome additions to the Symphogear franchise, LA\'s favourite villain\'s being Shirabe Tsukuyomi voiced by Yoshino Nanjo and Kirika Akatsuki voiced by Ai Kayano behavioral dualities were the most interesting villains, ohh and LA\'s favourite character in the series is still the gunslinger idol Chris.The character evolution and development does range for A LOT of betrayals that works to some degree from both sides of the main cast and villains, it\'s gets a bit crazy and actually works well in terms of character dynamics or ""melodrama"" but G\'s melodrama can be given some grace due to how the melodrama is executed as not obvious or over-exaggerated and actually brings more in-depth lore to the world of Symphogear and it\'s bigger main cast.The animation done once again by Satelight has actually stepped up from it\'s previous season with higher details in general, from the character designs to the bombastic battles, this is a HUGE plus to G.Now for music, LA might as well praise this element of G as well, with many of the voice actors singing some of the battles OST\'s as well as insert song OST\'s (those goes to Aoi Yuuki, Ayahi Takagaki, Nana Mizuki, Yoko Hisaka, Yoshino Nanjo, Ai Kayano, Yui Horie, Yuka Iguchi and even freakin\' Hideo Ishikawa) as well as Nana Mizuki singing the OP and some of the ED\'s, the music across the board are  a-m-a-z-i-n-g, special props to the OP ""Vitalization"" especially.LA has been praising this season too much, with all your detractors out there of this series, if you want there are some faults in this season, those are; the fanservice gets slightly rampant from the typical panty shots to the questionable transformation sequences, the plot twists of this season are either a hit or a miss (LA more or less saw it as a hit for the most cept one in Episode 10), the only other fault LA saw was *SPOILERS* this one new character Dr. Ver voiced by Tomokazu Sugita is your stereotypical mad scientist ""destroy the world"" villain, he is outright stock and cliche, he may be a smart-tactiful villain but his maddening-ever evil because evil presences weigh down the more sympathic, interesting villains *SPOILERS END*.The ending, well the ending blew LA\'s expectations out of the water and even UPPED the previous ending from the first season too, from the battles, character resolutions (including the newly added sympathetic villains, through battles) and just how awesome and batshit crazy the ending lead up to, the ending just blew LA away and executed almost perfectly, wrapping G in a bombastic musically-amped up ribbon.Symphogear G, is a definite step up to first season, from it\'s self-contained story that was built somewhat away from some of the inconsistencies of the first season (though still implemented, still semantics), to character evolution and developments changing the stereotypical main cast to some interesting badass characters & villains, animation and music elements being better highlights of G and even though G has faults LA mentioned above, the pro\'s outweigh the cons in G immensely for LA.Symphogear G WANTED LA to carry on watching for more with it\'s higher stakes and heavy involvement of it\'s main cast and villains to take the stage with it\'s bombastic battles as pure sweet eye candy, and if your in it for the music, ear-candy, yes LA enjoyed this season, LA isn\'t gonna lie, if you haven\'t already noticed. G, by all means helped LA show that Symphogear series CAN do something amazing, now let\'s just see whether GX will do the same or even better... self-contained immensely helped remove almost all the inconsistencies from it\'s first season.

The last act of the work is stripped of all the themes that the first season had the audience come to associate with the series and is a comically simple showcase of good overpowering evil.There was absolutely incredible potential here, and episode 5, despite many of the meandering plot points already in the process of damaging the work, showcases just...how much can be done with the pieces the show is working with. However, it is mostly a nose-dive downward from that point with plot pieces such as Hibiki's Gungnir and surprises with Miku amounting to exactly nothing in the functional sense. how much can be done with the pieces the show is working with.

Due to the activation and control of these relics through sounds, these magical girls also ""moonlight"" as idol singers. The plot armor for why high school girls save the world is that ancient relics can only be activated through certain frequencies, which only certain chosen ones possess. Closing the distance between yourself and your symphogear increases your power, and there are a few pure relics only a chosen few can possess, wielding nearly unlimited power.Is the plot made up on...the spot?

An emotionally and physically abusive mom is repeatedly framed as loving, with her children missing just how great she was after her death. Even though she even subjected them to medical experimentation, she\'s framed as actually good because she cries while she abuses her children. Abuse isn\'t a character flaw as long as you have good intentions while you carry it out, since it\'s simply tough love. It doesn\'t matter that they\'re child soldiers to carry out terrorism as long as you love them.Even if you ignore all its problematic elements and incoherent plot, Symphogear is still terrible. Despite the increased animation budget of later seasons, the fight scenes are just as lifeless and uninspired as ever. Rather than do anything creative, the creators seem content with new transformation stock footage, shinier graphics, and incessant boob jiggles. Their commander catches a barrage of bullets flying at him with all the excitement of catching someone\'s car keys. The protagonist\'s punch, which normally can pierce metal and destroy rock, doesn\'t even graze him. Dramatic collisions overshadow fluid fight scenes. Effortless attacks can wipe out an entire battalion of enemies. Epic battle scenes include the protagonist throw punches in the same place without moving while yelling top of her lungs for a full minute. The ""high-octane action"" is less inspired and creative than golf.Symphogear is atrocious and haphazardly combines classic shounen tropes into a mindless mess of a story. There\'s the audience surrogate, a weeb girl who relates everything the anime. There\'s a scantily clad villain sensually torturing her pawn as character development. The 55 pound school girl lets her fists do the talking. The soundtrack is a generic blend of up-tempo synthpop. Symphogear is peak anime, everything from the awful objectification of minors to gratuitous fan service to mindless action sequences, so its target audience will love it.Is it good? Absolutely not.

Unfortunately, Symphogear has all of Kill la Kill\'s of the problematic elements and few, if any, of its upsides. The plot, action, and music are generic, incoherent, and dull.

Probably.Honestly this caught me off guard. Like i did not expect it to be this better than season 1. Hell, might as well make this the season 1, let's just pretend season 1 didn't happened.From the animation to the story to the characters, they all received a LOT of improvements from previous season. The story is still confusing to me but wth you don't need logic to watch this banger. Characters got MAJOR improvements we get to see Hibiki's backstory, which added depth to her character. Ogawa suddenly became a fucking badass this season, he's like...my favorite character in this season. Also Chris best girl, fucking fight me!The animation also received improvements like the transformation scene and the fights. Damn, they are hype af!. they're not as messy and janky as the last season and the studio delivered. The songs are still the main highlight of this anime. All of them are lit af. I was headbanging when the opening start, shits that good.I enjoyed this season so much than before. Might even continue to season 5.Thanks for reading ya'll my favorite character in this season.

Say goodbye to the first season of Symphogear\'s hair-brained scheme to develop mature character arcs in a fantasy world devoid of mature themes. Fully embraced in Symphogear G is the soul of the show - robogirls saving the world from the noise with their punchy warballads. Suspend your desire for ""realistic"" world building and experience the closest thing to an autistic rock opera Anime has to offer, Symphogear G.Story 8Two parts wheat, eight parts buckwheat... on the scale of so bad it\'s good, Symphogear G gets an 8/10.The moon, which had a makeover in the season 1 finale, is not in stable orbit...as NASA claims! Turns out we\'re in for a doozy when she comes crashing down, and a rival gang of popstar power rangers have emerged from their invisible flying fortress seeking to return the moon to a safe orbit through advanced achaeology, terrorism, and vocals. The USA plans to evacuate to the lost city of Atlantis and leave the rest of the world to its fate. Red, Yellow, and Blue must contend with the new Black, Green, and Pink rangers to save the world from being saved the wrong way. Yellow ranger, who is also jinchuuriki for the 9-tails, must contend with the weakening of the sealing Jutsu. We learn that the heart of a power puff girl is fickle, and the absolute dedication of these young women to their naive world views creates a series of reshuffles in the midst of battle until everyone has basically fought everyone for every reason.Art 7The endless hordes of noise are completely passed over once again, probably the worst thing about the art in the first season and this season... but the show really shines when it comes to the naval battles, control rooms, and like 4/7 of the Symphogears\' abilities in battle. Towards the end there are some fantastic throw-ins that are pleasing to the eye - complete remodels of each Symphogear, visual progression for the threats posed by the main villain and his minions, a fairly competent depiction of planetary scale battle with energy weapons. The opening has a beautiful, stylized first half. The scene with Chris eating Spaghetti like she\'s two with a mushroom plastered to her cheek and some of the veggies from the sauce finding themselves under her mug was great. It\'s nothing spectacular for the most part, but not bad either.Sound 9There is a greater range of emotional intent to the tracks this season, some duets, and overall a more polished feel. Beyond that, many battles take place with limited, varied placement of sing-alongs by the Symphogear users or none at all. They mix it up a lot more this season, and it works to the benefit of the viewer/listener.Character 8The antagonists have ""complex motivations"" in Symphogear G. Specifically, they are either too senile, too young, too traumatized, or too manic to see their half-baked aspirations through without relying on archaeological terrorism - birds of a feather flock together, I suppose. Our protagonists struggle to determine where their allegiances lie when confronted with NASA\'s lies about the trajectory of the moon - will they join the invisible fortress crew, convert them to common sense, or is there another way?Meanwhile, the best characters in the show are again the Americans, and now also Blue Ranger\'s talent manager who is revealed to be a Ninja capable of subduing the full might of the Yakuza while taking a phone call, walking on water, bending bullets, and using bent bullets to shadow bind enemies. The commander also turns out to be legit, singing one of the finest songs in the series as he toughens up his young songstress unit by having them run long distances and box frozen critters suspended from meat hooks. Rocky!They\'re all idiots in the best of ways.Enjoyment 9It\'s great mindless entertainment. Blue Ranger launches herself off the deck of an aircraft carrier using that slingshot thing the fighter jets use for same. The lost city of Atlantis destroys an entire American convoy at sea. The American MIB unit once again attempts to steal national secrets from Japan at gunpoint and gets merc\'d by the Symphogear. Kyubi makes an appearence, but is resealed when Bikkie jumps in front of the most powerful laser the world has ever known to take advantage of its special properties. It turns out the main villain from season 1 is the most selfless self-perpetuating genetic parasite (that\'s called a virus, folks) that you could imagine - she was just misunderstood, what a sacrifice. The final battle is literally just FMA: Brotherhood + The Avengers Movie = this. It\'s a god damn travesty that doesn\'t try to be anything else, as opposed to the first season which tried and failed to be anything else. Fun! as NASA claims!

The commander also turns out to be legit, singing one of the finest songs in the series as he toughens up his young songstress unit by having them run long distances and box frozen critters suspended from meat hooks. Rocky!They\'re all idiots in the best of ways.Enjoyment 9It\'s great mindless entertainment. Blue Ranger launches herself off the deck of an aircraft carrier using that slingshot thing the fighter jets use for same. The lost city of Atlantis destroys an entire American convoy at sea. The American MIB unit once again attempts to steal national secrets from Japan at gunpoint and gets merc\'d by the Symphogear. Kyubi makes an appearence, but is resealed when Bikkie jumps in front of the most powerful laser the world has ever known to take advantage of its special properties. It turns out the main villain from season 1 is the most selfless self-perpetuating genetic parasite (that\'s called a virus, folks) that you could imagine - she was just misunderstood, what a sacrifice. The final battle is literally just FMA: Brotherhood + The Avengers Movie = this. It\'s a god damn travesty that doesn\'t try to be anything else, as opposed to the first season which tried and failed to be anything else. Fun!', ""The most notable points about this second installment to Symphogear is it was significantly more consistent than the first season in animation quality, we get three more Symphogear users, and there is shift towards having more fighting and less school/slice of life moments (which is either good or bad depending on your preference).In regards to the animation there is a noticeable difference that is almost like a generational gap where the style of anime changed from like pre 2010s to mid late 2010s (despite it being one year apart from the first season). Also whereas season 1 had some very iffy looking action season towards...the middle of the season (I specifically remember some scenes where Chris's guns looked quite silly) the lows in animation this season are much better, and there are more highs in animation be frequency, although season 1's best scenes are about equal to me.As far as new characters Kirika and Shirabe are pretty cool designs, Kirika behing a scythe character reminding me of Ruby from RWBY or Rory Mercury from Gate, although it's interesting that her color scheme is green and black given that most scythe characters seem to be black or red themed. Shirabe has like giant saw blades attached to her head and skates around with roller blade like things on her shoes. Maria is like a new diva idol character and does a collab with Tsubasa in the first episode, she has cool black cape that can block projectiles, I like her design the least of the new characters but it's still solid.This season had maybe 1 episode that focused on activities at the school where there was a karaoke competition but other than that it was purely action focused, with a convoluted plot of a secret program keeping vessels for Fine to be reincarnated into, and a crazy annoying dr villain, and basically just finding excuses to have different symphogear users to fight each other. I actually missed some of the slice of life because I thought Miku and Hibiki had a really good dynamic in the first season with lots of scenes of them talking in their dorm (it's still in this season but in more dramatic scenarios than down time). That said the action scenes where on average much better and having more symphogear users fighting each other was great. Also because there were more symphogear users there were a lot more insert songs, and I liked all of the insert songs alot (particularly Chris's and Hibiki's).Overall at it's core this season continues with the general formula of great high tempo music, cool action and special attacks, and cute girls that the first season had, with slightly more action and a little less slice of life. the middle of the season (I specifically remember some scenes where Chris's guns looked quite silly) the lows in animation this season are much better, and there are more highs in animation be frequency, although season 1's best scenes are about equal to me.As far as new characters Kirika and Shirabe are pretty cool designs, Kirika behing a scythe character reminding me of Ruby from RWBY or Rory Mercury from Gate, although it's interesting that her color scheme is green and black given that most scythe characters seem to be black or red themed.

I finished season 1 about a week ago, and it was a pretty fun introduction to what I think is a good start to an overall story. Not the perfect anime, far from it. Very rough around the edges, and even throws in some things that made me want to back out. Most notably the main villain and how her ""evil-ness"" is expressed (the sexual harassment of the younger girls in the cast was a huge red flag and made me nearly stop watching the anime...all-together). Season 1 tried in earnest, and the finale did leave much to be sought out for in a sequel. With the previous villain out of the picture, I\'d hoped season 2 would be able to mature from it.Season 2, or Symphogear G, however, I think is already failing. The animation quality has gone up exponentially. I think even music quality is better (though I find myself more irritated by the songs of G because of the instruments and the vocal direction of the actresses. But that could be preference). I think the overall character designs are great, though you can tell that, besides the main 6 girls, and the already introduced characters from season 1, there\'s not a whole lot to delve into. Just characters that are there to be characters.Story, however? I\'m not sold on. Spoilers for season 1, we left on the Lunar Attack that ended with a huge section of the moon breaking off, which had to be destroyed by the combined efforts of Hibiki, Tsubasa, and Cris. The whismical ending to season 1 might leave viewers wondering how the world would view this event, how life carried on for Hibiki after having to fake her death for a few months, where Tsubasa\'s music career has gone, how Cris is doing. And while these topics are nodded to, they\'re not given as much attention as I\'d hope.The story doesn\'t really wanna focus on that. Rather, we\'re introduced to an array of new characters, including three new Symphogear users, the new main villain, and the supporting villain(?) who serves as the new girls\' leader. The villain is extremely one dimensional. Has next to no motive besides ""we gotta stop the moon from falling, but we\'re not really gonna tell anyone how to do that."" The supporting villain(?) is sorta just there. The new girls are very neat, but I cannot buy into the fact that they were meant to be anything besides the match-up to Sailor Moon\'s large cast.The pacing is everywhere. The first episode takes place 3 months down the line from the last, with Cris and Hibiki attempting to recover a relic, showing off their new designs and new songs (including Hibiki\'s celtic-rock style genre, which I can\'t help but dislike because of the annoying mixing of the vocals). We are also intoduced to Maria, who somehow landed a spot in a duet with Tsubasa during a live concert. How\'d we get here? I dunno, but it ain\'t gonna be explained, so don\'t ask.There\'s an implied rivalry between Tsubasa and Maria for the entire season, and it\'s directly shown in the opening sequence to this season. But in honesty, it doesn\'t click. Maria using Kanade\'s relic was already a plot-point covered in season 1, when Tsubasa came to terms with Hibiki using it instead. If anything, it feels like there\'s supposed to be implied tension between Hibiki and Maria, since they each have a Gungnir. But it\'s a missed opportutnity in any case.This season is rampant with cliffhangers. And in honesty, I think it was a choice made to try and lure the viewer in to keep watching and eventually finish the season without realising it. Because there is next to no substance in season 2 that has made me want to come back besides just seeing what happens next. I have no lingering ties to Hibiki\'s ""character arc"" this season. Cris and Tsubasa aren\'t doing much, but they are moving towards a conflict. And the new girls are not making me feel anything for them besides a little bit of disappointment because...why should I care about these girls introduced as villains, who have so far only beat up the main characters? Maria is the most compelling, if only because of her sister\'s history. But that\'s it.SPOILERS FOR LATER IN THE SEASON.Hibiki\'s arc this season is coming to terms with the fact that her relic, the Gungnir, is killing her by fusing with her flesh. All of her ultra-powered attacks in season 1? That insane finale where they just shot the moon out of existence? Yeah, that\'s apparently been killing her this whole time. It\'s very briefly mentioned in season 1 that Hibiki is fusing with her relic, but it is NEVER implied save one scenario to have a true downside to it. In season 1, Hibiki went berserk because the relics of Gungnir combined with her grief over Cris\' sacrifice was just too much to bear. It was sad to witness, and it made someone wonder what the lasting effects could be. And while I\'m somewhat glad it gets more expanded on in this season, turning it into ""terminal illness"" plot point just doesn\'t seem the way to go.The rate at which it happens is why it disappoints me the most. In the second episode, when Hibiki is charging up a mega attack with the help of Tsubasa and Cris, you can briefly see that she is holding back her berserk state. But it isn\'t implied that such a state is killing her until she collapses later in the season after going berserk again. She understandably faints from the strain, but after being treated, we learn very suddenly that her relic is fusing with her and will eventually kill her if she keeps this up. This information is kept from Hibiki. Why? I don\'t know, so it can speed up faster by accident and create drama.It doesn\'t make sense, for an anime that started with carefully examining Hibiki in season 1 and seeing how her relic was working, would just skip over her physical check-ups for 3 months straight and somehow completely miss this. It\'s contrived, is what I\'m saying.And one of the most egregious things of all, Hibiki losing her arm. Which leads to the discovery of Gungnir\'s slow killing of her. Hibiki losing her arm is supposedly traumatic. But it\'s not, because it doesn\'t matter a few minutes into the next episode. It was very clearly meant to be an ending that would make viewers think ""Oh my god! They just tore off her arm! We gotta see what happens next!"" so they\'d keep watching. This action is not committed to, it is hardly brought up ever again. Hibiki does not take away anything from having her arm bitten off by a monster. Because it does not last. It is torture porn for the sake of making the viewer cringe because Hibiki got hurt, and then be relieved because it\'s all fine.I have not yet finished this season, but I can already tell the ending is tending towards a huge spiral of plot details that I will not be able to keep up with because of the break-neck pace it\'s gotten into. It\'s going to include a ""I don\'t need a weapon, my friends are my power"" cliché. It\'s going to lead to Hibiki pushing herself to an absolute limit that may damn-well kill her, but somehow, her friends are gonna pull her out of it. And also the new girls are gonna be there.I have very little positive to say about this season because almost everything so far feels contrived. It was bouncing off the walls in a way that can almost feel cohesive if you squint. The animation is a lot better, but the eye-candy shots are still undesirable. Music is somewhat improved, but I\'m jaded and cannot stand the pitchiness of some of the songs. Given the earnest start of season 1, it\'s sad to see season 2 is having such a rough time. I will give my thoughts on the ending as I approach it. But I do not have high hopes so far.Edit:Having finished the season in it\'s entirety, I\'ve still not much to say different from my original comments.Hibiki\'s solution to her relic killing her is, again, contrived. And perhaps that\'s my issue with the season as a whole. While I appreciate the anime for doing some stellar work on Maria\'s redemption, everything surrounding it does not feel organic.Shirabe and Kirika\'s duel feels needless. Fine\'s inclusion is a nice nod to her character arc coming to a head and proper closure after season one\'s ambiguous end. But it\'s such a strange conflict to have. Perhaps it\'s a good comment on how, even with gears, the characters in this show can have issues communicating with each other, too. Though, Chris and Tsubasa\'s fight towards the end of the season felt like a better execution of that topic, as the girls have always clashed with each other throughout the whole season till now.As for the main villain, again, there\'s not much to feel for. He\'s maniacal, and that sorta seems to be it. Just a power-hungry person who knows how to exploit others. And while villains like that can be interesting, he doesn\'t have much in the way of making me think beyond ""there he is again, being crazy.""And lastly, Hibiki\'s new relic. It\'s the shard of Gungnir that Maria had been using, while Maria goes on to use her sister\'s relic in the finale. I understand why Hibiki uses it, and I am happy to know that the idea of Hibiki being a ""rival"" to Maria who would eventually claim what is her\'s was executed upon. In proper Hibiki fashion, it wasn\'t really a fight at all. Just Hibiki insisting that all they need to do is talk and listen, and things can work out. And just like that, Hibiki won back her relic, this time without killing her.It makes me question what the point of vaguely implying the rivalry between Tsubasa and Maria was, but given the anime didn\'t want to act on it, I have to just shrug and wonder.I\'ve been mostly negative, but it\'s because I can\'t bring myself to really think of ground-breaking positives. I feel the message of the world re-uniting in song was well-delivered. And the bitterness of knowing the only way to stop the moon from crashing was to inadvertently keep pushing the curse on humanity forward is a good way to end the show all-together, in honest. I don\'t know what\'s beyond these seasons, but Miku\'s final scream about making a world where people don\'t have to fight just seemed like a good end.As for positives, again, the animation is a lot better. I\'m not an eye-candy person, I don\'t like the blatant sexualisation of the girls in this show, I never will. But there was a lot more focus on action and how the gears can function as weapons, rather than how many shots you can get of the girls in really sexy poses. Which I think is a very big improvement. There was still eye-candy shots, which I just glance away from when I see them, but they\'re a lot less prominent.Music is down to preference. I personally don\'t enjoy the songs in season 2. For most of the girl\'s songs except for Tsubasa\'s, I found myself turning the audio down a tad so I wasn\'t so grated, and could focus more on the subtitles and the voices talking over the songs instead. That\'s just me, I wouldn\'t direct my bias at the show for that.While I understand Symphogear is an anime about just watching and getting excited over everything being shown, I have to argue that wasn\'t what I imagined when I watched season one. The story went off the rails at the very end, but it was grounded up until that point. Hibiki\'s accident with Kanade\'s death was impactful, even though I didn\'t know these girls at all. School life for Hibiki, as well as her social life with friends like Miku, really helped sell me on the world of Symphogear in season one. Seeing her interacting with classmates more, just being in class and hanging out with others, between all the fighting Noise, and being at HQ to help out. The fall-out with Miku especially.It was cemented in the reality that Hibiki was in: school life toppled with being an alien-fighting weapon. And while the life of a gear user is incredibly hectic, and I can understand the show taking a turn to show that side of it more, it\'s missing what I previously enjoyed the most. Miku\'s fight with Hibiki towards the end was good, honest. Miku fearing for Hibiki to such a painful extent. It felt genuine. I enjoyed it. But I still miss what made season one so alluring to me.I would say, if you enjoy the first few episodes of this season, then watch the whole thing. I personally don\'t find much value in it, besides the introduction of the new characters. Hasty as it is, it\'s not bad. But it\'s lacking, and that\'s unfortunately very disappointing for me. all-together). Season 1 tried in earnest, and the finale did leave much to be sought out for in a sequel.

But it\'s lacking, and that\'s unfortunately very disappointing for me.', 'Symphogear G improves in several ways over the first season, though in other ways feels like it fails to quite live up to the same breakneck antics that made the first season work so well. On the whole, though, it still maintains the same level of enjoyability, and while it can drag at times it feels very much like a natural continuation of the previous season.As with the last season, the first episode actually sets the ball rolling almost immediately, with a very powerful opening scene. However, after this, the season loses steam much faster than the previous one, and is overall much more stop-and-go...than the full-steam-ahead of season one. That\'s not to say that the drama isn\'t there, as it most certainly is, and one of my favourite sequences of the show occurs around episode 5. It\'s just more hit-and-miss than the previous season. Like the previous season, the mystery is solved by around episode 5, with the story throwing as many twists as it can in to make the plot finish out the season. Unlike the previous season which makes it work as a (somewhat) coherent story, this season definitely feels more meander-y, with the plot slowing down to a crawl for a few episodes.While I will defend the characterizations and arcs of the first season, I do have to admit that this season did the characters better than season one, though it feels like at least some of the character progressions are repeats of what had happened the previous season. The background characters aren\'t given quite as much attention, though the new additions to the main cast more than make up for this, as all three are given quite good characters. Finally, the ""twist"" villain is... significantly worse than that of the previous season, with poorer execution and an infinitely worse motivation.The continued brutalization of the Climax Song aside, the season didn\'t actually do power creep as badly as the previous season. I liked the direction that they went w/ Hibiki\'s gear, and there are some clever things done with the gears throughout the season. With the absence of a certain character, there\'s less explanation about how specific systems work, though with how handwavey the systems are anyways I consider that a good thing. As with the previous season, the finale goes just a bit over-the-top for my taste, but on the whole I feel the power levels were much more engaging.The show, as with nearly all anime, also still suffers from the occasional show-then-tell-anyway problem that cropped up in the last season, with an equally egregious example placed in for the sake of a twist that was easy to see coming from several miles away. And, as with the previous season, there is a shower scene. So be advised if those ick you.Animation is done way more consistently than in season 1, with fewer of the Jpeg background images that showed up in key moments, though I\'d still hesitate to call it great, just good. Which is better than the ""fine"" of the last season. The soundtrack is also very good, with one of my favourite songs of the series cropping up about midway through the season, the sound design is still done competently, and though the voice acting misses some of the raw highs of the first season, it\'s still punchy enough to sell it in my opinion.This review may read like I don\'t like Symphogear G as much as I do the first season; however, I do still think they both have their merits, and both deserve the same rating. While there are a lot of things G does worse in little ways than the first season, those few things it does better it does so by quite enough that it comes together to the same mile-a-minute don\'t-think-too-hard package that worked so well for the first season! than the full-steam-ahead of season one. That\'s not to say that the drama isn\'t there, as it most certainly is, and one of my favourite sequences of the show occurs around episode 5. It\'s just more hit-and-miss than the previous season. Like the previous season, the mystery is solved by around episode 5, with the story throwing as many twists as it can in to make the plot finish out the season. Unlike the previous season which makes it work as a (somewhat) coherent story, this season definitely feels more meander-y, with the plot slowing down to a crawl for a few episodes.While I will defend the characterizations and arcs of the first season, I do have to admit that this season did the characters better than season one, though it feels like at least some of the character progressions are repeats of what had happened the previous season. The background characters aren\'t given quite as much attention, though the new additions to the main cast more than make up for this, as all three are given quite good characters. Finally, the ""twist"" villain is... significantly worse than that of the previous season, with poorer execution and an infinitely worse motivation.The continued brutalization of the Climax Song aside, the season didn\'t actually do power creep as badly as the previous season. I liked the direction that they went w/ Hibiki\'s gear, and there are some clever things done with the gears throughout the season. With the absence of a certain character, there\'s less explanation about how specific systems work, though with how handwavey the systems are anyways I consider that a good thing. As with the previous season, the finale goes just a bit over-the-top for my taste, but on the whole I feel the power levels were much more engaging.The show, as with nearly all anime, also still suffers from the occasional show-then-tell-anyway problem that cropped up in the last season, with an equally egregious example placed in for the sake of a twist that was easy to see coming from several miles away. And, as with the previous season, there is a shower scene. So be advised if those ick you.Animation is done way more consistently than in season 1, with fewer of the Jpeg background images that showed up in key moments, though I\'d still hesitate to call it great, just good. Which is better than the ""fine"" of the last season. The soundtrack is also very good, with one of my favourite songs of the series cropping up about midway through the season, the sound design is still done competently, and though the voice acting misses some of the raw highs of the first season, it\'s still punchy enough to sell it in my opinion.This review may read like I don\'t like Symphogear G as much as I do the first season; however, I do still think they both have their merits, and both deserve the same rating.

Kara no Kyoukai Movie 6: Boukyaku Rokuon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5204/Kara_no_Kyoukai_Movie_6__Boukyaku_Rokuon,"['Kara no Kyoukai review Part 6The sixth movie in the Kara no Kyoukai series is, once again, a departure from what one has come to expect. Unfortunately Boukyaku Rokuon (or Oblivion Recording), is a somewhat lacklustre effort compared to the rest of the franchise, and is only carried through by some great visuals and excellent sound.The story takes place in January 1999 and focuses on Kokuto Azaka, Mikiya\'s younger sister who was ""adopted"" by their uncle. She is enrolled at Reien, a school for girls, and is also apprenticed to Aozaki Touko in order to become a Magus.The movie begins in a fairly ambivalent manner,...with Azaka remembering a scene from her childhood. Her current task is to investigate investigate a string of events at Reien which seem to involve ""fairies"", and to aid her investigation Touko sends Ryougi Shiki to work undercover at the school (posing as a student), something which Azaka is not too pleased about.Now the plot itself is pretty straightforward, however this is also the biggest problem with this movie. Story-wise this is by far the weakest episode in the series, and even though simplicity may not be a bad thing in a show, in this case it comes at a price. The plot is extremely feeble when it comes to the characters and their development, and whilst the concept may be a good one, the movie is never given a chance to realise it\'s potential.One of the reasons for this is that a great deal of effort has gone into fleshing out the two main characters (Kokuto and Shiki), who, along with Touko, form the backbone of the franchise. Azaka\'s inclusion however, seems more of an afterthought, and there is little in this movie to fully justify her presence in the series. Granted she adds a different dimension to the relationship between Kokuto and Shiki, but the impact is almost negligible, and viewers may find themselves wondering how she fits in to the grand scheme of things.The art and animation are of a very high standard, but there is once again a drop in the overall quality of some scenes (the young version of Azaka being cross-eyed at times is an example of this). The action sequences are extremely well choreographed and executed, whilst the character animation is often fluidly smooth. Unfortunately though, there are again times when the movements do not match the actions, and while these occasions are not too common in the movie, they are noticeable because of the quality of the rest of the animation.Sound is, once again, excellent. The music is extremely well suited to the movie, with the more cheerful scenes feeling cheerful, and so on and so forth. The pieces are varied, with some being more reminiscent of Maria-sama Ga Miteru, while others are very much what one would expect of the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. The effects are very well crafted and choreographed, and while there is some slight cacophony to be heard at times, this should not really impede on one\'s enjoyment of the movie.The acting is pretty much what one would expect from the franchise, with each of the characters being portrayed very well overall. One does have to wonder what Sakamoto Maaya (Shiki) was trying to achieve this time though, as there are occasions where she sounds like she has blocked sinuses.From the start of the movie it\'s clear that this outing will be all about Azaka, and whilst this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, it could have been done far better if the story was tighter, more interesting, and a little darker (which is what one would have expected from the series). There is an effort to give Azaka a degree of depth which comes off as laughable at times, mainly because her ""love"" for her older brother is given as the reason for her adoption, her choice of school, etc. Her apprenticeship as a Magus is purely based on the fact that she considers Shiki a rival for her brother\'s affections, and while I have no problems with personal reasons being the basis for such actions, it just seems a little too neat an excuse in Boukyaku Rokuon. Having an unhealthy interest in one\'s siblings may cause some aberrent behaviour in people, but there is an expectation that the viewer will simply accept Azaka\'s actions and reasons without questioning them - not a good move on the part of the writers.The other characters don\'t really get much screen time so there isn\'t any really much one can say about them. That said, there are some pretty obvious hints given about Shiki which feel more like preludes of things to come than any real attempt at development.Given the flaws in the story and its characters, I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed Boukyaku Rokuon as a whole. The movie represents a big departure for the franchise, and has a far more lighthearted feel to it at times than any of the previous outings. The action is well done, and there is enough going on to keep the viewer interested till the end. It\'s unfortunate then that the main feeling one gets from this episode is that it is nothing more than a prelude to the final movie, a factor which upsets the balance of the narrative and can leave the viewer frustrated that many obvious questions remain unasked or unanswered by the end of the movie.Boukyaku Rokuon isn\'t the best installment in the series by far, but it\'s not a bad effort on the whole. While there are a number of improvements that could have been made (in particular the rather haphazard plot), there is still an entertaining addition to the franchise here, and one that has a different feel to it than the other movies.One can only hope that the final chapter will represent a return to form for the franchise. with Azaka remembering a scene from her childhood.

Frankly, nothing other than the nice effects of the anime makes it alright.I\'ll start with the good news...The art and sound direction in Boukyaku Rokuon (Oblivion Recording) are both very nice. If you\'ve seen some of the earlier installments, you\'ll know how impressive they are. If you have not, well, they are refined and a step above most anime MOVIES (which is a step above anime shows).Unfortunately, the plot does not shine quite as nicely as the effects. This one focuses primarily on the relationship between Shiki and Azaka...(a side character in the series) and they attend an all-girls school to investigate the disappearance of a student. I\'ll take two positions in describing the plot depending on whether you have seen the series or not.If you have, you\'ll be accustomed to and expecting a dark story that includes a lot of violence and... harsh themes. If you like the series because of that, you won\'t really find the same kind of enjoyment. The plot seems ""girlier"" and a few characters feel out of place in the Kara no Kyoukai world. That said, this movie is quite important in fleshing out some of the older characters as it delves into more of their histories and lifestyles so you might want to watch this just for that knowledge. However, the movie\'s plot isn\'t essential to the rest of the series, as it seems to be almost a filler. The way it expands on the magical world of Kara no Kyoukai can lead to a better understanding of the series (mainly in technical aspects, like how people attain magical powers and whatnot) but some of it seems rather inconsistent and random. Thus, I think it IS worth watching to know a little more about the characters, but be prepared...If you have not seen the series and are just thinking about this movie in particular, I can understand how you may be drawn in. If you like things of the occult detective genre that centers around female characters, this movie would be a pretty good experience for you. However, just know that you might get confused by a lot of stuff that goes on, especially between other characters from the series that don\'t do much in this movie. The pacing of the story is fairly well done and will keep you interested, but the overall plot is decent at best.Conclusion: You\'ll probably like this more if the dark nature of the series is not something you are interested in. Don\'t get me wrong, as this movie isn\'t completely... uplifting. Some mysterious elements were really good, but it could have been done better.And before you suspect me about the ""low"" grade I gave this movie, a 5 means mediocre on MAL standards. Is it worth watching? Yes. Will it make it to the top of your list? Most likely not.

We're kicking things off with yet another look at UFOtable's Kara no Kyoukai film franchise, based on the light novels by Nasu Kinoko. I've talked about the first five already, but let's reiterate a bit. Previously, in the Kara no Kyoukai movies Mikiya collapses on a couch because he likes dolls and gets left to rot in the first and there is much stupidity. The second goes back in time to Mikiya and Shiki's first meeting and the subtle mystery surrounding it and it's surprisingly good given the first one. In the third, a group of rapists are being...justifiably murdered by one of their victims and our “heroes” decide to step in and put a stop to it. It had some faults but was pretty decent. In the fourth film we focus on Shiki's psychology and an existential crisis and it was epic. The fifth film gave us a mystery involving an apartment complex and magic and it was a great film. I'm a bit surprised that I've gotten to like the franchise so much given what a poor first impression it had, but there you go. Let's jump in to look at Kara no Kyoukai 6: Boukyaku Rokuon.Story:Our tale opens at a boarding school where Mikiya's sister, Azaka, is thinking about the taboo way she feels about her brother. Ewww. Fortunately, the story doesn't focus on that aspect all that much. We get an exposition dump about how Azaka has been studying magic under Touko and has been sent to the school to find out the truth behind a strange incident where magic faeries seem to be stealing people's memories and may have been behind the death of a student. Shiki is sent to help her since her mystic eyes give her the power to see things that Azaka can't. What kinds of dangers will they face and how will they overcome them? Matters are made worse with the animosity Azaka has towards Shiki, whom she considers her rival in love because her brother loves Shiki in a way that he doesn't love her.Let's start with the film's story issues. The biggest one is probably obvious, Azaka's incestuous feelings towards her brother. I'll give Kara no Kyoukai some credit over a lot of other things I've seen with incestuous overtones, it does treat the situation like it's creepy and screwed up and I'll give it some credit for not focusing too much on it. However, there is a pretty substantial amount of time spent on flashbacks that serve the sole purpose of helping establish why Azaka has a creepy brother complex and it's just annoying. Exacerbating matters is the fact that the incest sub-plot ultimately does nothing. It doesn't need to be an element at all for the film to work. The only function it has is to give a reason for the animosity between Azaka and Shiki, but that animosity itself does basically nothing. There's a brief stretch where they're arguing but it never really affects their ability to function as a team. All of which just begs the question, why in Sir Ian's name does this need to be here at all? They could have removed it completely and used the extra time to develop their scenario better. Maybe they could've used the time to show some of Azaka's training under Touko and avoided the annoying exposition dump.On the positive side, the investigation itself is quite interesting. Initially, it looks like the solution is going to be kind of obvious, but there's more to it than meets the eye. No, that doesn't mean that something turns into a giant robot. They just keep introducing more complexity as it gets further in until they finally reveal the whole truth of the situation. Flashbacks aside, the narrative also flows really well.Characters:The main character focus in this one is on Azaka and Shiki. Shiki remains a good character and you get a good sense of her personality in this. The problem is Azaka. Her personality is pretty much defined by her brother complex and her being generally commandeering. Maybe the final film develops her more, but as she is now she's just an insipid, unpleasant character and having her as such a big part of the movie does hurt it. At least we get a super cute border collie. UFOTable probably thought that it would make up for having to deal with Azaka, at least somewhat because cute puppies are the best way to make up for gross things. Of course, they could have just not had gross things and just had a cute dog as a bonus. That would have worked. The antagonists are kind of interesting and fleshed out in this. They could have been given more depth, but given the length of the film they're pretty decent.Art:The artwork and animation are spectacular. The backgrounds look really nice. The battle sequences are intense and somewhat surreal. Like several other movies in this franchise, there are some intense and disturbing images. And, like the rest of the franchise, the characters are well drawn but their designs are pretty standard.Sound:The performances are really well done. Sakamoto Maaya gives a strong performance as Shiki. Fujimura Ayumi., in spite of voicing a completely uncompelling character, does give a good performance as well. Really, there are no weaknesses in the cast. The music in this one is strong as well. Kajiura Yuki did a really good job.Ho-yay:One of the antagonists has a motivation that does read as a bit homoerotic, but there's not enough of it to say for certain whether they were going for that or something else. Aside from that, there is no ho-yay.Final Thoughts:Kara no Kyoukai 6 takes a strong story idea with some compelling elements and weakens it with an unnecessary incest subplot and over-used flashbacks. The film itself is still pretty decent given how much it does well, but it's not one of the strongest films in the series by any means. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. Tomorrow we'll continue film festival week with a look at Hetalia: Paint it White. justifiably murdered by one of their victims and our “heroes” decide to step in and put a stop to it.

Also, it could be serious at times, and in her defense Azaka actually was much more mature in the light novel than in the movie. But the movie I could just not take seriously at all. They made Azaka into a moe imouto-type character and changed around a large part of the...plot, so much that it almost threw me off completely. The original chapter in the light novel was also actually somewhat relevant to the overarching plot, while in the movie they spent like 15 seconds on that, didn't even explain it properly, and just went straight back to Azaka.Granted, the animation quality and sound are as good as always (actually not really; Azaka's voice actress pisses me off). But the plot in the movie was god-awful.Do yourself a favor and just read the light novel translation for this one. It's incomparably better. plot, so much that it almost threw me off completely.

This is due to the fact that there is little no development of any of the characters and the only thing that this particular addition brings any light to is the confirmation that Azaka Kokuto does have an elder brother complex.Speaking of which, it is done in a very cliche manner, however, it does attempt to explore the past of Azaka and Mikiya the reason being 'Azaka does not remember the exact moment that she fell in love...with him.'The rest is entirely, almost sickenly cliche there are no real reasons given as to her love for him, from the film's point of view it is basically just 'it was bound to happen, let it be.'Onto the actual story:It has a reasonable premise, a suspicious string of deaths, a prime suspect, the supernatural aspect of fairies is also added. However, there is no building upon this, the actual perpetrator is revealed very quickly without any intelligent reasoning, simply 'revenge'.Within the story there is also a factor of jealousy that Azaka feels towards Shiki in being too close to her brother. Azaka is initially very cold to her, yet towards the end of the movie this attitude just seems to fade for no apparent reason.This is where I feel the movie failed the most on.6/10Art:There is something about Kara no Kyoukai art that I simply cannot dislike, in other words, it is AMAZING.There is no other word to describe it, I adore the character designs for one, but my main praise is for the fight scenes, not only are they beautifully choreographed and animated; they also seem to bring your whole screen alive with the fluidity of the motion.This movie does not fail on this aspect either, in Azaka's fight scene with Ouji, her senpai, in the church; I found that my mouth was agape for the entire sequence, with the entire light spectrum flashing before my eyes and the fairies all over the place. Simply marvelous.9.5/10Sound:The ED was nothing memorable... there were the standard sad tracks played in the BGM when Azaka is reminiscing about her days with her beloved brother, pretty standard.There was also the usual 'epic' sort of music played during the fight scenes that I found fit quite well, however, the fact stands, there was nothing MEMORABLE.It was decent, but at the end of the day, for the most part, remains forgotten.Voice acting was also just... fine, nothing outstanding, I also found that Shiki's voice sounded a bit flat and nasally for the few lines that she did speak in this film.7/10Characters:I find myself actually disliking Azaka for being such a possessive brat over her brother with Shiki, who actually doesn't view Mikiya as a love interest.In addition her depth is equivalent to that of a puddle upon a road after a light drizzle of rain.Read - VERY SHALLOW.Her love for her brother is simplistic at best, her personality is one of the ultimate stereotypes of anime, quite disappointing overall.As the story was mainly focused on Azaka I found that the other characters were basically omitted on the development area. Shiki, Touko and Mikiya all get basically no development relative to Azaka.6/10Enjoyment:I usually tend to enjoy all Kara no Kyoukai films to at least a certain degree due to the fantastic artwork and choreography; and I'm afraid Boukyaku Rokuon is no exception, despite my previously bashing of pretty much every aspect except the art.I did find myself having fun during the fight scenes, especially Azaka Vs. Senpai.So all in all, 7/10.I expect the final movie to be AT LEAST the standard of Mujun Rasen, ufotable do not fail us now!Conclusion: If you have seen the previous 5 movies, watch this one, if only for the sake of continuity, however, if you have not then do not bother.You would not understand what was really happening anyway, and I do recommend watching the rest of the movies, 1-4.

Now Azaka has to bear all the teasing by her brother's lover, all the while unlocking many mysteries of the academy and her past.If you have followed the series up until now, in whatever order it might be, one can tell how narratively inconsistent the film feels.

This is not to argue that the movie looks horrible; it is still just as well animated, if not even more so than its earlier installments.It's just a bit of a letdown given how much tension and anticipation the series has created so far and now it just feels like a magical girl plot.

The greatest differences between this one and the others is that the anime is focused on Azaka Kokutou, Mikiya\'s sister. She is in love with her brother and gone through great lengths to dismiss the ""she\'s your sister, incest is bad"" argument, having her uncle officially adopt her as his daughter (which just makes her Mikiya\'s sister and cousin, I don\'t see how that helps), attending an all girl\'s school (where the story actually takes...place this time around) that has student dorms, and having a life outside of Mikiya\'s. For her, Shiki is an unwelcome surprise, a potential rival for Mikiya\'s love. Mikiya is completely oblivious of any romance conflict whatsoever. Ig that\'s to be expected from loving Shiki unconditionally, no matter what sex she physically is.Due to an incident where a student at Azaka\'s school, Reien\'s Girl Academy, dies, Touko Aozaki sends Shiki to help Azaka take out a magus that is the culprit. Azaka could not be more dismayed at the aid but has no choice in the matter. She cannot see the ""fairies"" behind this and thus must rely on Shiki and her eyes of death perception.In my opinion, this version of Garden of Sinners is much lower in quality simply due to Azaka Reien. She tends to be a selfish individual who is easily swayed by her emotions, especially in cases she deems offensive. This leads her to do things that are not exactly wise, such as shouting about magic and Magus in the corridors of the school with other people around and ransacking the principal\'s office for information on students in the same classroom as the deceased. She is not considerate of others, acting like she is superior to everyone around her and thus her decisions are the best course of action. Basically imagine Rin Tohsaka from Fate, but with Sakura Haruno\'s personality with a incestuous love for her brother, and you\'re in the right ball park.Besides for Azaka Reien, the anime was fine. This version was more descriptive on what was going on at the beginning than the previous versions, although there was some room for improvement. The art and sound was as beautiful as its been in the past, although a noticeable hole in the story was during the fight scene at the end, where Azaka could see the fairies and a bit more than was previously explained, noticing the extra bit even before the magus did. It was a bit too coincidental for there to be a famous magus to be pulling all the strings in the back as well in this specific school. Although in my opinion the school system was sloppy, allegedly having strict rules but letting a visitor in during a school break to investigate a student\'s death without any issues. That\'s not even considering how there was a teacher that also dealt drugs.I\'d say the episode was fine.

Chapters 1 and 3 of this special deal with Mikiya and Shiki, with Chapter 1 being fairly inconsequential to watch, and Chapter 3 being, at least from what I believe, an unintentional but beautiful ending to the series proper. Chapter 2 deals with a new character, and the return of Asagami Fujino, which is very nice. Chapter 2 allows Fujino and her friend to develop very well in reaction to events from the previous movies and what they believe in...now.The art is, as per usual, really nice. The use of CG works very well, and there's nothing outside of the ordinary, just a very simple, solid presentation of animation by ufotable, and a very nice ending frame.The sound... well, there's not too much in terms of sound design to notice. As for the composition, Yuki Kajiura and Kalafina are purely wonderful in their use of vocals that accentuate the mood and characters of scenes, especially the ending.Now you've probably noticed I've said the word ending multiple times, and that's because this OVA is worth watching just for that.

A solid 7.5/10, this special stays true to the overall feel of Kara no Kyoukai and blends several kinds of approaches to storytelling/atmosphere. Essentially, this is a 3-in-1 bundle of short episodes (~9 minutes each).I watched Extra Chorus after Mirai Fukuin and much like the other reviewer, I believe this to be a better decision to absorb this short special.Episode 1 centers on Kokutou and Shiki in a slice-of-life manner. You'll have cat-appreciating-Shiki and several moments that show a  more vulnerable side to her. As for Kokutou, he's...well, Kokutou as usual. Their interactions are...organic as always. So much left unspoken yet understood in their relationship dynamics which is even more applicable in Episode 3.Episode 2 re-introduces other characters you've already seen in KnK Movie 1 and KnK Movie 3, as well as Mirai Fukuin. It ties their interactions and maps out their future in a neat, non-intrusive way that makes sense and doesn't feel forced. It also sheds additional light on the aforementioned side characters; they get some extra fleshing out which is always a thing to be appreciated.Episode 3 wraps up with Shiki/Kokutou on one hand, and the cast from Episode 2 (a.k.a. the Reien Academy girls) on the other. Equally entertaining and emotionally melancholic, it manages to tie the whole feeling of this special in a very heartfelt way. Azaka being angry at the station scene is hilarious.The balance between the dramatic, heavy-atmosphere-filled essence of Episode 2 is a great counterpart to the playful and funny Episode 1 and the more emotionally-packed, nostalgic, and yet optimistic nature of Episode 3. Few series can achieve this, to be honest.In a way, these 30 minutes encompass a wide variety of situations, emotions, and messages for you, the watcher and appreciator of the KnK universe. They are in no way a must to understand the whole plot. They are, however, a neatly-wrapped 'extra' that will be appreciated by any KnK fan.As I said, a solid 7.5/10. organic as always.

Kengan Ashura,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36903/Kengan_Ashura,"[""This is my first review so I apologize in advance for poor formatting or it's not done well but I just thought I'd have a go at it.First of all to all of those reading this please please please please try and look past the fact that it's 3D CGI as it's not as bad as you might think.  It's not nearly as bad as Berserk was and in fact feels like it excels over traditional 2d when it comes to fighting scenes.  The movement feels fluid as well as the choreography is very well done with no repeating actions and speaks well...to the source material.  The downside being that there is quite a few moments of exposition where a commentator or the peanut gallery may through in a few comments but overall wasn't too jarring.The story felt true to the manga however it doesn't have as many interpersonal character development as the manga which is okay considering they have to fit the story down in to a 12 episode season.  It certainly was able to transition well between the comedic moments as well as those that were more serious in nature and the impact of certain scenes were conveyed well.I think the sound was one of the highlights of the show, every fighter has had theme song which really made their entrance into the fights feel more memorable and sometimes even gave more character to the fighters or fleshed them out a bit more.  The sound effects in particular never felt like they were dull or out of place and felt natural as well.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the adaptation,  it deserves a 2d animation medium for sure but don't let that distract you that the anime direction, sound, choreography and overall feel of the show felt like it was a memorable use of my time. to the source material.

I love the manga, it\'s one of the best martial arts stories and I wrote an entire review on how cool it is. I\'ve been wary of the anime adaptation ever since I saw the first trailer and realized it was going to be in CGI. Being a Kengan Ashura, I felt obligated to watch it but I set my expectations extremely low. apparently, those expectations weren\'t low enough because I am still baffled at how awful this show is.The most glaring problem with the anime is the CGI animation. While not...the worst CGI that I\'ve seen, it\'s far from what I\'d call good. Character models are clunky and stiff, the attacks lack impact. The CGI does a poor job of emulating the beautiful art of the manga. The fight choreography is terrible, the camera is all over the place, never knowing what to focus on. At best it\'s uninspired and at worst it\'s just disorientating. It doesn\'t feel like it\'s ever taking advantage of the fact that it\'s CGI. The anime tries its best to replicate the exaggerated and detailed facial expressions characters have and it often falls flat. Sometimes they look fine but other time it just doesn\'t look right on a 3d model. The presentation of some of the techniques used by the characters is just abysmal. Raian\'s Removal and Ohma\'s Advance look ridiculous in the anime. Something about the way they glow is just off. There some 2d scenes during flashbacks, which are mostly still images with very limited animation. They\'re not great but they look better than CGI. The switching between the 2d and CGI scenes can be quite jarring at times.The CGI is bad, but the real problem with the Kengan Ashura anime is the story. I\'ve already talked at length about how good the story is in my review for the manga. It\'s a simple story but well thought out and executed. The anime somehow completely butchers it. The anime adapts 73 chapters from the manga, not counting the extra chapters. Obviously, a plethora of stuff was cut to make it fit into twelve episodes. Entire subplots and characters are just gone, it\'s a mess. For example, the anime just skips the second major fight of the series and jumps right to the third fight. I\'m astounded that they would skip a fight, in a series all about fighting. The character that Ohma fights against is also important to a later subplot, so of course, that entire subplot was axed. I think the baffling change is the absence of Yamashita\'s secretary Kushida Rin. She\'s an integral part of the story and she just doesn\'t show up at all. They even cut some vital character development for Yamashita. He\'s more a comedic relief character than anything else in the anime. It\'s upsetting because he\'s one of the most well-developed characters in the series. The side characters suffer the most from the cut content. There are a lot of good character interactions that give good characterization and flesh out character relationships between side characters and most of them were cut. Because of this you\'re never really given a good feel for or reason to care about characters other than Ohma and Yamashita. The most these characters get is a flashback during their fight. The manga excelled at fleshing out all the characters and the anime seems focused on getting to the next fight as quickly as possible. Another bizarre change is that in the manga there\'s a character named Adam Dudley, a fighter from Texas. He\'s a rude and vulgar man with ""FUCK"" engraved on his teeth. Oddly enough this was changed to ""DAMN"" in the anime. It\'s a minor change but it feels unnecessary. He\'s still just as foul-mouthed as he was before, so why change it at all?If there\'s one positive thing I can say about the anime, it\'s that the music is pretty decent. The opening song is good, even if the visuals of the opening leave a lot to be desired. The ending song is terrible, the rap does not complement the series at all. The background music does its best at trying to get the audience hyped for the fights and would succeed if not for the fights themselves didn\'t look so bad. The voice actors are fantastic for the most part Daisuke Namikawa is absolutely perfect as Kiryu Setsuna, he gives the best performance in the show.Quite simply Kegan Ashura is a bad adaptation of a brilliant manga. The visuals and all the cut scenes are just horrid. It\'s an insult to both Daromeon\'s art and Sandrovich\'s storytelling. The manga was full of passion for martial arts, and I didn\'t feel any passion for martial arts or even love for the source material in the anime. It\'s such a hollow and soulless adaptation, and it\'s unlikely there\'ll ever be a proper adaptation. I\'d advise anyone who was put off by the anime\'s visuals or story to try and give the manga a shot, it\'s a far better experience. the worst CGI that I\'ve seen, it\'s far from what I\'d call good. Character models are clunky and stiff, the attacks lack impact. The CGI does a poor job of emulating the beautiful art of the manga. The fight choreography is terrible, the camera is all over the place, never knowing what to focus on. At best it\'s uninspired and at worst it\'s just disorientating. It doesn\'t feel like it\'s ever taking advantage of the fact that it\'s CGI. The anime tries its best to replicate the exaggerated and detailed facial expressions characters have and it often falls flat. Sometimes they look fine but other time it just doesn\'t look right on a 3d model. The presentation of some of the techniques used by the characters is just abysmal. Raian\'s Removal and Ohma\'s Advance look ridiculous in the anime. Something about the way they glow is just off. There some 2d scenes during flashbacks, which are mostly still images with very limited animation. They\'re not great but they look better than CGI.

There's more than just graphic or double standard. (Kingdom S1 for instance...)The story was able to capture the interest at episodes 2, which is quite a slow paced for a short series. However, the wait was worth so far. The story was quite straightforward by episodes 2, basically, our main fighter has some sort of vengeance plot while his rep. company has a twisted goal in mind. It's from that episode that you slowly learnt the protagonist story.Sound details were also fine,...the add of bone cracking sound and other miscellaneous did enhanced the fight.Yes, animation isn't anywhere close to typical anime post 2015, but overall it was enjoyable and nowhere cringy as people make it sound. the add of bone cracking sound and other miscellaneous did enhanced the fight.Yes, animation isn't anywhere close to typical anime post 2015, but overall it was enjoyable and nowhere cringy as people make it sound."", ""I loved the manga. It's the best thing I've read so far and it's honestly great. But this is just a mockery of what the manga was. I was disappointing when I saw the trailer for this ONA but actually watching it is another level of terrible.Story-7/10The story is simple and interesting but it's not exactly what it was in the manga. I feel like the pacing was far better in the manga. Things were also explained far better in the manga too with a lot more detail and making the read a lot of fun but its numbed down in the anime.Art-3/10The art style...in the anime is truly terrible. I hate it so much. There are so many awesome moments in the original manga that just have no where near the same impact here. The main cast of characters looks so much better in the manga due to the amount of detail put into it but it's nowhere to be seen here. I would love to see how scared Kazuo would get in the manga due to his facial expressions but those are just missing in the anime.Sound-5/10The sound design is pretty mediocre. Often during the start of the episode I was thrown out of immersion purely due to the sound of the drums making me think I'm watching Naruto. I also don't like the generic impact sounds during the fight scenes as it just doesn't carry that heftiness.Character-8/10I like the characters, I really do. There are so many charming and interesting things about these characters that make them compelling to me but it's just all over thrown by the awful animation and how they decided to go about the character designs.Enjoyment-2/10Yeah... It wasn't an enjoyable experience at all.Overall- 4/10I really wish Kengan Ashura gets turned into a proper anime at some point in the future as there is so much potential in it.

It is CG anime but honestly it isn't as bad as people are making it out to be.Story: 6 The anime dosn't have much of a story going on at the moment and has cut out some stuff from the manga but it never ruined my experience mainly because the fighting is more important to me then the story (at least for this anime not the manga.)Art: 7 For a CG anime it is pretty good it feels more fluid then...most do at least during the fights. It can feel a bit clunky and sometimes people will just look so weird and bad. Sometimes it seemed like they had normal non CG characters talking with CG characters so that looked very weird and off. But you get used to it unless you just hate all CG anime.Sound: 7 The sounds for the punching and kicking and whatever during fights was fine. I loved the soundtrack and music and the voice acting for the most part. Not much else to say.Character: 6 We don't get to see much character depth or anything, at least not yet. But for what we have I enjoy the main characters. Not much to talk about unless I go into the manga but this is the anime so yea.Enjoyment: 9 I don't mind or hate CG anime's and I love the manga so that already makes me happy and t he fights to me looked awesome and I think wouldn't look as good without the CG because there are a lot of fights.

I have also read the manga too, but I wanted to try and give a review from the point of view of someone that hasn\'t read the source material.Lets get started- Brief synopsisA middle aged salary man named Yamashita Kazuo on his way home runs into Fighter Tokita Ohma and see\'s him beat up a another huge fighter. The next day Kazuo is invited to talk to the owner of his company where he is dragged into the world of the Underground fighting circuit called ""The Kengan fights"".There he is re-acquianted...with Tokita where their journey begins to compete and attempt to win the Kengan Tournament.- StoryThe plot is basic enough. Company CEO\'s have fighters represent them and fight for them in Kengan Matches. Fighters fight to see who\'s strongest, and other personal reasons. Their CEO handlers are in it for the prize(money, property, and whatever to further their companies.) Every so often there\'s a Kengan Tournament where only the best of these fighters come together to compete to be Champion and win their boss the position as the new Kengan Comittee Chairman. The whole story is basically one big Tournament arc. I know that will scare many away but it\'s really about all the subplots between characters that really makes it not just another ""people fighting"" anime.- CharactersCharacters are everything from cool looking to Drag QueensTo walking stereotypes that have their own fighting styles. That\'s about it. No developement of any sort in the 12 episodes. Though some of the cast do have their back stories touched upon.-PacingVery fast. It can be jarring at times when it goes from fight to fight so fast with no grace period in between.- Art and AnimationThe anime consists of 3D CG models and 2D hand drawn art. CG is used for the fights and 2D is mainly used for static stills or scenes with not much movement. Sometimes however you have one character thats CG in a frame with another character drawn in 2D in the same frame. It looks odd but I didn\'t find it as jarring as other people have said.They also use a really stylish way of presenting the visuals to the viewer during flash back scenes or when the narrator is explaining something. It\'s a combination of still images  and audio showing you what\'s going. So the camera would show an image then pan over to another image that will either have the narrator speaking or a character(or character\'s).Overall the 2D art looks fine. The CG is decent and surprisingly quite fluid(can be clunky at times). Is it as good as say the ""Ultraman"" 2019 CGI Anime? No, but is it as bad as the ""Berserk"" 2015 CGI Anime? No. In my opinion it\'s a decent middle ground.I personally didn\'t mind all of the different art styles and techniques used though I do understand how some would dislike it. I\'m unsure whether it was a design choice or budget issues. I jmagine both due to the fact both the video for the OP and ED are quite lackluster and you can tell they didn\'t have the funds to put effort into them they\'d have liked to.- MusicThe opening theme (The King and Ashley by My First Story)I really enjoyed the opening song and was anticipating it ever since I heard the snippet from the PV(Preview) for Kengan Ashura months ago. It\'s a Pretty good Jrock song that does the job to set the tone.The ending theme (Born this way by Bad Hop)I enjoyed the ending. It\'s Japanese Rap. It balances out the hard hitting opening by having a more mellow and melodic ending. Works especially well since every episode ends with a fight.The rest of the music consists of heavy metal and other insert music that is quite forgettable.- SoundSound effects are fine, the audio sounds great. When the announcer is introducing fighters and commentating, her voice is powerful and has a lot of energy and flare. You really feel like you\'re actually at the Kengan Tournament.Voice acting (viewed in Japanese)All the characters sound exactly as I\'d imagine. They really put together a great cast. I\'m especially impressed with the announcer Sayaka Katahara(voiced by Mana Hirata). She really did a fantastic job playing the role of ""Master of Ceremonies"" and doing super hype fighter introductions and commentary.I can\'t speak on the dub but it does have veterans like Johnny Yong Bosch so it should be pretty good even if they used the same  actors for multiple roles unlike the Japanese version which is understandable.- EnjoymentThis is where I\'m going to diverge from looking at the anime as is.Honestly it was just ok. Even before the anime aired I knew it would be hard to adapt it properly and I was correct. A lot of character interaction was axed as well other events that took place before the tournament started that are referenced later in sub plots and in the plot itself. What makes Kengan Ashura is its characters more than the fights.In the manga they\'re so individualized with their personalities. We don\'t get to see that in the anime due to them removing  interactions. In turn it just makes the whole show feel like a bare bones adaption that\'s too fast paced. The anime rushes from fight to fight with just enough plot so you don\'t get completely lost. I can understand why they did this though. The way the Manga is presented makes it hard to adapt. Easier to adapt fights than a ton of character dialogue and interactions that only real work in comic format and don\'t translate well when animated. Overall I\'d say it\'s more of a Kengan Ashura lite. If you just wanna see cool characters fighting each other and don\'t care about much else than I recommend this. In my opinion they accomplished what they set out for. A show that can be enjoyed on its own as a stand alone and that can also make people want to seek out the manga for a more complete experience. with Tokita where their journey begins to compete and attempt to win the Kengan Tournament.- StoryThe plot is basic enough.

The anime\'s strength lies in its character development,with protagonist ""Tokita Ashura"" Ohma\'s journey from a mysterious fighter to a deeper character. However, the anime\'s major flaw is theomission of several manga chapters, leaving fans wanting more. This omission is crucial to understanding the full scope of Kenganmatches and the complex relationships between characters. Despite this, Kengan Ashura remains an exciting and visceral journey into thebrutal world of underground fighting, making...it a must-watch for fans of martial arts and combat sports. it a must-watch for fans of martial arts and combat sports.', ""The anime turned out to be terrible. I was hoping to see something on the level of Baki's fighter, but all I saw was a pathetic parody.The main character is just strong and cool, no character, no motivation, no story. His assistant is a surprisingly more lively character, who, however, only evokes disgust and a desire to be removed from the screen; in fact, he is copied from the head teacher of the cool teacher Onizuka.The plot - underground fights, solving money issues through fighters, etc. is essentially taken from the anime Fighter Baki. In general, it could be good if the anime was purely...about this.The animation is pathetic, as if poor Indians paid for food animated this inspired by the second season of Berserk.This work is so empty that there is nothing even to say about it. about this.The animation is pathetic, as if poor Indians paid for food animated this inspired by the second season of Berserk.This work is so empty that there is nothing even to say about it."", ""The anime that revolves around one big tournament arc. Now how can an anime with only one plot be this interesting? How is character development present? I can tell you that Kengan Asura hadled everything nicely. We have fighters who act as company representatives and engage in the kengan matches where different martial arts and styles are used. I recommend, reading the manga for the full experience because the anime excluded the subplot and other characters who were important in the story.I was suprised when I saw Kengan Asura had 236 chapters and only talked about ONE TOURNAMENT ARC. I started with the anime...first and was quite displeased with the CGI. But as I continued watching, the problem with the animation didn't bother me as much. I was engaged in the storyline. The way Kengan Ashura portrayed martial arts was very realistic. It feels as if the characters in the story were real people. The fighters are overwhelmingly powerful but this doesn't mean that fights are one-sided. The case with Kengan Asura is, you won't know who wins or loses the fight and it keeps you hyped up every match. The stances are accurately drawn and their muscular figures don't seem disturbing. And I loved every part where the fighters showed fear and disappointment after their matches ended. The Opening and ending theme song also gave that underground fights vibe about the anime. 10/10. Don't worry about the CGI, the voice actors and actresses made up for it. first and was quite displeased with the CGI.

And if you\'re one of those people who can\'t enjoy an anime if it looks bad, then you\'re going to hate this.  But, if you\'ve watched enough anime to know that animation is secondary to story, and that some of the best anime is hidden behind mediocre animation, then welcome to yet another hidden jewel.A certain anime taught me a long time ago, never judge an anime by it\'s animation style. Always give it a chance.  That anime was Gankutsuou. Since then, I\'ve learned that whether an anime looks like it\'s for children (Made...in Abyss, Madoka Magica), made with substandard animation styles (Now and Then Here and There, Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni) made with cheap CGI (Knights of Sidonia), or just weird styles you\'re not used to (Gankutsuou, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei) you always give it a chance.  I am adding Kengan Ashura to that list as yet another example of a great anime that was hidden behind trash design.Beyond the atrocious CGI, is amazing action, intriguing characters, laugh out loud humor and over the top memorable moments.  What other anime has Ronald McDonald out here participating in death matches while Barack Obama watches on? What other anime has a dude leaving trails of naked chicks in the entrance tunnel before coming out to fight?  Kengan Ashura is like Tekken, Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventures, Baki The Grappler, UFC and WWE all just got drunk and said: ""Hey, you guys look sexy after these 9 beers."".This anime is intentionally ridiculous. You\'ve got Panasonic, Bandai, Nintendo and McDonald\'s, out here hiring mercenaries, psycho killers, and pro wrestlers to fight each other to the death to secure contracts for lucrative multi-billion yen deals in underground death matches. (Apparently ""secret underground death matches"" take place in massive stadiums before 70,000 people, though.).In the middle of this, you have Ouma Tokita: Your typical stoic MC on a quest for revenge in the midst of the madness. And by his side, is the comedic relief, Kazuo Yamashita. Kazuo, in over his head as Ouma\'s manager, is the source of the best comedic moments of the anime and really breathes life into the duo. Ouma, by himself, would be boring outside of his fights. Just another brooding tough guy.  But, paired together with Kazuo, it brings life to both of their characters.As for the fights they are very entertaining to watch. While CGI is ugly as sin when not properly animated, it has one advantage over traditional anime, in that the motions are much smoother.  This leads to some very fun fights.  The fights in Kengan Ashura are brutal, nearing Mortal Kombat levels a couple of times. (But, the gore is not too excessive, and if you\'re not into that, probably only one fight will really bother you.) As with any tournament battle anime, you get all kinds of styles and powers.  People who fight with hair, people who appear to transform, etc...  It leads to some interesting combinations and characters and that\'s the main thing that sets Kengan Ashura apart from alot of tournament animes: Fights not containing the MC are actually interesting.Usually, in these kinds of anime, the creators breeze through the rest of the cast\'s fights. There\'s not a lot of effort put into them.  They may spend a little time focused on the MC\'s top sidekick fighting, or the main villain\'s fights in the tournament, and breeze through the rest.  But in this anime, they actually put in the time to make each fight entertaining in it\'s own way, and flesh out the characters a little bit.  While the focus mainly resides on Ouma, they actually put significant time into getting you familiar with other characters that have little or nothing to do with him, like Cosmo, Lihito, Sekibayashi and the Kure Family.  This really helps the anime a great deal, as the rest of the tournament doesn\'t feel like filler when the MC isn\'t in it.  In this entire season, Ouma only has 4-5 fights out of about 15-16 fights in the season, and I was still engaged and entertained by every fight.There\'s a lot to love about this anime. It\'s a shame that the CGI drags it down for so many people. But, at the end of the day, this is anime and good animation IS important, so I don\'t blame those who are turned off by it.

Do not get me wrong, they did get the animation right where it matters but the rest is rather cringe- worthy!Sound goes just beyond OP and ED. Though its not my style, it suits the anime! The action sequence sound is far more important here as each blow and break of the bone is what matters!That being said its a great fun anime to binge if you feel like turning your brain off and just enjoying what happens on screen with over the top fight sequence and great character design.

The series spends about half of it’s runtime setting up this simple premise before we move onto the fights. There’s really not much to say for the story other than it feels like an overjustification for creating a fighting tournament anime. To spoil the ending, it was “wait for season 2 or read the manga”.Sound and Visuals:The opening and ending were both good choices for trying to hype up the show. I have no complaints...with the voice actors either. Mana Hirata as the announcer in particular was willing to sacrifice her vocal cords for the greater good of hyping up the fights. If you’ve seen any of this show, you’ve seen the absolute lows that CG anime has to offer. CG anime peaked a few years ago with Houseki no Kuni, since then a lot of shows seem to be using it just to save more money on their manga ad. This show is no exception. It hurts because I’ve heard a lot of good things about the manga, and you can see the effort put into the choreography during the fights. But it really gave off the feeling of watching someone else play a fighting game that keeps skipping cutscenes.Characters:There weren’t any standouts here. You could see everyone’s personalities just fine, but the anime never really tried to go any deeper than the surface. Also, the standard character design was rippling strongman. When everyone is an ugly abomination of CG, it’s hard to really latch on to any of them. If I had to choose a favorite it would probably be Karla, and that’s mostly just for character design.Verdict: Hard avoidThere’s nothing really worthwhile here. If you want to watch an anime about bad CG buff guys fighting, you might as well just watch Baki instead. It’s also on Netflix but some scenes actually look fine, there are memorable characters, and there’s some semblance of a plot. with the voice actors either.

In season 2 we are introduced to many characters, so many that its almost hard to keep track however they are all developed well in a short amount of time. the soundtrack is also very good and adds alot of hype to the fights. the anime has fantastic world-building and the choreography of the fights is goods. in the tournament arc every single...fight is genuinely hard to predict and this includes the fights of the protagonist.initially the main characters didn't necessarily interest me but they grew more likeable as the show went on. fight is genuinely hard to predict and this includes the fights of the protagonist.initially the main characters didn't necessarily interest me but they grew more likeable as the show went on."", ""Story-7/10The story is simple and interesting Kengan Ashura provides an interesting tale of bloodsport to fix business disputes among busiess tycoons. It's your usual high stakes fighting anime, but the animation is flawless and they do a decent job of fleshing out the characters. They aren't the mindless meat puppets that just fight to spill blood. The pacing is on par with the story that is being told. We see a number of matches being fought and also a decent exposition of the plot, without it feeling rushed.Art-6/10The art style in the anime is truly is something that many hate as they use 3D...models which a lot of people don't like, but it's good enough as far as I'm concerned. It isn't the smoothest thing, but it gets the job done just fine. What I really liked about the animation is the fact that they got most of the martial arts moves right and captured their essence pretty well. They showed combat where it was time to show combat. This is in contrast to Baki where combat is mostly just one-sided beatdowns. This anime actually shows the struggle behind combat and even the most overpowered character in the anime actually has to fight instead of just walking up to a guy and crushing them like a can of soda. People are all human in this anime complete with their weaknesses which are accurate from a martial arts perspective albeit dramatised. The violence is also pretty exciting and how it actually is when it comes to martial arts instead of the cult-like Baki violence full of shock content. The violence in this anime can get brutal and there are deaths and severe injuries as well, but they're few and not focused upon too much. They're more like the natural course of events in a fight to the death. All in all, I'd say that the animations in this anime are quite accurate, exciting, and enjoyable.Character-8/10The characters in this anime are another story entirely. It is full of people with amazing physiques to start off. Even the extras look simply scrumptious, the characters do have their own backstories to them which do have humane content to them. Some of them make mistakes or go adrift from their paths, others are simply born evil, there are those who have great ambitions, then there are those who fight for the sake of others, and finally, there are those who want to prove a point to themselves and to the world. At a few points, it feels like they're just spamming you with character backgrounds to increase air time without having to animate a whole lot, especially since the backstories are often just still frames with sounds. But it all works out in the end. The anime also has a pattern of giving you backstories to certain characters just to make them lose in the end, probably to stoke your empathy on the broken hopes and dreams. Apart from that, even the secondary characters have quite some content to them than simply existing. In contrast to Baki the Grappler, there is much more by the way of content as far as characters are concerned. In fact, the characters and their struggles in the fights and the changing tide of the fight itself is pretty much what adds to the excitement of the Anime.Overall- 8/10I would definitely recommend this if you enjoy mixed martial arts anime or if you like watching weirdly powerful characters fight to the death It simply portrays the elements to martial arts and combat quite accurately and the only other anime I've seen which does it better would be Hajime no Ippo. models which a lot of people don't like, but it's good enough as far as I'm concerned.

It tells the story of Yamashita Kazuo an ordinary japanese corporate worker who one day meets Tokita Ohma a man that wants to prove that he's the world's strongest in a alleyway after a fight Ohma had with a random man. He is frightened and disturbed by him. The next day Kazuo is called in by his superiors and he meets Tokita Ohma in there as well, together the two will soon embark on a journey in the world of the Kengan Association where corrupt businessman pit...their own respective fighters against each other in order to gain power. The primary reason that I started watching Kengan Ashura is because I was looking for another anime just like Baki, and this one is quite similar to it, they both have the same epic, gory fight scenes plus the interesting characters that fight to become the world's strongest, to protect something, or to just be violent for no worthwhile reason. Kengan Ashura differs in a sense that it actually has a decent story behind it that can be related to our society, corrupt people whether they areworld leaders, politicians or businessman will do everything in order to attain  power, prominence and wealth, this is portrayed really well in Kengan where the fighter's owners are mainly businessman, and people bet their fortunes on Kengan matches in order to attain power, wealth and the ever so coveted chairman position granted to the winner of Kengan Life Or Death Tournament, in society this type of stuff actually happens behind the scenes, and this anime despite being a gory martial arts anime known for its fight scenes has managed to show that in its story, that is the main difference it has with Baki, since that show pretty much has non-existent plot, the characters are interesting as well, some of them have decent backstories and interesting techniques, plus their power scaling is just right unlike  in Baki where it is bat shit bonkers. Now let's talk about the CGI, at first I was really annoyed by it since it is really bad, to this day I still don't like it, the characters look horrendous and stupid due to it, but due to the story and how interesting the nature of the show is I've managed to set it aside and overlook past it, now I'm enjoying the show for what it is , a gory, carnage candy martial arts anime with a decent story and some crazy over the top fight scenes. Let me remind you all tho, despite the corrupt businessman and world leaders trying to attain power and wealth by using the Kengan matches the story is on thin ice, a lot of the backstories are standard, people fight cause they want to be the world's strongest, their family needs them to as assasins, trying to protect something and all that, although some of a selected few backstories are interesting, they are overshadowed by the overwhelming generic backstories and a story besides for its main plot is skating on thin ice. At the end of the day you watch anime like Kengan and Baki for the fight scenes, the inhuman techniques and the unusual  characters that are violent for either shallow or no apparent reasons at all.Pros:-Epic fight scenes-Decent enough story that can be related to society on how corrupt people will do anything for money and power-Interesting characters and techniques-Great Op and EdCons:-Besides main plot the story is lackluster-CGI is dogshit, animation looks pretty bad-Backstories are generic AF-Some characters are introduced to either be throw-away characters, or get no follow up story about them afterwardsOverall Kengan Ashura is a gory, violent, carnage candy, over the top and fun fight scenes type of martial arts anime, that surprisingly has a pretty strong main plot, but all the subplots and other characters fall flat on their faces unfortunately, then again that's just how it goes for fighting anime and manga in general. If you're a fan of Baki, gory, carnage candy filled  with over the top fight scenes then Kengan is for you, go check it out on Netflix if you're interested. In conclusion I give the first season of Kengan Ashura a 7/10 for my personal anime rating. their own respective fighters against each other in order to gain power.

Seeing the flashbacks in 2D still frames was an interesting choice, and I liked that.I'd heavily suggest reading the manga, it has more developement and gives the characters more depth than the anime did. The anime only has so much time, but they cut off parts that I felt were essential to what made the manga such a masterpiece.Those cut pieces like Yamashita's other son that gets a wake up call from Ohma, the lovely redhead-Rin, lots of flashbacks that added...flavor to the characters that made them more dimensional. By cutting so many pieces out, this entire tourneyment arc feels a bit shallow.Should you watch it? I'd have to say no, and suggest the manga. flavor to the characters that made them more dimensional.

But it is a huge negative in my eyes.Theres alot of history explained that i didn't care much for. I found myself skipping most the explanations surrounding who someone was and why. There were just too many of those, i like the way AoT does it, with static screen with the info if you want to read it.Overall found myself skipping everything before and after the fights.Fights are cool tho!First 5 eps...are great the rest are very filler heavy. are great the rest are very filler heavy."", 'Many people will go over as to how the CGI looks bad blah blah and so on, but we gotta take 1 thing in account. The studio that animated this one was a studio so unknown, it\'s only got other 3 anime produced, so their proficiency is clearly either bad or unknown. But that doesn\'t mean i didn\'t enjoy the CGI! The CGI did a great job handling the fight scenes and coreography, with a smooth flow and correct anatomy arrangement!What really bothered me A LOT within this anime was the fact that, in order to squeeze out most of the story in 12 episodes,...they came as far as to skip not only crucial development moments for Yamashita and Ohma, world-building scenes but as well skip entire fights! (as seen that they didn\'t show Kaburagi\'s fight). Sometimes even deleting characters to fit the budget (as they erased Yamashita\'s assistant existence). Even though the CGI is quite bad rendered it doesn\'t make the art style any worse. The high constrasted colors, exclusive flashback panels that look like they were straight out of a Comic Book and opening has shown us the intensity the anime is bringing us.The soundtrack is pretty great not gonna lie, the opening is a banger, the tournament themes are good to listen and has introduced me to very cool japanese metal bands and i really didn\'t expect to find a japanese Trap group to have the ending space.The voice acting fits quite well, but I really expected Nogi\'s voice to be deeper, but that\'s just me. Also, I love Ohma voice acting, it fits him perfectly.Overall, it\'s a good watch, but not the one the manga deserved. The animation could be better to match the flow the manga had, and i definetly want the anime to remade by an actual animation company that\'s not  a ""pay cheap get cheaper results"". they came as far as to skip not only crucial development moments for Yamashita and Ohma, world-building scenes but as well skip entire fights!

You can skip this analysis.Well, as I said, I will only talk about the anime itself.Kengan Ashura is an anime done in CGI and as incredible as it seems, as much as I am used to good old 2D (traditional anime design), the CGI of this work seemed to me very fluid.This anime does not waste time, it is simple and objective in its presentation. It does not roll like most animes and one of the things I liked is that the beating happens all the time without mercy or...pity, with a lot of blood and violence. The rating is not +18 xD.Despite being a story centered and focusing his episodes on pure fighting, Kengan Ashura manages to amuse you with the absurd amount of characters (mostly fighters) and their unique personalities. You can also mix and work humor and drama effectively, being serious only when you really need to be.It is not a magnificent anime, but it pleases me enough and enough that I continue to follow, entertaining and suffering from the bloody struggles and personal stories of its iconic fighters.You can watch that at least you will have fun!-------------------------------------------------Review em PORTUGUÊS-------------------------------------------------Se você espera que eu vá fazer comparações com o mangá, você está enganado.

It\'s mindless fun for the most part. Just something notable was that even knowing the show is supposed to be ridiculous, there were times I cringed a bit when they tried to explain some ridiculous move or technique. The animation for the most part is pretty good but nothing extraordinary or ground breaking. I\'d say it\'s a step below something like Ajin in terms of 3D animation. The blood effects feel pretty cheap and there\'s definitely a sense that at some...points a 2D animation style would be better.The characters and their abilities aren\'t exactly very compelling a lot of times sadly. They are just simple things like the person being agile while being fat, being very sturdy, or like a kaio-ken thing where they ""unlock"" their potential and two characters have essentially the same ability in the show but they\'re just called different things. The main character also has an ability to control ""the flow"" of energy or whatever and that allows him to basically do advanced parries on the opponent but it\'s not really explained that well.The relationships between characters also feels a bit tepid, with me not really feeling like there is a clear cut villain that I can hate or a rivalry that I feel is iconic. In the show there is also a relationship between our MC fighter and a salaryman who is forced into being his manager. That relationship works pretty okay at it\'s role as comic relief and seems like there are hints that there will be something more than just that in the second season, though in this season comic relief for the most part is the extent of it.Kengan Ashura has enough problems to make it feel more generic than not, but it\'s not a bad watch if you don\'t expect anything too special from it. points a 2D animation style would be better.The characters and their abilities aren\'t exactly very compelling a lot of times sadly.

The creators opted to switch between 2D animation and CG during fight scenes. However, this description is misleading because in most dialogue scenes, they still use the CG animation. I would have preferred if they had chosen one or the other. Nevertheless, the CG animation during fight scenes made them appear more realistic, and for the crazy moves they wanted to showcase, it was the best option. Not only due to the budget but also for the viewer, as it made the movement of the fight more visible. In 2D animation, the action is usually...too fast, and the frames can look distorted. This can result in less impact on each hit. While I still prefer 2D animation if done correctly, I appreciated the style chosen for Kengan Ashura. In comparison to recent seasons of Baki, which don't use CG animation as often, Kengan Ashura's fight scenes had more movement on each hit. Another significant factor that makes the fight scenes smoother and more satisfying is that you can actually see the dodges and punches that connect, something that is often lost with 2D animation because it is so quick. too fast, and the frames can look distorted.

I don\'t think the visuals work as well when they\'re not in motion, and some of the character designs look better in 2D, but I can\'t argue with their choice to go this way for the anime. It just makes it stronger. That being said, there\'s not a whole lot of buy-in to the characters yet, and though the tournament is moving by quickly (an improvement over many of similar anime like Baki, IMO, as is the wide diversity...of fighters and styles on display), the gravity of the whole thing still feels light beyond the basic ""who will survive?"" element, since we\'re not very clear on what leadership of the Kengan Association actually entails or why it\'s so essential for so many. Still, for a series that goes full steam ahead, it knows what it\'s doing and much of that can wait. of fighters and styles on display), the gravity of the whole thing still feels light beyond the basic ""who will survive?"" element, since we\'re not very clear on what leadership of the Kengan Association actually entails or why it\'s so essential for so many.

They also receive great character development as the story progresses especially Ohma and Cosmo as they become better characters when they find stronger reasons to fight than just win and become the strongest.Overall, It was a great show but after reading the manga, I find it hard to look back and rewatch the series when there\'s a noticeable difference when the overall stories , art, and characters between the original and adaptation when the adaptation omits certain characters and have worse art than the manga great, using music from various artists with a variety of rock music and pop though I only liked a few songs.The characters are great as each of them gets their backstory and gives us a reason why they fight though, they take good chunks of episode time when they fight.

After watching Baki on Netflix which I hated (you can find my review on MAL). I didn't feel like wasting more time on a senseless and violent action anime. It was later recommended by an anime YouTuber that I feel has good recommendations and I have mutual interests with, so I decided to give it a shot.The CGI was a bit of a downfall but not as low as I thought it would be. The CGI rigs seemed to help the animators...with the action sequences. The white powder puff of smoke with each hit seemed and the exaggerated reaction of the fighters for attacks was cheesy in 3D. Would I rather prefer it to be in traditional anime style? Absolutely, the reaction shots of the side characters during the fights are traditional animation and they look really good. The show does possess the aptitude to do great animation, as they showcase in the flashback and exposition scenes of characters that have different animation styles and are done very well. I just feel that in regards to action anime, traditional animation just feels right and the impact of every attack is almost tangible.The show is based on a practice held for hundreds of years known as the Kengan Tournament, where big corporation find a fighter to champion their company and go up against others champions, where they battle over business disputes or for exclusive rights to do business in certain areas, wager their entire company, net worth, etc, on top of which the representative of the companies can have personal wagers against each other like stocks and so on.The story then leads to senseless and brutal violence but, the simple premise coupled with likable characters in Kazuo Yamashita, Lihito, etc is able to hold the series together and make it watchable. Kengan Ashura does overuse a lot of action anime tropes and not the good ones, like the crazy guys who fight to kill because they just do, the crazy fighter chicks who are interested in mating with the main character. It manages to still be funny and the characters are memorable, although that might be due to Ohma calling everyone by their full name.The show alludes to the main characters having some character development in-store. They are interesting enough to get invested in.Final verdict, Kengan Ashura is just a big dump of action anime tropes made with bearable CGI but, has enough energy and heart to not only be watched but enjoyed. with the action sequences.

At first, it starts choppy not to mention reuse of the same animation. However, as you continue to watch the series you see improvement in the company animation so.As for the general series, it's a show with some flaws which can be improved. One is not the biggest flaw of the series is the use of exposition. In every episode, there is...always a major abundance of exposition either used by the characters themselves for other characters or the story to help the audience better understand what's going on rather than allowing them to figure it out themselves.Another area where he needs some improvement is its characters. Some characters don't seem that very interesting. This is caused mostly by the character's motives.  The primary motive for the most interesting characters which are the competitors is common to be the strongest and their reason behind. Yet the majority fall under either being the pitiful, noble, or questionable.Finally, my last area of improvement for the show is the constant rising of tension. It's appropriate for a competition to have a rise in tension with the adrenaline, emotions, and stakes coming into play; especially when it involves money and business However in this series, the tension is hindered. If you take into account the mere exposure effect which implies you are exposed to something constantly then eventually you mentally and physically become used to it and is no longer stimulating and powerful enough as it used to be when you were first exposed to it. That is where the series is hurt because of its constant rise of tension with a new bad guy or a dramatic revelation in the middle of the fight. Because the tension is always rising it just doesn't excite you anymore and thus you rely on something else to enjoy as the series continues. Luckily those issues do improve as the show continues but they're still there so it's a good show to see especially if you're a fan of martial arts; as there is plenty of violence and hand to hand combat. For the conclusion of my review, I give this series a 7.5/10 due to its entertainment.But if you do enjoy seeing a bunch of steroid freaks, brutally smashing and kicking the ever-loving shit out of each other with nothing but their skills, ripped body and strength then this shows is right for you. always a major abundance of exposition either used by the characters themselves for other characters or the story to help the audience better understand what's going on rather than allowing them to figure it out themselves.Another area where he needs some improvement is its characters.

On the other side of the coin, there is Yamashita Kazou, an old Japanese salaryman, so fed up with his life, the non-ending bills and debt is catching up to his last nerves, with no way out, he gets involved in this gruesome underworld fighting scene with a promise for a better and more stable life.What really put Kengan Ashura above Baki narratively was the plot itself, there is a lot of politics to what seems like just a sublime fist fight. Global corporations are at stake and influence is constantly shaping up to be the decider of fates here. It throws itself under a curve ball but comes off as a full-powered continental crossing canon shot, full of promise and rights to come.Looking at this first season alone, not much can be praised, but it's one of that stories that lays itself a strong foundation and builds upon it in time. So many intriguing characters make their debut and a lot of rivalries are set up from the get-go.Overall: 7.3/10. his past, un-cohesive fragments that let us peek closely at what sort of man he really is.

Often overshadowed by its fellow Netflix ONA, Baki, it is not given nearly the amount of recognition it deserves. I've also always felt like a lot of people are on the fence about watching this show, so to those of you wondering whether or not to watch it, I come with a review to sate your curiosity!!Visuals:One big turn off for a lot of people is the CGI used in this show, but if I'm being honest... It was actually kind of good??? Now, don't get me wrong, I will always...prefer hand-drawn animation to CGI when it comes to animation, but the CGI used in this show, in my opinion, is leagues better than the absolute crap that is used in shows like Berserk (2016). Plus, a lot of the times the CGI actually made the fight scenes look better. It also helped that I really liked the art style of the show as well, because while it was nothing too amazing, it was still pretty nice to look at.Story:The story, while nothing too unique or new, was still pretty compelling to me, and I actually felt motivated enough after finishing the anime to go read the manga. It's your typical setup for a tournament arc, except with a slight twist. I don't really have much else to say story-wise concerning this show.Music:The one metric that everyone seems to judge anime OSTs by is if they have at least one song good enough for you to choose to listen to outside of the show, and unfortunately, Kengan Ashura's OST does not. The opening is alright at best, and mediocre at worst, and I didn't even bother listening to the ending. But the OST isn't really that bad, even if I may be making it sound that way, it's just mediocre.Characters:The characters are all likeable enough, but I wouldn't expect a ton of character development for the side characters, because the anime does cut a few corners when it comes to adapting the manga. One of the high points of the show, however, is the characters interacting with each other. The way all the characters bounce off of each other can lead to both some hilarious and some epic moments.Final Thoughts: While this show does not have the same mass appeal of Baki, I still enjoyed it quite a bit, and I highly recommend you go check it out. While not a great anime, it was certainly a decent one I enjoyed mightily, and you may too. And to anyone who didn't like the show, I recommend reading the manga, because many consider it to be one of the best martial arts manga out there.Final Score: 6 (Bordering On 7) prefer hand-drawn animation to CGI when it comes to animation, but the CGI used in this show, in my opinion, is leagues better than the absolute crap that is used in shows like Berserk (2016).

As always there is a use of a lot of bs during the fights. For example, making up, in the middle of the match, a new technique that nobody knew about before, was ever hinted, so the chosen party can win. But this isn't uncommon in the shonen genre, but having to use this everytime isn't a good display of writing skills from the author.But, if it was only that, this could have been a 6. The reason for this low score another: stupid nationalism shoved from...the author. Caricature of african american people. Caricature of international nations, except Japan, which is perfect. Especially jarring how they ridcule everything of value of other nations while simple stuff of Japan gets spotlighted. Incarnation of a technique looking like missile, incarnation of a god, all these beaten by contracting the muscle and anti-riot police, of course. The first death, of course, from another nation. Japanese fighter uses kayoken from nowhere and then kills the priest that loved his sister.The thing is that i know this is a Japanese opera but there was absolutely no reason to bring those themes in any way to the story. Stay racist Japan, as always. the author. Caricature of african american people. Caricature of international nations, except Japan, which is perfect.

However, from here the problems began with the later chapters until at least 8, which except for some scene that was truly preponderant for the story, otherwise was lackluster in the narration of the same. The high pace that the story provides and recreates moments not...as entertaining as they had to be. Luckily entering the final stretch, things begin to focus on what seems to be the true main event of the Anime that was the ""Kengan Tournament"", from here if it becomes a more solid program considering that the fights take them to a rhythm chord and give enough time to give small ""flashbacks"" of the secondary characters and convey a little more empathy to the viewer and not be so empty.Art: 8 / Sound: 8.5As for the visual setting that I read too much comment criticizing the CGI, I don\'t think it was bad at all this time, because in reality it was the opposite. Thanks to CGI, anime is allowed to give big battles with fluid movements that perhaps with ""traditional"" animation would have been much more expensive and the movements of the characters were not so attractive, in addition to giving a certain particularity to the title.

Kyuuketsuki Sugu Shinu 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50287/Kyuuketsuki_Sugu_Shinu_2,"['When I saw Draluc pop in a shitty game that has Sugita yelling ""QUEST OF SOUL GATE GA HIROGARERU WOW!"", I knew then I was in for something truly special.I wasn\'t the biggest fan of the first season when this first came out, but KyuuShinu S2 is shaping up to be my favorite comedy of the year. After overcoming the initial hurdle of getting to know everyone, you start to appreciate the humor of KyuuShinu once you know who\'s who and how they act around each other. And my word does S2 improve upon S1\'s humor and then some, with familiar characters getting into...wacky situations and new characters feeling right at home in all the mess.The series\' trademark wacky humor with everyone being a loud asshole never fails to make me laugh. But what elevates this more than the first season for me was how well it balances the chemistry of everyone with each other and constantly finds new ways to humiliate/spotlight already familiar characters. I never asked for a romantic(?), redemption(?) arc for Yakyuuken, but it ended up being surprisingly wholesome, heartwarming, and hilarious at the same time. And I\'d never thought I\'d see the climax to Mountain of Madness from The Simpsons in anime form. There is just an endless treasure trove of madness lurking in Shin Yokohama that makes you wonder just what the hell is wrong with the town.The show has it all. Expensive veteran seiyuu being cast as important characters, impeccable comedic timing, stunning visuals, and many, many dick jokes. Somehow they crammed an entire 7 minute section with nothing but dick jokes and it\'s one of the funniest things this year has to offer. As usual, the animation staff clearly shows a lot of love for the show. Including even subtle references only seasoned readers would get (such as including the butt doctor twitter manga from the author).KyuuShinu S2 is a blast and I\'m not gonna spoil all the other scenarios in the show. If you even had a passing fondness for the first season, the second season just completely blows it out of the water. Go watch it. John is cute.8/10Also maybe play QUEST OF SOUL GATE on their official site. wacky situations and new characters feeling right at home in all the mess.The series\' trademark wacky humor with everyone being a loud asshole never fails to make me laugh.

And it...is a very tiresome one in this show, where I thought there should only be Season 1 of existence, but then that the demand calls for another season, so here is where we are at...if you're still sticking around with the hit-and-miss comedy, who wants more of it.New to Season 2 are of course, new characters:- The dhampir Mikazuki being the butt of the joke whenever he fixates on eliminating pesky vampires with his overkill sword technique- The newest member of the Vampire Control Division Kei Kantarou acting as goofy on his own accord- The dangerous bloodlust vampire Tsujigiri Nagiri, the former serial killer vampire, who since entering Shin-Yokohama, is a pathetic shell of his former self. He hardens his blood into blades, usually produced from the palm of his hands.- Autumn Books' newest replacement editor Sanzu, who has a habit of accidentally using dirty double entendres when talking to Ronaldo, since she's so obssessed with him.With Madhouse's production being the same as it was before then, and the OST kinda worse than Season 1, if you, like me, have already watched Season 1 to the finish line, then Season 2 is of no bargaining that it's a must-watch. But this time, limit your expectations on how another season of side stories will make you feel. Besides, it's just another 12 episodes of the same two-fer set that's of completely no comparison with Season 1.That's it, no more John the Armadillo, though I will miss you dearly. is a very tiresome one in this show, where I thought there should only be Season 1 of existence, but then that the demand calls for another season, so here is where we are at...if you're still sticking around with the hit-and-miss comedy, who wants more of it.New to Season 2 are of course, new characters:- The dhampir Mikazuki being the butt of the joke whenever he fixates on eliminating pesky vampires with his overkill sword technique- The newest member of the Vampire Control Division Kei Kantarou acting as goofy on his own accord- The dangerous bloodlust vampire Tsujigiri Nagiri, the former serial killer vampire, who since entering Shin-Yokohama, is a pathetic shell of his former self.

Surprisingly, I enjoy this season more than the first season. Of course season 1 have its own charms on attracting me to keep watching and instantly make it my favorite series back in 2021. However Season 2 makes the series to climbs up fast to be my favorite comedy of the year. After beautiful introduction on previous season, we get more of their hilarious interaction. What makes it more amazing is how this season make me appreciate the humor of KyuuShinu and making me carving for more. Plus, S2 comedy is far more better here in my opinion....Its like they improved a lot on the gag.I love how well it balances the chemistry of everyone with each other and constantly got a new scenario with each of them either to be dumb together, hunting vampires or just get into trouble. Whatever it is, it never fails to make you laugh, wholesome, heartwarming at the same time. This season also introduces a few new character that added more spices to the comedy.Overall, I just love this series so much, and the animation is still as beautiful as the previous season.

Though sticking to the status quo could get a bit stale. A fresh face could make it more better, right?When it comes to the newcomers, they can be ranged from good to flat-out unspeakable. We have great additions like Mikazuki being the butt of the joke...whenever he fixates on eliminating pesky vampires with his overkill sword technique and Kei Kantarou acting as an unofficial partner of a former dangerous bloodlust vampire Tsujigiri Nagiri.But what holds me back from giving the second rising a perfect 10/10 score is...Sanzu: the black sheep of the entire series who lurks within the potentially sinister editorial company our beloved duo were forced to work with.As much I like her design, Sanzu's characterization could sum up more as an obnoxious, obsessive, GATEKEEPING stan of Ronaldo who desperately wanted to steal him away from Draluc and John. She comes off as rather creepy and unnerving like a predator at her first debut and she almost rarely takes a hint. Sadly, Sanzu never made me laugh like everyone else, but rather  her loathsome behavior spoils the quality. And do you know the worst part about this? SHE WILL BE LIKE THIS FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES.I suggest to watch only the best parts without her presence for this 2nd roundup until 3rd time becomes a charm. whenever he fixates on eliminating pesky vampires with his overkill sword technique and Kei Kantarou acting as an unofficial partner of a former dangerous bloodlust vampire Tsujigiri Nagiri.But what holds me back from giving the second rising a perfect 10/10 score is...Sanzu: the black sheep of the entire series who lurks within the potentially sinister editorial company our beloved duo were forced to work with.As much I like her design, Sanzu's characterization could sum up more as an obnoxious, obsessive, GATEKEEPING stan of Ronaldo who desperately wanted to steal him away from Draluc and John.

Ronaldo yells at him that ""You should have walked out in season one!""Which is when I sensed trouble, the show is self aware going wink wink at the camera. Always a bad sign.The gags here are a play on the ones from season one with returning characters and a few minor additions to the side casts. It\'s a pure gag show so plot is episodic by nature.One negative I\'ll give it is that Ronaldo went from being the straight man (if slightly stupid) to really, really,...REALLY dumb.The show has it\'s ups and downs depending on the episode but nothing extreme either way... except the finale because that was pretty bad. Oddly enough there aren\'t many references in this season.Art and animation is on the same level as season one though there are more chaotic movements here.Overall this one is for the fun factor, although less than season one it\'s still a fun show with a few standout episodes.

However it still has lots of manservice, so I will forgive it. Micro bikini is a blessing.Anyhow it\'s not that much different from the first season, the same typical set ups with occasional new characters as well as old character that didn\'t get to shine until now.Fetish pleasing wise...it\'s also the same, there are two age regressing episodes (my fetish) and Ronaldo\'s sweaty, hairy, snowy pits are as present as ever. There\'s also a bigger focus on the sideline vampires, with the pervert vamps huddling up and becoming ""brothers"" which may or may not tickle your fancy depending on if you\'re fine with NBR.The new characters are fine for the most part, Mikazuki feels pretty one note and the brown haired guy was just Handa without the Ronaldo obsession part. Sanzu is cute tho, and while I\'m not certain it seemed the animation team really liked her too as her scenes look of higher quality.Should you watch Kyuuketsuki Sugu Shinu and it\'s second season?

Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta...,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38555/Otome_Game_no_Hametsu_Flag_shika_Nai_Akuyaku_Reijou_ni_Tensei_shiteshimatta,"[""It’s time. And by ‘it’s time’, I mean it’s time for an otome isekai to take the world by storm. We’ve had so many different types of isekai these years that this was destined to happen. A show of this nature requires not just a colorful story but a character cast hammered to their roles. I tend to think Hamefura as a gift that any fan of isekai would be grateful to receive. It’s Bakarina time.The original novels gained a fan following and I’d assume popularity would surge more after this adaptation. Hamefura is based on the light novel of the same name featuring female...protagonist, Katarina Claes. She is reborn as a villainous character in a game known as ‘Fortune Teller’ and fate has it that she will die by destruction flags regardless what route she takes. Sounds eerie, right? Not quite. Hamefura is not a show to be taken too seriously despite the initial premise. By routes, we have Katarina playing her life like a game in this world with a variety of characters and circumstances. ‘Before dissecting the show, I think it’s important to watch this with an open mind. Make no mistake as Hamefura has tons of moments of comedy, character gags, and is prone to open shipping wars. Katarina is a single woman after all and the male cast is made of gentlemen of high class. In fact, many of the male characters she meets are wish-fulling guys you’d see from an otome game. Katarina is not the type to chase after them for romance because she’s got way bigger problems on her mind. And let’s be honest, she’s so dense that they'd practically have to say ‘I love you’ to get her to notice. But besides that, Katarina has a rather peculiar mind evidenced through the surrealistic court hearings we see often throughout the show. It’s a running gag that plays on Katarina's psyche and shows how her mind works in a very peculiar fashion. That’s not the only running gag as we also see the younger version of Katarina although both retains the same personality. This same gag applies to many of the other characters including Alan Stuart, Keith Claes, Mary Hunt, and among others.A big question to answer is how much should we care about Katarina. Do you want to see her avoid her doomed fate? Would you like to see her enter a serious relationship with one of the main male cast? Or do you want her life to just be normal again? You don’t need to think too hard about these questions as the plot plays out naturally. From the first few episodes, we see Katarina adjusting to her life as a villainous protagonist. Armed with knowledge about Fortune Lover, Katarina takes chances at making meaningful relationships with important characters. She even becomes a gardener as part of her plans. In essence, she’s not just living in this game world but playing it. Katarina herself is the anti-thesis of the game version of her character. After regaining her memories, Katarina becomes a humble person willing to help others although she remains oblivious to others’ feelings around her. To put it simply, she is a dense black hole. Through character interactions, we see that she tries to change her relationship status with the male cast to avoid certain game endings. In contrast to her game version character, Katarina goes out her ways to fix mistakes such as being a better sister for Keith. Furthermore, Katarina’s actions causes others to view her differently compared to her in-game character. At its core, it can be said that Katarina is described as socially gifted but an academic failure in all respects. No wonder she is known by the community as “Bakarina”.An otome also has its fair share of female characters as we are introduced to Mary, Sophia, and Maria. In the present timeline and story, Katarina builds important relationships with all of them, a sharp contrast compared to her antagonistic connections from Fortune Lover. It’s because of Katarina’s selfless nature and compliments that earns her friends and to no one’s surprise, she also gain their admiration, or perhaps a bit even more. But make no mistake, this anime isn’t fully committed to romance but rather aims its focus at Katarina at very chance. Let’s also not forget how dense she can be towards other people’s feelings that sometimes, it can seem like a meme. Watching Hamefura takes an easy mind to enjoy and honestly, it’s a show that delivers what you see.Helmed by studio Silver Links, there’s an elegant charisma bestowed upon the characters. We see the studio dress the characters into noble clothes to fit their aristocratic status, especially for the male characters. In fact, this is an anime based on a fictional otome game so naturally, the male characters has the look of bishounens. Katarina herself is also an eye catcher with her lady-like behavior during important episodes. There are episodes that depicts her as more elegant than others especially during dance sequences. It gives a certain level of mystique look to her character when she has a mask on, or it can be rather plain and simple as when she is in her role as a gardener. The world fiction contains colorful architectures, void of modern technology. And finally, I do want to praise on our main heroine’s voice acting. Katarina may originally be a spoiled brat but in the present timeline, she manages to be very convincing as a humble woman. She even seems like a princess at times and wants to be treated as such despite her overwhelmingly dense personality.Oh Hamefura. The time finally came for an otome isekai to show what the world it can do and with just 12 episodes, it managed to be convincing enough to pull the trigger. Watching this show gives me hope that more otome isekai will be animated in the future. With Season 2 announced, we're in for more of Bakarina. protagonist, Katarina Claes. She is reborn as a villainous character in a game known as ‘Fortune Teller’ and fate has it that she will die by destruction flags regardless what route she takes. Sounds eerie, right? Not quite. Hamefura is not a show to be taken too seriously despite the initial premise. By routes, we have Katarina playing her life like a game in this world with a variety of characters and circumstances. ‘Before dissecting the show, I think it’s important to watch this with an open mind. Make no mistake as Hamefura has tons of moments of comedy, character gags, and is prone to open shipping wars. Katarina is a single woman after all and the male cast is made of gentlemen of high class. In fact, many of the male characters she meets are wish-fulling guys you’d see from an otome game. Katarina is not the type to chase after them for romance because she’s got way bigger problems on her mind. And let’s be honest, she’s so dense that they'd practically have to say ‘I love you’ to get her to notice. But besides that, Katarina has a rather peculiar mind evidenced through the surrealistic court hearings we see often throughout the show. It’s a running gag that plays on Katarina's psyche and shows how her mind works in a very peculiar fashion. That’s not the only running gag as we also see the younger version of Katarina although both retains the same personality. This same gag applies to many of the other characters including Alan Stuart, Keith Claes, Mary Hunt, and among others.A big question to answer is how much should we care about Katarina. Do you want to see her avoid her doomed fate? Would you like to see her enter a serious relationship with one of the main male cast? Or do you want her life to just be normal again? You don’t need to think too hard about these questions as the plot plays out naturally. From the first few episodes, we see Katarina adjusting to her life as a villainous protagonist. Armed with knowledge about Fortune Lover, Katarina takes chances at making meaningful relationships with important characters. She even becomes a gardener as part of her plans. In essence, she’s not just living in this game world but playing it. Katarina herself is the anti-thesis of the game version of her character. After regaining her memories, Katarina becomes a humble person willing to help others although she remains oblivious to others’ feelings around her. To put it simply, she is a dense black hole. Through character interactions, we see that she tries to change her relationship status with the male cast to avoid certain game endings. In contrast to her game version character, Katarina goes out her ways to fix mistakes such as being a better sister for Keith. Furthermore, Katarina’s actions causes others to view her differently compared to her in-game character. At its core, it can be said that Katarina is described as socially gifted but an academic failure in all respects.

I thought it was a pretty good idea at first and to be honest it had a very good first two episodes or so. The setting is in an otome game---which is like those story-telling visual novel games that appeal to young women---and I thought this could possibly be the next big thing for isekai anime because of its two major differences as compared to all the other generic isekais every season, that being:1. It is a story-telling type game with multiple potential endings that all end in hell...for the villainess (MC), and2. It appeals to both men and women instead of just the men being showered with anime tiddiesTo my disappointment, this series was only good at the beginning. It was really funny seeing the MC desperately struggle to avoid her inevitable doom and they even had these cute moments of her various personalities debating their next move in her brain. It was also funny because the MC is a teenage girl in a child’s body which adds more drama and makes things really consistent with its humor.All of this, however, was lost after the timeskip which signals the beginning of the actual otome game. I find it really ironic how the MC just seemingly stops to care (or care a lot less) about her “inevitable doom” as it draws nearer and nearer. The entire middle part of the show is just her eating sweets and enjoying her time with her friends. The entire plot that was being built up before the timeskip is completely put on hold and then brought back at the final 2 or 3 episodes. It was so painful having to sit through that as I keep telling myself every episode that it will come back to its former glory of its first episode but just never does.The art and animations are nothing special either and are in fact actually extremely mediocre and dull due to the low budget. There is no memorable score either and the OP isn’t that well directed with matching the appropriate music with the actual scenes, not that any of those were any good anyway.The magic system was hardly ever touched upon (not that it mattered because of the nature of the show but if it bothers you that there is a magic system that is just there doing nothing for the most part then don’t bother with this show).Although all the middle episodes were absolute garbage, the show does get better at the final few episodes where they actually bring back the focus of the main storyline. It also has some good plot twists and a lot of character development for the side characters, but still no comedy despite it giving off a comedic mood at the very start. It’s a very unfitting genre change that can be described as illogical.The main criticism for this show is the lack of consistency with its humor where it starts off really good but just has a massive decline and just entirely disappearing really. I really hate it when a show has a good start and gets you all excited to look forward to something every week but then just turns out into a complete disappointment for the most part. for the villainess (MC), and2.

I’m glad I was proven wrong.Not only Hamefura isn’t a mindless reverse harem, it is also one of the rare actually original isekai shows. It does have a female protagonist, sure, but that isn’t that much groundbreaking (Honzuki is airing during the same season, after all). What’s different is that instead of being put into the role of a hero and getting tasked with saving word or something like that, the protagonist is instead thrown into the role of a villain and it is her...self-determined goal to deflect the fate of villainess. What’s more, this goal isn’t some end game that the protagonist gets to eventually after having their deal off side adventures – it is something the Katarina, the protagonist, is consciously working on and her main focus. This is both a point of interest as we can see her plans unfold and a source of comedy, as her tunnel vision gets her in position she not only appears in unintentionally, she doesn’t even notice those situations. This makes the harem way more watchable – it doesn’t fall into the protagonists lap, the protagonist doesn’t chase after others even though they have more grave things to worry about. Instead, it forms naturally as the protagonist has positive effect on the world and people around. It also turns out that romance not being in mind of the protagonist is another thing that might make reverse harem anime enjoyable, not to mention the inclusion of both sexes in the cast of the harem, greatly increasing the potential demographic of this anime.The comedy is actually entertaining and doesn’t get stale within the number of episodes this anime has. Story progression is present as well as character growth – that is mainly affected by the Katarina’s survival planning, to both her intentional and unintentional extent. The cast is likeable and doesn’t feel just like generic group of bishounen.

When I found out it was getting adapted, I decided to check it out. Still, I was worried that this brand new concept would be bad, but I completely changed my mind later on. It...was far more interesting then I anticipated. The pacing of the story is very good. It gives you enough time to understand the other characters but doesn\'t drag it out long enough for you to lose interest in them. The events that happen areSo I give it an 8. Of course, it wasn\'t the best and there could always be things that would make it better but all in all, it\'s very good!This is airing during a tough time, and I appreciate that the company that is making this and other anime that are currently airing (or going to air) are working hard even during a time like this. But because of this, I can\'t be very critical than I am already. The art and animation are fair. Not so good that it\'s a masterpiece, and not so bad that it\'s not enjoyable. The music and voice acting are the same case as the art and animation. I really like the voices they used for the characters, and I think that they fit very well. I really liked the OP, and the rest of the OST is quite good. (But in the end, I\'m not very good at reviewing sound and art so I have nothing else to say about them other than they\'re good I guess)Just like the story, the characters are very good themselves. I find myself really connecting to them (and by that, I mean really wanting to give them all hugs cause they\'re all so darn cute!) and it\'s really enjoyable seeing them interact with each other! The main character actually isn\'t that bad, and she may even be one of my favorite characters in the show. Which is strange for me, because I barely ever find myself liking a main character that much. I guess that\'s what the manga/LN readers call ""The Bakatrina Affect"" (or so I\'ve heard). But in total, the characters are very good and I like them very much!Now I was debating whether or not to give it a 9 or 10 for enjoyment, so would say a 9.5, but since you can\'t really do that on MAL, I just rounded it to a 10.The show is comedic enough to make you chuckle but not entirely funny. It feels more wholesome than most anime of this season and I\'m always in a good mood during and after watching it. This show gives me a strange sort of sitcom vibe and I don\'t know how to explain it other than it\'s strangely relaxing in away. Again it may have something to do with the fact that it\'s a brand new concept I\'ve never seen again but it really feels like a breath of fresh air.This show is honestly very good and far better than I expected! If you\'re looking for something new that you\'ve never seen before you should really check it out!

Who knows where this is going.', 'Whenever someone I know criticizes the isekai genre, I\'m usually there to defend it. However, even I will admit that many shows within the genre fail to progress beyond an exciting premise and end up being disappointing. Unsurprisingly, Otome Game no Hametsu, or ""Bakarina,"" also fails where many other isekai have as well.Otome Game no Hametsu is no better than your standard isekai: it relies on its premise far too much, and the plot develops predictably. Even worse, the story feels pointless with how the protagonist, Katarina, can do nothing and avoid her ""bad ending."" If that wasn\'t bad enough, Katarina still acts like she\'s...at death\'s door and in a tough predicament, only for her to solve it with ease. The plot\'s progression is virtually the following: introduce a character who triggers a ""death flag""; Katarina helps them; they fall in love with Katarina, unbeknownst to her. This setup comes off as repetitive, and due to an already uneventful premise, hinders the viewer\'s enjoyment. Now, I don\'t mind having a harem in any show as long as it treats its characters respectfully, but ""Bakarina"" fails to do so. In the end, the plot\'s pointlessness, combined with its predictable progression, leads to an unsatisfying story.The cast, while likable, are flat personalities with an unoriginal backstory lacking enough substance to be significant. This flaw becomes apparent when they conveniently resolve their backstories within minutes. Leading me to believe the backstories were mere plot devices. The author does not lend enough insight for the audience to grasp the depth of their characters. I understand they\'re mimicking otome game archetypes, but that doesn\'t justify lazy and uninspired writing. Each character\'s interactions with Katarina only consist of misunderstandings as well as activities both parties enjoy. The harem fights over Katarina while she remains clueless-like every other harem protagonist-and this denseness becomes unappealing quickly. For some, this is enjoyable, but that is not enough to warrant the praise it has received while consisting of an uneventful cast resulting from a lack of creativity.Quite simply, the art does its job by fitting the setting\'s climate. Unfortunately, the character designs are generic, adding to their already flat personalities. It feels as if they were all lazily based on a preexisting template and simply changed the hair and eye color. The backgrounds are detailed and evoke a mood you would see in an otome game. Overall, the art is like any other isekai except with a couple of improvements.While the music blends well with the premise, it\'s like any other anime and is hardly noticeable except with an entertaining opening. Like always, the voice acting suits the characters. My one complaint, however, is they downplayed the amusing jokes but would exaggerate the dull ones. However, this is likely the studio\'s fault, not the voice actors\'. The worst aspect, by far, was the ED that takes the story too seriously. The tone at the end of every episode feels out of place as a result. Honestly, aside from the opening, the overall sound is average and won\'t impact your enjoyment much.Even though I like most isekai, my enjoyment here was somewhat limited. Other than the premise which eventually became irrelevant, there was nothing satisfactory. The lazy dialogue executed the already unoriginal comedy in a subdued fashion and felt dull as a result. However, it may just not be my type of comedy, and I can see some enjoying themselves watching this show. At the same time, though, I find myself asking why I\'m watching an underwhelming harem comedy isekai when I can get an improved version of all that and more in shows like ""Shield Hero"" and ""Overlord."" Unless what I\'ve described in this review appeals to you, you\'re not gaining anything by watching this isekai.Overall, it\'s merely your run of the mill isekai. I don\'t think only having a relatively fresh concept deserves anything above a 6/10. Don\'t go expecting too much and try not to take the show seriously if you\'re bent on enjoying this to the fullest. With that said, I understand why a lot of people have given it a high score. After the first two episodes, though, it is apparent that it is another isekai that doesn\'t evolve from a unique premise. at death\'s door and in a tough predicament, only for her to solve it with ease. The plot\'s progression is virtually the following: introduce a character who triggers a ""death flag""; Katarina helps them; they fall in love with Katarina, unbeknownst to her. This setup comes off as repetitive, and due to an already uneventful premise, hinders the viewer\'s enjoyment. Now, I don\'t mind having a harem in any show as long as it treats its characters respectfully, but ""Bakarina"" fails to do so. In the end, the plot\'s pointlessness, combined with its predictable progression, leads to an unsatisfying story.The cast, while likable, are flat personalities with an unoriginal backstory lacking enough substance to be significant. This flaw becomes apparent when they conveniently resolve their backstories within minutes. Leading me to believe the backstories were mere plot devices. The author does not lend enough insight for the audience to grasp the depth of their characters. I understand they\'re mimicking otome game archetypes, but that doesn\'t justify lazy and uninspired writing. Each character\'s interactions with Katarina only consist of misunderstandings as well as activities both parties enjoy. The harem fights over Katarina while she remains clueless-like every other harem protagonist-and this denseness becomes unappealing quickly. For some, this is enjoyable, but that is not enough to warrant the praise it has received while consisting of an uneventful cast resulting from a lack of creativity.Quite simply, the art does its job by fitting the setting\'s climate. Unfortunately, the character designs are generic, adding to their already flat personalities. It feels as if they were all lazily based on a preexisting template and simply changed the hair and eye color. The backgrounds are detailed and evoke a mood you would see in an otome game. Overall, the art is like any other isekai except with a couple of improvements.While the music blends well with the premise, it\'s like any other anime and is hardly noticeable except with an entertaining opening. Like always, the voice acting suits the characters. My one complaint, however, is they downplayed the amusing jokes but would exaggerate the dull ones.

There is NOTHING original about this isekai. Actually, this is probably the most unoriginal an isekai can get, which is really saying a lot for an isekai. If you’re familiar with the shoujo genre then you’d know there are WAY too many of these manga/light novel with the EXACT same story with the exact same plot and the exact same characters. MC gets reincarnated as the villainess of an otome game and they have to escape from the bad routes. It always starts when they are children and...there is usually a catalyst for them to remember their past lives (eg. injury or illness). They are always the fiancee of the main guy who obviously likes them even though they’re too dense to realize, and at some point they enroll in a magic school and meet the actual “heroine"". These stories are so lazy they don\'t even try to be different. It is ridiculous how unoriginal yet prolific these types of stories are but since this is the first of them that got an anime it’s understandable why everyone thinks it’s so novel.Look, I get its appeal because it is quite a fun and light guilty pleasure (which is why I am a closet fan of shoujo manga). But that’s all it is, and there’s no way it deserves this high of a rating. Trust me when another one or two of these isekai get an anime adaptation people are going to see how terrible they actually are. there is usually a catalyst for them to remember their past lives (eg. injury or illness).

However, proceed with caution.""My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom"" is mediocre at best. This is your usual pleasant casual romance, fun to watch but when it comes to the story this anime drops flat.Story) Katarina is reincarnated as a villainess in an Otome Game and she has a simple goal in mind: avoiding her preestablished destiny of death. There is nothing extraordinary about the story, and whenever something serious happens, the mood doesn\'t fully adjust. When most of the...main cast got trapped in a book the only two characters that can save them aren\'t taking it seriously. It is considerably unorganized how the story can jump back and forth like this. My next point is the story also relies on its otome game premise but does nothing with it, the death flags/romance flags are mostly a device they make no use of. The escaping death flags are what brought me to this series at first. The reverse harem was fun while it lasted but eventually, it got old and it felt slightly boring. It\'s really humorous how Katarina just apparently stops to care about her ""doom” during the middle part of the series.The settings are dull, the story could take place anywhere but it\'s another genetic town/magic school/castle. For a fantasy world, they sure spend time farming and doing normal stuff. The game premise makes no sense either, Was there a design in the game to trap the characters in the book, etcHow does the secret route of the game even work out? As far as we know Katarina can\'t be changed to become friendly in the game, So how does this path unlock?Episode 10 is finally where the climax of the series is happening, the episode ends on a cliffhanger and I was becoming excited. However, in the next episode, six sets of flashbacks take place. Did we need a reminder on how the characters started to love Katarina? (especially when there were only a few episodes) This killed off my excitement, the flashbacks are extremely tedious. They shouldn\'t be recapping near this point of the series, there are so many other things to be focusing on. For example, the many unsolved questions just from Episode 11 alone - How did Katarina even get back to her real world? How is she talking to Acchan? It\'s not even clear if Katarina\'s friend Acchan is Sophia or just inside her.Characters) The story had a chance to create unusual personalities that copy game characters but instead the cast are standard harem protagonists. Katarina is entirely oblivious, furthermore, making her a complete dumbass, but that reasonably makes the series enjoyable. Katarina mostly carries this show single-handedly. The other characters have their moments that are entertaining and engaging, but also sometimes bland.Entertainment) This is where the anime shines. It\'s pretty lighthearted and fun to watch. Also quite calming and refreshing if the cast isn\'t being clingy to Katarina.Art and Sound) The animation in this is pretty good. Granted, they don\'t have to do much with it since most of the series takes place in a rather generic world. The animation is soft and solid and the characters look cute. Intro song and ending were good, I loved the closing song with the visuals. Voice actors fit their characters strongly.Overall) This isn\'t to say that I don\'t like My Next Life as a Villainess, because I honestly do like the show and I’ll stay around for season two. If you like simple, entertaining, well-made stories, My Next Life as a Villainess is worth viewing for you.----Story - 4Characters - 6Animation/art - 7Sound/soundtrack- 7Enjoyment - 6Overall - 6 or 5 main cast got trapped in a book the only two characters that can save them aren\'t taking it seriously.

At that moment she realized that she was now inside the enemy body of the Heroine....These figures are usually called Villainess in the game.With that in mind, Katarina immediately confirmed that it was true that she was currently in the world of otome games.

On the one hand, you can’t go ham on suspense and drama and give your audience an aneurysm with constant tension all the time by incessantly keeping them on the edge of their seats like a Kuroko no Basket match. No, the conflict has to be simple, laid back, and not all-too-dramatic, just warm and pleasant, not unlike a summer breeze.That said, conflict does have to exist. You need drama to tell a story. If you make that conflict too easy to resolve and forego tension entirely, then the story loses all meaning. It’s...difficult to invest in something when there are no stakes. An example of how to do this wrong is the Smartphone isekai. That one never came across to me as a story about an overpowered protagonist, but rather a story about a regularly-powered protagonist in a world set on babyshit easy mode. Everything just sort of works out for him in that world, even with little to no intervention on his part. In a way, he feels a lot like Indiana Jones in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, except, you know, minus the part where he is a cool character in a good movie.What is needed is a sweet spot between teeth-gnashing tension and meaningless child’s play. In other words, what I’m saying is that you need to create the illusion of a high-stakes conflict, and then slowly but surely resolve it in a relaxed, fun, and pleasant way. And that’s what’s difficult about it. It’s difficult to sell an illusion as believable. If you don’t sell the illusion hard enough, and if you’re not subtle enough with the resolution, then the curtain falls away and you see the Wizard of Oz for what he really is.

Then, upon unexpectedly suffering a head injury, the trauma makes her remember her past life as a Japanese otaku girl who died in a car crash at the age of 17. What’s more, she particularly remembers a dating sim she used to play, Fortune Lover, whose world and characters bear a striking resemblance bordering on the identical to the world and characters of the world she currently lives in.

You might already intuit what she needs to do. I mean, it’s really not that hard to figure out, right? All in all, it’s a genuinely pleasant and fun show, and seeing Catarina encounter characters from the game one after the other, and changing the way she interacts with them, thus fundamentally changing the way they develop as people was nothing short of a delight.If it has any weaknesses, other than being light novel shlock, it’s the fact that it doesn’t have much to offer beyond its original premise. Point and fact, whenever the characters deviate towards a side-quest that doesn’t directly have to do with altering Catarina’s fate for the better, I found myself losing interest. I also felt that the ending was the weakest part of the anime, seen as it introduces a completely new antagonist character out of nowhere, rather than paying off a threat it was admittedly building throughout its run, but never really went anywhere.

There’s also some dark magic mechanic that tries to sell itself as ominous, but I found wholly uninteresting and superfluous.If the basic premise does not attract you, then you can safely skip this, but if it does, then by all means, enjoy it because it really is a lot of fun.

You have been warned.Based off a popular light novel series of the same name Otome Game No Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta which is better known by its much shortened English title  My Next Life as a villainess All routes lead to Doom is a comedy, romance, school and fantasy genre anime that gives...us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a teenage girl were to after meeting an untimely demise be transported and reincarnated within the world of her favourite Otome game Fortune Lover.The overall story of the series takes place within the kingdom of Sorcier a country that while being able to provide safety and economic security to its people was also one that featured a deep social division due to the social struggles that exist within its society. In this world no matter what one’s ability was within society only those within the noble class can advance up the ladder that is society. While the Isekai genre in recent years has seen a massive boost in popularity due to the release of celebrated series such as Re Zero and Saga of Tanya such series while demonstrating well what otherworld knowledge and magical application can do on the field of battle these did little to show the kind of impact it can have on changing the social injustice that can also exist in class-based societies. In this, while My next life as a villainess’s story is one that focuses on romantic comedy in line with its genre and not a serious attempt to address the social issues present in its world I felt that its unique attempt to address this in the form of forging friendships and bonds that transcend social classes and in the process change the direction of not just their fates but also Katarina’s own was a unique idea that served to make me an instant fan of the series. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that while doing well in introducing the series main premise and setting also did well to showcase the unique quirks that are present within the series main heroine Katarina that serve to make her an example of an atypical noble on account of her wiliness to take on hobbies that will be seen as strange for her as well as her desire to befriend others in an attempt to save both their lives a combination that served to make her pretty endearing in my eyes.KatarinaKatarina portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Danmachi fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A teenage girl from the prestigious Claes family Katarina on initial appearances and before the regaining of her alter self-memories was seen to be a mischievous and rather temperamental person that seems to take particular delight in taking advantage of people around her. However, after regaining her memories Katarina’s personality shifts for the better. While still maintaining her confident and determined nature Katarina also as a result of her realization of the truth of the world around her also began to treat those around her differently treating them with not the pasted on fake kindness and care that standard nobles would show but with kindness, friendliness and politeness that was genuine a fact that soon allowed her to meet and befriend many new friends among her peers. While kind and considerate to her friends Katarina was also shown to be someone willing to go the extra mile in helping them deal with issues that would often give people pause a fact that reflects well on not just her preference to deal with matters directly but also her determination to help those around her a fact that I felt was admirable of her.While Katarina’s personality shifts did well to make her realize the beauty that can come from having friends and comrades that she can count on within both school and society these shifts also served well to aid her in her efforts to improve her given route in the book called Katarina’s life. Within the series, this is perhaps best shown in Katarina’s sudden interest in gardening as well as her preference to learn more about the world and improve her innate skills by learning from others. While certainly aspects that will be frowned upon by both her fellow nobles and her mother these aspects, I felt served well to reinforce the fact that while Katarina may not be the ideal daughter that they want that to Katarina this was the kind of life and freedom that she wanted to experience in her life one that was full of smiles and happiness that was borne out of having an enjoyable time with friends that are linked together with genuine bonds of friendship and trust. Overall the character of Katarina Claes I felt was one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a mischievous child who had all the hallmarks of one that will grow up to become a terror to those around her to someone that was not only kind and caring towards her friends and fellows around her but someone that will go the extra mile for them to help them overcome their struggles being especially well done. While Katarina’s atypical hobbies of gardening and learning about the world by interacting with commoners on equal terms served to cause relations with her mother and fellow nobles to fluctuate I felt that this openness, when used in conjunction with her klutzy nature, served to make her not only more entertaining but also more relatable to both the audience and to her world’s inhabitants as well an aspect that served well to resonate with the series core themes of changing one’s fate by forging bonds of friendship.GeraldGerald Stuart portrayed by voice actor Shouta Aoi is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Katarina’s circle of friends within the series. A prince of the kingdom of Sorcier and the brother of Alan Stewart Gerald on his initial appearances was seen to be a kind, calm and curious person by nature that had all the hallmarks of being someone that can be said to be a perfect example of royalty being both polite, honourable and someone that looked out for his fellows. While shown to have some degree of pride within him as can be expected of being a prince Gerald unlike his fellow nobles was seen to have little in the way of arrogance and was someone that treated others with respect regardless of their social class and was someone that preferred to work hard to achieve his aims that showed well both his determination and preference for honesty over the mind games that are prevalent within the nobility of the kingdom.After the time skip Gerald while still retaining his base traits starts to gradually change as a result of not only meeting Katarina but also his circle of friends as well. In the past, due to the training that he received as part of his prince duties, Gerald was noted to be someone that while calm and composed was someone that preferred to keep his true emotions and thoughts hidden and interact with others with all the grace and humility that is expected of a prince of the kingdom. While the training that Gerald was provided with proved sufficient for the task this also created a sense of loneliness within him as despite being a prince he had no real friends that he can count on for both advice and friendship and as a result while maintaining a surface mask that served to fool others in his heart Gerald saw his life as one that was both boring and tedious. However as a result of meeting Katarina and later her circle of friends this belief of his gradually starts to change as for the first time in his life he was able to not only meet but also befriend people who while being nobles treated each other not with false words but with genuine honesty, respect and trust and for the first time in his life Gerald was able to let do of his mask and interact with them on even terms a fact that is best shown in the playful competitions that he has with Alan and Keith and in the genuine laughter that he exhibits when interacting with his friends.KeithKeith Claes portrayed by veteran voice actor Tetsuya Kakihara of Fairy Tail and Occultic Nine fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the members of Katarina’s circle of friends. The adopted younger brother of Katarina Keith on his initial appearances was seen to be someone that was quiet and nervous by nature but yet was someone that was noted to be surprisingly perceptive for someone his age. While preferring to stay away from potential sources of trouble Keith was noted to be someone that while wary of those around them was shown to be someone that was calm and intelligent by nature and was someone that was shown to be able to see the bigger picture of a given situation quite easily which for a kid is an impressive skill. Unlike his adopted older sister Katarina Keith was noted from an early age to have the talents that would enable him to become a mage however for Keith this life-changing opportunity soon served to make his childhood traumatic thanks to a case of loss of control of his powers that caused him to be vilified by others and ensure that he was nothing but an outcast to his fellows that was better to be avoided. However, after being adopted into the Claes family and meeting his new adopted older sister Katarina the darkness that has been Keith’s life since the awakening of his powers was soon replaced by a bright light that was filled with warmth that came from being accepted as part of the grouping that society codifies as a family and for the first time in a very long time Keith had finally found a place where he can belong and a person that he can both look up to as well as shower his affection on.As a result of both meeting Katarina as well as seeing the lengths that she will go to help those dear to her Keith’s personality gradually starts to change. While still retaining his quiet and calm nature Keith gradually becomes more self-confident and becomes far more willing to both interact with others and express his views on matters that concern him unlike how he was in the past. While serving to allow him to gain no small amount of friends and admirers within the academy this development also allowed Keith to finally gain the trust of his family and bestow him the duty of watching over his dear elder sister as she goes through her education at the magic academy an aspect that I felt served to marry both his earnest desire to protect her as a brother while also allowing him to remain by her side and if the fates allow to transform their relationship into something more. In overall, the character of Keith Claes I felt was an interesting character that was pretty well designed and developed as the series went on with his adult self and newfound personality shift serving well as the moderator within both the Claes family and within the circle of friends that serve to mostly keep Katarina’s impulses at bay.Maria CampbellMaria Campbell portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of the Irregular at Magic high school and Owari no Seraph fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the members of Katarina’s circle of friends. A classmate of the magic academy Maria on her initial appearances was seen to be a friendly, positive, and hard-working young woman who shows kindness, care and consideration to all she meets. As a result of these qualities Maria was shown to be relatively popular within the academy and indeed was elected to become a member of its student council following her ascension to it. However despite gaining entry to such a prestigious body at such an early point in her education Maria instead of showing pride and arrogance as some would seemingly preferring to focus on carrying out her duties as best she could while quietly remaining within the background as if to avoid drawing unwanted attention.As the series goes on and Maria’s personality is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that despite being able to attend the prestigious magic academy that many people would only dream off that Maria’s time within it was far from being an enjoyable time for her. While certainly skilled at both magic and at handling the affairs of the student council Maria had since the gaining of her magic as well as her entry into the school had been forced to wear a mask that acted as both a shield that allowed her to interact with others readily while also keeping her protected from the worst insults and bullying that the nobles would throw at her on account of her lineage for unlike them Maria was born a commoner the very class that the nobles of the kingdom would look down upon with scorn. As a result of this hard life that Maria was forced to live while seemingly getting along with her peers Maria was shown to be wary of those that tried to befriend her and in the first instance would create walls that she will hide behind when encountering such people.However, as a result of meeting the unusual noble named Katarina Claes this aspect of Maria that she was forced to make use of for so long was at last finally allowed to retire as unlike the other nobles that she had met and defended against within her life Katarina rather than being rude and arrogant as others of her ilk was instead kind, caring and honest and her offer of friendship was despite Maria’s wariness one that seemed genuine and heartfelt. As the newly formed friendship between Maria and Katarina progressed Maria for the first time in her life was able to appreciate both the happiness that came about from being able to interact with friends who not only cared about her well being but were also on hand to help her confront personal issues that until now she had to shoulder by herself and for the first time in her life got to appreciate the beauty and joy that comes from having friends that she can rely upon and make memories with within the academy. For the first time in her life, Maria was able to look toward each new day with not despair but joy and anticipation of being able to have a fun time with Katarina and her circle of friends as they take upon the new day together.While the character of Maria Campbell was one that was both designed and developed as the series went on I felt that Maria as a character served as a perfect example of both the social injustice that class-based societies create on account of the bullying that she receives from the nobles within the academy as well as serving as the perfect demonstration of the kind of impact that a little stubbornness and a desire to help someone overcome their fate can have on opening their eyes to the joy that can come from having friends that they can both have fun with as well as count on for advice.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the style that was used within the series was both clear and made great use of warm colours that served to enhance both the locations shown within the series as well as the designs of its inhabitants. Characters design-wise I felt that while the designs of the characters themselves were relatively simple ones I thought that they made great use of bright colours, simplicity, and style that served to not only differentiate each character featured within the series but also complement their personalities as well. One unique aspect of character design within the series that I felt deserved mention was the council of Katarina’s that are often featured when their master is at a crossroads in their attempt to overcome the fate that is in front of them. What makes the council so unique in my eyes I felt was the fact that each member while being very loyal to their master also represented the different character archetypes that exist within the anime medium that serve to make each of their meetings a blast to see thanks to their often hilarious and contrasting opinions as they analyse the situation and try to come up with countermeasures. In terms of location variety while the series only featured a small number of locations I felt that these served to represent well not just the different parts of Katarina’s journey but also served to show well the many friendships and happy memories that she had made as part of her quest.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Otome No Route Wa Hitotsu Janai that was performed by the veteran pop band Angela and Bad end which was performed by Shouta Aoi. Both of these songs while being excellent ones I felt gave off slightly different feelings that served to complement the show with the former being a catchy and positive one that through the skilful usage of its lyrics and accompanying visuals introduced the viewers to the cheerful and unique noble Katarina who despite her station is someone that will make use of every available means to overcome her fate be it taking up gardening or striking up friendships with her former route targets. In contrast to the upbeat and cheerful opening theme, the series ending theme Bad End I felt was markedly different in the feelings that it invoked for while the song was dramatic and grand it and its accompanying visuals served to showcase well the fruits of Katarina’s labours in this new world for in her determination to avoid the bad end she had not only served to change her own fate but also in the process changed the fate of everyone that she had met in the world by forging strong bonds of friendship with them and tying their fate threads to her own and ensure that their happiness will remain as long as they are together in this new world.Voice acting-wise I thought that the main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support characters. In particular, I felt that Maaya Uchida, Shouta Aoi, Tetsuya Kakihara and Saori Hayami all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Katarina, Gerald, Keith and Maria respectively. While I did not cover them within the review, I also felt that Miho Okasaki, Inori Minase and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka also did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Mary, Sophia and Nicole respectively. While only featured briefly and having only brief lines until near the end of the series I felt Azumi Waki deserves special praise for her portrayal of Katarina’s loyal maid Anne as her recall of both her origins as well as the changes that have been brought on to her by Katarina’s own development as a person as she matured being especially well done and reflected well on Azumi Waki’s skill as a seiyuu.Overall conclusionIn overall My Next Life as a villainess: All routes lead to Doom I felt was an excellent anime that had among its strong points an interesting premise that presented a unique take on the traditional Harem anime via the usage of a reverse harem, an excellent story that proved to be both entertaining and heartwarming, well designed and developed characters and excellent voice acting from a talented voice cast.While the overall premise of the series from first glance appears to be identical to your standard Isekai anime that has a human being transported to another world after death I felt that when this simple premise is combined with both the series overall narrative and its themes of friendship and the changing of fates that the series serves to transform into something else entirely. For while the series is not a combat anime like other Isekai series being transported into another world is always going to be a risky affair that is full of unexpected surprises. While Katarina may have survived death in her world being reincarnated as the villainess of the story that is on the road to doom is perhaps one path that she did not expect to be deposited on. Yet even on such a path, it can be said that humanity is a resilient species that will persevere no matter the odds arrayed against them and in this Katarina’s decision to use her in-depth knowledge of the game to overturn fate by befriending her would-be enemies and forge a new true route of friendship, I felt was a novel idea that served to not only free her from the path of doom but also change the fate of her friends and the society around them and in doing so lay the foundations for change that will make people realize that social class is nothing more than a label that serves to place unnecessary restrictions on one's life and that true friends are those that interact and have fun in each other’s company regardless of whether they are from the same class in society or not.Overall in terms of final score, I would say that the series would deserve a 10/10 on account of its unique premise, excellent story that proved to be hugely entertaining, excellent characters and excellent voice acting. While only intended as an entertainment medium I felt that the series core values of overcoming adversity via the forging of friendships and bonds of others and in the process break down the social classes that separate people is as relevant to Katarina as it is to the world that we live in. us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a teenage girl were to after meeting an untimely demise be transported and reincarnated within the world of her favourite Otome game Fortune Lover.The overall story of the series takes place within the kingdom of Sorcier a country that while being able to provide safety and economic security to its people was also one that featured a deep social division due to the social struggles that exist within its society. In this world no matter what one’s ability was within society only those within the noble class can advance up the ladder that is society. While the Isekai genre in recent years has seen a massive boost in popularity due to the release of celebrated series such as Re Zero and Saga of Tanya such series while demonstrating well what otherworld knowledge and magical application can do on the field of battle these did little to show the kind of impact it can have on changing the social injustice that can also exist in class-based societies. In this, while My next life as a villainess’s story is one that focuses on romantic comedy in line with its genre and not a serious attempt to address the social issues present in its world I felt that its unique attempt to address this in the form of forging friendships and bonds that transcend social classes and in the process change the direction of not just their fates but also Katarina’s own was a unique idea that served to make me an instant fan of the series. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that while doing well in introducing the series main premise and setting also did well to showcase the unique quirks that are present within the series main heroine Katarina that serve to make her an example of an atypical noble on account of her wiliness to take on hobbies that will be seen as strange for her as well as her desire to befriend others in an attempt to save both their lives a combination that served to make her pretty endearing in my eyes.KatarinaKatarina portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Danmachi fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A teenage girl from the prestigious Claes family Katarina on initial appearances and before the regaining of her alter self-memories was seen to be a mischievous and rather temperamental person that seems to take particular delight in taking advantage of people around her.

Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s quite enjoyable but I feel as if people are overhyping it.It\'s similar to last season\'s Bofuri (incidentally, same studio) where the story is quite generic but it was somehow thought to be extra funny that the character was OP. In this case, Catarina AKA Bakarina is ultra dense and while that is funny at times, it goes overboard.The character is just plain stupid and the whole story goal of ""avoiding the doom flag"" seems kinda pointless since it should be obvious from the start that she already has...avoided it. I mean, she could have simply not got in the way of any relationship and everything would have worked out.TLDR, it feels kinda forced that she doesn\'t realize the doom has been avoided. I would prefer if there were actual obstacles on her way to avoid her doom.On the flip side, the characters (except Mary) were quite interesting and each had their own backstories and personalities which were explored throughout the show. The reason Mary is annoying is because her obsession with Bakarina is well, annoying. She even tries to get in the way of her fiancée just because she wants her for herself.Overall, a decent show with some flaws but many fun moments.I hope in Season 2, they can at least have a good story or at least focus more on the relationships between the characters, an area which was largely left out especially in the second half avoided it. I mean, she could have simply not got in the way of any relationship and everything would have worked out.TLDR, it feels kinda forced that she doesn\'t realize the doom has been avoided.

She even tries to get in the way of her fiancée just because she wants her for herself.Overall, a decent show with some flaws but many fun moments.I hope in Season 2, they can at least have a good story or at least focus more on the relationships between the characters, an area which was largely left out especially in the second half', 'Usually in harem animes I think ""Why this character? Why does everyone want to fuck THAT one?"" But here it feels justified and the protagonist\'s relationship is developed with those characters and it\'s before their ""harem"" is really established.  There\'s no leaps in logic for all of the characters to be in love with her. Catarina is a very likeable protagonist too and not just a vessel to show us the other characters. She\'s reborn into the world, not transported. So while the show is technically an isekai there\'s no disconnect of Catarina from the rest of the cast. She has parents, and grew...up in that world. The ""harem"" is just her friends she\'s grown up with who ALSO are all in love with her, secondary from their character and personality.Objectively speaking, this show is not a 10 (maybe it\'s more of an 8 or 9 to me).

I've seen anime that are better in terms of objective quality, but I've never felt a connection to an anime quite like this one, and given that I'm not well-versed in the isekai genre AND I've never touched an otome game in my life, I think that really speaks to its strengths. One of Hamefura's greatest strengths is, of course, its characters, without a definitively unlikable one in the batch. The fact that there are so many great romance options for Catarina is great...for a harem anime, but it's the fact that we get a firm understanding of why each and every character is attracted to Catarina that makes the story really shine.This is the first anime to make me tear up after the FIRST EPISODE. I went into Hamefura expecting another everyday comedy harem, but I ended up with a strongly-written, emotional story that struck a chord with me from the get-go. What really helps the show as an isekai is that Catarina isn't acting nice towards the other characters out of obligation. While the conversations in her head might give off that impression, that's just the kind of person she is naturally, and the juxtaposition between game events and real-life events as they happen makes this abundantly clear. Catarina's childhood arc was especially strong, giving me some of the best individual episodes I've ever seen.Add in plenty of actual character development, a plot twist that surprised me when it happened but was obvious in hindsight (perfect for a comedy anime), a complete absence and/or subversion of the tropes I despise from typical harem anime, story beats that don't depend entirely on the magical school setting to happen organically, and a mountain of heartfelt moments, and you get My Next Life as a Villainess, my new favorite anime that probably shouldn't be. While other anime I've seen like Kaguya-sama or The Promised Neverland are certainly stronger when viewed through an objective lens, there's never been a series that's pulled me in from the very beginning the way Hamefura has. It's definitely one of the most pleasant surprises I've encountered in anime so far, and it certainly gave me a lot to talk about. I'd easily recommend this series to anybody who enjoys the isekai genre... or the harem genre... or romance... or anime. for a harem anime, but it's the fact that we get a firm understanding of why each and every character is attracted to Catarina that makes the story really shine.This is the first anime to make me tear up after the FIRST EPISODE.

Having the MC be the villain of the show is interesting. However, none of what she actually does is of course evil, as she is trying to avoid all her bad endings from the game. Whenever she meets a character from the game, she always gets concerned about the ""doom flags"" or ""death...flags"". However, so far, all of these seemed to be resolved rather quickly without much of an issue. So far there hasn\'t been any real struggle or noteworthy drama, or even romance. I\'m hoping things change later in the season, as it feels things are going a bit TOO smoothly. If nothing changes, it is pretty bland and forgetable.Art (4/10) - Very subjective, but personally I am not a huge fan of this show\'s art direction. The backgrounds and environment aren\'t drawn the best, and some scenes are more noticeable than others. My biggest issue is that the artistic style of the environment is in complete contrast to the design of the characters in the show. The characters stand out and don\'t go together all that well with their surroundings, and it can be a bit jarring at times. Art overall isn\'t terrible, there are some charming scenes, but if art and animation is your selling point, this show is not for you.Sound (7/10) - OP is a bit bland, but not terrible, the rest of the OST and then all the sound effects are pretty solid, no complaints here. I\'m not a huge stickler for sound, so I\'m not too harsh on it. It did however lack any memorable OST, at least so far.Character (6/10) - The characters, although entertaining and charming, are rather bland so far. They tend to be one dimensional, largely because they are reflections of the game character\'s personalities. Everyone is just a bit TOO nice to each other, and there just isn\'t any intrigue or substance with character interactions.Enjoyment (7/10) - Despite a generic bland storyline so far, mediocre art, and lack of meaningful character development, romance, or drama, this show is still entertaining to watch. The characters are adorable, there are some clever jokes thrown in here and there, and the premise of Catarina trying to avoid her inevitable demise keeps me hooked. It isn\'t deep or memorable so far, but it\'s a solid feel good show atm.Overall (6/10) - If they wrap things up nicely in the season and progress with something interesting in the plot, I will probably rate it a 7/10. Currently the story and characters just aren\'t quite there yet. flags"". However, so far, all of these seemed to be resolved rather quickly without much of an issue.

Currently the story and characters just aren\'t quite there yet.', 'When talking about this show, it seems the natural place to start is the premise. I’m sure it’s what drew most people to the show initially, myself included, and I really think it’s quite good. The synopsis of the show is that Catarina hits her head and remembers her past life (I’m not quite sure how that works). In doing so, she comes to the realization that she has been reincarnated into her favorite otome game (again, I’m at a loss), and that she is none other than the antagonist of the game, Catarina Claes, who is doomed to a terrible fate of being either...killed or exiled. Despite my nitpicks, I personally haven’t seen anything quite like this before and I was excited to see how Catarina would deal with this predicament. I was anticipating an uphill battle where Catarina tries to alter the inevitabilities etched into the game’s programming. I was expecting things outside of Catarina’s control to go wrong as the game’s way of fighting back and keeping up the natural order of the game. I thought that the story would feature Catarina going to great lengths to win over these characters who are meant to oppose her by design, particularly Maria, the game’s protagonist. Were my assumptions correct? I couldn’t have been more wrong. What does the show do instead? Simply put, things are much, much easier.It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the show’s premise doesn’t matter at all. The inciting incident of this story happens when Catarina is still a young girl, before she ever truly went down the path of a villainess, and with plenty of time before she is set to meet her doom at the age of 15. Not that she needed much time at all because winning over these characters is easier than one could have ever anticipated. The pattern that dictates each and every one of these encounters is that Catarina meets a character in the game, she intentionally or unintentionally solves their problems simply by being nice to them, and they quickly fall for her. Now, if all the characters are in love with Catarina, how could she ever achieve a bad ending? Well, the answer is she can’t, but the show will continue to pretend there is some sort of danger present for the rest of the season. Despite everything I’ve just laid out, though, I do understand that the plot isn’t very important to the show. What this show really focuses on is delivering a reverse-harem rom-com.The characters in this show aren’t very interesting. I’ve heard it said that the characters are this way because they mimic the common archetypes of otome games, which makes sense, but when the focus of your story is placed this much on the characters, there should be more to them. On top of that, as a whole, I didn’t really find them all that likable either. First, there are the four conquerable princes of the game. There’s Geordo, who is Catarina’s overbearing fiancé. Then, there’s Keith, her clingy adopted brother. Next, you’ve got Alan, who is just your standard  tsundere. Lastly, you’ve got Nicol, who is quiet and lacking personality. Once you get the Expanded Harem DLC, you receive Mary, the loyal best friend, Sophia, the shy and reserved one, and lastly, Maria, who’s sweet, pure, and with the importance of just another harem member, despite being the protagonist of the game. At the end of it all, Sirius, or Raphael, is also added to the list. Then, of course, there’s Catarina, herself, who is dense, kind, and simple-minded. She routinely friendzones up to seven people at once, commanding even the most seasoned harem protagonists to take notes and watch as she somehow misinterprets people just outright confessing to her. All in all, these characters work for the laid-back, wholesome vibe the show aims for, but there isn’t anything more.The drama attached to the characters in this show is very repetitive and quickly forgotten after it’s dealt with in their introductory episode. I think Keith’s really shines in particular, but the rest are forgettable. Mary, Sophia, and Maria each have a very similar backstory, involving them feeling isolated and lonely until Catarina offers them friendship. Oh, and Sirius also has a very interesting backstory to say the least. So much so that it really is a shame when it is resolved the same exact way as usual with Catarina solving all his issues simply by being nice. On the other side of things, the comedy in this show isn’t anything great. Almost all the jokes center on Catarina misunderstanding what another character says, which is expected from a harem show. I do think the comedy is serviceable to the appeal the show is going for, but it rarely ever got a laugh out of me.So, what is the appeal of this show? With everything I’ve said so far, I’m sure it must sound like I hate it. However, I do understand why people like it, and it was one of the few shows that I caught every week and never fell behind on. The reason is that, despite all the flaws I’ve mentioned, My Next Life as a Villainess invites you to just relax and not think about those things. This show delivers a wholesome and cute experience and a pleasant escape from the real world. This show isn’t really boring either. There’s always something new happening that isn’t ever very good, but just entertaining enough to satisfy you. Watching the whole show is painless save for a few eye-rolls and even some laughter at the show’s attempts at drama. After it’s finished, though, you know that there isn’t anything more to what you just saw, and it isn’t even clear whether or not you enjoyed it while it was on.With all that said, I will be catching the second season next year. I’m interested to see where the story goes from here now that it’s seemingly given up on acting like Catarina is in danger. Additionally, I’m planning on reading the spin-off manga, the Verge of Destruction Arc, when it is released in English. In that story, Catarina remembers her past life at the age of 15 rather than as a young girl. With less than a year left and her villainous deeds already done, she might actually be in some real danger in that story. Then again, if it’s handled by the creator of the original series, I’m sure Catarina will apologize or something and they’ll all forgive her instantly. All in all, My Next Life as a Villainess isn’t really worth seeing, but watching it isn’t a bad time either. Just don’t expect anything great or memorable. killed or exiled.

Just don’t expect anything great or memorable.', 'Before I start, I want to say that there will be mild spoilers in this review. Worry not, these spoilers will be interest-catchers one way or another.As far as the clichés in the isekai genre and tensei category goes, when the protagonist dies and gets reincarnated to another world, he/she becomes a protagonist of some sort. It\'s the same with the game genre—when the main character logs to the game, he/she becomes the main character for that game.Not for this anime, though. This anime, ""Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta...,"" takes the tensei isekai game genre into a perspective...different from the usual: what if we spice things up a little and reincarnate our main character into the bad guy… well… bad girl?That\'s exactly what this anime did. Our unnamed main character dies like all other tensei anime, gets reincarnated in another world, only to find out that it\'s a world in the game she played on her past life. Unfortunately, she\'s not the protagonist—she\'s Katarina Claes—the main antagonist of the game. Her worries do not end there, because like the title—the main ending for her is not anything pleasant like getting flat-out rejected by the male route she is the rival for, for an antagonist, that is—she dies or gets exiled. Sadly.This is where the story builds itself—with our ""protagonist"" doing everything she can to avoid her ""doom endings,"" using all of her knowledge on the game. This is one of the premises that is really unique to me, as I\'ve only come to think about this because of this anime. This level of uniqueness is really praiseworthy—combining being young again, knowing what will happen in the future, and the isekai genre, going to a world different from what you were used to. They development in the story was excellent, not too fast, and not too slow. All 12 episodes of goodness to look forward to every week that passed by.The art was just amazing. From the characters\' child forms to their young adult forms, the development in style is there—the attention to detail was superb. The backgrounds and sceneries were also amazing—the colors are vibrant, inviting, and just plan beautiful, even if those were drawn in a more cartoonish way than the usual anime. As for other art implementations, I don\'t think I can find eggplants more sumptuous that in this anime. This makes me want to cook another eggplant omelette.Ah yes, the music. From the time I heard the opening theme, I was just enchanted. The OP is one of the best OPs I have heard all of these years I have watched anime. The lyrics, rhythms, and individual parts were really catchy, embedded to my mind. I even went as far as singing it every time I am reminded of it, singing along as the sequence came out. The full version is even better. Of course, the OSTs also would not lag behind. One soundtrack I am particularly fond of is the Track 15 – Sonatina (Fast). It\'s the piece one of the characters played on the piano. I actually thought that it was a classical piece made by artists like Beethoven in the past, until I found out that it was actually an original one for the anime. I had to wait in anticipation of its release.The characters.The characters were very awesome! I really like their designs and their developments, especially the yuri baits going after the main character. I like how the anime for a total harem, comprised of both genders. It\'s actually a new take on the harem genre especially that the game where Katarina reincarnated it is an otome game—meaning that the main routes will generally be… male characters. I like how MOST of the characters do their roles properly and help this show to become the amazing show it is. The voice acting also really made it better.Well, except for one. There is one character that I came to hate with passion—I don\'t think the word ""abhor"" is enough. I really don\'t like that he exists in the story, or if he did, I would rather he did his role better. Geordo Stuart, Katarina\'s ""fiancé"" is introduced as a ""sadistic prince with a black heart."" This nonsense is very rage-inducing. I really hate how he shows up at every scene with his face hinting his non-existent ""sadistic"" personality which was done very horribly. I have no grudges against any other sadistic male characters out there, but it\'s the first time I really hated a character like this. Why? Just why?Even so, I still find this anime very enjoyable. This anime changed not only me, but also my relationship with my siblings. I was able to bring my younger brother and younger sister to the ""anime"" side, and we began watching this anime every week. From then on, they discovered their own tastes and watches anime independently now. It\'s just a very wholesome experience. Individually, I also enjoyed the premise, waiting week per week to see new episodes, laughing at the comedy and sharing the pain in the dramatic moments. This proves that anime can strengthen bonds, too which is very awesome, not to mention that I also really enjoyed this even if I was heavily spoiled by an upperclassman who reads the source material.Overall, this is an excellent anime. Excellent music, excellent premise, and excellent characters… well, except ""him."" It really made a permanent mark on how I watch anime, and for that, I will never forget it. Now that a second season has been announced, I am really looking forward to watch the additional things that happens after a pretty conclusive ending… which of course, my upperclassman also spoiled me too. Did that reduce my excitement? Let me repeat: NOPE. It makes my blood more excited for the upcoming season.But yeah, this anime reminded me that I really need to learn how to draw so that I can finally create my visual novel.

No, I don\'t have money to hire an artist.', ""Some anime are great because they give you everything you wanted, and some go a step further by giving you something you never knew you wanted, but end up loving anyway!Meet Katarina, also known as Bakarina (otherwise known as the harem queen), who is reincarnated as a villainess in an Otome Game and starts off with a very simple goal in mind: avoiding her preestablished doom! She might seem on the surface like your typical isekai/ harem main character, and while her dense-ness may be a turn off for some, it generally makes sense in the context of the show, as she is expecting a...certain outcome of the game which isn't in her favor.Despite all that, in a matter of only a few episodes, Katarina ends up being a very charming and loveable character, that you cannot help but root for. A lot of the enjoyment of the show comes down to her wacky persona and her interactions with the rest of the cast, who are all equally entertaining. No matter your preference, you will be sure to like at least 1 character of the main cast. It might be argued that the rest of the characters other than Katarina are kind of shallow, however the story is still in it's beginning and there is a lot of potential for each one of them.However, it must be noted that this is much more than simply a 'guilty pleasure' or a 'feel-good' show. The writing is actually very solid and consistent with the setting of an Otome, and there is great attention to detail. The production values are very solid, too, as the production of the show was already finished before the first episode started airing. On the voice acting side, each and every VA delivers, and the music is fitting for the atmosphere, which makes for an all and all very enjoyable watching experience with never a dull moment, and with endless possibilities that keeps you speculating.A lot of this show's enjoyment comes down to being engaged in the premise and liking the characters, however, don't sleep on this one because 'reverse harem' or 'isekai' aren't your favourite genres, it might surprise you, give it a chance! certain outcome of the game which isn't in her favor.Despite all that, in a matter of only a few episodes, Katarina ends up being a very charming and loveable character, that you cannot help but root for.

Having them all be around the age of 8 was a surprisingly ingenious idea. Instead of the entire cast just being harem troupes, the show throws us into an earlier stage in their lives which gave us the opportunity to see what kind of upbringing they all had as children that lead them into becoming the way they are as teenagers. We got to see how a guy that grew up to be the typical womanizer was overcompensating for how lonely he felt as a child who couldn\'t...control his own power. We got to see how the silent broody ikemen with a sister complex developed such a condition due to the families around them treating his sister as a demon ever since they were young. The main character could actually interact with each of their backstories directly. This could\'ve been great. It was a brilliant way of having troupes but also giving the cast some depth without resorting to flashbacks...Only for the show to ruin that when it does a time skip at around the 5 episode mark. Then all of the characters just grow up to become the exact troupe they were alluding to minus all the depth and charm. The only thing Catarina managed to change is that they\'re troupes who now also worship the ground Catarina walks on. wooooooSure Catarina was still a mary sue as a child. But it makes a huge difference when the cast are more just genuinely happy about forming a bond with a friend as children than trying to get in her pants 24/7 as teenagers. I really do think the time skip was done for fanservice because obviously we can\'t have a harem anime without 4 guys (and some girls) slamming her against a wall seductively while she acts like every other oblivious harem protagonist. It\'s what appeals to the lowest common denominator. The show\'s momentum died sometime at around episode 5 or 6 just to become another slice-of-life harem where none of the characters have any personality except ""wants to please Catarina.""I hate that the show did this. It had some good stuff going for it in the beginning. The whole ""would-be harem but from before all the characters grew up"" proved itself to be a way more substantial premise than the whole ""reincarnated as a villain"" thing. The former actually presented some good storytelling beats. The latter was just a gimmick to try to differentiate this isekai harem from the 997317384 other isekai harem just to be exactly the same except for some 2-second running gags that got boring after the 30th time they happened.Of course, I\'m not saying that the second concept can\'t make for a good series at all. In the hands of someone else, it could\'ve been amazing. The issue is that this series in particular executes it horribly. First of all, the title claiming that all routes lead to doom is a complete lie. Only 2 of them do and both of them are resolved within the first 2 episodes. Second of all, Catarina being so perfect that she manages to fix everyone\'s problems just by being ""nice"" is power fantasy at its finest, sure, but offers absolutely zero rising tension for the remaining 90% of the show. I wanted to see her screw up at least once. I wanted to see her teeter around different routes based on her personality and growth, but nope.I think there was one scene with the prince-guy that I didn\'t bother memorizing the name of which perfectly summarizes this entire show. I won\'t go into specifics of the context to avoid spoilers. He was talking to Catarina about a certain type of magic that can manipulate people based on the hatred or jealousy in their hearts. This was one of the major plot points of the season. Then he goes on to say, and I kid you not, that Catarina ""has no hatred or jealousy"" which is why she\'s immune to the magic. That\'s it. That\'s the entire show and how it deals with every single one of its conflicts in a nutshell. That\'s what makes Catarina an absolutely horrible one-dimensional protagonist. If there\'s a problem, Catarina-jesus-sama will fix it.The first five episodes are around an 8 out of 10 for me. The last seven episodes are an easy mediocre 3 out of 10. According to weighted average where 5 episodes out of 12 is approximately 42% of the show, my final score would be 5.1 out of 10. control his own power.

The isekai genre is just for fluff to the story and doesn\'t add anything.If you like good isekai/fantasy or romance series stay away from this trainwreck and dont be fooled to waste your time as I was. I kept thinking there\'s gonna be...a twist. There is not. i repeat, there is NOT.There is no real depth to any characters, no real story besides taking turns fawning over MC.

That is, most of the comedy comes out of our protagonist spending so much of her time monologuing, which is represented by a council of Katarinas arguing in...her head, that she doesn\'t even notice how much all of her friends, and I really mean ""all of them"", want to be in a romance with her.With that said, you shouldn\'t expect many school elements nor a well developed romance. Mostly because of the comedy, but don\'t get me wrong, even though the comedy overshadows most of the other characteristics of this show, it\'s really fun and entertaining to watch both her childhood and her teens as the show progresses.About the characters, even without much of a depth added to them, I would say that they do their job pretty well.It\'s pretty simple, the characters close to Katarina have a different personality from one another, which leads them to different kinds of approach towards our main heroine, being it romantic or not, as it\'s the case for Bakarina\'s maid, for example. You might find them a bit cliche, but, as I said, if you came for the comedy, there\'s no need to worry about it.All things considered, it\'s a really fun and entertaining comedy, with character fitting in their roles to the genre, but there isn\'t anything that stands out.Yet, if you don\'t know whether to watch it or not, I\'d still encourage you to watch this anime.

Even the ending doom flag, feels like it was kind of forced. The antagonist had no real purpose of going against the villainess. Revenge is stated as a reason but the object of revenge was not the villainess to begin with, so it makes little sense as for why she was targeted.The real problem of the series is the MC kinds of befriends every doom flag that is supposed to appear in the years before they actually appear....She wakes up at the age of 5 which is very early to harbor any kind of bad reputation or anything of that sort and proceeds to intentionally or unintentionally befriend anyone that will likely cause her to be flagged as a villainess in future. Thus when the actual plot, the academy story line beings, the situation is such that no matter what happens, she is not going to be cast away to begin with.This lack of challenge which you would kind of expect in this genre of stories, is what makes this series disappointing for me.So, a rare bad rating from me and obviously I will not recommend anyone to watch this series being fooled by the title.

And most importantly, the series does not rely on an overpowered hero who can solve everything with physical/magical might/real-world knowledge, nor on cheap fanservice, to sell me on the story.  I consider both of those things a distraction from what might otherwise be a fun and interesting premise!The cast of characters is interesting and diverse, and I enjoy watching them interact.  And there\'s something...inherently funny about the idea of a femme noble lady taking up farming and tree-climbing as hobbies.  There\'s something charming about the way that Katarina can charm all of the people around her without even realizing it, as she stupidly plows through life trying to clear away the death flags that are already long gone.However, perhaps it\'s a symptom of preferring serious dramas over lighthearted isekai, but it bothers me a little that the series fell into the ""gamer does gamer things"" trope over the alternate option of a spoiled, haughty, impulsive character, armed with knowledge of her future, having to struggle to overcome her fate.  If she had to struggle to become close with her skittish brother, or struggle to overcome feelings of disgust and scorn to befriend a commoner, or struggle emotionally in ANY meaningful way, I\'d be a lot more invested in this series.  By the nature of the genre, though, she can\'t struggle.  She\'s playing for her life, sure, but she\'s playing to win the game, rather than struggling to defeat her flaws.  This series is a shallow one.That said, if you don\'t care about character development, don\'t mind that the protagonist is an idiot, and are just here to have a good time, this anime will deliver. inherently funny about the idea of a femme noble lady taking up farming and tree-climbing as hobbies.

Without dropping spoilers, the plotline involves the MC dropping into another world where she finds herself as the villianess of the story. From there on she tries to stay on survival mode and become friends with every character that may effect her end game.But after a few episodes you discover its a lot more than that! She\'s genuinely trying to be their friends because she\'s a good person who just wants them to have better lives than...the game could have ever predicted. So while she\'s still very much worried for herself after a while she\'s more intuned to what they need, and if that helps her along the way that\'s just icing on the cake.She\'s also a weirdo in almost every world but I suppose especially one filled with nobility and rules. She was born in this world to a noble family and yet she\'s climbing trees and learning (and succeeding) in how to make a great garden. Her otaku past hasn\'t left her, she\'s just using it as a weapon to charm people with her subtraction of the norm.I wanted to make a review earlier but I\'m not good at these and felt like others would be able to do a better job, but after having watched the 7th episode I just need to spill my heart out about how much this show has exceeded whatever expectation I had for it! It was just supposed to be a filler anime for me, but its grown to be something I absolutely adore!During this quarantine if your looking for a new isekai that falls into a rating of 8-9 very easily due to its charm, character development, interesting story, and weirdass MC this is for you!<3 the game could have ever predicted.

Unfortunately, many of these titles end up being nothing more than mediocre promotional skits for the Light Novels they’re adapting. \u2028\u2028Most fall into the same circle of having a loser otaku die in an unfortunate event and be reincarnated as an overpowered mage in another world with a harem of girls.Hamefura breaks the traditional isekai mould by having a female protagonist with rather mediocre abilities and intelligence be surrounded by attractive guys, making it one of the few otome...style shows we’ve had recently. Unlike the usual edgy isekai style of story telling where there’s a need to defeat a demon lord, save the world, etc. Hamefura is exclusively focused on Katarina’s attempts to avoid the Bad ending of the game world she’s isekai’d into. In order to do so, she has to strike the perfect balance with all of male and female members of her harem.Where the show excels is its humour. While there are definitely some serious and heartwarming moments, it’s overwhelmingly a comedy series and it does it very well, playing on traditional anime/isekai tropes. The characters all receive a fair bit of development and feel important to the overall story.It’s not an action series so animation isn’t super important, but when needed, the art and animation are very well done and consistent.Overall, Hamefura was one of my top 4 anime of the season and provided consistent comedy and entertainment. I highly recommend it even if you’re not necessarily a fan of isekai. Hamefura gets 9 doom flags out of 10. style shows we’ve had recently.

Bonus points for it having a female lead, something not very common in Isekai’s and harem series.But, after finishing the season, I can only think about what could have been more than what actually was. By this I don’t mean that the content was bad, but that it ended up being so average that I needed to look over the episodes to even remember what happened throughout the 12 episodes.After the pretty solid first 4...episodes or so, it becomes almost a slice-of-life show where nothing really happens until the final 3 episodes. Now, I don’t hate slice-of-life shows, but I need to at least enjoy the characters (or at the very least SEE them as characters).One thing that this anime nails on the head is making all characters besides Caterina feel like 2 dimensional NPCs. Whether this was the intention or not, this ends up being a double-edged sword where I like it for sticking to the otome game concept but dislike it because now I don’t see the characters as anything besides NPCs with their own psychologies.Also, while discussing how the concept was handled, I disliked how there was never even an attempt to explain why the protagonist was reincarnated into a video game (or a world that follows the same story of the video game? The anime never explains which one it is or how this is possible). This gets even more confusing after an event occurs toward the end of the season that pretty much throws all the logic about the world out the window.I don’t want to make it sound like I hate the anime, I just want to show how it squandered its great premise to make something run-of-the-mill and average.The art was pretty typical. The music was pretty typical. The world was a typical magic high school world. All this can be ascribed to it being set in the world of an otome game where cliches are common and everything is standard, but that does little to make up for the lack of enjoyment I recieved at its expense.I did like Caterina as a character though. She is the thing that held the show together, although I did find her lack of intelligence/denseness a little annoying at times.All in all, after the initial appeal of its interesting concept My Next Life as a Villaness just ends up as an average anime leaving one to wonder what could have been.It is a solid 5. episodes or so, it becomes almost a slice-of-life show where nothing really happens until the final 3 episodes.

I\'d completely understand why someone would hate it, though. I\'ll refer to this series as Bakarina to keep things short, since I don\'t feel like typing out the full name.This series is really fun, but I can definitely acknowledge it is not for everyone. It\'s a comedy series but not all the jokes land. At times it can be wholesome but in more of a corny-because-you-expected-it kind of wholesome.

Despite the two series being different from each other, I\'m inclined to say that Bakarina will most likely suffer the same fate: repetitive jokes, comedy relying on the same subversion of isekai tropes, main character is always oblivious etc etc.Also, if you dislike the main character, don\'t watch the show. Trust me when I say you will just be wasting your time. I know that\'s a given in most cases, but I feel it\'s especially true here.Not much else to say. It\'s a comedy series, it\'s four episodes in and it hasn\'t proven to be anything more than that.

I genuinely enjoy myself watching it- the humor is actually well-executed and makes me laugh, something that not many shows can do well.When starting this show I was pleasantly surprised to see it isn't your typical isekai. This show has a fun twist, one that makes me really root for our main character Katarina. The characters are well written, the art style is simply gorgeous, and the humor is there.It's certainly a very light-hearted show, one that brightened my evening...when I started watching it. It's a fairly straight forward plot but with just enough twists and diversions to keep me entertained.Katarina as a main character is also a breath of fresh air. This genre can often fall victim to the empty-main-character disease, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how likeable, vibrant, and strong Katarina is as the main girl. Her sole purpose is not to exist for love interests, and the show did a fantastic job conveying that.My favorite aspect of this show has to be the likeable characters. I don't have a favorite, and it doesn't seem like the show has any blatant bias toward one particular side character, which is a huge relief. Each and every one of the characters is well-rounded and dynamic, including Katarina (even if she is a touch dense).So overall, this show is definitely worth the watch! It's a fun take on isekais, and is doing a great job of keeping me entertained. :) when I started watching it.

Having no romantic scenes makes me unsatisfied since its a Harem but I've heard there's a 2dn season so Ill be the judge on that....in terms of characters each characters are fairly used in every episode. Although they all fall in one Person which is the Protagonist which is quite annoying since I'm single (jk don't remove this).The story revolves around a supposed to be antagonist which is interesting for a story but to implement a harem is quite a 50/50 since some people hate harem. I can say they really tried their best to make the isekai-harem work they do try their best to fit in the main characters in 1 season but they neglected some of the drama specifically the only drama scene (for me) which gets hyped in a span of between 2 episodes. Ill put this a 10 if they can just give more episodes to the drama stuff since it is important to the story. in terms of characters each characters are fairly used in every episode.

Sure, maybe the animation and characters were subpar but the pure joy this series gives you is something that can\'t be measured by actual development or visuals.Story (7)Super interesting premise. They did their very best to stick to the plot of ""Wow! I could die if I mess up!"" but literally three episodes in and those stakes are completely gone. However, it\'s sort of what gives its entertainment. You know damn well she won\'t die but she\'s still doing these crazy things to avoid it and it\'s fun. I found the magic book episode...to be one of my favorites in terms of enjoyment. They had to put story in the last two or three episodes to give it a dramatic ending. Also, those last couple of episodes pulled so many things that weren\'t previously mentioned. Catarina forgets so much it\'s crazy. It didn\'t really work because of how quick they did it, but watching this plot for the overarching story is something I wouldn\'t recommend in the first place.Art (7)Nothing too special here. The art style looked pretty standard, I noticed they use brighter colours to fit the light tone of the show. One thing that did bother me a little was the animation. There\'s always that one moment in an anime where you watch this scene and you think that how they did that facial expression or that movement was really cool. I never found myself saying that here. The animation looked a little choppy sometimes, especially in the OP. I know it\'s not technically a part of the show but it drove me nuts everytime I had to watch the scene of Geordo spinning Katerina around and in the next cut have her be completely still facing him. Anyways, pretty standard art, not ugly at all, but nothing special either.Sound (8)The soundtrack for this show is actually pretty nice. It had a lot of charm to it. One of my absolute favorites was in episode 11. It just fit so well with what was going on and did it so so beautifully. The acting was great and the characters all fit the voices really well, especially Maria. Her actress just accompanied that sort of warmth she had as the protagonist of the game.Character (7)All super loveable. Pretty much everyone was a good character. Catarina was a pretty dumb sometimes, but it\'s sort of like a loveable dumb. I really liked Alan and Mary respectively as the way they developed seemed the most genuine out of everyone. They did try giving one of their character\'s development in a very very short amount of time and to be honest Nicol sort of felt separate from the group.Enjoyment (9)This show is so so fun. It\'s a little dumb sometimes but it\'s so great. If you need a pick me up i\'d absolutely recommend this.Overall (7)From a technical standpoint, yeah, it\'s definitely a seven.

It's a tongue-in-cheek isekai that takes place in an otome game and lingers on quiet slice-of-life style comedy with an emphasis on the importance of friendship.Longtime anime fans have seen this before in other skins. I was indirectly reminded of Azumanga Daioh and Host Club, although the delivery of the jokes is notably more subdued in Villainess.Our heroine is notably not subdued. She is the best part of the series. Fight me. I love that her immediate instinct is to befriend the problem. My first anime were all battle shonen, so...I have a soft spot for that personality type.The remaining cast is a bit lackluster by comparison, even if that is the joke. They are meant to be otome game archetypes after all. Still, the protagonist is notably charming which summarizes my feelings on the series thus far.I wouldn't call Villainess mind-bending or uproariously funny or visually-striking, but I will call it charming.

YOU WANT MEAT AND NUTRITION WHEN YOU'RE BACK NOT BAKED COOKIES!The whole story is just so forced together that you think... how did anyone give this show more than 6/7 stars?Overall, don't get me wrong.

How the main character isn't reborn as a hero like more isekai, but is in the shoes of a villain, and trying to prevent her doom. I really like this and would recommend this. How she was able to grow her relationships with each and one of her friends and family. How its changed their lives for the better. This is something so unique that i hardly ever seen. Its not a...traditional hero, and yes it seems as though she was only being nice and befriending them to prevent her doom, but as the show goes on we see her genuinely care for them, in the recent episode so was touching and amazing its unreal. traditional hero, and yes it seems as though she was only being nice and befriending them to prevent her doom, but as the show goes on we see her genuinely care for them, in the recent episode so was touching and amazing its unreal."", 'This show is one of those series that you don\'t really watch for the plot.

I feel like unlike in a lot of other animes of this genre, Katarina isn't afraid of the world that she is in, she knows what to do to change the future and with that, in my opinion, it gives an more enjoyable experience, because it breaker what is expected in most of isekai animesGoing to the final point: Who should watch this?Any isekai fan, or even harem fans, in my opinion it has a little of everything, cool concept, decently written characters, good soundtrack, beautiful artstyle, and a great overall story. is in an game that shw would originally be killed in the end, and starts changing everything, it becames diferrent.The interaction that Katarina has with other characters is something special.

To this end and her status as the villainess however her dodging the doom flags and gravitating many of the main cast of the otome game also causes divergence towards her plans to dodge flags as a result namely because of her getting to the good sides of the main cast, her foresight to her dodging her doom flags becomes less precise as a result, it\'s similar to what happened with the main protagonist from Oda Nobuna na Yabou but with Otome Games instead of Oda Nobunaga\'s history. To this end it also causes Catarina in an otome game sense to steal the spotlights to the main cast\'s ""events"" due to her gravitating nature as well as her needing to butt into incidents in order to dodge her doom flags, whether for the better or worse directions, though because of her charm, she mostly gets off scot free.

Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta... is another interesting isekai anime as well as an interesting reverse/mixed harem otome game, sure Catarina is both the best and worst parts about her, but the anime is pretty confident (much like Catarina herself) in itself and speeds through in it\'s execution quite well.Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta... was more or less a surprising anime of Spring 2020 and even a close Top 5 anime of Spring 2020 for LA, LA wasn\'t expecting much from this anime but LA\'s experience to this anime was mostly positive and a fun romp and a breathe of fresh air in both the isekai elements but also otome game elements to watch through, flaws and all.""Catarina only has five brain cells.""', 'My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!""I\'ve avoided my death flag!"" - Katerina ClaesThis otome isekai anime is splendid. It knows what it is and wants to be, that\'s what makes it all the more enjoyable. It\'s not trying to differentiate itself so much but just taking every aspect of a good isekai and moving forward with them. Furthermore, it takes it a different approach with the main character \'Katerina\' being born into this world as the villain of the world. However, after getting a light nudging on the head she recalls her previous life and knows that she\'s in a...game known as \'Fortune Lovers\'. Now she attempts to try to avoid her impending doom of dying in every possible love and non-love route in this game, hence the title of this anime.Being the total contrast of herself in the game \'Fortune Lover\' where Katerina is a villain by her evil traits bully, manipulative, and rude, she sets out to change her fate by being a selfless and caring person. That\'s one of the most admirable things that I found myself enjoying, and it just ties so well with the anime. Differentiating herself from the original Katerina by picking and taking on new hobbies to help herself avoid possible death flags.Using her knowledge about many of the other characters and possible love routes, she navigates her way to escape her impending doom by building meaningful friendships and bonds with many important characters. The animation is wonderful as well, though the complete pencil drawing background threw me off a bit.This anime is wonderful and bingeable, it knows it\'s limitations and plays them with a minor twist.

It\'s still a fun and playful watch with bountiful humor especially carried by the antics of Catarina, the lead, but the simultaneous potential for depth and suspense set up by the show early on ends up being disappointing.Hamefura is powered by a great premise and a compelling twist on the isekai model: with the protagonist Catarina reincarnated as the lead villainess in an...otome game from her past life, she must now play the game of life right to avoid what seems like certain doom for her. Ever colorful and sympathetic as she strives to remain in the good graces of the game\'s other characters, Catarina is easy to root for and a hilarious lead. One of Hamefura\'s strengths is showing Catarina deliberate (with what appears to be her five braincells) upon her next course of action to stay one step ahead of life itself. It\'s a situation ripe for comedy and intrigue, and Hamfeura does a great job of this early. The show is at its best when we see Catarina\'s sometimes bungled and sometimes successful attempts to carve a new, unprogrammed route in her new otome world. The other characters in Hamfeura don\'t particularly stand out (and ultimately end up being somewhat one-note), but it\'s heartwarming fun seeing Catarina empathetically befriend them and the camaraderie that develops among the central cast.Unfortunately, what begins as a great start with many avenues for exploration loses its steam about midway through. The show keeps its comedic tenor but gets caught up in side stories and odd excursions that drastically slow down the story and derail the momentum that was building up, so much so that it almost slows into slice-of-life territory with episodes skipping forward in time to whatever ultimately trivial event happens to be ongoing. The show starts off with a lot of potential to play on both being lightheartedly humorous yet also bear meaningful stakes, which would have been a rare and exciting combination. However, Hamefura ends up angling more for the comedic vibe, which is fine for atmosphere but comes at the expense of the story itself. With all the time spent dawdling, the impactful moments in the story come very suddenly and are resolved very quickly, and it\'s because of this that the payoff for Hamefura\'s central conflict (after finally getting its premise-driven footing back towards the end) ends up falling pretty flat. By compressing meaningful events and drawing out milieu, a lot ends up going unanswered or deserving of more elaboration, and key events seem to just ""happen"" without impetus.Hamefura lays out the framework for a great show, and while it at the very least follows through with what it promises and the threads it opens up, it does so in a way so full of random detours and stalls that its conclusions become somewhat flat and unsatisfying.

Which, I gotta say, even if it had served as an okay story on its own, it's just so unnecessary here. Even to break up the tedium that the show devolves into. It's all the cliches you can handle: clueless protagonist, romantic scenarios undermined...by last minute jokes, so ultimately she can stay buddy buddy with everyone.I get so worked up by these things, because it started out SO good. This premise, that she has to avoid her death flags, and develop relationships and strategies so she survives till the end of the game is great!

The Dim protagonist is the type that thinks he/she has no-one who loves them in the entire world, even when a busload of people are directly telling them they want to have babies with them. The Dim protagonist will wail on the loneliness of their existence even as someone is giving them a kiss so deep they reach the tonsils.

It is a very interesting premise that the anime lets go of less than halfway in.The first episodes, as promised in the synopsis, involve the protagonist doing her best as a kid to avoid future doom arcs. The very first episode is incredible and over-delivers; it shows her...struggle against what appear to be events set in stone by trying *all* possible ways to avoid them.

The plot point that made the entire premise interesting, trying to avoid bad endings because everyone hated her (the villain), was resolved in the first few episodes.Since there are no longer any stakes due to Katarina having romanced everyone, it feels ridiculous when she panics and worries they may kill/vanish her.

For me, the idea and first episodes were good and it became great later on, only to face its downfall in the series finale.Bakarina was inovative, something unique in the isekai and romance genres, broke a lot of cliche and I loved it, so it was hard for me to give it a 4. Well, the ending made it possible and I\'ll cut straight to it.After 11 episodes working with the life of the protagonist inside and outside of the game, the anime had two...plotlines to solve, the Sirius one and the romance.Sirius was introduced as a mysterious, kind student who turned out to be a villain with dark magic, a perfect antagonist for this series. Yet, for an anime that broke a lot of cliche from the beginning, with a multi-gender harem and characters with an actual reason to fall in love with the protagonist, here it repeats some of the worst ones. There was no fight, Bakarina defeated the villain with the power of friendship, holding his hands for a few seconds until it was over. May I remind you they have ACTUAL POWERS and used them before? Why end it like this? You don\'t even need to think that long about a fight with their power system to see that Maria\'s light magic is the perfect counter for Sirius\'s power, it was even stablished that she was a threat to him and that\'s why he took her out. It could end simply with her, Katarina and the others using their abilities to give a proper defeat to the guy and not doing the fucking power of love ex-machina.This instant friendship ex-machina adds to the villain having a redemption arc quicker than a microwave ramen. His flashback, the reveal that he was posessed, his sudden change of not wanting to be evil anymore and the actual thing being defeat, it all happened in a blink an eye. After that, he is instantly forgiven, suffers almost zero consequences, becomes a total good guy and even gets to join the group later on.I also have to mention the clickbait brought with this guy. At the end of an episode he is in trouble and shouts that it could be the ""destruction flag"" he tried to avoid. Yeah, he says ""destruction flag"", a term ONLY KATARINA says, and when she does everybody around is confused because it\'s a reference to the game, so it implied that Sirius, like Katarina and Sophia, was also a person reincarnated in this game. Yeah, it ended up being nothing. This whole character was a giant clickbait.Since the Sirius arc was stablished only in the end, it isn\'t as big of an issue as the main romance plotline that we follow since the first episode.The second half of the last episode had potential to be GREAT, as it had the screentime to resolve this plotline since it cut off all of the villain fight. But it didn\'t. Katarina may have had 7 people in her harem, but some of them had almost no screentime and no reason to develop feelings for her, and in the end the only ones that had development to end with her were the girls.Maria may be the last one that she met, but they formed a strong bond. They had a new hero-hero of the original game duality, Katarina protected her from bullies, offered her friendship when she had no one and invited Maria to her group of friends, convinced her to continue doing what she loved, went to her house and encountered her more times than most of the cast. They also were the main ones involved in the Sirius problem and Maria went to the point of confronting and being kidnapped by the villain trying to protect Katarina.They surely were the most developed couple of this anime, and then when she confesses you expect it to be the closure, Katarina realising at least for once that one of them likes her as more than a friend and that she overcame fate, she doesn\'t need to worry about her doom anymore and can actually be happy with a girl who loves her. What happens is that Maria\'s confession is thrown in the trash right after it happens. By trying to please all ships while attempting to be innovative the story forces them all to ""end together"" with Katarina, although they don\'t, they all continue to be just friends and nothing changed. Maria and Mary, with actual development with Katarina to be elegible to be with her, are thrown in the same boat as the psychopath, her rapist fiancée, her brother and two guys who rarely appeared.And now that they all openly know that everyone loves her, they normalize Geordo\'s continuous creeping towards Katarina and the fact that Keith wants to bang his sister. And yeah, the quickly-redeemed villain.For most of the anime the harem dynamic was funny, even if the levels went down when the incest ship was true and not something only made by the fandom. The thing that totally ruined it was Geordo. He and Mary were the most ""agressive"" ones when trying to conquer Katarina, but while Mary tried to persuade Katarina to like her by proposing crazy plans and expressing her feelings, Geordo straight-up went physical. There were many scenes of him being abusive, creeping her, trying to kiss her and so, even clearly said that he wants to fuck her and the idea that she may not want it would make him like it even more. That\'s a fucking rapist, right there. For some reason, the anime adaptation loves him, even creating a new scene, non-canon, where a lame excuse is given so he could kiss her WHILE SHE WAS IN A COMA. We have to follow this talking dumpster for 12 episodes and his acts has zero consequences and he is even put as someone we should care about. He could be a better villain than Raphael if it was done right, but no, the rapist must be forced as a hero. And in the end he was the only one that got to kiss her.Besides being Katarina\'s harem, this is also a story with many characters, each own with a different background and a different kind of relationship with Katarina. So it\'s stupid that they are own put in the same level in the end. Not everything needs to be Katarina-centered. As an example, Nicol, the most random guy of this group: He is the only one with no backstory and no current story with Katarina and overall no reason to be in love with her. And no, befriending and helping his sister is not enough of a reason. His sister Sophia is the proof that the closure could be different. As a reincarnation of Katarina\'s real life friend without her past memories, she wants to be with her as her best friend, thus she doesn\'t need to compete with the others because the solved herself out.There were many possibilities, actually. Maybe Nicol could have questioned his feelings towards Katarina, Keith could have realized that he should find someone other than his sister, Mary could\'ve seen that Alan is a good guy and give the engagement another try, Geordo and Raphael could\'ve fucking died, and so it goes.As if this disappointment wasn\'t enough, they will make another season, because why not? Because this one disappointed me so much I probably won\'t watch it, just take the spoiler of which one she ends with, if that happens. Knowing this anime it isn\'t hard to guess what will happen, Maria will probably be thrown under the bus again and become more irrelevant, the season will be full of pointless episodes and more Geordo creeping and an inconclusive romantic plotline again, this time with no conflict or whatsoever, since the main story is already gone. Not that it\'s a problem, if something like this happens they\'ll just put Katarina to solve it with the power of friendship again. plotlines to solve, the Sirius one and the romance.Sirius was introduced as a mysterious, kind student who turned out to be a villain with dark magic, a perfect antagonist for this series. Yet, for an anime that broke a lot of cliche from the beginning, with a multi-gender harem and characters with an actual reason to fall in love with the protagonist, here it repeats some of the worst ones. There was no fight, Bakarina defeated the villain with the power of friendship, holding his hands for a few seconds until it was over. May I remind you they have ACTUAL POWERS and used them before? Why end it like this? You don\'t even need to think that long about a fight with their power system to see that Maria\'s light magic is the perfect counter for Sirius\'s power, it was even stablished that she was a threat to him and that\'s why he took her out. It could end simply with her, Katarina and the others using their abilities to give a proper defeat to the guy and not doing the fucking power of love ex-machina.This instant friendship ex-machina adds to the villain having a redemption arc quicker than a microwave ramen.

The series I am writing about on this occasion is one of those surprises, since overcoming the current prejudices of the isekais with titles too long to be remembered, it offered one of the simplest and most fun experiences on the billboard in the last three months.Otome Gēmu no Hametsu Furagu Shika Nai Akuyaku Reijō ni Tensei Shite Shimatta, also called as...My Next Life as a Villainess All Routes Lead to Doom !, or abbreviated as either HameFura (official abbreviation) or as Bakarina (informal) is an animated adaptation of the light novels of the same name written by Satoru Yamaguchi and illustrated by Nami Hidaka that has been published since 2015 (2014 if we count the web version that started everything) and currently has several spin off manga and a second season in production for some point in 2021. Produced by the Silver Link studio and with a total of 12 episodes premiered between April and June of this year, this series was directed by Keisuke Inoue, with the scripts of Megumi Shimizu, the work of Miwa Oshima in character design, while Natsumi Tabuchi, Hanae Nakamura, Tatsuhiko Saiki, Miki Sakurai, and Shu Kanematsu were in charge of the soundtrack.In a fantasy world where magic exists, Katarina Claes is a young noblewoman who since childhood acted spoiled and seemed destined to become the usual villain you find in this kind of world, however an accidental blow to her head allows her to remember her past life and how she lives now seems to be a setting from the otome game ""Fortune Lover"". Fearing that her role as the villain in the story will be fulfilled in this new life, she decides to do everything in her power to avoid bad endings, not knowing that her simple personality change has already done much to keep her from exile or death and she creates her own route.Hamefura\'s story is that of a clumsy girl who reincarnates in what could be a very bad situation, ""brilliantly"" she decides to try to avoid the bad endings in her destiny but is so blind to this that she does not notice how the script she feared has derailed just by being herself. There are no deeper themes or a wide variety of jokes in what could have been a story about fighting fate, but it is a comic series that shines because of how it embraces the execution of this simple premise and the enormous charisma of its protagonist. Although the latter is its greatest advantage and disadvantage, whether or not you like the protagonist separates the experience between fun and boring. Being an innocent idiot who does not wish harm on anyone, her tunnel vision does not allow her to see how she conquers practically every character in the story regardless of gender and the situations that she generates around her. However, not everything is relatively harmless comedy in this anime, the series allows itself to be dramatic at moments with many natural demonstrations of how the innocent protagonist changed the tragic backgrounds of many other characters in the story, but it shines especially when it decides to touch an idea that many of the current isekais ignore, what happens to the people and the world that is left behind? This will be a simple title, no doubt about that, but it has everything you need to function as an entertaining show from start to finish.Regarding the visual aspect, I must say that Silver Link has managed to give this series a nice look that accompanies its story along with the design of characters that are bishonen enough to be part of a true otome game, all framed in a effective palette of colors that bring this fantasy story to life. For its part, the soundtrack is everything you could expect for this series, an orchestra worthy of fantasy romance, which accompanies from the simplest to the most dramatic moments throughout the episodes. The opening of this series is ""Otome no Route wa Hitotsu janai!"" of the singer Angela, which is a joyful and sticky theme that is difficult to forget, the same theme that taking advantage of the fact that the anime\'s story is about destiny is allowed to refer to the famous Beethoven fifth symphony. For its part, the ending theme is the song ""BAD END"" interpreted by Shouta Aoi that surprises with its melancholic but energetic tone.Within all, this series is not more and it is not less than what you can expect from its synopsis, but it is done with enough care that it works without problems as one of the most entertaining isekais that I have seen in a long time, being one of the series that I enjoyed the most in the 2020 spring season - and it has nothing to do with half the billboard was paused -, I am quite satisfied with what I saw last season season. It is not one of those series to see yes or yes, but if you have the time it deserves the opportunity ... although knowing the base material, I do not know very well what to expect from the future second season ...But I\'ll cross that bridge when I get to it.

Look, it\'s not a dumpster fire, but I genuinely only gave it a 7 in Enjoyment because I had fun making fun of it (mainly the complete and total dumbass of a MC). I\'m probably going to be pretty harsh in this review, but that\'s because I\'m going to look at it from the perspective of...how objectively well it accomplished each of the criteria, which isn\'t very good. However, if you\'re just looking for something that\'s fun to laugh at, not necessarily because the show is exceptionally funny, but because its easy to make fun of, skip this review and give it a try.PS, this title is long af, so I will simply refer to it as ""Villainous"" in this review.Story: 5, Villainous gains most of its points in this category for the original and intriguing premise, however it also loses most of its points due to how poorly it gets executed, thus we end up at a 5. The premise is about a girl that gets reincarnated inside of her favorite Otome game, which is weird and hardly explained, but I\'ll let it slide, as it is all really just a setup for her to know of the fact that the character she was reincarnated into was the villainous of the game, and all of the game\'s endings involve her either dying or getting exiled, but usually it\'s death. Thus, she must tiptoe her way through life, hoping to prevent any of those endings from happening, there\'s just one problem, she\'s a massive idiot. Like, you think the average male harem-protag is a massive idiot? Because Catarina redefines that troupe entirely, honestly, I cannot think of a MC who is genuinely more of a dumbass. She completely ruins all possibility of this story sticking to the path it has lead out in front of itself. Instead, Catarina very obviously has avoided all possible negative outcomes before even reaching the point in time when the game starts, but is too stupid to actually realize it. This makes for a much more light-hearted show than the title implies, and honestly, it was rather disappointing to watch it squander its own potential.Art: 5, Drop your expectations if you think the arts going to be any good, because it isn\'t. The only redeeming thing I have to say about the art is that it is consistent. It\'s nice to see they didn\'t blow their whole art budget on just one scene, like many others do, but the rather poor overall quality made it very clear they really didn\'t put much into the budget for the art.Sound: 7, I watched the English dub, and none of the characters annoyed me, but I wouldn\'t really say any of the VA\'s did exceptional jobs in their respective roles. The OP was pretty catchy, but its also the only song I remember from the entire anime, clearly this anime just wasn\'t given much of a budget in general.Character: 6, I almost want to say the characters are kind of unique, but most of them are characters you\'d find in any harem, they just look different, because it\'s a reverse harem. Nonetheless, they are decently fun to make fun of, so I had to splurge a few points here. Also, if you\'re thinking there might be some genuine character development, there isn\'t. Half the characters are just like ""Wow, the MC likes me, even though no-one else does, maybe I should fall in love with her"" BOOM! HAREM! Yeah, I wish I was joking, but at least it makes the show easy to make fun of.Enjoyment: 7, I think you can probably tell by this point, but Villainous got the majority of its points from being easy to make fun of, and personally, that\'s the only way I can imagine anyone getting genuine enjoyment out of it.Overall: 6, All in all, I know I was pretty critical on this anime, but I feel like I was still generous in the scores I gave it because I managed to make myself laugh by making fun of it. If you have friends that you like to make fun of bad movies with, then pick this up, and share it with them--I\'m sure you\'ll have a great time. how objectively well it accomplished each of the criteria, which isn\'t very good.

However, even though I was a fan the anime was horrible! The first episode consists mostly of the main character as a child screaming, which did not capture the fun story that I liked so much in the manga. I think that if the manga was able to hook me in just one chapter the anime should as well and I was very disappointed. I watched it with my friend who had also read the manga and she was also extremely disappointed. Needless...to say, we did not watch the second episode. I am glad that this anime exists as it will allow the genre of female oriented isekai to become more popular but that is the only benefit of this badly done show. to say, we did not watch the second episode.

This can be troublesome when the main character has around 9 romantic interests. Getting to meet the characters as children helps get to know them but it isn\'t in depth. Due to the main character not realizing her friends\' feelings for her, everyone is ""friends"" with each other although they are internally competing for her affection. I admit that the show is hilarious and it\'s great that the main character has both male and female love interests. It makes the show a bit different from most harems, but it would be...even better is the main character, Katarina, was aware that everyone loves her being she\'s in a dating game and used it to her advantage. even better is the main character, Katarina, was aware that everyone loves her being she\'s in a dating game and used it to her advantage.', ""I am writing this after just finishing the series so these are my initial thoughts.I loved it! The characters were lovable, and the story was unique and interesting. Every time I finished one episode; I couldn’t wait to finish the next! Each episode was filled with loveable moments and put a smile on m face. A truly wholesome series and I can’t wait for more!However, there are some things I find myself disliking now it’s over. it started off well and built up the tension in the first few episodes, with comedy and the pressure to fix the past vileness’s mistakes with her actions in...her place. And all was good up until it all seemed extremely focused on having fun and it resulted in it lacking comedy throughout the middle episodes, with hints of avoiding the doom endings - the focus of the show - and it ends up neglecting the character development and relationship of the characters that could lead to Catrina’s doom. All problems were resolved too quickly, and the world building was hardly existent - let alone touched upon. The magic system was never even explained and the whole reason Catrina starts to garden is to up her magic, but that doesn’t happen or get explained.The aftertaste of this show is that its enjoyable, but I never truly felt a connection to any of these characters except Catrina, because she is the only one we really know in depth – even then her relationships are never anything deeper than “oh they’re nice let’s be friends”. Everyone ese just seems like a face with a backstory, they are still just a character in an otome game.Overall, I rate this a 6. Its thoroughly enjoyable, wholesome and I can totally see myself re-watching this! But it lacks substance and is just a pleasant pass time.That's my thoughts at least.- Keeno her place.

Comedy is the center of the tale of Caterina Claes, who gets reincarnated in an otome game as the villainess, and every route leads to her death or exile. So she gets determined to avoid her doom!I know that the genre of Isekai is quite full of shows, but in how many do we get a female protagonist (or will she become the antagonist), because she is also the villainess of the #isekai world.But Caterina Claes is quite a lovely villain, actually...she is a dumbhead but a lovely dumbhead, who does what she feels like doing and is a sweet addict. I love those little board meetings that she has with different personalities of herself every now and then. She wants to avoid her doom but unintentionally she turned complex characters of the game into adorable characters because like us, they also got trapped with this lovely dumbhead and her sweetness!!!Since we talked about the characters, they all are quite adorable and stylish in their design, and all the characters are great, and I can't wait for more to be introduced. The show also gives us some interesting questions to ponder upon...* If you know your future and you don't like it, can you change it the way you want?* Will your inevitable actions avoid your doom and create situations that leads to happy ending?Well, this is a fresh Isekai anime with lots of comedy mixed with friendship and romance, cute  and fun to watch! she is a dumbhead but a lovely dumbhead, who does what she feels like doing and is a sweet addict.

And i really felt that just like your typical overpowered MC in your average isekai, that this subject was also getting kind of stale. However after reading the manga and watching the anime of this particular series, to my surprise I really enjoyed myself and had a good laugh and i'll explain why.In terms of the story, it's nothing special, pretty mediocre if i had to give it a rating. It's just like your typical otome game where the MC meets...and develops relations with a bunch of people, the only thing that set's it apart is that it's an antithesis of your typical otome games which just means that the MC's not trying to slide in to all the love interests pants. The art in my opinion is pretty 1 dimensional with not much diversity within the characters (especially the males) in the view that if you removed everyone's hair the only thing that could tell them apart is the colour of their eyes, that's it.So with all this criticism i guess your're wondering why i enjoyed this anime. There is only 1 reason why i enjoyed this anime and that is the MC. first of all props to Maaya, as the voice acting for catarina was brilliant, i could tell she was very comfortable on the mic and had a lot of flexibility which is quite hard to come by. However the reason why i love this MC so much is because her personality made it so there was never a dull moment. What i mean by this is that is that she appears to be a relatable MC but in my opinion she is the most un relatable character iv'e ever seen not because she has any superior qualities, it's actually the opposite.i'm saying it now catarina must have suffered from some sort of brain damage when she got hit in the head in ep 1, because she is the most dense, thick character iv'e ever seen in any anime. i reckon she could give beetlejuice a run for his money. honestly watching some of the scenes from that show made me feel like i was kirito from war of the underworld. Absolutely braindead. watching her playing out scenarios in her head just left me bewildered. throughout the entire anime she didn't show a single sign of maturity even after years had passed between ep's. The entire thing was just laughable, and i laughed a lot.overall i'm giving this show a 6 because i did enjoy it, but that was only because of the MC and nothing else, compared to catarina all the other characters were out shined so much that they just felt bland and very boring so that's why i wouldn't give it any higher, there's also the story but iv'e already gone over that so i'll just leave it at that. and develops relations with a bunch of people, the only thing that set's it apart is that it's an antithesis of your typical otome games which just means that the MC's not trying to slide in to all the love interests pants.

But after that spell fades and you begin to come back to your senses, you realize you aren't sitting in a mansion after all, just a decrepit sewer.Maybe I'm just bitter because this anime had a really excellent opener. Proactive protagonists can make any story far better, and Bakarina takes it a step further by, as the nickname suggests, making its proactive protagonist an absolute moron. But she presses on, utterly demolishing the timeline and winning everyone over in the process, including the viewer.But...then the status quo starts to settle and the madcap pace comes to a stumbling halt. The protagonist stops taking such an active role and just bumbles through the events of the story (or the filler). The supporting cast are seemingly present in every scene on sufferance, endlessly repeating their one joke each. That's when the spell begins to fade, and you realize what was in front of your eyes all along. The character designs are good, but was the art always this bad? Was the world building always so low effort? Yes, yes it was.Read this review and see what a sad and salty man Bakarina has turned me into. I enjoy anime, you know! Don't turn out like me. Watch a show that knows what to do with its potential. then the status quo starts to settle and the madcap pace comes to a stumbling halt.

Watch a show that knows what to do with its potential."", 'Nobody is that clueless.That was the thought crossing my mind as the series progressed, that Katarina\'s level of clueless is just not believable. I contemplated the reason why and the first conclusion I came to was that clueless people aren\'t idiots, but instead simply naive, only for me to remember there is the character type of clueless idiot. Both the naive idiot and clueless idiot are popular character types, the former because of the innocence personified by said character and the latter because of the trouble they cause. It is possible to combine these two.So then I started examining it from the view point of...fandom. I\'m one to hold that isekai is one of those genre which can be judged on very similar standards as fanfic happens to be, but in this particular case this holds even more true. There\'s no getting around the fact Katarina is a fan of the otome genre, but I honestly can\'t believe an otaku like herself wouldn\'t have simply stuck with the otome games, but would have also emmerced herself into fandom, which means she would actually not be anywhere near as naive as she happens to be within this series.Particularly, she wouldn\'t be as focused on the doom flags as she happens to be, but have realized quickly that changing certain events would also in turn change the doom flags she talks about, yet not once did the doom flags change like they should have, nor should everybody be falling for her character like they are in the series, including the girls.Like, no.Not unless what we\'re watching is actually a fanfic written by the person whose supposed to be the ""past life"" of Katarina. This isn\'t to say that the idea of someone becoming a villain character is a good idea, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, but this is something I\'d expect out of a newbie fanfic writer, or a young fanfic writer.I mean, one of the things I see this type of fanfic writer doing is copying the original plot points, some times to the point they plagiarize the original series, but we\'ve a series where Katarina openly admits that there are certain scenes which are in effect plagiarized from the original game because she\'s ""stealing"" the flags simply because she is that special and the world starts to revolve around her which in turn means she\'s a Mary Sue.This type of writer is also quite fond of the ""clueless"" character type as they want their character to come across as super innocent yet they also go for an idiot complex because they want that element of them causing trouble, yet they don\'t stop and really think about what the character would be naive and/or an idiot about. They just are, to the point as the series progresses more and more, it becomes more and more unbelievable.Said writer also falls into the trap of everyone coming to love and like the character, but this one takes it a bit further than others by having even the girls tossed in. You might think this means that the writer is questioning their sexuality, or even bisexual, but no - LGBT stuff is often tossed in there because the writer is trying to be politically correct without really realizing what they are doing.Does the questioning happen, let alone the bisexuality? Yes, but more often it\'s done for the reason I mentioned, but the writers who are questioning their sexuality or are bisexual - the way they go about things is a bit different in that they would often focus on the characters they like, rather than making it all the characters.Of course, given all of that, do I think this series is not enjoyable? That\'s actually a misconception. Myself, for example, enjoyed looking at this series from the view point of someone who is in fandom, but I also recognize that this is an ideal series for those who want to self-insert themselves. I also found myself falling head over heals with the characters despite the fact the story made the characters do things, such as falling in love with her rather than simply wanting to be a friend or protector. It\'s the type of series that makes me want to write fanfic for said series, albeit all of it being fix-fic. Which does say something, I think.That said, this series will not be as likely to appeal to those who aren\'t majorly into fandom stuff, for those who aren\'t into self-inserting themselves. Instead, the series is far more likely to be frustrating and the viewer is more likely to ask what they are watching. I mean, even in fandom not everyone enjoys what we call badfic like I do, though sometimes they can appreciate a parody of badfic if it is well done. In this same regard, I think for some people being able to go into the series with this particular analysis will actually make it easier to enjoy said series, and for some it will help them decide to give it a pass. fandom.

And had three-dimensional characters, creative worldbuilding, compelling stories, and actually cared about things like character development and storytelling? Yeah, me too. In recent years, a sudden wave of novels and anime involving characters being sent to fantasy or game-like worlds drowned Japan, giving rise to the term ""isekai"" which means ""another world"" and many of them...aren\'t good. You may recognize them by several things: Ridiculously long titles that threaten to break the Twitter limit count, milque toast male main characters with little personality but are magically given God-like powers for no reason...other than convenience, a harem of beautiful girls who exist to fall all over said male character, video game mechanics, very little effort put into actual worldbuilding, character development, or any kind of compelling conflict whatsoever, and functioning as little more than male power fantasies. Unfortunately, it\'s still going, and I don\'t think it\'s going to die out anytime soon. Luckily, in the pile of stale excrement, there are some gems to be found, so it\'s safe to say that there are some genuinely good ""modern"" isekai anime lurking about, even if they\'re still not as polished or compelling as many of the powerhouses from the late 80s to early 90s. One of them is the subject of today\'s review, My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead To Doom!, which took the isekai community by storm.Based on the light novels by Satoru Yamaguchi, it goes under a variety of names, but many of them are too long, so for the purposes of convenience, I\'m going to refer to it as Hamefura. So what\'s the story? A young Japanese high school girl is killed in a car accident and finds that she\'s been reborn as a villainess named Catarina Claes in an otome game she owned called Fortune Lover. But she only regains her past life memories when an eight-year-old Catarina trips and hits her head. Remembering her knowledge of the game, Catarina realizes that the person she\'s reborn into either gets exiled or dies in all of the game\'s endings. Afraid that she might suffer this terrible fate, Catarina does all she can to avoid anything or doing anything that might potentially force her down that path...which basically amounts to just being a nice person and being nothing like the original character.So yeah, Hamefura still adheres to a lot of cliche isekai tropes that its contemporaries love so much, such as MCs dying, being reincarnated into a game, gaining a harem, and so on. Thankfully, unlike its contemporaries, none of the characters do anything like level up or look at their stats (If you want to do that, just play an actual game!), nor is anyone overpowered to the point of completely solving every single problem with a snap of their fingers. Much of the show is a gentle parody of the genre, poking fun at the tropes it indulges in without seeming too mean-spirited or overly reliant on breaking the fourth wall. A lot of the comedy is fairly character driven, with Catarina being too dense to see that everyone she interacts with has clear romantic feelings for her, or trying to do something silly only to wind up achieving weird results...or overreacting to every little thing involving the conquerable characters interacting in any way whatsoever. Several of these work fairly well, but other times the comedy can be milked a bit too much, especially when Catarina freaks out about being potentially exiled or killed even though she\'s already avoided the bad endings by...well, being a nice person and not the character of Catarina. Thankfully, a lot of the jokes and punchlines are well thought out and full of energy.The animation really helps sell the comedic aspects of the show here, showing a wide array of silly, cartoony expressions, zany movement, and bright colors. But even when not focusing on the comedy, the show is still well animated, with creative character designs that don\'t go too over-the-top, smooth character animation, pretty backgrounds, and just as much shoujo sparkle to make you feel like this is, indeed, the world of a fantasy otome game. I\'m rather mixed on the music, though. I mean, the soundtrack itself is very versatile and well done, with ominous violins during the dramatic scenes, soft piano tunes for more low-key moments, and energetic fiddles and banjos for when Catarina does something silly. Seriously, when was the last time you heard banjos being used in an anime soundtrack? But the opening and ending songs didn\'t really wow me, per se. The opening, while well sung, seems like it\'s trying to mesh a bunch of different musical styles together without trying to make them form a cohesive whole, making any transition between them feel jarring. I mean, going from J-pop to classical to hard rock within several beats doesn\'t give it a whole lot of flow. The ending song is...okay, but again, it didn\'t really wow me, and it was mostly just still images of the characters framed with sparkles.My mixed feelings continue with the characters as well. Most of them, anyway. Several of them are more developed and fleshed out than others, with Catarina having the best of it. She\'s a fun lead character with a lot of personality and charm to her that it\'s easy to see why people would like her. I\'m glad the show is at least careful to give her some character flaws, such as being rather dense (Though thankfully not the obnoxious kind of dense) and being rather reckless, so she doesn\'t come off as an overly idealized cipher the audience can project themselves onto. Plus, it is kind of funny to see her freaking out over anything that involves the game\'s progression, though sometimes even that could be a little much, especially when it\'s made clear that she\'ll never meet her doom simply because she decided to be a nice person and not the game\'s villainess. Maria, Sophia, and Alan also receive some good development, though they aren\'t nearly as fleshed out as Catarina is, and I liked the whole ensemble. Even Catarina\'s maid, a side character, is given her own backstory and personality, and from what I hear, she\'s pretty popular. Unfortunately, two of them, Geordo and Nicol, don\'t really change much throughout the series, with the former being especially notorious for it because the show is constantly telling us that he\'s a black-hearted, sadistic prince, but nothing in the show indicates as such. Anime, remember to show, not tell. All he really does is be nice, a little snarky, and constantly remind everyone he\'s engaged to her. Plus, Nicol doesn\'t really do anything other than just stand around looking pretty, and his reasons for falling in love with Catarina just feel forced. ""Hey, this random girl is nice to my sister. I\'ve found my true love at last!!"" As a result of the show not really doing anything with them, Geordo and Nicol just feel bland and woefully underutilized.Which also leads me to my biggest problem with the show. It\'s nothing that completely turns me off to it, but the show seems really intent on having EVERYONE have some sort of crush on Catarina in some fashion. From what I heard, the light novels are marketed as a mixed gender harem, which is fine, but the show seems to bend over backwards just to have every single character Catarina interacts with fall in love with her in some way, or interpret anything she does as seduction. In one early episode, when Alan first shows up, he accuses Catarina of trying to seduce Mary, even though all she did was become her friend...and keep in mind, this is a child accusing another child of seducing a girl. First off, how in the world would a nine-year-old know what the word seduce means, much less enough about it to accuse a girl of doing so to another girl? I myself didn\'t learn what seduce meant until early high school! Second, episode 8, which from what I heard is a filler episode, has all the characters except for Mary and Maria being sucked into a magic book which reveals all of their deepest desires. Everyone\'s desires except for Catarina\'s involve...well, trying to either bang Catarina or seduce her. It was at this point where I was like, ""Okay, now you\'re just trying too hard."" Why make EVERYBODY fall in love with Catarina? Having every single character do so just feels forced and unnecessary, and like the writers just want them to get with Catarina because they want them to rather than just letting their friendships (or in some cases, romance) develop naturally, and the show did do the latter in its first half! I mean, a little romance is okay, but having everyone want to smooch Catarina and get jealous if any one of them so much as looks at her, even a little bit (Though they\'re thankfully still nice to each other, so I\'m glad the show doesn\'t go down the cliche route of having everyone try to kill each other) just doesn\'t feel organic.So how does the show fare as an isekai show? Well, it\'s not nearly as compelling or polished as the ones from the eighties or nineties, but it\'s far better than a lot of the crappy wish fulfillment shlock we\'ve been bombarded with over the past several years. For one, even with its problems, it still TRIES to give the characters more personality and development beyond their assigned archetype, actually has a story, a little haphazard as it can be, and is overall just pure mindless fun. Hamefura is also one of the few shows that didn\'t get delayed because of the awful pandemic, and considering the current times we\'re living in, I think we can all use a little mindless fun once in a while, if only so we remember that there is some good to look forward to in this crazy world.Overall, if you\'re looking for some good mindless fun and a good laugh, feel free to check out My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead To Doom! It\'s funny, sweet, and Catarina will surely steal your heart some way or another. other than convenience, a harem of beautiful girls who exist to fall all over said male character, video game mechanics, very little effort put into actual worldbuilding, character development, or any kind of compelling conflict whatsoever, and functioning as little more than male power fantasies.

For one, even with its problems, it still TRIES to give the characters more personality and development beyond their assigned archetype, actually has a story, a little haphazard as it can be, and is overall just pure mindless fun. Hamefura is also one of the few shows that didn\'t get delayed because of the awful pandemic, and considering the current times we\'re living in, I think we can all use a little mindless fun once in a while, if only so we remember that there is some good to look forward to in this crazy world.Overall, if you\'re looking for some good mindless fun and a good laugh, feel free to check out My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead To Doom! It\'s funny, sweet, and Catarina will surely steal your heart some way or another.', 'General Opinion: (5,60 / 10)I expected a lot more of this premise due to the hype it received during its broadcast season, in addition to generating a good impression with the synopsis and the PV. So like most viewers, he had very high expectations in this show, seeing it that way, as a new face of the genre ""Isekai"". However, all this great promise fell apart in no time. At the third chapter we already know what the line that the story will take will be and that the other acts they will take in the course of it are very predictable as in any...other fantasy / harem isekai, only here with the peculiarity of being an inverse Harem But there is little more to the plot than that matter, which in any case does not seem the worst to me.Particularly what irritated me the most was the fact that basically at no time was it sought to give a development / depth to the characters themselves, most of them are only shown as the stereotype they represent in the ""Game of otome"" and they already add to the group without contributing any particularity or giving originality and entertainment to the series, so they only end up being one more number and it is not something that happens only with 1 or 2 characters, but they constantly repeat the process until they are fed up.So at the end of the day, if we leave aside the most important sections that can be within an Anime such as the Story and Characters, what is left? an empty shell, full of promises that were not kept. Either way, not everything is pale for me, the staging with Art and sound has been up to the task and they do their job quite well, especially the OP which is very catchy.Personally I ended up watching the anime for a bet in the face of what may come in a future 2nd season (already announced) and that it will turn around or bring more promising events. Finally, Sin are new to these stereotypes of Animes, you will surely enjoy it, but for anyone who already has experiences with it, I recommend that you do not put the rod too high with this show.En Español:Opinión General: (5,60 / 10)Me esperaba bastante mas de esta premisa debido al hype que recibió durante su temporada de emisión, además de generar una buena impresión con la sinopsis y los PV.

Sin embargo todo esta gran promesa se me cayo a pedazos en muy poco tiempo.

De cualquier manera no todo es pálido para mi, la puesta en escena con Arte y sonido ah estado a la altura y cumplen bastante bien su cometido, sobretodo el OP que es muy pegadizo.Personalmente acabé viendo el anime por una apuesta de cara a lo que puede llegar a venir en una futura 2° temporada (ya anunciada) y que de un giro o traiga eventos más prometedores.

It was definitely my favourite show of the season. It focuses around a girl who falls into her otome game as the villain with s a death flag over her head. As the villain she's never supposed to get the man, even her fated husband. However, even though she is not the MC of the game this time, her personality really shines through as she finds a way to make everyone else fall for her anyways (both...platonically and romantically); she really has no concept/compass/suspicion the type of spell she's casting on her friends. (... to this second I can't decide if it's more endearing or more annoying).I think the story -- although not completely original -- is refreshing. It's not your traditional isekai -- yet it definitely isn't real life. I would have loved to have experienced a bit more world building, or one on one relationship scenes but it seems it's not fated in the works. (Unfortunately for her friends who are desperate for her love...senpai has not noticed.) It may be due to the genre, but I definitely got the vibes that this was a B-grade anime. That said, it has pretty great animation/seiyuus and comedy. It gets a tad bit exhausting near the end as it seems like there reaches a certain point where they just give up on the story line of the world itself and just poke fun at how the MC is a Bakarina, but overall it's endearing and well paced. platonically and romantically); she really has no concept/compass/suspicion the type of spell she's casting on her friends.

I am quite the pig for this sub-genre. I’m not complaining about the anime adaptation, they did a pretty good job. No, the problem isn’t so much the anime as it is the actual source itself (I have also read the manga).If I had to give a name to the primary issue facing this work it’s “solved relationships”. The best part of this anime is the first 3 episodes. Catriona is still navigating her way through the cast of characters that she is expecting to meet...from the game. While there isn’t really any doubt that her concerns about “doom flags” are not going to come to fruition, the new relationships are new and exciting. Characters in turmoil over various hang ups, issues and trauma. Catriona shaking things up with her weird, isekai heroine behaviour.But then, what happens after the first few episodes? The main casts personal issues are solved. Catriona and her relationship with each of her coterie are now complete. Shiny and unblemished. The story then moves to continuous, rather boring exposes of the same joke, told in similar ways without the visual flair or characterisation to make up for it. “Wow Catriona is so dense to how much everyone loves here hahaha. Look at her eat her sweets so unaware!”. Like why even have the main cast together constantly if the formula of their interaction is always going to be the same old tale. What is meant to be the hook here?The final antagonist then throws a spanner in the works by REALLY hating Catriona (well, kinda lol) before he becomes apart of her harem as well. Right… “My Next Life…” isn’t ugly and it’s not particularly annoying, insulting or offensive. It’s just boring. from the game.

It’s just boring.', ""When I first heard about this show I figured it was just some average comedy trip to kill time with and decided I could not be bothered to watch it. Especially because I had important things to take care of, I really didn't want to waste my time on a show I likely wouldn't care too much about.Now, a year later, I am once again avoiding taking care of important things and YouTube keeps throwing scenes from this anime at me so I decided I'll watch it. Mind that I still thought I wouldn't care at all.The premise itself is already a quite interesting...one seeing as people with Isekai-Syndrome tend to not be the main antagonists of a pre-existing story. However, it would only be half as good as it is if not for the execution. Katarina starts out as a child and so both she and the viewer have plenty of time to get the basics of this world down. We essentially learn everything either as we need it (see the basics of this OtoGe World at the beginning) or as Katarina learns it. Those instances also rarely feel out of place or out of character which makes them fit in with the rest of the story.The story overall is fairly predictable in my opinion and the final twist is mostly obvious if you pay attention except for the details of who and why. This is executed well though and I think it's more about the fun we had with the friends we made along the way than purely about the story.Personally speaking this anime felt mostly like a comedy, having a bunch of scenes that play on the fairly simple traits of all the characters but even within those comedic scenes there is story progression and character growth. Inbetween all the laughs though, there are a bunch of moments, usually the ones about a characters past, that evoke a genuine heart-felt reaction as well. Balancing those main aspects together with the romance and some smaller ones is something this anime does surprisingly well.Now, I called the characters fairly simple and I stand by that as they are mostly definable within a sentence or two. But that doesn't mean they don't get to grow, which they do in a relatable way. Also, they are at their core still OtoGe characters so a really complex character would likely not suit them too well.The art and sound are nice as far as I could tell and I was surprised to find myself enjoying this anime quite a bit.Overall this was definitely worth my time and I might stick around to watch the second season once it comes out. one seeing as people with Isekai-Syndrome tend to not be the main antagonists of a pre-existing story.

I avoid shoujo anime unless i hear it has action or good story . I bumped into this anime purely by chance and i enjoyed it . this is the only reverse harem i can think of where i can understand why the boys fall for her , she got my heart too. ( Do i have a thing for enigmatic girls ....... i liked Muge from ""a whisker away"" too )StoryWhat happens when a girl get reincarnated ? the answer is WATCH THIS ANIME!!!ArtGreat animation awesome colors....CharacterOther than the first episode there is not much character development for the heroine .  All the rest of the characters only develop within the episode they are introduced in.English DubI honestly thought this anime would have better dub to be honest  . not much effort was put into trying to match character and voice actor.Enjoymentother than episode 9 and the first half of the last episode (which i found very cheesy ) the rest was awesome CharacterOther than the first episode there is not much character development for the heroine .

I really enjoy otome games, so obviously I have to watch this. Sadly, I must say I was a bit disappointed. I guess I expected a little more otome and a little less Isekai.-STORY-The absolute weakest part of the show. The premise is great and does most of the heavy lifting to make this show interesting, which is never a good thing. I think they really wasted the premise, because if they had made it more essential to the rest of...the story, it could've really made for some interesting scenarios. A good example for that would be ReZero, where the initial premise keeps being important to the story and the character development.The first few episodes do this by showing us how Catherina is changing the people around her with her kind nature, which is really interesting! But after she has changed everybody it just turns in a regular old isekai anime. The type where you can take out any kind of gimmick the show might have had and nothing would've changed.The setting doesn't mean shit. It's like a fantasy setting, but nothing is done as far as world building is concerned, ESPECIALLY once they get to the school. Which also, the school only introduces tired cliches into the story which it really didn't need. They could've made the school setting more important to the story without using these annoying tropes, think Little Witch Academia, but why would you if you only need it as an excuse to why these characters are together all the time.Don't really find it all too funny either, I don't feel like there were a lot of attempts at jokes either. What saved it for me was the pacing for the most part. Like, not the actual pacing of the story progression, because that is basically beginning, episodes of padding and a conclusion at the end, which I really dislike, but the scene to scene pacing, which when done well, will make any show watchable.Obvious twist is obvious.-ART-Very standard. Now, to me, one of the most important things in any otome is the character designs. I really hate it when an otome game is comprised of just the most boring looking people. It's almost more important to me than the actual personality of the character. (I know, how shallow of me! But don't expect better of otome fans lol)In this show the character designs are... distinctive enough? They aren't interesting in my opinion, but they aren't as boring as some otome games can be. Which to be fair says more about otome games than it does about Isekai, because these designs are definitely more isekai then they are otome.Once again, I should've expected more isekai than otome, but here we are.-SOUND-Don't like the opening, skipped the ending most of the time, the soundtrack never bothered me and the voice acting didn't either. I'm not an expert on this field, so I'll leave it at that.WAIT- ONE OF THE SONGS ON THE SOUNDTRACK REALLY SOUNDS LIKE YOSHIKAGE KIRAS THEME AND I JUST REALISED WHILE WATCHING THE LAST EPISODE-okay that's all.-CHARACTER-The MOST important thing in any otome game; the love interests. What is their gimmick/trope, how are they unique, what are their flaws, what do they think of the main character? That is what makes good otome games interesting in my opinion; a nice balance between enjoyable tropes and emotional character development.Well, I was wrong to expect this from this anime, because this show isn't an otome type of show. It is a reverse harem isekai show and it plays out like most harem shows. The characters meet the main character, their lives are bettered by them and then they fall in love and tag along with the harem conga line. Not my thing.Ironically enough, Catherina is my favourite character of the main cast. You do kind of root for her, but all the other characters I just end up really tired with. I get it, the main character is your sole motivation and the only character you ever want to speak with.Seriously, none of the love interests have that much of a dynamic going on besides for the first few episodes. It's all about Catherina and what she wants, which just really kills any dynamic this show could have had.I don't think the characters are awful, but the lack of interesting dynamic to any of the other characters combined with all their development happening at the utmost beginning of the show really makes them feel flat. Like they only ever talk about how they love Catherina, how is that interesting?-ENJOYEMENT-Boring ending to a show that had a lot more opportunity. I think it's kind of funny how this show basically appropriates otome games to make a super standard isekai story.Now to list the good parts all in one place, since most of my points are negative: interesting setting and good first few episodes, scenes don't drag on for too long and Catherina is an enjoyable character, you really want to root fo her succes. Just as many female love interests as there are male ones, if that is something you're looking for.Final verdict: reverse harem/10.

Hamefura was NOT on my list of potential favorites this season. Man oh man was I wrong! It has turned out to be such a pleasant surprise that caters to everything I wanted and needed and loved and didn't know that I did. This show delivers when I didn't even order.I won't summarize since the page already has a summary, but I think that this is such a unique direction to take an isekai in. And I know many people would agree with me on that! We're used to isekai being about carnage and falling into a world that's filled with dangers and monsters...and high stakes drama. And while some of them are amazing (still looking forward to the Re:zero sequel) some of them... not so much. It can be so tiring of watching a show that's just about gore and war.Which is definitely why there has been a surge of lighthearted, fun isekai anime to choose from. However, Hamefura stands out from the others in that the world the protagonist falls into is... a dating sim. An otome game. For a girl otaku, this should be heaven right? (Unless you're a lesbian like me, but honestly this show has been catering to me in that department too, but we'll get to that.)It should be heaven. But Katerina is the RIVAL CHARACTER. Not the protagonist. And if you're familiar with dating sims, that's usually bad news. Dating sims - particularly Japanese Otome games are BRUTAL. Absolutely dark and wild sometimes. Even the good endings can mean some bad ends for the rival.This show would be interesting even if Katerina was the intended protagonist! She's just such an interesting and fun character anyway, but added with the premise and the rest of the cast, the chemistry is amazing. The cast is filled with the usual stereotypical otome game romance route types with fun little twists to them. And, even if they're pandering, I appreciate the girl character's appreciation for Katerina. Won't spoil much but... there's no way all the characters are straight. And that's definitely a winning factor for me.All in all, it's just such an endearing and lovely show to get into. It made me binge the manga that I didn't even know existed because I could not get enough.

One day changed after getting a hit on her head, by tripping her leg and falling on the ground. Now she is energetic, humble and caring. Why did she change?...well because she regained her memories of her previous life.Yes, another transfer to another world anime spotted.Story - The story is - ""Fortune Lover"" which actually was a game in"" Katarina Claes"" previous life, has become her new reality, she has been reincarnated in this new world as a villainess. And after regaining her previous life memory she\'s been trying to avoid any bad ending flag which will lead her to her doom by doing everything in her power based on her experience, knowledge of her previous life game which she used to play.The Story is based on a game story which is now has turned into a different story. We known what the actual game story is but by avoiding those bad ending flags which will lead Katarina Claes to a bad ending, the story has taken a different route and ending. I like how the story has turned out, Not just ending but also how other events with different characters have turned out, which are somewhat funny. The comedy, story flow, character involvement everything is done nicely and well, with no risk taken in anime, what I mean is the scenes in which ""Katarina"" does and says other character\'s lines.Story - 8/10Art, Sound and Characters - art and animation are done nicely and smoothly and are beautiful.Sound and music are also done really well, I really liked the opening theme plus some of those background funny and chill music. Character work are also done really well, every character is funny and interesting one or in some way. Plus we have seen a reverse harem here which is kind of not my thing but I liked the little bit romance part, not much of intense stuff.Art (animation) - 8/10Sound - 7/10Characters - 8/10Enjoyment - as for enjoyment, I enjoyed most of the parts in anime, plus I also liked episode 9 which shows us how good personality she has now. Also liked how Katarina Claes plans every part but when actually time comes she unknowingly does what she does not mean to and realize later that she has done something which she doesn\'t mean to. which I found funny (dense xD)Enjoyment - 8/10Overall - 8/10 well because she regained her memories of her previous life.Yes, another transfer to another world anime spotted.Story - The story is - ""Fortune Lover"" which actually was a game in"" Katarina Claes"" previous life, has become her new reality, she has been reincarnated in this new world as a villainess.

This was too short. It needed to be longer in order to actually expand upon a lot of these characters. It felt somewhat like Clannad. You address someone's backstory, then they fall to the background. Then, they just reappear for the group. The premise of the story feels somewhat clickbaity compared to what it actually is.You would imagine it would be a story about a isekai'd girl trying to avoid certain death. She would have to actually think and apply herself to get out of certain situations. Maybe it would have...been better if she came into this world mid-bullying rather than several years prior. But, she's a fool who only cares about food/books and stumbles upon situations. She overthinks things and is far more dense than even your typical shonen protagonist. My main issue with the series has to be the fact that her character is incredibly dumb. If any real person was put in this very situation, we would have probably caught on immediately. She read manga and watched anime in her past life, so my statement stands.As for the pros, I gotta say wow. I binged all of it in one sitting. I actually found myself much more invested in the side characters and their backstories than the protagonist herself. She's sort of like a Mary Sue, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. She stumbles upon situations that happen to resolve everything or completely set her up for success. Everyone loves her (rightfully so). The one thing that actually surprised me was that she genuinely had no OP ability at all. Yet, she actually relies on charisma and pure luck to get her through these situations. It made for a very refreshing isekai experience.I don't need to be surprised from expert level story telling. I don't need to be blown away a genius's unpredictable writing. Sometimes it's good to just sit back, relax, and know exactly what's coming.Even if the story was meh and the characters felt sometimes very one dimensional, I enjoyed it. It's 12 episodes, so you can't really expect them to flesh out 8 characters with this type of premise. Which is why I'll argue it would have probably been a 10 had it been longer. been better if she came into this world mid-bullying rather than several years prior.

Maybe i'm a bit biased since this anime is themed around two of my favorite things. In all honesty though it is pretty rare to find genuinely well produced reverse harem, due to how little there are compared to the normal harem counterpart.My Next Life as a Villaness is a unique anime with not your usual cliches, along with the surprising Isekai theme. The story follows a nerdy girl who must live in a world of an otome game she once played in her past life. One...of my favorite things about this anime is that there is a strong female lead. One where there's a decently smart individual with power, the power to conquer hearts. Unlike most Isekai's these characters aren't over powered in the sense of skills nor smarts so to say. While each character can be a bit of a ditz, naive or gullible, it isn't overwhelming and well balanced. The character design and animation is well done, simplistic, cute females and males, and finally, a female that has a forehead!Overall this is an easily enjoyable anime for a casual watcher. For those who actively seeks out good otomes and reverse harems, this one will not disappoint. of my favorite things about this anime is that there is a strong female lead.

It is nice to have it. Even before I finished it, I finished manga. So I knew in advance, this anime has no content. I dont mean to say it is a bad anime, just that praising it for anything else than being fresh might need some strong argumentation.The reason is, that story ended first episode after school started. You might notice MP doesnt develop. At all. In manga, it is even worse, because there are some 2. season chapters, that let you know,...she wont ever grow. Entire growth comes from her group of romantic harem friends. And yes, if you are one of those that are loosing your hair how male MP cant choose one girl ... this one is better. Because those girls AND boys do grow instead of MP. It is nice. But also, their growth ends when they come to school along with their powerlessness to explain to MP they do love her, like for real. The last one to join is Maria.There is also final one who is also final boss ... but his conflict could be solved on his own. It is like he was in a game, waiting for MP to come along and save him, but ... if you remember, that is usually a PROBLEM that games have and why movies try to avoid it. This is anime made as a game, repeating same in-game solutions to game structure that doesnt occur in real life. And love will save the day ... let me repair your life in 1 minute of talking nicely with you. It is weak and for most part pointless, even if true to source material. Animators knew that, which is why they started pulling endings out of MP's ass which she didnt know about just an episode ago. Friendship ending, reverse harem ending, hidden character ending ... it is almost as if author was desperately searching for a reason to continue this story, give it meaning, but forgot his main problem. MP and her group stopped growing long ago. Because she is dumb? Unbelievably dumb? Or just because you wrote her as such.So, nice anime, I liked it when I wasnt too angry how much wasted potential it has.

Everything is glamorous, even Katarina\'s vegetable bouquets.- Many of the characters have a good backstory, making you feel connected to them.- Reverse Harem- Short enough to finish in one sitting without dragging on. Long enough to keep viewers engaged and add an alright plot.The Bad:- Reverse Harem that had the most engaging moments during their child years with the exception of one other episode later in the series.- Mary. Her voice and personality were just too much at times....The Ugly:- Katarina is absolutely brain dead. I understand that her idiocy is meant to be a part of her charm but honestly, it just made things hard to chew. It didn\'t really add much towards the comedy in the show and left me feeling frustrated on so many occasions.- The show revolves around sweets. Katarina\'s obsession towards sweets felt like the main premise most of the time for the show. I don\'t think there was a single episode that didn\'t involve Katarina stuffing her face with an absurd amount of sugar and eventually it began to feel as though the title should have been renamed ""My life as an oblivious sugarholic""- Despite Mary being the protagonist of the game and the one who sets off Katarina\'s doom flags she becomes another Katarina groupie and doesn\'t really contribute to the story at all. In the beginning, viewers get hyped up about how much Maria could destroy Katarina but instead .... were given a whole lot of nothing. So many missed opportunities.Otome Game is an Isekai different from what you would normally expect. Instead of your typical male lead that inevitably becomes an over powered babe magnet, we have Katarina - or rather - ""Bakarina"" Claes.After being placed in the body of ""Fortune Lovers"" main villainess, Katarina must avoid her death flags at all cost to avoid execution or exile and what better way to do this than by doing the opposite of ""Fortune Lovers"" antagonists\' actions. With prior knowledge of the games backstory, Katarina does all that she can to befriend each of the conquerable characters to avoid the inevitable \'bad ending; and in doing so, this isekai becomes a reverse-harem....for dummies.The first two episodes of this anime were great. There were plenty of funny, heart-warming moments however after the time leap I found those moments begun to wear thin. Although some comedy was still present, a majority of the anime centered around Katarina\'s addiction to all things sweet, her gardening, and just how little braincells she has (5 to be exact).I really wanted to enjoy the full thing, liking the bold idea of making a different type of isekai but instead was left feeling frustrated and finding it hard to finish the series. Maybe it has partially to do with the fact that this anime is also a reverse-harem filled to the brim with attractive male and female characters but lacking in those cutesy, make you squeal in the most fangirly/cringy way possible, moments between our MC and the possible bachelor/bachelorettes. Maybe it was due to the lack of conflict despite there being magic, royals, and one sided love triangles.

The other cast members may be somewhat underdeveloped, but they don\'t carry enough of each episode that this becomes a problem; it is fun to watch them interact with the MC and each other nonetheless.

The first few episodes are in childhood and show the lead making an actual effort to become friends with the other characters. Unfortunately, afterwards all these other characters seem entirely relegated to just mooning over the lead and how great she is but without any actual additional effort on her part. All the time the lead is ridiculously dense about seeing other people\'s feelings for her. She takes the premise of the show seriously - that she\'s doomed due to being a villain in...other people\'s story - even when clearly the show has derailed from the story of the game.To be clear, I actually LOVE shows where the lead just wins everybody over with the power of friendship. But pretty quickly the show forgets that you have to actually give the lead good dialogue and make them be someone worth being friends with. The lead here spends a lot of time just eating sweets and making other people help her out. She\'s not unlikeable but she\'s just an average person, hardly worth 10 people swooning over her.The show also has a good amount of filler even though it\'s only 12 episodes long. One episode is entirely about the lead\'s maidservant and again it\'s just about how great the lead is and how much the maidservant loves her even though she just comes across like an oblivious rich kid. In the episodes near the end where some actual plot happens the action is interrupted by every character doing flashbacks (in a 12 episode series???) and going on about how great the lead is and how much they love her. One episode involves all the characters\' secret desires being revealed and surprise surprise they all love the lead and want to get with her. This does not change any character interactions or mean anything.In addition, the whole premise that she\'s a ""villain"" basically doesn\'t appear at all. Not even a tiny bit. Even though it couldn\'t last long I thought there might at least be some humorous mix ups with her trying to be nice and getting misinterpreted or something like that. But it just doesn\'t come up.Unfortunately too all the other characters are given basically no chance to be interesting or even have any character traits because they\'re too busy mooning over the lead. We know little bits about them but they\'re never even given a chance to act in support of the lead with their own abilities.I felt there was enough momentum from the first few episodes that I kept watching and then by the end I was really disappointed.

Getting the same result no matter what is done would give a much better story, that would actually tell about fighting fate. What we got tells about eating cake and drinking tea. Even though it is still enjoyable, it is so not because of the story which was very promising, no.

It isn't a show about a villainess who is a villainess avoiding death from social and life situations because it is actually an Isekai into a game of which the main character makes herself the heroine as opposed to villainess.

You\'ll see in this show how creative the isekai genre can be just by changing the setting, in which here, our main character\'s role in another world isn\'t actually the main character but the villainess. Although the show may have been a bit cheesy towards the end (like, really cheesy), I still think it was still a relevant resolution to the conflict at hand in which yes, this show actually has a conflict for those who somehow dropped the show midway...through. The fact that there will be a season 2 will just make you wonder what else is there for the show to offer now that the story of the anime\'s universe ""Fortune Lover"" has come to an official end.One thing I\'d rly like to discuss here is her well known ""bakarina"" personality and how her ""dense"" aspect is actually understandable with the setting in the story, unlike the other dense harem protagonists out there (looking at you Ichika from IS). Her main focus is to do everything she can to avoid her doom endings and funny enough, in doing so, she inadvertently created her very own harem consisting not only the initial game\'s routes, but also the females stemming from those routes and the main character herself (actually didn\'t expect this tbh). From this point on it just snowballed to a goofy reverse-harem situation with all the people around her competing for her attention. Also, the reverse-harem setting Katarina has found herself in gave us viewers a bit of background on each of the characters of the story and I just find it really fascinating, normally people would just shrug off the harem elements of a show deeming it unnecessary but this one utilized the genre really well.Honestly, Hamefura may not have deemed itself as the best isekai title but it is one of the best harem titles I\'ve come across.

An isekai where you\'re placed in an Otome game sounds interesting and finding out that our MC is the villainess who has to work  hard to not get a doom ending was intriguing.And for the beginning of the show, I was truly captivated. Not only was the show funny, but a nice change to the other isekai shows that we\'ve all come to expect. It was also due to this show that I started to seek out other villainess stories and for that I\'ll always be thankful.Unfortunately, I feel like once the...show had it\'s time-skip and Catalina started school, the show kind of fell apart. Each episode had a mini time skip too. There were times when an episode would start and I\'d think, ""Huh? Did I miss something in the last episode?""We know that all of the characters love Catalina, but I wish there was more development for the characters to shine as teens. It\'s strange, but it seemed like all of the characters had more life to them when they were kids.It\'s not a bad show, but you could tell that the writers were trying to cover as many major plot points as they could, which ended up causing the show to lose that initial spark that it had. show had it\'s time-skip and Catalina started school, the show kind of fell apart.

A lot. Debatably the most wholesome harem I\'ve seen so far!Looking back, I cant say that this anime was ground breaking in any sense, but what tropes it followed it absolutely rocked out of their boots. It had a very refreshing concept, the main character is positive and fixated on her goal(and gardening), and so so dense. Somehow, this turned into a harem so naturally that I barely noticed it. All the characters were introduced and nurtured in a great way, while expanding on Catarina herself. The comedy manages to be the same in a way, but not at all...repetitive.Plus, the finishing blow, a good plot to sum everything up in a cute blue bow!There is a fitting end to the season, but there is definitely room for more.Catarina is a heartwarming character, perfectly unaware, dragging the good out of everyone she meets. The side characters were also well fleshed out and carried out in a way that I found myself rooting for each and every one of them. They all are very distinct in mannerisms and ways they try to win her over but what also shows is that they care for each other too. That ""fighting"" was goodwilled& light hearted that it created the comedy naturally, thus I laughed a whole lot, cause it wasn\'t at someone’s expense. Just wholesome and cute.The art wasn\'t too extravagant but it was pretty, aside from some 3D carriages and horses. The character designs were beautiful too. The music was fitting, setting the mood for every scene.The plot was very good and balanced, not letting you get bored watching Catarina clear her way to a happy ending, making jokes out of her tunnel vision and ability to throw everything to be (oblivious) with her friends, sweets and veggie garden. Or pulling them into a new adventure.Overall, I think if you manage to let go a bit and go with how wholesome& carefree this anime is for its biggest part (it has more than that too) I believe you will enjoy it a lot!

The comedy was always there, but the plot was a bit slow. After two episodes I put this show on my On-Hold list. It wasn\'t until mid-January when I decided to pickup the show again. Boy, did I not regret it.This show is what a Harem-Romance/Comedy looks like at its upside. Throughout the series I was very engaged in the plot and the relationships between Katarina and her friends (""love-interests)"". Normally I dislike characters who are really really dense, for example Ichika from Infinite Stratos. But in this case...Katarina being really dense actually compliments this anime. It is really entertaining to see that her ""analytical"" (I say that sarcastically) mind is so hyperfocused on surviving that she totally fails to realize that she charmed every single character (yes even the female characters ;) ) and avoided disaster. Every character is in love with her, but she is totally Ash Ketchum dense. ""I achieved the friendship ending"" Meanwhile, everyone got friend zoned. I love it.In my opinion I rank this anime high because of its originality and pure entertainment. I do wish to see more character development and backstory of the other characters. It really is Katarina\'s unpredictability that keeps me in engaged and wondering what will she discover and do next.8/10! Go watch this anime if you have a chance. I cannot wait for the 2nd season!

Although there is nothing to expect much of its story (without spoiling anything from the LN and the manga) the character interactions are actually enough for you to keep watching and enjoy the show.

Many factors make it seem quite stereotypical due to the cover and harem, but once you decide to watch it, the anime turns out to be so much more.The main heroine of this anime is such a genuinely enjoyable character, and in this rare case, I find her dense personality to make her a strong lead for this series. The other characters are a lot of fun too and I find myself liking all of them, not having a favorite at this point. A huge key point is the representation of multiple sexualities, and...how those characters aren't overdone or treated abnormally as well.In conclusion, I most definitely suggest everyone to watch this anime as soon as possible!

This anime is one of those that you decide to watch when you don't want to think about anything. Absolutely nothing happened with the story, we only get to see the relationship between the characters develop. The first few episodes were wonderful. The setup between the characters was shown, and I wished they could've stayed as children a little while longer. Afterward, we saw them in the academy interacting, and it just felt like fun fillers. We got to see them use some magic, though,...so there's that. The last few episodes were the downfall for me. It tried putting a little more conflict for the characters, but it didn't even feel threatening or dangerous. Mostly, it felt irrelevant and stupid. Still, overall, I enjoyed watching this. It was funny and entertaining at times.In terms of art, I liked the scenery. Even though it didn't look realistic, it looked beautiful to me. The character design was adorable but inconsistent. There are times when they looked weird. Sometimes the character design and the background clashes because of how simple the characters looked compared to the background.

I wanted to hurt her in the manga, and I've only read nine chapters.In terms of the relationship between the characters, I enjoyed their bond. They were all adorable together. Most of them helped and supported each other a lot. I get that this is a harem, but I just wanted most of their relationship to be platonic.

The quote is something I have always adhered to as an anime viewer, as a show that does nothing but rip off elements from other successful shows is bound to prove mediocre at best. Realizing that Otome Game is going to be another product of the tired isekai genre, I had my guards up early. Then the first episodes took me by surprise with a novel premise: 1) the main character assumes the persona of someone she previously knows as...a fictional character, and 2) the main character is fully aware of her own fate in the new world. I then decided to stick with the show until the end.In terms of execution and story-telling, the show is fine and is certainly not pure garbage. The pacing makes sense and the animation is consistently acceptable. There is clear (though somewhat limited) character development. However, the elements of the show that appealed to me in the first place turned out to be very unsatisfactorily capitalized upon, which detracted from the final score I have given Otome Game here. Firstly, the overarching tension between the eventual demise of the villainess at the hands of her peers and her goodwill towards them was very easily resolved -- so easily that I wonder, ""Then what\'s the point of introducing it in the first place?"" Although we viewers know that the underlying conflict has been resolved, our extraordinarily dense protagonist has no clue and struggles through life believing the same cruel fate will still befall her. This misguided belief constitutes the material for around, well, six or seven episodes towards the end. Secondly, far from proving useful, the protagonist\'s foreknowledge of events, which she never utilizes to her own benefit, simply burdens her with additional cause for concern. Here\'s probably the only skill the protagonist has got in her favour but it\'s just sitting idle on the shelf. Why, indeed? Well, it\'s because the original conflict has disappeared altogether and there is simply no need for countermeasures. Now, even if we were to remove her prescience from the mix, we would have the exact same storyline -- minus her unsettling shrieks of apprehension about the future. To sum up my issue with this show in one sentence, I would say it lacks unity. The scriptwriter attempts to throw in too many things into the pot and it spills over: yuri romance, reverse harem, villains with a past, school life, isekai, magic, otaku-stuff, and many other things. In particular, there are too many characters, none of whom receive adequate treatment. The result is diluted cardboard characters who seem, on a metaphorical level, to be fighting for screen time. In the end, the director apparently gives up hope of ever reconciling these elements and resorts to a ridiculously convenient and abrupt ending, which I noticed significantly brought down the MAL average score.  Overall, this is an anime that showed promise initially but went off track along the way.

Watch at your own peril.', 'TL;DR Go for the waifus/husbandos, but be disappointed by the bare-bones comedy, forced and underdeveloped romance, as well as the simple plot and characters. But hey, it\'s a 5 for me because I enjoyed the VA cast, great character designs, characters fighting over Katarina, and sometimes heartwarming yet essentially still cheesy, simple backstories.While it has barely started, I\'d suggest the spin-off manga instead for its unpredictability, which the original lacks. (And despite my criticisms, you\'ll find me watching the 2nd season for sure. I\'m as simple as I can get, what can I say?)---Hamefura starts with an interesting premise in its setting being an otome...game, but more so on the fact that the protagonist is set to be a villainess bound to either exile or death. Thus, what drives her actions is to prevent those ""doom flags"".However, I should tell you now that the story could\'ve ended by the 3rd episode. Katarina had literally managed to avoid the doom flags by that point simply by befriending the insecurity-ridden characters, so the episodes that come after are really just the romantic interests trying to get with the dumb and dense Katarina. Sure, you might be surprised by how the story turns out at the last few episodes, but it\'s as simple and predictable as it can get (worse, a deus ex machina occurs).It\'s due to which that I find the spin-off manga much more interesting, as Katarina starts in \'hard mode\', AKA at 15 years old and in the original setting of the otome game. The characters aren\'t head over heels for her, what happens next and how she deals with these events are unpredictable, and the doom flags are as such still looming. But anyway...I don\'t watch much isekai to also know if this is commonplace and a boon or a bane, but the world lore and the concept of magic aren\'t as explored. I\'d merely justify it with the original setting being that of an otome game, where the point is to get with one of the guys. (I also don\'t play otome games to know if the justification is okay.)In any case, as many stories, Hamefura\'s redeeming but also make-or-break factor would be the other characters (AKA the romantic interests)—not just guys, but girls too! It shines with its very well-designed characters (*cough* Maria, Sophia, Nicol), though I can\'t say the same for the actual world and, well, the characters themselves.I love harems, but god, the characters are as stereotypical and simple as possible, who surprise surprise are all in love with the immensely dense Katarina.---You have a guy...(1) whose only personality is that of a flirty fiance of Katarina (worst choice out of the bunch, btw);(2) who became a siscon because Katarina made him feel welcome (not bad, but you\'re expected to have that and the fact that he\'s adopted as justification as to why he harbors romantic feelings);(3) who stopped becoming competitive and insecure thanks to Katarina, though he becomes lowkey tsundere (surprisingly the best out of the bunch); and(4) who\'s considered devilishly handsome, but he hardly ever talks. He somehow falls in love with Katarina solely because she doesn\'t treat his sister as a nuisance.Then you have a girl...(1) who was once shy and insecure that (obsessively) falls in love with Katarina solely because of a compliment;(2) who falls in love with Katarina because they share the same passion for books and because Katarina didn\'t find her looks repulsive; and(3) who (is best girl that) falls in love with Katarina because the latter saw her for more than her magic and didn\'t shun her; if anything, Katarina recognized and complimented her hard work.---The romantic interests each have their quirks, though at the end of the day, their entire character solely revolves around Katarina \'saving\' them and loving Katarina for that saving.What about Katarina herself? Well, she absolutely loves sweets and is very dumb, dense, and inept in magic. But hey, she\'s supposed to be a simply lovable, genuine character, and it\'s her dumb actions that make her endearing to you and it\'s her interactions with the romantic interests (or the interactions of the romantic interests themselves) that make the anime funny. It\'s nice, if only it doesn\'t get kinda stale.All in all, I\'d go for Hamefura with low expectations and only if you want light entertainment and minimal romance. It\'s not much, but it\'s okay. As someone who loves harems, I certainly did enjoy the romantic interests \'fighting over\' Katarina, if not just innocently admiring her, but it\'s really the only thing Hamefura has going for it.---Personal context, feel free to ignore---Became interested in watching because of the videos I saw in YouTube. I didn\'t expect there\'d be female romantic interests as well, so uh yeah, that definitely piqued my interest. game, but more so on the fact that the protagonist is set to be a villainess bound to either exile or death.

I\'d merely justify it with the original setting being that of an otome game, where the point is to get with one of the guys. (I also don\'t play otome games to know if the justification is okay.)In any case, as many stories, Hamefura\'s redeeming but also make-or-break factor would be the other characters (AKA the romantic interests)—not just guys, but girls too! It shines with its very well-designed characters (*cough* Maria, Sophia, Nicol), though I can\'t say the same for the actual world and, well, the characters themselves.I love harems, but god, the characters are as stereotypical and simple as possible, who surprise surprise are all in love with the immensely dense Katarina.---You have a guy...(1) whose only personality is that of a flirty fiance of Katarina (worst choice out of the bunch, btw);(2) who became a siscon because Katarina made him feel welcome (not bad, but you\'re expected to have that and the fact that he\'s adopted as justification as to why he harbors romantic feelings);(3) who stopped becoming competitive and insecure thanks to Katarina, though he becomes lowkey tsundere (surprisingly the best out of the bunch); and(4) who\'s considered devilishly handsome, but he hardly ever talks. He somehow falls in love with Katarina solely because she doesn\'t treat his sister as a nuisance.Then you have a girl...(1) who was once shy and insecure that (obsessively) falls in love with Katarina solely because of a compliment;(2) who falls in love with Katarina because they share the same passion for books and because Katarina didn\'t find her looks repulsive; and(3) who (is best girl that) falls in love with Katarina because the latter saw her for more than her magic and didn\'t shun her; if anything, Katarina recognized and complimented her hard work.---The romantic interests each have their quirks, though at the end of the day, their entire character solely revolves around Katarina \'saving\' them and loving Katarina for that saving.What about Katarina herself? Well, she absolutely loves sweets and is very dumb, dense, and inept in magic. But hey, she\'s supposed to be a simply lovable, genuine character, and it\'s her dumb actions that make her endearing to you and it\'s her interactions with the romantic interests (or the interactions of the romantic interests themselves) that make the anime funny. It\'s nice, if only it doesn\'t get kinda stale.All in all, I\'d go for Hamefura with low expectations and only if you want light entertainment and minimal romance. It\'s not much, but it\'s okay. As someone who loves harems, I certainly did enjoy the romantic interests \'fighting over\' Katarina, if not just innocently admiring her, but it\'s really the only thing Hamefura has going for it.---Personal context, feel free to ignore---Became interested in watching because of the videos I saw in YouTube. I didn\'t expect there\'d be female romantic interests as well, so uh yeah, that definitely piqued my interest.', ""For many of us, video games are about escapism, leaving behind whatever is happening in the real world. This series perfectly captures that, while bringing a vibrant story to life.The characters are all well fleshed-out and interesting, and the humour is especially great for anyone who has played otome or dating-sim type games before.What made the series especially great for me though, was the inclusion of the 'real life' sections. I don't want to spoil anything, but showing the reality outside of the game gave us a beautiful and tragic story, allowing the in-game plotline to be far more interesting and sweet.

And while it may not bring anything never seen to the table, My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! (Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta) quickly proved itself separated from the heaps of mediocre similar shows with an interesting premise, a loveable cast, and a generally very enjoyable tone.Most people would love the chance to be the protagonist of a world full of adventure, in a game or another world....One such girl finds herself recovering her memories of her past life, discovering she was reborn into the world of Fortune Lover, one of her favorite games. Unfortunately, the character she was reborn as is the main antagonist of the game; Katarina Claes, who faces doom in the ending of every route. Using her extensive knowledge of the world and characters, she takes it upon herself to escape her fate, and change her ending for the better.Despite the somewhat ominous and serious premise, Villainess is prominently a comedy-based show, each episode regarding the many antics Katarina and her friends find themselves in, most often due to Katarina’s own antics in her attempts to avert her fate. Dubbed “Bakarina” by the community, the nickname is quite appropriate, as Katarina...isn’t the brightest bulb, often completely oblivious to the true actions of those around her. Though humorous on its own, the way said obliviousness is placed against other characters’ very clear and direct actions and words are where the true comedy ensues, with a protagonist denser than a black hole.Another relevant part of the show is simply how heartfelt and adorable the show is. Katarina as a protagonist is kind to everyone she meets in the sweetest and genuine way, often accidentally so. Watching the show will just bring a big smile to your face as the various antics of the cast take place. It’s unavoidable to at least warm your heart a bit.Even with how light and fun the show is, there are still a few issues that stick out a bit more prominently than others. Primarily that being the rather...shallow depth of the cast. While the story doesn’t quite need deep characters, and the explanation of them being from an otome game gives a bit of a reason why, the fact remains that most of the cast can be boiled down to one personality trait that they stick with through it all. I’d argue it doesn’t detract from the overall experience, but is rather noticeable nonetheless.In all, while not particularly deep or complex, Villainess is a fun romp with a rather interesting premise, filled with lighthearted moments and laughs aplenty. Though the characters might lack some depth, it certainly doesn’t detract overly from the experience, one of fun that can be enjoyed regardless.Grade - B One such girl finds herself recovering her memories of her past life, discovering she was reborn into the world of Fortune Lover, one of her favorite games.

We've seen a vast amount of LN, mangas, and animes all created with an isekai premise, making stories less and less new and fresh. So what will this long titled anime bring to the game that will keep it memorable for time to come?Most notably, the premise of My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!(or Doom! for the purpose of not taking up half a review just typing out the title) is an entertaining...one:  after hitting her head, Catarina Claes regains parts of her memory from her past life in which she was a regular high school student in Japan. As Catarina, our heroine must now avoid the doom flags in the otome game she now resides in as her character Catarina is doomed to be killed or be exiled in every route the heroine- Maria- takes. Our main character is the Villainess of this tale! The premise, at least, bring some intrigue to the table as we are usually met with over powered characters in our isekai games. One of the best appeal of Catarina is that she is not some god powered character, in fact, Catarina is known for having amusingly weak earth abilities, only being able to create stumps of dirt compared to her brother Keith who can create ginormous dolls who obey his will.Let's dive more into our characters. In otome type animes, the maincharacter is often the heroine of the game; she tends to be dull in characteristics, usually in an effort to allow the audience to place themselves in the female protagonists perspective as they would in an otome game. However, this can make the female protagonist dull and makes you question why you would root for her. Catarina is far from being a removed character. In fact, she actively interacts with the characters around her in her own unique manner; she's selfless, loud, and has an affinity for climbing trees and gardening. As an audience we can grow to love her because her personality shines through the episodes and reels us in. The rest of the characters do fall into general categories: we have the coldhearted prince, the jealous younger brother, the seemingly emotionless older lord, and three female characters who love the mc. They all fall neatly into their original otome game packaging, but because Catarina is not the Villainess the game set her up to be, the characters change as a result of meeting our protagonist. Overall, we've got some well done characters.What's an anime without it's art and animation? Doom! s art is soft, and inviting, almost playing towards a game feel, reminding us that this is part of an otome game with some major edits taking over. The animation is decent, but not special; there is enough animation to keep you interested, but not anything noteworthy. The music is fun to listen to as the story progresses, but once more nothing riveting enough to have you wanting more. What drives this department is the voice acting, and there are various voice actors in this anime with multiple main character roles under their belts.Dooms! story progresses in an expected manner. As Catarina avoids the doom flags of the game, the characters all fall for Catarina, who is a classic oblivious character. Considering she is at least 10 years older in her mind(as she was a high schooler in her previous life) you would think she would realize the feelings of her friends more, it is predictable that she would be painstakingly oblivious. Often the episodes fall into a pattern: one or more characters have the spotlight, Catarina tries to avoid anything doom flag worthy, the other character is obviously falling for Catarina, Catarina is oblivious. What saves this pattern is the events that occur in the story are amusing, and Catarina is such a lovable character that you can find yourself chuckling or even laughing at some moments of the story. Where the story falters, however, is in its depth. A large critique of isekai animes is that they often lack depth, no real character development occurs besides the characters becoming stronger in their abilities; there is either an abundance of fanservice or jokes that get old after the first few episodes. Doom! stands out in it's ability to bring forth a level of character development for our cast. However throughout the series there is not enough development for Catarina. Since she regained her memories she's been trying to get past the doom flags, prepare for exile or fight for her life, and has been oblivious to all attempts made for her to see others feelings of romantic interest. We needed to see more change develop for Catarina.The main conflict of the last few episodes attempts to up the ante of the story. Unfortunately, not enough is done to flesh out the characters and it falls a little flat. Even after all these events, Catarina is still oblivious. A second season is said to be in the works for 2021, and there is promise. We have a fairly likeable cast but now that the struggle of avoiding the doom flags in the original game are gone, the question arises: will this story continue to intrigue, or will it fall flat on its face and become another forgettable isekai?  I have been pleasantly surprised by Doom! and will be watching out for the next season. Even if you aren't an isekai fan I recommend giving this one a shot.

Catarina Claes is charismatic, dense, incredibly kind, and imbued with a lot of prior knowledge of the world and its characters, traits come in quite handy in her attempts to survive her inevitable fate. It is lovely to see how she uses her extensive knowledge of the supporting characters to help them deal with their mistakes, drastically changing their lives for the better and winning over their hearts.The general story...of the show is alright. Catarina has a pretty clear goal of not wanting to die and it is rather fun to see her often completely misunderstand which of her actions actually will and actually won't contribute to her achieving this goal. To add some more tension to this generally laid-back story, a villain is introduced in the third act, which wasn't a bad idea persé, but I must say that they did execute this generally poorly. Let's just say they kinda fumble it due to a poor buildup and poor motivations for the third-act villain.The supporting cast itself is a fun bunch, all with distinct traits and decently thought-out personalities. The only problem I have with them is that we never really get to see them interact with one another unless Catarina is involved. It seems like their lives kinda come to a bit of a standstill whenever the protagonist is not around for them to gawk at, which I do think is a missed opportunity. Perhaps this is a common staple of a Harem anime. Truth be told, this is a subgenre I am not really familiar with, so perhaps my expectations are a tat unreasonable. I do hope that the supporting cast will interact a bit more with one another in the second season of the series.As for the humor (this show is a comedy after all), it is rather tame. The show lacks the high energy and over-the-top reactions (at least, in the dub that is) that one would often find in other comedic anime. That being said, the aforementioned denseness of the main character does lead to a couple laugh-out-loud moments. Two jokes regarding gardening equipment did have me rolling on the floor with laughter.To conclude, the show has some problems with its third act and could spice things up a bit more when it comes to interaction between its supporting cast. This, however, is balanced out with a charming cast of characters, a good premise, and some pretty decent humor.

The beginning was kinda rushed in and it took some time to understand what was going on but, after that, I was so hooked on the story I had to pace myself to no binge watch it. I enjoyed the idea of a character being sucked in an otome game and avoid the death traps that have been placed. I thought I would be able to predict the ending and in some form I did, but there were lots of surprises I wasn't expecting to emerge. I am kinda sad there wasn't as much romance as I thought...the game would hold but there is a lot of love to replace it.[Art: 7] I am not an artist so I can't say anything about the art but I did like the style. It mimic the style of some otome games I have seen. I believe it fit the story well and it was pleasing to watch.[Sound: 8] Again, I am not the best at judging on sound but I did enjoy the ost the anime held. The beginning was fitting in my opinion and I enjoyed that it didn't spoil the story but instead kinda helped to understand what was going on in the first episode. The ending reminded me so much of the amnesia ost however. I am not saying it is a copy but the somewhat dark format, I think that's the word?, was so intriguing that I watched each episodes ending without skipping it.[Character: 6] The main character was interesting to watch. She knew of the traps that the game had placed and avoided them to the best of her ability. She is a happy go lucky character who made friends and tried to avoid making enemies. You know, the usual. Nothing so amazing to rate higher than a 6, but defiantly not the worst character I have come a crossed to.[Enjoyment: 9] I found this anime to be HILARIOUS. The way this character thinks is just a ride of silliness. Not only did it have some humor in its story, it also had lots of suspense that kept me wanting to watch the series with joy.[Total: 7.6]I would recommended this anime to those who enjoy a quick anime to watch. It has a good amount of humor, suspense, a little bit of romance.  I enjoyed this anime and I am so glad that they are going to make a second season!

Nothing so amazing to rate higher than a 6, but defiantly not the worst character I have come a crossed to.[Enjoyment: 9] I found this anime to be HILARIOUS. The way this character thinks is just a ride of silliness. Not only did it have some humor in its story, it also had lots of suspense that kept me wanting to watch the series with joy.[Total: 7.6]I would recommended this anime to those who enjoy a quick anime to watch. It has a good amount of humor, suspense, a little bit of romance.  I enjoyed this anime and I am so glad that they are going to make a second season! I am excited to see what will happen!"", ""Well, this certainly took me by surprised. I've always had a distaste for the Otome genre but this Anime was great. Can't say I'd get heavily into the Otome genre, however this does leave a good aftertaste with it's story and comedy. I'm glad that I gave it a shot and didn't leave this one in the dirt. Otome from another perspective in my opinion is alot better than what we usually follow with the main female protagonist. Judging that the MC is supposed to be the villainess of the story. Her comeback as a loveable MC is a pure chef's kiss.  I really...do hold out hopes for more Otome Isekai where the main focus isn't on the main female of the Otome story but rather from the perspective of someone else. Now, I don't normally watch romance anime shows with female protagonists because it usually revolves heavily on a love triangle. This however has none of that, and that's fine. You don't need crazy love triangles or story twists to make a show great.Without a doubt, I feel as if alot of people will regret not watching this show. It's comedic, romantic, and full of friendship and has a loveable protagonist. Giving it such a high praise made me want to give this one a 10/10 score. However, I can see how the appeal of this show can draw people away. With that, I'm more than happy to give it a 9/10. do hold out hopes for more Otome Isekai where the main focus isn't on the main female of the Otome story but rather from the perspective of someone else.

Katarina is a delight and nothing elevates a harem like having a main protagonist where it actually makes sense that everyone likes them. Hell, she basically worked her ass off to make sure they did!It's not gonna change your life or anything but I imagine you'll have a fun ride on a light hearted bisexual harem romp. "", 'So sad that this turned out to be just another reverse harem where everyone falls in love with the MC. The characters just genuinely lose all their personality because suddenly all their wants and desires revolve around living with Catarina forever?I mean, boring as hell. I get the point she reincarnates in an otome so every character just acts as an otome character but still. If at least there was some kind of feelings awakening in her but no, she just ignorant all the time, their feelings don´t reach her in anyway, they just end up not feeling genuine. Mary was the wooooorst character ever....why she suddenly obsessing over Catarina and screaming all the time. Half the show is just slice of life. I honestly just watched it all because people told me it would pick up the main plot in the end. and that is actually interesting. BUT HOW ANNOYING THE TRIP TO GET THERE.Major disapointment I really did think it would be better than this. And for what I hear the 2nd season isn´t any better.

That’s something I’d love to see her get through alive. I mean nothing against this cute, all gender harem she’s got going, I’m here for it. But it’s just so predictable you know? And at times I can’t help but get a little bored of her ‘clueless’ personality…The plot itself is pretty standard, I mean you can sort of tell how...everything’s going to play out after the first episode. As in Catarina will unconsciously befriend and cause all the other main characters to fall in love with her. Though one thing i didn’t see coming was that the girls would fall for her too, but I’m all down for that.The only other thing that bothered me was the opening theme. In the last few seconds it shows Catarina and her friend from the previous life, but it does so in a way that just makes it painfully obvious that she too will be reborn into the game. Or well, not so much reborn as connected to? They left that part pretty vague but I guess it’s safe to assume that Sophia is the reincarnation of her friend just without the memories.I know this is a common occurrence in anime I’ve seen hundreds of openings that give plot points away, but this anime really doesn’t have a lot of surprises in it and that could have been one, if they hadn’t done that. So yeah, that was disappointing.The art is… ehhhh… I mean it’s ok. It’s very average actually. All the male characters especially, are tropes personified, which makes total sense for the anime of course. But it’s a bit boring for the viewer you know? It was for me anyway, but I also think that it fit the anime really well. Since it’s such a vanilla Otome game, the princess and castle vibe just works.Also, the whole thing with the president was probably one of the weakest attempts at a plot twist I’ve ever seen. Like the rest of the plot… it’s obvious the moment Catarinas friend mentions the ‘hardest’ route. This show has like 7 characters, excluding the parents and maid, and subtly including the president as a ‘side character’ is just, once again, painfully obvious. There’s like a one second fake out that fails to be convincing anyone who’s watching I imagine.Anyway, don’t get me wrong. I think this anime was great. I really enjoyed it, even though at times I’d get a little bored or annoyed. The animation worked great for the genre as did the characters and the plot itself. I just have a bad habit of critically analysing anything I watch and I watch a lot of everything…Best part ; I’ve mentioned it like twice already, the all gender harem.

All Routes Lead to Blue Balls.Despite the *sigh* light novel long title, Villainess is a very funny, charming and surprisingly inclusive harem anime.Catarina (an isekai-ed via truck-kun Japanese girl who has been reborn as the villainess from her favourite dating sim game) tries desperately to find a way to stop herself from being murdered by her fiancé and any other man who falls in love with the (games) main protagonist Maria Campbell.Little does she know that in the time she spends trying to avoid death flags she accidentally walks into a lot of...romance flags. Now instead of wanting to kill her everyone is now in love with her. Very in love with her. ESPECIALLY the women. Though Catarina is too stupid to figure that out for herself.It's a good pitch of a harem anime. Because of the 18th century, european aristocracy setting a lot of the hornier (or out right tasteless) parts of harem anime are kept under a smooth and noble wrap so people who find that sort of thing uncomfortable don't have to worry.It's interesting to see how Catarina's new (stupid) personality affects the rest of the cast. Thanks to Catarina's meddling in their childhoods they turn out to be completely different people instead of the products of their aristocracy up bringing.Catarina may be as thick as a plank of wood, but she has more personality than most harem protagonists who are actually planks of wood. She's kind, loving and cheeky with a face for both evil and cute expressions making her idiocy funny and affectious.The rest of the cast also have well thought out and interesting backstories and personalities. Catarina's fiancé Prince Geordo was cold and cynical before he became engaged, but now he's (very) loving towards Catarina and can open up to his friends and twin brother Alan who had an inferiority complex towards Geordo, lashing out at others until Catarina helped him discover and nurture his musical talents and now they get along well.I'll be here all day if I go into the other characters and I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I think they're all excellent and you'll most likely enjoy discovering them for yourselves (especially Mary... and Sophia. Don't @ me).The show itself looks good. Studio Silverlink isn't particularly know for amazing animation, but they don't really need to go that far for a show like this. The story itself is very fun for the first half of the season. It takes it's time to really establish all of our harem members and I appreciated that.The plot starts to feel sluggish towards for middle of the season due to harem shenanigans which is a shame, but the season ends pretty well. I'm not really a fan of the magic system. It's a little boring and though it's plot relevant it feels like a last minute addition by the author because they were writing an isekai.Flaws aside I had a great time watching this anime. I think theres a lot for anyone of any gender to enjoy. I understand there will be some people who can't get past Catarina's stupidity and that's totally fine, but for this villainess all routes currently lead too;8/10 Great romance flags.

While not a masterpiece of story telling, its more than i was expecting and hence the rounded up score.Art Style: 7/10 - Frilly, girly, nice, cute, not really much more to say, nothing distinctive but it has more than enough sparkles to keep me more than happy <3Pacing: 8/10 - when the show started at such a young age and stayed there, i was worried the pacing would be all over the place, but i think it hit the nail on the head and thus avoided slow points that would have hurt the flow.Music/Sound: 6/10 - Really nothing of note, the opening was okay but the flow seemed kinda off, im not writing home about itCharacters: 8/10 - While her reverse harem could be seen as a little on the bland side, they're distinctEmotion: 7.5/10 - My heart strings were for sure tugged during this show, much more so towards the end. Friendship takes a key role with romance taking a back seat due to the MC obliviousness so although there is a spice of romance, its very much not fleshed out or for fulled.Humour: 9/10 - The honour was fresh and surprisingly wasn't shackled to the premis of the show, it has small skits, and challenged the formulae that i feel other shows would just stick to for a  small laugh instead of taking a risk.World building: 6/10 - The world is fleshed out to a bare minimum to keep the story chugging along, but within this genre, its enough and focus is kept on the characters instead of the world they inhabitOriginality: 9/10 - Reverse harems are rare, and good ones even rarer.

The main character, Catarina Claes, is a reborn otaku trying to avoid doom flags, since she's been reincarnated in an otome game. Though the plot sounds dark (and it could be pulled off well in a dark version of the anime), it is, at its heart, a romcom that focuses on the main character.It is absolutely hilarious seeing the MC seduce everyone, from her distant cousin to her fiancé's brother, to her best friends AND the original heroine of the otome game.

But I’ve heard some good feedback and I don’t want to limit myself on initial impressions alone, so why not set foot on something new? Visual-wise, it’s a perfect embodiment of what Otome games would really look like. You’ll also probably wouldn’t mind that it’s an isekai since it’s done in a new way. But keep it on mind that the MC’s (Katarina) past life takes on a major role as the...story progresses. When the playful OP was shown on screen, I get to see a lot of beautiful characters and I really do appreciate the addition of Katarina’s evil smug face to be constantly reminded that she’s actually a villainess. The characters were slowly introduced each episode so getting confused with them wouldn’t be an issue.The show started great and it’s good to see that the situations went according to Katarina’s plan. But it started to have a downfall with a bunch of filler episodes in the middle of the series. I mean they aren’t bad fillers, I even get to laugh and appreciate the characters more. But I really wanted to see more progress from the original plot and that kinda annoys me. They intentionally did it though to end the series on the student council president’s arc. There are also a lot of cliche situations especially in the dungeon episode and a few more in the final arc. Speaking of the final arc, it’s “okay” but it got some predictable or even obvious outcomes. But still, it’s a good ending for the season.Katarina as a character is very dense and dumb, but that’s actually a compliment. I mean she’s actually called “Bakarina” for that purpose right? Some may hate her for it but the show would not be the same if she’s an intelligent villainess for example, and that’s probably going to be boring. It’s a comedy and a reverse-harem anime after all, so it’s the best decision for it to be continuously entertaining.

Chances are I will never find another one i\'ll like again but god, did I enjoy watching this show!It\'s like they took everything that made the harem genre despicable and made a parody of it (which is insane considering the harem genre doesn\'t even take itself seriously to begin with).I think it was the mix of:1) having a female protagonist2) the way that she never favored any of them/remained clueless \'till the...very end 3) ofc the fact that the other women weren\'t here as love rivals for the protagonist but as other love interestI dislike the romance genre but I legitimately found myself rooting for Mary.My only complaint is that I wish the protagonist wasn\'t THAT nice, it would\'ve been more fun if she was actually kind of bratty and was just friendly for the sake of surviving but that\'s more a thing of preference so I can\'t really deduct points because of it.The only thing I do think they could\'ve done better is that the villain\'s backstory felt really weak and also did not suit the tone of the story. Either give them a good reason to be a villain with proper foreshadowing and buildup or give us a meme villain with a ridiculous motive like ""i\'m actually in love with prince alan"" or ""catarina\'s black hole of a stomach emptied out the student council\'s budget"", something like that. Instead we got a half baked villain with a story I think we were supposed to take seriously but it was literally impossible to. very end 3) ofc the fact that the other women weren\'t here as love rivals for the protagonist but as other love interestI dislike the romance genre but I legitimately found myself rooting for Mary.My only complaint is that I wish the protagonist wasn\'t THAT nice, it would\'ve been more fun if she was actually kind of bratty and was just friendly for the sake of surviving but that\'s more a thing of preference so I can\'t really deduct points because of it.The only thing I do think they could\'ve done better is that the villain\'s backstory felt really weak and also did not suit the tone of the story.

My only real problem was the dub. Yes, I watch dub and to be honest this was one of the worst dubbed anime I've ever watched. So if you're a beginner anime watcher please don't watch this in dub. Most of the main voice actors I've heard before but they all did a horrible job even though they've done an amazing job in other anime. The art style seemed really simple in my opinion. I liked the isekai aspect of it too and being an otome game. Endings are usually make or break and the ending...was well put. Also the characters can be super annoying given that they're all based off of liking Katarina. Katarina herself can be annoying because of how oblivious she is to everyone and everything. I did like the maid and her little story. Overall the anime was about a 7.5/10 for me. The main reason why I liked it was that it was an otome game and usually game isekai are shounen so it was great to see something new. I think that's all for my review. Also this is my first review and as you can tell I wasn't so passionate about this anime. Sorry for my lack of knowledge. was well put.

I really appreciated the fact that they characterised Katarina as a complete ditz, for one it was super entertaining and it also softened the huge advantage that she had (having played the game prior to being reincarnated). The only gripe I have is that I wish they'd developed Sirius Dieke a little bit more, the conclusion to his arch seemed a bit empty. It's definitely not a very complicated show,...but it knows what it is and it's a very easy and *very* enjoyable watch. but it knows what it is and it's a very easy and *very* enjoyable watch."", ""Let's take a walk through the history of Isekai. There's been some action-packed ones and ones that leave you laughing on the floor and ones that just dissapoint and take a somewhat typical approach to the Isekai genre. In comes my life as a Villainess, and somehow people have found an Fascinating way of blending harem and Isekai together to create one beautiful, yet comedic Anime that I just love! (Like seriously do you remember the last time there was an Isekai that was also a harem)The Anime follows the light novel written by Satoru Yamaguchi, where a a 17-year-old otaku girl finds herself...playing an otome game called Fortune lover. In that game, they play the main protagonist, Maria Campbell, and the player tries to find the different routes in the game, where they end up in love with different men. The thing is, what are you supposed to do when you suddenly get reincarnated into the villainess in the game, who is fated to either be exiled or get executed? The story follows Katarina Claes and how she tries to avoid all her routes that lead to doom, altering parts of the game, while trying to keep a level head with the fact that she most likely will die (again...). I think overall the story was executed pretty well, except I would have liked the series to have followed a 20-25 episode run, instead of the normal 12-13 episode run as I would have liked to have seen the characters develop more and seen an ending climax that did not seem too rushed.I don't really interest myself in the artstyle most of the time when watching Anime, except for when I think it's really bad, which in this anime, is not (thankfully). It does its job and I like how it was adapted to make the otome game look more realistic than it would have in a game.The characters are nothing short from entertaining. Katarina Claes is so delightful to watch honestly. Probably one of my favourite protagonists this year and you will see that when you watch it. Because the anime had to be short and had to have so many main characters, I was scared that I wouldn't find them to be likable but nope, the anime manages to pull it off. This has such a great cast of characters.Another notable feature of the Anime is, the music, especially the OP. Please listen to it because It's just so crazy. Like I don't how to describe it but don't you think It's just like the Nichijou OP, except adapted to a world of Princes and Princesses. It is just such an enjoyable OP to watch and to listen to. The song itself sounds like 3 totally different songs but just put together. They even incorporated Beethoven into it like it's great! And yet it somehow fits the show very well, and sums up the kind of vibe you get from the show, which is Funny, absurd and lovable. The rest of the OST plays at great times and has it's is full of classical songs that fit very well, since the show is set in a world of Royalty and Nobility, however I do agree some scenes can go without the music as it's somewhat exaggerated. But please listen to the OP, it's so good ^^I really enjoyed watching this series. It is distinct in how they incorporated two completely different genres together and Silver link put together ideas that we thought would not work but actually work very well and I congratulate them for doing that because it just makes the show even more enjoyable. And honestly Silver link has made so many underrated shows and the ones I have watched have not under par.

Thank you!"", 'Here is the another entry into the otome-game-isekai-hybrid-with-a-unique-gimmick-and-overly-long-title and it is one that is not too bad an entry, at least for much of the series. The central conceit here of course being that the story revolves around the villainess of an otome game and her doomed outcome. Truth be told, this premise is probably the series\' main strength coupled with a cast of characters who are pleasant and well-played, epitomized by our titular ""villainous heroine"". Her introduction and initial interactions with the rest are strong highlights. However character development from therein is unfortunately a tad clunky and do not stray too far from their...pre-assigned tropes. This causes the story to sag and drag by the midpoint before the turn which unfortunately is as cliched in inception and ham-fisted in execution as you can get. A tad disappointing after a promising start although nothing here is outright offensive.The art and character design are appealing enough without being particularly extraordinary although for an isekai there is a distinct lack of world building. It is even less than the barely there character growth. The music is pleasant enough and fitting with some nice music. The voice acting is pretty good although a bit stock.In the end, HameFura (I guess?) is a series with an intriguing premise, a good start that unfortunately could have done a whole lot more with the what it had. At the time of writing, a new season is just around the corner so hopefully there is redemption.

At various times the premise is lost (as in the holiday episodes) so that the anime can reach 13 full episodes, some questions remain open (what does Sirius have to do with Catarina to hate her in the beginning? Who was the person who saved Catarina and Sophia in the ruins with wind powers in episode 7?), but those characteristics do not matter if we compare with the grandeur of this anime.1- First of all, it is an isekai. It is...not just any isekai, but a mixture of fantasy and slice of life. It is not an isekai with monsters, knights, wizards, scenes of fight and action, but a fantasy world in which the characters live normally, attend school, have happy days together as teenagers. Can you imagine a mixture of slice of life, only in a fantasy universe? And on top of an otome game theme (cute boys, girls with a strong personality, light romance).2- Second, at different times the narrative gave us information that would normally be obvious, but was subtle in the right way. For example, when Catarina remembered the gameplay, the male characters made statements to Maria. Catarina unwittingly made these statements to Maria. Result? Maria fell in love with her, just as she would have fallen in love with the male characters. Another example, in an attempt to escape the tragic end, Catarina was kind to everyone and helped them with their personal problems (prejudice, discrimination, insecurity, bullying), and this help was just what they needed to not become the characters of the game, but successful people and passionate about Catarina.3- Third, the presence of LGBTQ questions. The anime has a certain question about always thinking about couples being formed by men and women, Mary asks ""Does the person I want to date need to be a man?"". In addition, Mary, Maria and Sophia have a passion for Catarina, at different levels.4- Fourth, my favorite type of ""end"" is present in this work. That ending in which the villain does not need to die to correct his mistakes, but rather to repent, to be forgiven, to have a second chance and everyone to be friends in the end.The/If someone didn\'t like the fact that Catarina didn\'t ""choose"" someone to date, the premise of the anime was not that. To have an idea, we are talking about a comedy anime with parody, an example of a scene was in episode 8 when Catarina\'s greatest desire was to eat a lot of sweets instead of dating one of the people. Whatever, we are not talking about an otome game, but an anime that parodies this game genre. All the time the anime showed itself in this way, in which the power of friendship could solve anything, however absurd the problem was. This end was expected.Let\'s go to the notes:History (10/10)The anime parodies isekai, parodies otome game and parodies traditional romance. Despite the predictable scenes, the anime broke many standards.Art (9/10)Ordinary art, very well done animation, beautiful characters, like an otome game should be. There is nothing extraordinary about the beauty of the characters, they are similar to each other, so I didn\'t give 10. The scenarios are beautiful.Songs (9/10)Very happy opening theme. The anime is comedy, so happy music is appropriate. Besides that this song is memorable, the artists sing in different musical tones and the instruments are very varied (even organ and classical music) because anime is a mixture of genres: isekai, fantasy, comedy, romance, slice of life. .. Therefore, music also has several subgenres. The ending theme is ok but does not exceed the opening.Character (9/10)In the end, they are all passionate about the main character, just like in the otome game. The difference is that she was not expecting this. Another difference is that they love Catarina for different reasons.Overall (10/10)This anime entered my favorites not only here on My Anime List, but in my life. This anime mixes my favorite genres in the same plot (fantasy, slice of life, romance, friendship, comedy), has my favorite anime ending and the main character is the type I like the most: the one who is willing to help others .I don\'t think I need a second season because the end of the first one was very good, but if so, I\'ll be there to watch. not just any isekai, but a mixture of fantasy and slice of life.

Overall, it\'s not an awful story albeit a fairly dull Slice of Life. And time hasn\'t done it any favors as this subgenre has only improved alongside its weaker cookie-cutter stories. (Light spoilers ahead; this was marked incorrectly as Preliminary contrary to submitting this Review as having watched it Completed.)-Instant 3-star lost: Harems. I abhor them, but tbf the writing could\'ve saved a star or two had it tried.The writing needed to assign the type of love for MC with her large...variety of admirers. But without doing so, it\'s conflated awkwardly with one-dimensional romantic love... which is unfortunate as their one-sided affections, if it\'s supposed to be romantic, are 100% forced without anything that actually builds that up. Closest is Geordo, furthest is Alan.Lost of 1 star: Rest of the writing.It\'s so shallow and there\'s nothing interesting happening. MC just passes the days idly by, but we don\'t see much more than ""oh, I guess she eventually learned how to garden in 7yrs"". Even for a Slice of Life series like this, it\'s on the duller end because nothing changes amongst the cast. And that\'s absurd given the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY was for MC to save herself from a Bad End (Death or Exile). Instead, MC just lives life roughly as if she had no notion the original story so nothing really matters.Art is pretty good and the sound is nice (I watched dubbed). The only thing the animation added for me was to enjoy the nice character designs in full, especially the color choices.

With that said, I very much enjoyed this! I was hesitant to watch, seeing as a few of the other reviews were less than stellar, but I was in the mood for a cute love story with rich/prince-type characters, and this perfectly fit the bill!I thought the concept was unique from the start - a high school girl getting reincarnated as the villain in her favorite game. And as it continued, it did not disappoint....I was genuinely intrigued from the first episode, and this show did a great job of maintaining my interest in what was to come! I really couldn't wait to see what was going to pan out for these characters!Speaking of, I thoroughly enjoyed everyone included in the show, especially the main protagonist, Lady Catarina. Her quirky yet endearing charm left everyone enchanted, and it was no wonder why. She was extremely likable and unproblematic. And regarding some of the other friends, I really enjoyed that the girls were also smitten with her, not just the boys.While I wouldn't say this show was amazing, I would state that it's wholeheartedly fun and engaging.

It would be a lie to say the show didn\'t stray from the preconceived course. If you\'re watching this show expecting drama, expecting our Villainess to deal with major conflict, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. Instead, you\'ll meet a lovable MC on a journey to change her ""fate"".Go into this show with an open mind. It\'s very light-hearted and fluffy. If you\'re looking for a quick laugh/slice of life anime to add to your list, this is it. I don\'t normally write reviews for the...shows I watch.

The title caught my eye and I decided to give this a watch.There\'s no way around it: This is an absolutely shameless wish-fulfillment fantasy. If you make peace with that you can enjoy this anime, I think, but if you cringe at the little part in you that wants to be the most beloved person around, this anime will be torture. I did make my peace but was squirming uncomfortably towards the end anyway.If you are a self-aware nerdy...girl or so, and have played otome games, and occasionally enjoy some fantasies of being the center of everyone\'s affections while being a genuinely good person, this anime might be a guilty pleasure for you. It\'s not good or deep by any means but it is enjoyable.I immediately liked the premise of the main character being the intended Villianess of the story. That\'s unusual and I like the detail that Katarina indeed has all the visual cues of being ""the bad guy"". That said, there is a lot of missed opportunity here. Katarina becomes lovable so quickly that she faces virtually no challenges living her new life. Arguably avoiding her doom flags is the challenge but due to being impossibly likeable, she honestly solves this problem well before it\'s relevant. There\'s one attempt at a plot twist but the resolution is so predictable that I\'m not sure why they even bothered.In her previous life, Katarina was a self-proclaimed otaku but seems somewhat unusual for the role: she doesn\'t seem to be an outcast but rather an extremely peppy, cute girl ( with the only imperfection being an adorably messy hair ). Not that otakus can\'t be like this but somehow in an Isekai trope I\'d at least like to see a stark contrast between the old and the new ""character"". Also not to be the one to call for realism in an Isekai anime but c\'mon, if she likes sweets as much as she does, couldn\'t she at least have been a little overweight?The thing is though, they really were good at making Katarina likeable, to the audience as well. She\'s not a technically great character but enjoyable and funny, and definitely the saving grace of the anime. All the other characters are shallow carbon copies of characters you have seen a million times before. Well, to a degree this is understandable since the whole point of the show is that it\'s based on an Otome. In a way I think it helps if you can get the meta humor, though I think they missed many opportunities in this as well.The artwork is nothing to write home about, which is a shame. There are sakuga moments that look very pretty but the average animation is fairly dull. Surprisingly gorgeous environmental art every now and again. There\'s a weird contrast between the female and male characters. The latter are extremely boring and unoriginal in design and art but the female characters are vibrant and interesting to look at. It\'s a little bit funny really since it kinda drives home the idea that the male characters really are just kitsch to have around where as the more substantial relationships are between the female characters. Not sure if this is intended meta humor.Sounds and music isn\'t even worth mentioning. It\'s there.While I would criticize the story of being a missed opportunity in many ways and being very predictable and wish-fulfilly, I\'d say there\'s two things here that I would hope are thought provoking for some people: First is how Katarina accepts everyone, partly because she knows exactly how they would end up if certain things would come to pass but also just because of her temperament. Second is how she is oblivious to her problem having been solved because she is so focused on the problem she thinks she has.Entertainment though this may be, these two things stood out to me as good bits of wisdom for people to chew on. girl or so, and have played otome games, and occasionally enjoy some fantasies of being the center of everyone\'s affections while being a genuinely good person, this anime might be a guilty pleasure for you.

There are sakuga moments that look very pretty but the average animation is fairly dull. Surprisingly gorgeous environmental art every now and again. There\'s a weird contrast between the female and male characters. The latter are extremely boring and unoriginal in design and art but the female characters are vibrant and interesting to look at. It\'s a little bit funny really since it kinda drives home the idea that the male characters really are just kitsch to have around where as the more substantial relationships are between the female characters. Not sure if this is intended meta humor.Sounds and music isn\'t even worth mentioning. It\'s there.While I would criticize the story of being a missed opportunity in many ways and being very predictable and wish-fulfilly, I\'d say there\'s two things here that I would hope are thought provoking for some people: First is how Katarina accepts everyone, partly because she knows exactly how they would end up if certain things would come to pass but also just because of her temperament. Second is how she is oblivious to her problem having been solved because she is so focused on the problem she thinks she has.Entertainment though this may be, these two things stood out to me as good bits of wisdom for people to chew on.', 'tl dr; Fantastic start - Disappointing mid-arc - Good endingI haven\'t had this much fun watching an anime in such a long time--all I\'ve been watching were those ""hype"" animes or those that make you super depressed after finishing it. On the other hand, this one is not super light-hearted, but the perfect amount for an anime with this concept.I love how the main character is even though she does get carried away every now and then (but then again, that\'s almost a cliche for main characters in animes now, which is a part of their charm I guess). As someone who have played quite...a bit of otome games myself, I really enjoy how the game that the MC thinks she is born into is that exact stereotypical otome game that gets the doki doki going.Maybe the animation company and the author knew that it was going to pop off way before the first episode was going to air, but even though it attracted many others including me into watching the anime with the first 4 or so episodes, I was ultimately disappointed with the random filler that was provided. Yeah, the anime mostly focuses on Katarina, the main character herself, and BARELY makes note of how the magical school is run, which COULD HAVE BEEN interesting as it always is--BUT come on, it could have been done better. There are other animes that put in those ""hehe fun fact"" type of episodes as extras for buying their DVD or Bluray, so why didn\'t they do that instead if they were THAT confident? But then again I may just be jumping to conclusions.I am conflicted whether or not I should read the manga/visual novel/whatever source material there is or wait for the Season 2 that is supposed to air in January 2021 (or so I have heard). a bit of otome games myself, I really enjoy how the game that the MC thinks she is born into is that exact stereotypical otome game that gets the doki doki going.Maybe the animation company and the author knew that it was going to pop off way before the first episode was going to air, but even though it attracted many others including me into watching the anime with the first 4 or so episodes, I was ultimately disappointed with the random filler that was provided.

Now I know most isekai have a harem, its like getting a warranty on a new car, everyone has it, but the harem is the star of the show this time.Story: The story of Otome starts off strong. The first few episodes with the character introductions are the best part of the show. Once the show moves onto the (""inset fantasy cliche #4"") ""magical school"" the story moves a little to fast with the ending not getting enough build up.Art: The art...while not amazing is very consistent, the backgrounds and locations, if generic are well drawn and detailed.Sound: The sound of the show is fine if nothing special. The Japaneses voice acting is good, however the dub is one of best, and some of the charterers voices are amazingly annoying.Characters: The characters were the best part of the show by a long shot. The main girls are all well designed and easy to look at, the boys suffer a little in the character development department though, Prince Alan suffers the most from his lack of screen time. each of the characters, excluding Katrina has issues getting screen time. The show has eight main characters that need development, leading to some like Mary and Alan getting shafted in later episodes.Enjoyment: Do I recommend this show? Yes. Do you need to drop everything and watch it right now? No. It is a fresh premise on a long stale genre, like scraping mold off of a nice piece of cheese. If you like reverse harems, or slice of life isekai, then check it out, otherwise slap it on the plan to watch list. while not amazing is very consistent, the backgrounds and locations, if generic are well drawn and detailed.Sound: The sound of the show is fine if nothing special.

It is very fun to see all of the events play out for the characters and seeing how they react to one another is amazing. If you came to this show expecting an ecchi romcom you were….half right. This show does not contain any panties or any titillation. But it more than makes up for that by instead showing the viewer what I like to call “emotional fanservice”.-Tangent-I believe that there is something called “emotional fan service”. While normal lewd fan service is supposed to stimulate emotions through lewd scenes, I think emotional fan service is supposed to give...a sense of fun, accomplishment, or purity. An example of emotional fan service to me would be feel good shows such as ISEKAI SHOKUDOU, or this show Hamefura. These shows have the “oh my god this is so awesome, SQUEEEL” moments which I think is the embodiment of emotional fanservice.AnimationThe show has a lot of good moments and it's made by a fairly respectable studio. The animation looks happy and colorful and it fits the tone of the series like a glove. While it would be nice to have more crisp moments of animation I think the studio did its job perfectly well.soundThe opening theme is nice and has a bouncy feel to it, but other than that I couldn't really remember that many of the tracks. The soundtrack is perhaps the weakest thing about this show.PacingThe pacing for this show is very quick and snappy. It's not too fast to the point that you don't enjoy each moment of the show, but it's definitely not slow. I think the pacing is just right for the show and it makes it very fun for binging.

Each episode a new character joins and it's not until after the time skip in the show do new characters get introduced at a slower, more organic pace.CharactersPeople watch harems because of the characters and this show has some nice ones.

My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! or HameFura breaks that mold and is a breath of fresh air in what has become a saturated genre. I recommend checking it out, especially for those who enjoy Isekai or comedy and light hearted shows. I believe the key factor in enjoying this show comes down to the main character Katarina Claess. I personally believe she’s one of the best Anime protagonists so far in 2020 and what made this show a delightful...surprise.I compare this show to a sports team with one ultra talented player the team is built around. The team’s success hinges on that player’s performance. That isn’t to say the supporting players aren’t useful, instead important in bringing the best out of their key player and vice versa. As I alluded to before, that elite player for HameFura is Katarina Claess. The show balances Claess’s quirky gags with nice genuine moments as we watch how she navigates her newfound life trying to avoid a tragic fate. Claess’s goofy antics are never so long and drawn that they grow tiring, instead the story is always moving as to see how Katarina will approach her next challenge. While some may say the rest of the cast is boring or generic, I believe they all play their part in furthering and seeing more aspects  of Claess and her story.While the animation and soundtrack aren’t anything amazing this show is just a fun ride and something different. It’s worth checking out just to meet Katarina Claess. More likely than not you’ll probably find yourself joining her harem. surprise.I compare this show to a sports team with one ultra talented player the team is built around.

It is fun, the pacing is okay, the characters are charismatic, the production is okay, the intro is good, and the jokes and comedic scenarios are mostly good.That being said, I watched from episodes 1-7 in basically one sitting, but the second half of the show was much worse, because the comedy started to get stale and the focus from the series changed drastically to dramaAnd, unfortunately, Flag does not work well as a drama nor as a romance; mostly because of three reasons:1st - The heroine's personality. She is just too dumb and it is...impossible to take her serious;2nd - How the protagonist achieves so much just because of her compassion. She does not work hard, nor smart, nor strategically. Instead she just solves all her problems by being empathetic and somewhat nice to others, and this makes no sense and also removes much of the investment the viewers could have for her;3rd - The extreme way most of the cast regards the protagonist is too absurd to be taken seriously. This works perfectly well for the comedic and slice of life aspects of the show; but it also makes the drama and romance very hard to digest.Overall, Flag is a solid comedy anime that fails miserably when it shifts its focus to drama and plot progression, as the show is unbelievably boring regarding its romance and drama.It is also worth mentioning that there is a clear disconect between the light-hearted comedy and the high stakes of some of the plot points near the ending of this season. I don't think this is a major flaw, and I believe that fixing other aspects of the show could definitely alleviate this problemI would recommend watching the show until episode 9, as it is quite entertaining.

Yet... all her flaws only add to her charm so, they are not flaws, they are added cuteness in disguise... she sucks at studying so her friends get to ask her over to study and be on the presence of her, and her magic isn\'t the best but whenever she uses it it is just what was needed to save the day and have everyone fawn over her... and she might also be a total otaku, but then one of her friends is just the same so it kinda cancels out.

Honestly, its a blast, it\'s quite funny, this anime plays like a little girls fanfic about what her school life is like in her head, all the boys love her and are super competitive to win her over and triumph over one another in the pursuit of that love, the girls want to be her, the bullies wish they could even be her friends just to get a small amount of her insurmountable clout, her brother is super caring and loving, her ""boyfriend"" is the perfect man, not only a true gentleman that respects her boundaries, but also a naughty boy that knows how to push her buttons and be the hottest kind of ""pushy"", but wait! there\'s more!

I mean on paper our heroiness was the villainess, but she was never threated that way. (Honestly even the shield hero would have been better fitting for the title...) The thing is the show tried to sell her as a villainess, but she never was one (because of the usual isekai personality...swap). She is the always smiling, dull, shallow, cute girl archetype.

Lady Lady!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2227/Lady_Lady,"[""English is not my language.This anime is basically a soap opera.It starts with Lynn and her going to England, where Lynn's father lives. When they get there and are on their way home, they are in a car accident and Lynn's mother dies.A positive point is exactly showing the death of Lynn's mother, and not always the same old cliché of parents died and that's it.When Lynn comes home, she has no acceptance from her half-sister, and as the episodes go on the relationship between them develops.  Lynn also makes friends with Arthur and Edward, who show up quite a bit, but there isn't...much to talk about them.The misery begins when the Baroness and her children arrive at Lynn's home. The Baroness wants to marry Lynn's father only out of interest, so that one day her son will be heir to the dukedom.This woman and her children are some of the most disgraceful characters I have ever seen. Basically everything is blamed on Lynn, even though she is innocent, and they are always harassing her without her doing anything wrong. The goal of the anime is to make you hate these characters, and you succeed... THEY ARE UNBEARABLE. Every time they appeared I was irritated and angry.At one point, everyone hides from Lynn that her mother is dead, but the Baroness and her children throw it in her face in the worst possible way. They don't even take into consideration that she is only five years old.The anime is based on this, is the Baroness trying to marry Lynn's father and the Baroness and her children picking on Lynn and her sister in various ways, often with silly things and sometimes doing bad things to both of them. It is hard to say who of the three is more despicable, one is worse than the other. Baroness also starts to think she is in charge of everything at a certain point, even sending employees away for silly reasons.One problem is that Lynn and Sarah never tell their father what they are going through, and I don't understand why. There is no point in me going into detail with everything they have been through, because it won't change anything. But I think that if they had told everything, their father would have given up marrying the Baroness much earlier. Although he didn't want to, he doesn't even like her and was only going to marry her to pay his debts and because his father kept insisting.Well, at least in the end the Baroness doesn't get what she wants. I only wish that the last episode had shown her and her children angry because they don't get what they want.One problem with this anime is the drama. Most of the time it is unnecessarily overdone. Like I said, this anime is a soap opera.Like, it could be the silliest thing possible and this anime overdoes the drama, it pushes too hard to try to have an impact, getting repetitive and predictable. The less overdramatic dramas are usually with Lynn, and sometimes when her father has moments of drama.This anime has an exaggerated Ie Naki Ko level of drama, sometimes it goes even further. The drama is not as functional exactly because it is overdone, making it very repetitive and forced.The technical parts are good. The first and second episodes are a show of production and direction, after that it becomes more normal and the drama more exaggerated.Character design is very good.

Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37475/Kishuku_Gakkou_no_Juliet,"[""Being a great fan of the typical Romeo X Juliet school-twisted manga at hindsight, I was wishing for an anime adaptation of this rom-com for sometime, and when it premiered in Fall 2018, I was SO happy and ready for the anime adaptation by Liden Films, and it delivered flawlessly (well, small faults but big wins). (Yay, Happy Xmas wish granted!)The story...let's just say that if you know a even a little bit about the Romeo X Juliet Shakespeary context, it's the exact same premise here, just in terms of different factions, mainly the White Cats and Black Dogs, led by both leaders Romio Inuzuka...and Juliet Persia. So with that, Dahlia Academy Boarding School (Juliet), was made as per the neutral ground for both factions to have and nurture education for everyone regardless of which faction they belong to. However, as both Inuzuka and Persia encounter each other *starts rolling Romeo X Juliet the play*, the amount of controversy that both have that's weighted on their shoulders become the main problem for concerning people.And that's where the side characters come in. From the assistants, Inuzuka's ever-helpful assistant-cum-crush Hasuki and Percia's strangle-hold Princess Chartreux (just call her Char) are always there to help shape up each counterpart's emotions and feelings about each other, and confront each other as to deal with countless situations with the slightest damage possible. The most frightening are always the top brass, or model counsellors such as Inuzuka's own older brother Airu (which he despises greatly), twin sisters Kochou and Teria from the Black Dogs and Persia's relentless leaders Cait Sith, Anne Sieber and Rex from the White Cats to name a few. And of course, the White Cats rebel faction of Aby Ssinia, along with his supporter-cum-crush Somali and few others. Their depiction in the anime is just as frightening as in the manga, so great pointers for showing their cruelness. Overall, all characters were done as well as how they were in the manga.From here on, really no problems at all. Liden Film's art and animation, bright, clean, fluid and showcasing some of the most simple but bad-ass animations when it comes to the serious stuff (e.g. scenes of action). That, I can go along with it. Same goes with the music too. I was concerned about FripSide's songs as the quality of songs they were pumping out in the modern times were average or didn't sound very good (as per the case of Dances With The Dragons). But, once that OP played, I was rest assured, this OP was fantastic and great, along with Riho Ilda's ED (which I should listen to her songs more) which was icing on the cake.If there is the minimum fault I could lament with, was that the storytelling was quite slow, but once I compared that to the flow of the manga, it allayed most of the fears I had about pushing quantity for quality, and am glad that the slow storytelling compensated for most of the enjoyment I had for this anime. Heck, I'd even say this anime adaptation surpasses the manga in every way. It's a great one I tell you. If you're a fan of the Romeo X Juliet archetype, this anime is a must recommended watch. It puts a smile on my face, and so should inflict on you as well. and Juliet Persia.

While neither series are alike to each other, they do borrow a few familiar themes with the most prominent being a forbidden romance. But there’s more to that, no?Romance is practical in a show like this but it made me question first what the were really aiming for. I’m not familiar Yousuke Kaneda’s works but when it comes to a rom-com, they made the point crystal clear. Romio Inuzuka and Juliet Persia are in love. It’s the type of love that...ties these two lovebirds like fate. However, it’s a forbidden love as Romio and Persia belong in opposite sides of society. In their school (Dahlia Academy Boarding School), there are two rivaling countries. They are known as the “Black Dogs” and the “White Cats”. As the respective leaders of their dorms, you can expect a whole load of drama coming their way.At first, this show felt like an experimental story of trial and error. The first few episodes depicts Romio and Persia in a relationship although they must keep it a secret to avoid consequences. They face numerous obstacles with their secret often being risked in public. This creates consequences which misunderstandings arise. Throughout the series, people assume Romio has been harassing Persia. There’s countless times in the show where Romio has to defend his own pride while maintaining his poker face persona. On the other hand, Persia has trouble hiding her own secret but can’t help but stay in love with Romio. You get the big picture here? The show sets up this sort of dilemma that seems to signal for a tragic or doomed relationship. And that’s a good thing. It makes the show feel less predictable as viewers will anticipate how their relationship will ultimately end. Will their relationship be an everlasting love or is it fated to be a tragedy?While all this drama exists from behind the scenes, another main selling point is the rivalries in the show. The Black Dogs and White Cats are often going head to head in competition. Their personalities and attire also contrasts with each other greatly. The anime depicts the Black Dogs as rowdy individuals that almost seems to allude their behaviors as animals fighting for their territory. On the other hand, the White Cats are dressed more cleanly and maintain an aristocratical attitude to maintain their presence. Like cats, they are also cunning and are not afraid to take risks. The series takes opportunities to showcase both sides’ strengths and weaknesses. Through competition, the Black Dogs and White Cats strives to win no matter what in their adamant rivalry.While Romio and Persia is the main focus, I suppose the audience wonders why the key visual contains other female characters. Make no mistake. This isn’t a harem despite the deceptive image of several girls surrounding our main male protagonist. Characters like Char, Hasuki, and the Wang sisters adds doses of drama in their own ways. For instance, Char often teases characters in playful ways like a curoius cat. Romio becomes one of her key targets although most of this is played for laughs. Hasuki is more outgoing and friendlier with others and that’s thanks to Romio’s influence. As one of the very few characters who knows the truth of his relationship with Persia, she’s definitely a character that he can trust. Unfortunately, not every character in this show is too welcoming. The Wang sisters are an example of this as their role has little impact on the overall story. Their debut in the show is nothing more than showing their status at school as prefects and there’s minimal character development for either girl. Still, you may wonder if this show has emotional drama. In the second half of the series, Romio and Persia’s relationship is really tested as they encounter more complex problems such as Romio’s brother.Watching a romantic comedy like this probably gets predictable if you’ve seen similar shows before. The repetitive formula of misunderstandings, emotional segments, and character chemistry is usually drawn through dealing with social issues. Now I’m not going to deny this show is a cliché teenage soap drama. However, the show seems to shine best when we see the importance of Romio and Persia’s character relationship. Between the humor and drama, it maintains a balanced story without jumping over itself. However, I do wish the show extended its plot more from the manga. The series is ongoing and with just 12 episodes, there are other characters that are omitted. The plot seems to be structured in a way that gives the overall story its flow but not truly adapted to my expectations.As a show produced by Liden Films, it’s satisfying to see the faithfulness of the character designs. The contrasting attires of the Black Dogs and White Cats shows their status at school with their personalities. Romio and Persia are the two to keep an eye on the most for their character expressions. This is because they behave in both honest and deceptive ways depending on circumstances. Thanks to characters like Char, we also get tons of humorous moments thanks to her manipulative antics. The feminine voice of Persia is also expressed adequately to showcase her elegant personality. Even when she cross-dresses a boy, Persia still maintains an overall cool image in public; a contrast to her more fragile self when alone with Romio. There’s also some fan service in the show so do be prepared for some cliché pitfalls like accidental perverted moments with loose clothes. Yes, this romantic comedy has it all.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is far from being a classic Shakespearean tale but manages to capture the magic of a romantic comedy. I’ve seen many rom-coms in the past and most falls for the same tropes over and over. This anime is vulnerable to some of those tropes but is also able to tell an convincing story with memorable moments. Don’t expect this to be a big hitter of the year but do be prepared for a gleeful rom-com amplified by the charms of a star-crossed couple. ties these two lovebirds like fate. However, it’s a forbidden love as Romio and Persia belong in opposite sides of society. In their school (Dahlia Academy Boarding School), there are two rivaling countries. They are known as the “Black Dogs” and the “White Cats”. As the respective leaders of their dorms, you can expect a whole load of drama coming their way.At first, this show felt like an experimental story of trial and error. The first few episodes depicts Romio and Persia in a relationship although they must keep it a secret to avoid consequences. They face numerous obstacles with their secret often being risked in public. This creates consequences which misunderstandings arise. Throughout the series, people assume Romio has been harassing Persia. There’s countless times in the show where Romio has to defend his own pride while maintaining his poker face persona. On the other hand, Persia has trouble hiding her own secret but can’t help but stay in love with Romio. You get the big picture here? The show sets up this sort of dilemma that seems to signal for a tragic or doomed relationship. And that’s a good thing. It makes the show feel less predictable as viewers will anticipate how their relationship will ultimately end. Will their relationship be an everlasting love or is it fated to be a tragedy?While all this drama exists from behind the scenes, another main selling point is the rivalries in the show. The Black Dogs and White Cats are often going head to head in competition. Their personalities and attire also contrasts with each other greatly. The anime depicts the Black Dogs as rowdy individuals that almost seems to allude their behaviors as animals fighting for their territory. On the other hand, the White Cats are dressed more cleanly and maintain an aristocratical attitude to maintain their presence. Like cats, they are also cunning and are not afraid to take risks. The series takes opportunities to showcase both sides’ strengths and weaknesses. Through competition, the Black Dogs and White Cats strives to win no matter what in their adamant rivalry.While Romio and Persia is the main focus, I suppose the audience wonders why the key visual contains other female characters. Make no mistake. This isn’t a harem despite the deceptive image of several girls surrounding our main male protagonist. Characters like Char, Hasuki, and the Wang sisters adds doses of drama in their own ways. For instance, Char often teases characters in playful ways like a curoius cat. Romio becomes one of her key targets although most of this is played for laughs. Hasuki is more outgoing and friendlier with others and that’s thanks to Romio’s influence. As one of the very few characters who knows the truth of his relationship with Persia, she’s definitely a character that he can trust. Unfortunately, not every character in this show is too welcoming. The Wang sisters are an example of this as their role has little impact on the overall story. Their debut in the show is nothing more than showing their status at school as prefects and there’s minimal character development for either girl. Still, you may wonder if this show has emotional drama. In the second half of the series, Romio and Persia’s relationship is really tested as they encounter more complex problems such as Romio’s brother.Watching a romantic comedy like this probably gets predictable if you’ve seen similar shows before.

At Dahlia Academy Boarding School, the “White Cats” and the “Black Dogs” operate on the assumption that the only way to resolve their differences, is through a school yard battle royal where anything goes.  Faces get punched.  Hair gets pulled.  Even more faces get punched.  Girls clothes get stripped off (you know, standard middle school happenings).  But...amidst all the chaos and lifelong brain damage, our main character, Romio Inuzuka, reveals his affection towards his Juliet and thus begins an awkward series of events where the two must conceal their relationship from the prying eyes of their compatriots.Romio is your typical too-cool-for-school badass, which makes sense because he’s almost never shown in the classroom, as he’s too busy courting Juliet or pounding her head in (he should have been pounding something else).  He’s not particularly smart, but his fiery passion and general oaf-ness make him somewhat entertaining.  I genuinely spat my coffee out when he lunged himself into that mirror.  But slapstick comedy only works for a limited time, as it becomes redundant rather quickly.  Nine out of ten jokes fell flat on their face, rendering much of the show as a tedious waste of time.Juliet, Romio’s love interest, is a trite Tsundere with little-to-no value in the comedic department.  Her main hook includes getting infuriated with Romio’s inane comments, followed by screaming at him and/or clobbering him (it gets old fast).  While staying focused on her goals of changing the world, she also exhibits moments of foolishness when she leaves a spoon in the microwave (not funny bro, that shit kills people).  In addition, due to her petite stature, Juliet looks three-to-four years younger than Romio, making their tender encounters seem a bit awkward.Boarding School Juliet, lamentably, is a show without a clear direction, nor is it consistent enough to entertain the viewer with its abundance of unavailing situational comedy.  Romantic situations between Romio and Juliet are surface level fluff, routinely devolving into lewd, hackneyed circumstances with little comedic value.   On the other hand, the “love square” — Romio loves Juliet; Hasuki loves Romio; Weslia loves Juliet — creates an interesting dynamic between the characters, particularly because the love that is accessible is not the one Romio or Juliet desire.  Boarding School Juliet does flesh out the relationship between Weslia and Juliet as children, but it leaves much to be desired.  Also, the dynamics of such a relationship are bromidic, especially when little-to-no nuance is added to differentiate itself from its — numerous — predecessor’s.The colorful artwork is so diversified that it hypnotizes the viewer into thinking they are looking into a kaleidoscope; unfortunately, this pristine look is impeccable beyond belief.  There is a thing as being too “perfect.”  Sometimes a sprinkling of “imperfection” can go a long way in creating an “authentic” environment.Why the producers of the show decided to emulate the story of Romeo and Juliet, when the characters and thematic elements are antithetical to the Bard’s classic is beyond any reasonable person’s rationalization.  So instead of concocting a convoluted reason as to why this happened (**cough**a lure to draw in more viewers**cough**), I decided to write a humorous poem to encapsulate my thoughts on the series.“Thou must have reckoned himself quite capable of tackling the Bard’s masterwork,But it was a far cry from a tear jerk; verily, it was an incomplete patchwork;Methinks’ the comedy soured the mind, combined with the unkind bitch whoConsidered herself refined;  Although she rode Romio similar to an equestrian,It was obvious she wanted to ride someone else, due to her being a lesbian;Love interests come and love interest go, but instead of Juliet I would have chosenThe ho;  If you dare question which ho I presuppose, any which one will do as longAs she takes off her clothes;  Watching this show became a terrible chore, and theVibrant colors elicited a pronounced eyesore; I mustn’t allow myself to becomeRemarkably incredulous, lest I wish to hasten my exodus via leaping from a largeEdifice; let it be known that this anime is no gem, as it was quite fortunate toReceive a three out of ten.”— Krunchyman amidst all the chaos and lifelong brain damage, our main character, Romio Inuzuka, reveals his affection towards his Juliet and thus begins an awkward series of events where the two must conceal their relationship from the prying eyes of their compatriots.Romio is your typical too-cool-for-school badass, which makes sense because he’s almost never shown in the classroom, as he’s too busy courting Juliet or pounding her head in (he should have been pounding something else).

The title of this series could as well be changed to ""Fuck You, William Shakespeare"" and that wouldn\'t even affect the level of subtle we have at hand. Make no mistake, however, this isn\'t a parody, this is just a disgrace.We have school settings here and the school is divided in two because people apparently really hate each others. In this other divided half -- called House White Cat, lives our Juliet, and in the another -- called House Black Dog, lives Romio....The daily school life of our students consists of people slapping each others in the face and acting like the opposing party members are total buttholes. While this is pretty much how different opinions work in irl and especially in politics, with Juliet\'s case there just is no reason to give a damn.Juliet herself is pretty much like every background anime girl ever except this time she got the role of a main. She hardly has any personality, and in generally, it is hard to even see why the main male lead would fall for her as she is just totally empty character. The main dude presents himself as some sort of cheap ""girls like guys like these, right?"" stereotype. He is practically one of those shojo love interests that solely exist in romance series until the girl realizes there is more to guys than their outlook... except this time he is the real main character. The only mildly interesting character and the only one who seems to have some sort of personality is Harusi from Black Dogs and she is used basically as an element in the series to a) create comedy and b) create some type of cheesy and completely improbable love interest alternative.If this series had more comedy or at least some comedy (it is supposed to be a comedy), maybe it would be at least entertaining in some way. Thus far, the pinnacle of the comedy was a scene where our main dude disappeared in the middle of an ongoing monologue aimed at him. Which is a thing that has occurred in approximately 3 gigazaillion other anime series already, most of which presented it better and had some characters with personalities so that the comedic moments came with at least some level of depth.Art is another thing that could easily make this series seem better and give some sort of glory and meaning to its events, but damn if ain\'t generic and cheap. I am mainly reminded of those low budget action anime series from the beginning of this decade where the coolest animation tricks were practically different colored light effects. This thing looks boring, sounds boring and is boring, and on top of that, has been going for worse since the beginning.

As a romantic comedy, it’s hard to keep up with the top shounen shows releasing every season. However, this show is surprisingly interesting and although can’t exactly be compare to the quality of the top shows airing right now, is still quite entertaining to watch.Story: Boarding School Juliet is a spin-off of the original “Romeo and Juliet”(which is quite obvious when you read the title), as it retains many of the same elements. This time, the two rival groups, the White Cats...and the Black Dogs continuously fight amongst each other with their leaders,Juliet Persia and Romeo Inuzuka, as the two star crossed lovers. These two groups are a part of the same school, but each compete to rise to the top and best the other. It’s your basic, simple storyline that has been overused, but still is enjoyable as we watch the two characters get into problematic, comedic, and romantic situations together.Characters: When it comes to characters, romantic comedies tend to fall very short, and Boarding School Juliet isn’t exactly any better. Inuzuka Romeo, although isn’t as dense as most harem show main characters, still retains the cliche dense archetype many in the audience despise and are tired of constantly seeing. There’s not much depth or uniqueness in his character, he still retains a predictable and overused personality. Juliet is not very different either, she also has a very shallow character with a predictable personality. In fact, how she even fell for Romeo seems very rushed with no development, how someone who was her life-long enemy suddenly became the love of her life in a mere instant.Art and Music: If you have read my past reviews, then you would know I don’t put too much stress on the art and music of a show. What matters most is the plot and the characters, great art and music alone can not get you anywhere. Moving on, Boarding School Juliet’s art is quite good, and I have nothing really to complain about it. The colors are bright and it fits nicely with the comedy of the show. Music is also great, as the opening is probably one of my favorite ones this season. Overall, solid animation and music production that fits nicely with the theme and mood of the show.Final Verdict: For many of us, romantic comedies are guilty pleasures, and I am not an exceptions. They’re fun to watch and many times the cuteness of the characters puts a smile on our faces. But the main problem with these type of shows and including Boarding School Juliet is the lack of strong characters and plot. It’s almost always the same predictable character archetype with a weak story to follow up on it. Boarding School Juliet is fun to watch, but it lacks two of the most important elements to truly entertain the audience. There is a lack of a strong theme or message or any powerful statement; this show like many others is simply there to make a select group of people have fun and that’s about it. Boarding School Juliet can bring many people excitement for a short period of time, but it’s a show that stays largely forgettable once it finishes airing. But if you are looking for a show for some quick enjoyment, then I recommend this show to you.Story:6 Characters:6 Art:8 Music:8 Enjoyment:7 Overall:7 and the Black Dogs continuously fight amongst each other with their leaders,Juliet Persia and Romeo Inuzuka, as the two star crossed lovers.

I think it was a theatrical play? Anyway this anime is a love comedy and did it do romcoms justice? Well it did decent enough.This anime is bursting with really well known voice actors and actresses from Kayano ai who voiced Darkness from Konosuba and Gintoki himself and many more well known voice actors and actresses. But the BGM doesn't shy away it is also top notch. But that isn't the best part about this anime the best part is the romcom itself. But that's about it. The story in this anime...is a tale as old as harem animes, it has a generic story that we have seen in many romcom animes.The story dodges cliches and makes a really good twist in the end of the 1st episode. But what really drawn me into this anime was because I was either laughing at the jokes or grinning on how cute the MCs are together. But it does not excuse on how generic their story is. There are a few good plot points in the story right now but those interesting plot points have been used in other animes as well and kinda make them a bit uninteresting.But there was one thing that surprised me the most in this anime they were able to make a really good emotional moment between the MC and a side character and balance both comedy and the emotional weight of the scene.I don't what's gonna happen in the next episodes but I if this anime keeps on surprising on really good moments like that and improves on the overall story then this might become an evne greater romcom then it already is. is a tale as old as harem animes, it has a generic story that we have seen in many romcom animes.The story dodges cliches and makes a really good twist in the end of the 1st episode.

Animation was fantastic, and I am very happy this didn't turn out to be just another harem anime. I think their relationship progressed a bit too slow and that Romeo was a bit childish not even being able to be close to her without blushing but nothing which degrades the score of the masterpiece this is. I honestly jumped out of happiness and excitement during the last episode and that is a strong 10 for me.Also this is not a spoiler of any storyline but the anime ended on manga-chapter 18, out of current 85. Material-wise this has every posibility for a season...2. 😍 2. 😍"", 'My first review so i am gonna keep it short :) A bit of spoilers*This Anime series takes the elements of Classical Shakespeare Story of Romeo and Juliet from a manga by Kaneda Yousuke , with the story of the two main characters Persia Juliet and Inuzuka Romio belonging to opposite factions ""The White Cats"" and ""The Black Dog"", who fall for each other and have to overcome difficulties on a daily basis to keep their relationship a secret from their factions and maintaining it while achieving their common goal which is achieving peace between the two factions and change the world while developing and...working on their relationship.The story is a mix of your generic Highschool romance and Comedy, also throwing in some serious moments at times and adapting elements of ancient time traditions and culture as its derived from the classical romeo and Juliet.Characters:Inuzuka Romio : A strong minded Mc with an angry,stubborn mindset at times, can be dense and clumsy. but caring for others and also most importantly honest and strong headed, also possess qualities shown time to time which is refreshing to see.Persia Juliet : A smart, skilled and a maiden figure, who leads by example, has a shy and loving, caring nature and wants to change the world starting by peace between the rival factions.Hasuki : Inuzuka\'s Childhood friend who is cheerful, smart, and really caring for the faction members and especially inuzuka and possesses many qualities to be one of the best girls.Char: Persia\'s friend who shows a dominating and sadistic side on the outside mostly but is really caring for Persia and in a way obsessed over her.There are more side characters too but have not stand out that much till now.Art: Studio LINDELFIELDS have done a really great job in terms of animation, keeping it Bright and colourful , great work in the detailing of the drawings, especially as many of the scenes contain old school type of buildings, romantic scenes and views.The depiction and presentation of an old school scenario where the series is taking place can actually be felt and it goes well with elements of the story.Music and soundtrack : Not much to discuss there but the background tracks are pretty well done, considering it blends well with the scenes in the anime. The Intro and outro songs are sung by well known artists Fripside and riho lida which are pretty good.Finally i would just like to say this is again a rom com series with a adaption of romeo and juliet a classic. if you like something to sit back relax and enjoy, with a bit of drama and emotional touching scenes with the main element of romance and comedy, then this anime is really worth the watch. working on their relationship.The story is a mix of your generic Highschool romance and Comedy, also throwing in some serious moments at times and adapting elements of ancient time traditions and culture as its derived from the classical romeo and Juliet.Characters:Inuzuka Romio : A strong minded Mc with an angry,stubborn mindset at times, can be dense and clumsy. but caring for others and also most importantly honest and strong headed, also possess qualities shown time to time which is refreshing to see.Persia Juliet : A smart, skilled and a maiden figure, who leads by example, has a shy and loving, caring nature and wants to change the world starting by peace between the rival factions.Hasuki : Inuzuka\'s Childhood friend who is cheerful, smart, and really caring for the faction members and especially inuzuka and possesses many qualities to be one of the best girls.Char: Persia\'s friend who shows a dominating and sadistic side on the outside mostly but is really caring for Persia and in a way obsessed over her.There are more side characters too but have not stand out that much till now.Art: Studio LINDELFIELDS have done a really great job in terms of animation, keeping it Bright and colourful , great work in the detailing of the drawings, especially as many of the scenes contain old school type of buildings, romantic scenes and views.The depiction and presentation of an old school scenario where the series is taking place can actually be felt and it goes well with elements of the story.Music and soundtrack : Not much to discuss there but the background tracks are pretty well done, considering it blends well with the scenes in the anime.

It borrows a couple of things such as the names Romeo (or in this case, ""Romio"") and Juliet, as well as the idea of 2 rival factions where the secret lovers are from, but that\'s about it for similarities.The show wastes no time in pairing the two together. Being secret lovers, they need to do all sorts of...antics to make sure their relationship stays hidden. The story isn\'t the most interesting and it\'s pretty generic, but that isn\'t necessarily a bad thing; it all depends on the execution.My main gripe with the show is the chemistry between the main leads. Their relationship just doesn\'t feel very interesting, and to a degree, almost one dimensional. They have a couple of cute and funny moments together, but I often find myself wanting to ""get it over with"" during scenes where they\'re alone. Romio is a little dense and his interactions with Juliet get a little too predictable. Likewise, Juliet is your typical ""goody two-shoes"" female lead and this just generally results in uninteresting dialogue and scenes. This wouldn\'t be too much of a problem, but the idea of the show is centered between these two characters and so far it just hasn\'t been doing it for me (hopefully this gets better in the later episodes).Thus it amuses me to say that interactions with every other character show seems so much more interesting; some of the best and funniest scenes are from the supporting characters. The relationships between the leads and side characters (e.g. Romio and Hasuki, Juliet and Char, Romio and his classmates) is so much more enjoyable to watch than the main relationship. But naturally, the show wants to push the whole Romio and Juliet thing, so we always end up circling back to it.The animation does look pretty good at times, especially during the action scenes; the accompanying music during said scenes is also pretty solid.I really do hope the show steps it up for the remaining episodes. If episode 4 is any indication (first episode with any emotional weight), then the rest of the show could be pretty decent. But then again, that episode wasn\'t centered around Romio and Juliet but rather Romio and (good girl) Hasuki, so who knows if things between the leads will become more interesting, especially if there\'ll be more focus later on. There\'s room for improvement so I\'m cautiously optimistic.Is it worth watching? If you don\'t mind the leads being a little bland, then sure. There\'s some good to be found in the show, but at this point it\'s really dependent on how much you can tolerate/ don\'t mind. antics to make sure their relationship stays hidden.

No seriously.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet takes a Romeo and Juliet story, add in a harem that makes ""some sense"" for the main couple and combine all that with the basis of Romeo and Juliet\'s family dispute to a school setting, as much as these statements makes it out like cliche, but it\'s in the details.Our titular Romeo and Juliet are taking place in Dahlia Academy Boarding School where there are two rivaling countries known as the White Cats where our Juliet Persia voiced by Ai Kayano is factioned where as the Black Doggies is...where Romio Inzuka voiced by Yuuki Ono is factioned. Romio and Persia both drives the plot forward, with Romio having a crush on Persia since childhood and wanting to help Persia to change society but their relationship is taboo in the eyes of the school to say the least. Persia trying to keep their relationship a secret and seeing both sides of society so she can change society and in a ways grow their relationship through it as well.Now the anime has a harem aspect, mainly with the harem element focusing on Romio and most of the time they are either allies or rivals turn support characters, like Hasuki Komai voiced by Ayane Sakura, Romio\'s childhood friend, Weslia Chartreux voiced by Yuu Shimamura being Persia\'s childhood friend and finally Teria and Kochou Wang voiced by Yui Ogura and Rina Hidaka as Black Doggy Prefects. Now Hasuki and Weslia probably gets the most development for the harem element as they aren\'t stereotypical childhood friends THOUGH they go through the same dilemma especially for Hasuki however Weslia gives us something unique especially towards her relationship with Persia making her actions rather unpredictable throughout the anime making things interesting, Hasuki is undyingly loyal to Romio unfortunately she goes through the typical childhood friend dilemma just under differing circumstances. Kochou and Teria however arrived a bit too late and get one focused episode in which they become an obstacle for Romio trying to get a date with Persia go awry. Nonetheless the harem aspect might be tacked in, nonetheless Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet does make good use of it.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is best when it looks into Romio and Juliet\'s growth as a couple and heck even using the harem aspect to show differing aspects of Romio and Persia through their strengths and weakness about themselves, like Romio sacrificing his desire for the happiness of others, Persia\'s desire of changing the school through their relationship as a linchpin to see both sides of the White Cats and Black Doggies, but for both wanting them to grow their relationship to further both their goals to change the world as a result and because of that, strengthening the main couple further. Because of this, LA sees Persia as LA\'s favorite character in the series, with Hasuki being a close second and Weslia third.In terms of animation done by LIDENFILMS, the animation quality from the backgrounding was pretty decent, the character designs are polished and detailed throughout the anime and the few battles are decent as well due to the decent sword choreography but tends to do moving still speedlines at times. To say the least LA feels like the character designs are the best part of the animation, as most of the characters look exotic and distinct even in uniform!. LIDENFILMS did decently overall.In terms of voice acting, LA will say that voice work was very well done, from Ai Kayano to Yuu Shimamura to Ayane Sakura. The majority if not all the voice cast was pretty well handled. LA LOVED Ai Kayano as Persia but Ayane Sakura as Hasuki was just meant to be, while Yuu Shimamura just owned as Weslia with her intentionally smarmy trickster ojou cadence. It\'s also been a while since LA saw an anime where Rina Hidaka and Yui Ogura were in the same anime AND both being twins at that. Yuuki Ono also did pretty well as Romio and Hiroshi Kamiya as Scott Fold. LA loved this voice cast to say the least.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet does have the notion if the names of the characters are anything to go by and that is of the ""White Cats"" , ""Black Doggy"", Romio and Juliet, Persia, Scott Fold, Hasuki...yes the rivalry countries have their own social hierarchy because of it. The White Cats are aristocrats and work off that notion, they also represent the West, right down to their Western regal attire and mannerisms, while the Black Doggy represent the East, many characters having Japanese names at that and also wearing Japanese school attire. It goes deeper when we see the White Cats and Black Doggy\'s hierarchy and how they function...LA doesn\'t know LA really liked that dynamic and how Persia herself wants that to change as a result.However Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet has some flaws through all this however which LA DOES need to mention. LA brought up Hasuki having the childhood friend dilemma as well as the many cliches that has the harem elements, BUT as much as Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet does follow many cliches of the harem genre, Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet still does it\'s cliche WELL and better yet uses it\'s cliches to better the main characters and the harem themselves making the majority of the characters likable and memorable. Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet\'s cliche though they use it well it is nonetheless using cliche and that might annoy some people, not to mention the fanservice of Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet gets extremely risky though that is only happens once, but LA will defend the fanservice as they use it sparingly. Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet\'s flaws does have it\'s flaws but alot of defense to outweigh it all.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet\'s finale does have similarities to the classic Romeo and Juliet though through the typical famous event and if your wondering, the finale does the ""read the light novel"" type ending but not in a unsatisfied way as the finale does make Romio and Persia go through hurdles and hurdles in order for them to keep their lie hidden harder and harder and almost exposed and to progress to their ultimate goal of changing the world and with all the tension to this finale and really with how this finale resulted in, well LA was satisfied by it even with this ""read the light novel"" type ending, a resolution from both main focused characters and a somewhat good climax.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet for LA was a pretty well done retelling of the classic Romeo and Juliet story but taken to anime standards. Sure Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet has lots of typical flaws that the harem genre it entails but nonetheless Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet\'s strengths definitely outweigh all this, from the likable relationship of Romio and Juliet and it not being the relationship being the sole focus as both Romio and Persia grow individually with the harem elements added in and through the harem, they too grow with them be it if they know of Romio and Persia\'s relationship or not especially with Hasuki and Weslia, thus incorporating it\'s harem elements well. Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet may be a typical harem anime just with the Romeo and Juliet setting, but man was it done well and one of the more surprisingly good harem anime of Fall 2018 but also good romance anime as well. where Romio Inzuka voiced by Yuuki Ono is factioned.

Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is just like that.Nostalgic because of its resemblance with the anime we watched during our younger days, Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet may be seen as something good, or at least tolerable to watch, when it's not.Sure, maybe the relationship between the two main characters is cute and all that, but it's not worth the watch when everything else (other characters, plot, setting) is plainly mediocre.The opening deceives (It deceived me) and make you think this...is an actual good anime, but it's not. I guess some episodes are fun, but overall it's pretty weak. is an actual good anime, but it's not. I guess some episodes are fun, but overall it's pretty weak."", 'Totally spoiler-free short review with almost no mentions of plot. A review on objective points of an anime:Art:One of the most important things about an anime is the art! Boarding School Juliet\'s art is good enough to be graded as ""A"" or ""B+"". Its art is not superb; its drawers draw them pretty averagely, like how some normal studios draw. Another important part of the art is its consistency - is  the art always good enough to be average throughout all the episodes released so far? Unfortunately- no, but it\'s still ignorable. In episode 5, the quality drops a bit, making it obvious something...was rushed.Sound:The OP sounds like it was sung by Yoshino Nanjo; her songs are always nice to hear. The ED is also very melodical and worth listening to.The VAs don\'t sound awkward at all! I think one factor that makes the non-awkwardness of the VAs possible is actually the director\'s decision on how to animate things (for example - for how many seconds does the director want this and that scene to last). Fortunately, it seems that the VAs were given enough time to speak fluently and naturally, with nothing rushed.Story:The director did a good job, in my opinion, on not rushing things. It seems that many anime has their quality dropped because of rushing. Fortunately this is not one of them. It has a nice pace.The story itself is entertaining! Some might say that it is cliche, but it only is in the first episode. You stay on the ride for this anime because of the comedy (I did). It\'s a new rom-com that I haven\'t watched in a long time.You have to keep the 3-episode rule for this anime. My opinion of this anime improved after I watched the third episode.  I think it\'s because the first episode gives a boring introduction of the characters, and the second episode mildly starts trying to make the viewer interested. In the third episode, some more characters are introduced and things get more dynamic - with the dynamicity, entertainment also started for me.Characters:Characters can only go so deep in a 12 episode series. It is especially so if it is a rom-com. Too much character depth isn\'t neccessary in a rom-com (I guess). One thing I can remember to commend about this anime\'s characters is that they don\'t irritate you.I enjoy rom-com a lot, and I just felt very entertained when I watched this so I want to give it a 9. However, maybe a more objective and critical opinion would give it an 8.Edit: after having watched more recent episodes, I have to take back my opinion on consistent art and not rushing. I guess it\'s inevitable that a 12 episode series has to pack in a lot of content in a short amount of time leading it to make things look less smooth, but it\'s still true that this anime still delivers at least average art and animation throughout the episodes so far. was rushed.Sound:The OP sounds like it was sung by Yoshino Nanjo; her songs are always nice to hear.

Capulet to a hilarious degree-\xa0 \'The West\' Seriously, why name the Capulets that?Characters:Romio and Juliet (better known as their last names of Inuzuka and Persia) are certainly quite the pair in this rendition.\xa0 Inuzuka is an outwardly scary but ultimately a determined and loyal person with a heart of gold.\xa0 Like a dog.\xa0 Persia is a proud and independent girl who has her moments of being cute and taking out her claws within a few scenes.\xa0 Like a cat.\xa0 (Huh, starting to see the duality here.)\xa0 Together, they make the show\'s dumb/main couple that I honestly can\'t do anything but root for.\xa0 They are ultimately each other\'s motivation for their actions, and you see a lot of that culminate in the final act of each episode before starting the process over with a

other\'s strengths and flaws are at the core of their love despite the ridiculous and vaguely comical setting they\'re in.Recurring characters like Hasuki, Princess Char (and Scott), and a few others primarily serve as blockades or obstacles to the main couple\'s relationship, often times having an episode where they are the main contributor to the conflict before mildly intervening or supporting at various points in the series.\xa0 They grow along nicely thanks to the harsh reality that they just have to deal with the fact that their friend is \'dating the enemy\', which isn\'t as annoying as it could\'ve been, so that on its own is a major boon for the series cause it makes these potential roadblocks better characters in the end.This factor also extends to the setting since the show really goes to a hilarious amount of lengths to show how much the two sides hate each other, often times having either faceless background characters or background characters with faces shouting obscenities at each other which is somehow more gratifying than it should be when the main couple does some \'traitorous actions\' cause they just want to either be left alone or spend time with their significant other.Overview:+\xa0 Active and prominent protagonists+\xa0 Side cast adds to the story instead of subtracts+\xa0 Side cast helps to embolden the rivalryArt:Produced by Lidenfilms, the art

and an anime version of Romeo and Juliet sounded right up my alley for a good time.\xa0 What I was not expecting was a competent plot followed by characters and a couple that I actually cared for and

that reason aside from some genuine care put into making a proper anime (and more enjoyable) rendition of Romeo and Juliet makes me give this show a stamp of approval for something if you\'re looking for pure enjoyment factor.\xa0 At the very least, the show\'s a fun watch, and definitely deserves a chance even if you hated the original Shakespeare\'s play that you were forced to do reading and a report on. of two rivaling countries: \'Touwa\' and \'The West\'.\xa0 On Dahlia Island is the boarding school where there\'re two dormitories based on the rivaling countries: The White Cats for \'The West\', and the Black Dogs for Touwa.\xa0 In the midst of this rivalry, our protagonist Inuzuka Romio of the Black Dogs confesses to the leader of the White Cats, Persia Juliet, and the two begin a forbidden relationship where getting caught would most definitely cause a war between the rivaling sides.First off, I want to ask.\xa0 \'The West\'?\xa0 Seriously?\xa0 You couldn\'t come up with a better name for the Capulet/Britain side of this equation?\xa0 I\'m kinda disappointed if only for how lazy it sounds when you put it next to \'Touwa\'.There\'s really no better way to explain this show other than \'Anime Version of Romeo and Juliet\'.\xa0 Seriously; even the protagonists are named that.\xa0 But I think that simplification is giving the show not enough credit.\xa0 While the setting is certainly reminiscent to the Shakespearian work, in actuality, the show is more about the relationship between the protagonists and how both each other and some of their closest peers react to what\'s being fostered between the two.\xa0 There\'s a real attempt at further developing the \'tragic romance\' of the original story, and that ultimately turns the story into one where the two halves of the couple develop into better characters all the way towards the end.Because of this, I found myself weirdly engrossed in the story, really rooting for the mildly dumb couple as more and more wrenches are thrown into their plans of things like going on a date or just speaking to each other on school grounds.\xa0 Not only that, but typical anime tropes like sports festivals and birthdays get \'Romeo and Juliet\'ified so had that it actually feels fresh, if not a little dumb when you don\'t keep in mind that this is an anime rendition.\xa0 The ending caps everything in this manner too, giving a satisfying enough ending to elude to a ""read the manga"" ending, but still being paced and written well enough ti serve as its own standalone ending.All in all, what can be said about \'Boarding School Juliet\' is it being a show that despite being basically an anime parody of Romeo and Juliet, is actually a decent romance story based off of the concept that is way more fun to watch than any actual faithful telling of Shakespeare\'s work I\'ve ever seen or read.\xa0 You actually get to see the relationship grow through the episodes, and just adding that layer made it way better than I ever thought it to be.Overview:+ Actual growing Relationship+ Everything is \'Romeo and Juliet\'/Montague v. Capulet to a hilarious degree-\xa0 \'The West\' Seriously, why name the Capulets that?Characters:Romio and Juliet (better known as their last names of Inuzuka and Persia) are certainly quite the pair in this rendition.\xa0 Inuzuka is an outwardly scary but ultimately a determined and loyal person with a heart of gold.\xa0 Like a dog.\xa0 Persia is a proud and independent girl who has her moments of being cute and taking out her claws within a few scenes.\xa0 Like a cat.\xa0 (Huh, starting to see the duality here.)\xa0 Together, they make the show\'s dumb/main couple that I honestly can\'t do anything but root for.\xa0 They are ultimately each other\'s motivation for their actions, and you see a lot of that culminate in the final act of each episode before starting the process over with a similar or different obstacle in the way.\xa0 You see them grow from each other, care for each other, really making everything feel like a genuine relationship where trust and acceptance for each other\'s strengths and flaws are at the core of their love despite the ridiculous and vaguely comical setting they\'re in.Recurring characters like Hasuki, Princess Char (and Scott), and a few others

You have been warned.Based off a popular manga of the same name Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet better known as Boarding school Juliet is a romance comedy themed anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you reimagine the classic romance story of Romeo and Juliet and replace the feuding families with two rival countries who send students to a neutral boarding school and the...many rivalries, bonds, friendships and romances that can occur when students from rival countries compete with each other in the many events that are unique to school-based settings. The main concept for boarding school Juliet naturally is the famed romance story of the same name a story that due to its blend of tragedy and romance has garnered an impressive reputation over the years since it become known and since reading it in school it has become one of my favorite stories. As a result, when I heard that this anime will make use of a reimagined story where it will replace the stories tragedy with comedy and its family feuds with the tense relations between two countries that are inches away from war, I have to say that my interest was piqued. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me as it not only did a great job of showing the kind of tense relations that existed within the schools two main factions but also introduced both an intriguing cast of characters and the sense of forbidden feelings that exist between Romio and Juliet.The overall story of Boarding school Juliet takes place in Dahlia academy a private boarding school that is situated in a remote island that’s far from the mainland. Here in this remote but beautiful academy students from two of the continents main powers which are the Eastern nation of Touwa and the Principality of the West are sent to attend and receive their education before graduating and joining the society. But while the academy and the surrounding town are beautiful and provide the students with everything that they can possibly need for their time at the academy the students of the two nations that attend the academy as if mirroring the true situation that exists between their respective homelands have rather than forge bonds of friendships with their opposite numbers and try to enjoy their school life in relative peace instead does the opposite. Rather than strive for a peaceful environment as one would expect the students from both sides instead form two factions that are centered around their respective dorms that see each other as hated rivals. These two factions are the White Cats that represent the students from the principality of the West and the Black Dogs that represent the students from the Eastern nation of Touwa.In the midst of this endless struggle where both sides would make use of every opportunity and school event to prove their superiority over the other in their quest to satisfy their pride is Romio Inuzuka the youngest son of the famed Inuzuka family of the Eastern nation of Touwa who while brought up to show nothing but dislike for the members of the principality of the west and by extension the white cats that serve them has a hidden secret that he hides desperately from his comrades. For unknown to them Romio actually has a massive crush on Juliet Persia who is his opposite number within the white cats. After a dramatic confession that came after a equally dramatic dual between the two Romio while managing to forge a romance between him and his crush also finds himself embarking on a wild and high staked adventure as he and Juliet must while gradually getting to know each other and forge deeper bonds with each other must work hard to keep their forbidden romance from not just the school authorities but also their closest friends for if their liaison is revealed they would not only bring great shame to their factions but also to their countries and families as well. Joining Romio and Juliet’s little high staked adventure are a host of characters that while initially against the idea gradually approve of it. These include the positive and caring Hasuki, the proud but equally cunning Weslia, the quiet and timid Teria and her older sister the mischievous but surprisingly kind Kochou. Together Romio and Juliet and their many allies must do all they can to keep their romance hidden from both the school prefects and their equally suspicious dorm mates as they go about their school life and live the life of a normal student and maybe one day be able to graduate and make the changes to society that both so much desire.Juliet PersiaJuliet Persia portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Three Gatsu no Lion and Grandcrest Senki fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 1st year student of Dahlia academy Boarding school and the student leader of the 1st year high school division of the White Cats faction Juliet on initial appearances can be seen to be a brave, kind and understanding person by nature whose beauty and grace have earned her the title of Lady Persia among her dorm mates. A polite, hardworking and modest person by nature Juliet while a noble by birth is shown to have none of the typical traits that such people exhibit and indeed rather than showing arrogance and pride instead shows consideration to all that she meets in school provided that the opposite party isn’t acting in a threatening manner. While possessing both intelligence and beauty in spades Juliet is someone that’s noted to be a responsible and loyal person that always places the wellbeing of her friends over herself a fact that is shown well within the series. While having the air of a noble it can be seen that Juliet isn’t just a lovely flower for beneath her beauty Juliet is shown to be fiercely independent that’s reinforced by a strong will to prove herself to not just the world but to his friends as well. This is shown well within the series in the serious side that Juliet shows when standing up for her beliefs where both her determination and inspirational nature can clearly be seen.  True to this aspect of her personality Juliet is also shown to be somewhat of a realist and is someone that prefers to hear everything that transpires in an event before deciding on a decision on the steps that she should take something that I really appreciate about her character and something that I thought placed her in good stead as she began coming to grips with the struggles that existed within the school.As the series goes on and Juliet’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her confident and kind nature Juliet also has many struggles that she hides from all but her closest friends. While shown to not just have confidence but also an impressively strong will as the series goes on it can be seen that this is just her surface personality as beneath this Juliet is shown to be surprisingly fragile. While largely content and understanding of the role in which she must play within both the school and society it’s shown that Juliet is someone that dislikes being seen as weak and being pitied that stems largely from the great pride that she feels for her family. As a result of this Juliet is someone that tries hard to shoulder all the burdens, aspirations and criticisms that are placed on her something that her closest friends constantly worry about. While content with the role that she must play within the school however it can be seen that Juliet also understands that the current state of things within the school cannot be sustained and as a result works hard to foster better relations between the two sides within it hoping to create a better world and hopefully change the rules that govern it. In the beginning of the series largely as a result of her status as a noble Juliet was shown to struggle somewhat with placing her trust in others and as a result while she had no real shortage of friends that she can count on to help her she had few people that she can call true friends who she can reveal her true feelings too. Largely as a result Juliet’s interaction with Romio, in the beginning, was shown to be rather guarded as if she expected to be betrayed at any moment. However, as the series goes on and their relationship deepened this began to change with Juliet not only learning to trust not just Romio but also many of her dorm mates and in the process discovering that friendships are something that can cross both borders and social classes. A realization that served to make Juliet realize that her determination to hide her true feelings from her friends while serving to protect their image of her also served to make it harder for people to understand and help her achieve her goals. In light of this realization Juliet began to slowly open up more of her heart to others especially to Romio and while still possessing the confident and dignified traits that define her Juliet also begins to show a more joking and teasing side to him while also showing a gentler side to her personality. The character of Juliet I felt was an interesting character whose confident and strong-willed nature contrasted greatly with the surprisingly fragile inner self that she hid from her friends. Her gradual development from someone who had trouble not just with trusting others but also with revealing her true feelings to someone that was able to forge bonds easily with others while being more open with her emotions and feelings I thought was done well and demonstrated the kind of knowledge that she gained from her relationship with Romio.Romio InuzukaRomio Inuzuka portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Angolmois and Granblue Fantasy fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 1st year of student of Dahlia academy and the student leader of the 1st year high school division of the Black Dogs faction Romio on initial appearances can be seen to be an honorable, brave and confident person by nature that rather than rely on strategy and planning is one that prefers to act in the moment. However, while appearing brash to others as a result Romio is also shown to be an intelligent and perceptive person that’s quite capable of determining the perfect moment to strike at their opponents. While appearing to be grumpy, quiet and possessing a grim aura about him that most assume would mean that he prefers to settle things with fists rather than words its perhaps surprising to note that Romio is someone that prefers to avoid conflict. But due in part to his indecisive nature, these attempts to solve situations via such means often fail to amusing results.As the series goes on however and more of Romio’s personality is revealed Romio’s personality gradually begins to change. At the beginning of the series Romio while possessing both intelligence and confidence was widely seen as being indecisive and lets his sense of honor get the better of him when trying to create plans that would harm their rivals. However, as the series goes on this begins to change. While still retaining his core qualities Romio gradually comes to realize that his indecisive nature while serving to protect him well from potential failure also served to make his attempts to forge bonds with others a major hurdle and that his attempts to protect others which while serving to show his responsible nature also had the unfortunate effect of creating a mistaken belief that he was pitying them. As a result of these revelations, Romio began to try to actively change his personality. While still retaining the caring and responsible nature that he shows to his friends Romio starts to take great care in trying to understand the core reasons that are behind someone’s behavior and try to take actions that would help them solve the problems that ail them. This is best shown when he treated Juliet with fairness during the sports day tournament as well as in his attempt to help Kochou and Teria solve the reason for their inner sadness and thus showing that in addition to becoming more caring and perceptive Romio also learned through his interactions with Juliet how to be considerate as well. While still appearing brash at times it can be seen that Romio also developed a certain amount of cunning within him and is capable of creating some rather creative plans that can be called upon when pressed into desperate situations which is best shown when he takes advantage of the bond that he forged with Kochou and Teria to aid him in his plan to surprise Juliet. The character of Romio Inuzuka I felt was an interesting one whose initial personality traits of nervousness and indecisiveness contrasted well with his initial image of a grumpy male whose grim aura suggested he preferred to act with his fists rather than words. Romio’s gradual development from a quiet and indecisive person to someone that was not just considerate but also understanding of the true feelings of others as a result of his deepening bond with Juliet I thought was handled well within the series.HasukiHasuki Komai portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Psycho Pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Romio’s able right hand among the Black Dogs. A 1st year of Dahlia academy and a member of the 1st year high school division of the Black Dogs faction Hasuki on initial appearances can be seen to be a positive, cheerful and caring person by nature that has earned her great fame within the Black Dogs. A proactive, determined and intelligent person by nature Hasuki while remaining cool and level-headed most of the time is also shown to have a rather short fuse within her that can easily get lit if either the Black Dogs or Inuzuka get slandered a sight that is always a sight to see when it happens. Despite her fiery nature Hasuki is shown to have a soft spot for her childhood friend and superior Romio and shows genuine care and affection for him when she can show well the kind of feelings that she has for him. Perhaps more than anyone within the Black Dogs Hasuki can be seen to be the one person that understands Romio the most and this is something that can be seen easily in the interactions that she has with Romio where she demonstrates the ability to easily see through his lies and at the same time being able to see when something is bothering him.As the series goes on and Hasuki’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Hasuki as a result of her loyalty towards the Black Dogs also has hidden side to her that’s only unleashed when exams take place within the school. This personality that I like to call the director is markedly different to her usual personality as in this form Hasuki is serious, inspirational and has an aura about her that exudes both authority and fear which is helped greatly by the fact that she also dons a teacher like outfit that aids greatly in reinforcing the impression that here she’s a teacher. Rather than treat her fellows with the warmth and care that she’s known for in this form Hasuki is shown to treat them coldly and exhibiting an icy personality that’s akin to a Tsundere. However, while certainly harsh in this form it can be seen that Hasuki is serious about teaching her fellows and ensuring that they all manage to pass the tests successfully. As the series proceeds it can be seen easily that one of Hasuki’s most prominent traits is the loyalty that she has towards her friend and superior Romio a sense of loyalty that ensures that even if everyone dislikes him and views him as an enemy, she will remain by his side to provide him all the support that he needs. This sense of loyalty I felt was interesting as it highlighted very well not just the depth of the feelings that she has for him but also of her desire to repay the debt that she feels that she owes him. However, amusingly enough it can be seen that strong as this bond can be it also has a breaking point as well as shown in Hasuki’s chase of Romio after his confession of his love for Juliet where she amusingly chased him down with a replica sword while adapting a chilling and tenacious personality in the process. The character of Hasuki I felt was an interesting character who within the series functioned well as Romio’s friend and emotional support. In particular while only shown briefly I felt that the contrasting personalities that Hasuki has were interesting as they showed not just how loyal and committed, she was to her dorm mates but also to Romio as well.Weslia ChartreuxWeslia Chartreux portrayed by veteran seiyuu Yuu Shimamura of Koi to Uso and Owari No Seraph fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is a member of the White Cats. A 1st-year student of Dahlia academy and a member of the 1st high school division of the White Cats faction Weslia like Juliet is a member of a noble house and indeed is also the first princess of the Principality of the West.  A childhood friend of Juliet Weslia who prefers to be called by the name Char on initial appearances is seen to be a proud, confident and a somewhat arrogant person by nature that acts somewhat like a typical spoiled princess that’s used to getting what she wants. An intelligent, courteous and cunning person by nature Char while appearing to be a beautiful, cheerful and polite young woman is, in reality, someone that’s the complete opposite. Beneath her cheerful nature Char is shown to be something akin to a trickster for while she often demands strange things from her enemies and allies alike, she also enjoys teasing and pranking them with everything from simple pranks to outright blackmail all to satisfy her desire to seek some kind of fun in the moment.As the series goes on however and more of Char's personality is revealed it can be seen that Char's personality while partly an act also functions as a sort of shield that hides her own feelings that she has about her life. On the surface while widely seen as a trickster and also a violent person by many which has earned her the rather unflattering nickname of the violent princess of the west beneath this it can be seen that Char is someone that cares deeply about the well being of her friends and allies with the strong bond that she has with Juliet being the best example of this. To Char, it’s obvious that Juliet is someone that can be seen to be the center of Char's pride and joy and is someone that she views as akin to a treasure. Given this fact it's perhaps unsurprising that Char’s initial view of her relationship with Romio and her impression of him was a poor one a fact that she did not bother sugarcoating for him when she made that clear. However, as Char began to see the types of changes that Juliet’s relationship with Romio caused and also as a result of seeing just how dedicated and serious he was about it this changed not only her opinion regarding the two but also began to change her own personality as well. while still retaining her usual trickster like personality Char gradually starts to change becoming kinder to others and learning to show consideration to others and more willing to admit her own errors of judgment traits that would have been hard to see in the past. Arguably the greatest change within Char’s personality was the realization that not everyone in the world is willing to bend their knees to fulfill her often selfish requests and that maybe its time to change her ways. The character of Char I felt was an interesting one for while on the one hand her love of pranks and jokes provided plenty of comedy moments within the series the character of char also provided to Juliet the first person that can truly be seen as a close friend to her and one that she can eventually confide in when the opportunity presented itself something that I felt was especially important to both Romio and Juliet as their relationship improved.TeriaTeria Wan portrayed by veteran seiyuu Yui Ogura of Kamisama no Memochou and Vivid Strike fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Romio’s allies within the series. A 14-year-old girl and a second-year student of Dahlia academy’s Black dog’s faction Teria like her twin sister Kochou are members of the academies prefect’s unit. A quiet, timid and somewhat innocent person by nature Teria like Kochou is an expert in a specific field whose expertise in them was what allowed them to skip grades and proceed straight to the second year of high school despite their young age. In Teria’s case, she’s an expert in engineering with a particular focus on machinery.  In contrast to her, more outgoing older sister Teria is someone that can be seen to be calm and composed and true to her expertise in engineering is also seen to be someone that prefers to observe and plan out her moves before committing to them. In a way, it can be said that Teria’s nature also acts well as a foil for her sister’s antics as she is able to keep her focused and on track with their duties as prefects.Similar to her sister Teria is shown to be thankful for the fact that their intelligence managed to allow them to get to high school despite their young age. However, unlike her sister Teria is shown to view the position and role of a prefect with some amount of disdain. While Teria is shown to be dutiful towards her role as a prefect and understands the responsibilities that comes from being one it would seem that she is less concerned with handing out the correct punishment and seems to be more lenient with the rules than other prefects. At the same time despite reaching the role of a prefect at such a young age Teria rather than showing any sign of being proud of the role seems to exhibit the opposite in that she seems rather lonely. From looking at the interactions that she has with both Romio and her sister it can inferred that this sense of loneliness is due to the fact that being prefects means that she and her sister are unable to have the normal high school lives that most girls their age would be able to enjoy due to both the fear that their role generates and the time that they have to spend on their duties. This sense of fear continued until an unexpected encounter with an underclassman of hers opened her heart and made her realize the fear that she had been trying so hard to hide from others. In the aftermath of this revelation Teria largely due to this begins to markedly change in personality. While still quiet and shy to a degree Teria starts to gradually take her first steps of entering high school by not just learning to form friendships with others but also learn to form opinions by herself and not take cues from her sister as she would have done in the past. At the same time, she was also willing to take the initiative and stand up for what she believes in which is best shown when she tried to shield Romio from his brother.KochouKochou Wan portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sword Art Online and Ryuuou no Oshigoto fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Romio’s allies within the series. A 14-year-old girl and a second-year student of Dahlia academies Black Dog faction Kochou like her younger sister Teria are members of the academy’s prefect unit. Like her sister, Kochou is an expert in a specific field that allowed her to skip grades and become a 2nd year at such a young age. In her case, she’s an expert in pharmacy with particular focus in its use in medicine. From initial appearances, Kochou can be seen to be a mischievous, and cunning person by nature that seems to love teasing others and having fun at their expense. Despite this, it can be seen that Kochou views her role as a prefect with something akin to pride and would easily get angry if someone insults either her or the role of a prefect. Unlike her younger sister, Kochou is shown to someone that’s quick to anger and seems to take offense at people who make fun of her figure or looks down on her due to her age or height. As a result of the pride that she feels towards being a prefect Kochou is noted to approach her role with both determination and tenacity and would try hard to complete her assigned duty until either she completes it or her target escapes showing how driven she can be.Despite the strong pride that she feels towards the role of being a prefect Kochou can be seen to place a heavy importance on the main role that prefects should be encouraging. While Kochou understands that part of a prefect’s role is to maintain discipline among the students she also believes that prefects should also strive to guide those that have no talent on to the correct path and to protect them when needed. From this, it can be seen that Kochou is of the belief that talent and not age is the factor that’s most important for people a belief that no doubt came from the complex and struggle that comes being looked down by others due to their age and the authority that others feel they don’t deserve. In line with her determination to guide students is Kochou’s rather curious determination to protect the happiness that students can experience in school which is shown well during the festival in which she in conjunction with her sister acted to break up a fight that if left unchecked would have the effect of causing the fireworks display to be canceled. This showed not just how dedicated she is to the role of being a peacekeeper but also how kind she really is as a person something that I really enjoyed seeing with her character. Similar to her sister after their encounter with Romio Kochou’s personality also began to exhibit changes. While still retaining her teasing and mischievous nature Kochou also starts to think somewhat outside of the box and instead of merely following instructions from her superiors starts to think and act on her feelings. This is shown in the times that she and her sister would infiltrate Romio’s room to have fun and also in the care that she shows to Romio in the aftermath of the surveillance order that was given by her superior and thus showing the increased bond of trust that had been formed between them. The character of Kochou I felt was an interesting one whose introduction to the series helped introduce a great amount of comedy into the series thanks to the many interactions that she has with Romio.AMVIn terms of animation, I thought that the series animation was really impressive being both sharp and clear. I felt that the academy and the town while being beautiful to look at also featured a great variety of locations that was not just well designed but also showed great variety in terrain types as well. The character designs for the series I felt was pretty well done with the uniforms that the two sides wear doing a great job of not just showing the colors of the two countries that the students represent but also in contrasting and showing the differences that lie between the two sides whether in terms of the nature of the individual students and the different culture in which they come from. This contrast between the two sides I feel is also shown well in the physical appearances of the cast specifically in the hair and eye colors that the students from the two sides exhibit that I felt have a synergy effect with the uniform colors that both sides wear and help reinforce the idea that the rivalry between the two sides is not simply a small scare one but in fact one that carries great weight on a national level.Music wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Love With You that was sung by Fripside and Someday Until The World changes that were performed by Riho Iida both of which I thought were catchy songs that resonated well with the series main theme of a teenage love story. The series OST I felt also did a solid job of providing good support for the various scenes that were in the anime.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Ai Kayano, Yuki Ono, Ayane Sakura, Yuu Shimamura, Yui Ogura and Rina Hidaka deserve special praise as I thought that they all did a fantastic job of portraying the characters of Juliet, Romio, Hasuki, Weslia, Teria and Kochou. In addition, I feel that the series also featured a great supporting cast of characters that did well in enhancing the story by injecting both much-needed tension and hilarity within the series. In this I feel that Tomokazu Sugita who portrayed the character of Chizuru Maru, Daisuke Ono who portrayed the character of Airu Inuzuka, Eri Kitamura who portrayed the character of Somali Longhaired and Hiroshi Kamiya who portrayed the character of Scott Fold all did a fantastic job of playing their respective characters who did much to enhance the overall story.Overall conclusionIn overall Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet was an anime that I really enjoyed, and I would say that it’s definitely one of the best animes for this season. Its main strong points, In my opinion, was its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters, sweet and well-designed romance moments between Romio and Juliet and excellent voice acting.The overall premise of Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet which is its reimagining of the classic romance tragedy that served as its main inspiration and its replacement of the tragedy element with that of a romantic comedy as well as its replacement of the classic family feud and ancient Italy setting with the tense relations between two factions whose homelands are being subjected to a tense peace treaty that can be undone at the sign of a single spark I thought was definitely one of the series highlights. Having the main setting of the series be a school where students from both of these nations attend to receive their education before moving into society to help advance their nations goals I thought was also rather creative as while it allowed the students from both sides to enter a setting where they will all enter regardless of their origin while at the same time creating an area where their respective feuds would not just be out of place but also serve as a perfect opportunity to allow the concept of forbidden love to manifest. All of these elements I thought really synergized well with each other to truly make a premise that was unique to this series.The overall story of the series I felt made great use of this premise as while it did well in showing the kind and depth of the rivalries that can exist between the two countries and their subordinate factions It also did well in introducing the two main leads of the series in the form of the student leader of the White Cats and the Black Dogs who in this case was Juliet Persia and Romio Inuzuka. The forbidden romance between the two that served as the crux of the story I thought made great use of the rivalry between their two respective factions as a backdrop as it showed not only their determination to both stay loyal to their respective countries but also did well to show the inner struggles that both have in relation to them as well. Seeing the two of them try to both overcome the ingrained animosity that exists between the two sides and try to break out of their shells as they try to both make the romance between them work and learn about their respective struggles and wishes in the process was something that I really enjoyed seeing. This struggle to both change and at the same time make their romance work within the series was shown well in the many sweet romantic moments that were shown in the series that showed the kind of effort that both were trying to make in an effort to not just change the world but also their lives as well. These cute moments I felt were also used well in conjunction with the school events that were featured within the series such as the sports day event as while the former did well in showing the advancement in the romance between the two the latter allowed us to see the kind of determination that exists in them in their desire to help each other overcome the struggles that they are wrestling with in their own way while providing us with some background amusement in the form of the antics that both perform during the latter event.Overall Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that it handled its use of both the core romance story and the many themes that it introduced into the story and premise relatively well to create a pretty fresh take on the classic tale of Romio and Juliet. It's balancing of comedy moments with the romance and the character development of both the main and support cast was something that I especially enjoyed seeing as well. In terms of the final score, I would say that it easily deserves a final score of 10/10. many rivalries, bonds, friendships and romances that can occur when students from rival countries compete with each other in the many events that are unique to school-based settings. The main concept for boarding school Juliet naturally is the famed romance story of the same name a story that due to its blend of tragedy and romance has garnered an impressive reputation over the years since it become known and since reading it in school it has become one of my favorite stories. As a result, when I heard that this anime will make use of a reimagined story where it will replace the stories tragedy with comedy and its family feuds with the tense relations between two countries that are inches away from war, I have to say that my interest was piqued. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me as it not only did a great job of showing the kind of tense relations that existed within the schools two main factions but also introduced both an intriguing cast of characters and the sense of forbidden feelings that exist between Romio and Juliet.The overall story of Boarding school Juliet takes place in Dahlia academy a private boarding school that is situated in a remote island that’s far from the mainland. Here in this remote but beautiful academy students from two of the continents main powers which are the Eastern nation of Touwa and the Principality of the West are sent to attend and receive their education before graduating and joining the society. But while the academy and the surrounding town are beautiful and provide the students with everything that they can possibly need for their time at the academy the students of the two nations that attend the academy as if mirroring the true situation that exists between their respective homelands have rather than forge bonds of friendships with their opposite numbers and try to enjoy their school life in relative peace instead does the opposite. Rather than strive for a peaceful environment as one would expect the students from both sides instead form two factions that are centered around their respective dorms that see each other as hated rivals. These two factions are the White Cats that represent the students from the principality of the West and the Black Dogs that represent the students from the Eastern nation of Touwa.In the midst of this endless struggle where both sides would make use of every opportunity and school event to prove their superiority over the other in their quest to satisfy their pride is Romio Inuzuka the youngest son of the famed Inuzuka family of the Eastern nation of Touwa who while brought up to show nothing but dislike for the members of the principality of the west and by extension the white cats that serve them has a hidden secret that he hides desperately from his comrades. For unknown to them Romio actually has a massive crush on Juliet Persia who is his opposite number within the white cats. After a dramatic confession that came after a equally dramatic dual between the two Romio while managing to forge a romance between him and his crush also finds himself embarking on a wild and high staked adventure as he and Juliet must while gradually getting to know each other and forge deeper bonds with each other must work hard to keep their forbidden romance from not just the school authorities but also their closest friends for if their liaison is revealed they would not only bring great shame to their factions but also to their countries and families as well. Joining Romio and Juliet’s little high staked adventure are a host of characters that while initially against the idea gradually approve of it. These include the positive and caring Hasuki, the proud but equally cunning Weslia, the quiet and timid Teria and her older sister the mischievous but surprisingly kind Kochou. Together Romio and Juliet and their many allies must do all they can to keep their romance hidden from both the school prefects and their equally suspicious dorm mates as they go about their school life and live the life of a normal student and maybe one day be able to graduate and make the changes to society that both so much desire.Juliet PersiaJuliet Persia portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Three Gatsu no Lion and Grandcrest Senki fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 1st year student of Dahlia academy Boarding school and the student leader of the 1st year high school division of the White Cats faction Juliet on initial appearances can be seen to be a brave, kind and understanding person by nature whose beauty and grace have earned her the title of Lady Persia among her dorm mates. A polite, hardworking and modest person by nature Juliet while a noble by birth is shown to have none of the typical traits that such people exhibit and indeed rather than showing arrogance and pride instead shows consideration to all that she meets in school provided that the opposite party isn’t acting in a threatening manner. While possessing both intelligence and beauty in spades Juliet is someone that’s noted to be a responsible and loyal person that always places the wellbeing of her friends over herself a fact that is shown well within the series. While having the air of a noble it can be seen that Juliet isn’t just a lovely flower for beneath her beauty Juliet is shown to be fiercely independent that’s reinforced by a strong will to prove herself to not just the world but to his friends as well. This is shown well within the series in the serious side that Juliet shows when standing up for her beliefs where both her determination and inspirational nature can clearly be seen.  True to this aspect of her personality Juliet is also shown to be somewhat of a realist and is someone that prefers to hear everything that transpires in an event before deciding on a decision on the steps that she should take something that I really appreciate about her character and something that I thought placed her in good stead as she began coming to grips with the struggles that existed within the school.As the series goes on and Juliet’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her confident and kind nature Juliet also has many struggles that she hides from all but her closest friends. While shown to not just have confidence but also an impressively strong will as the series goes on it can be seen that this is just her surface personality as beneath this Juliet is shown to be surprisingly fragile. While largely content and understanding of the role in which she must play within both the school and society it’s shown that Juliet is someone that dislikes being seen as weak and being pitied that stems largely from the great pride that she feels for her family. As a result of this Juliet is someone that tries hard to shoulder all the burdens, aspirations and criticisms that are placed on her something that her closest friends constantly worry about. While content with the role that she must play within the school however it can be seen that Juliet also understands that the current state of things within the school cannot be sustained and as a result works hard to foster better relations between the two sides within it hoping to create a better world and hopefully change the rules that govern it. In the beginning of the series largely as a result of her status as a noble Juliet was shown to struggle somewhat with placing her trust in others and as a result while she had no real shortage of friends that she can count on to help her she had few people that she can call true friends who she can reveal her true feelings too. Largely as a result Juliet’s interaction with Romio, in the beginning, was shown to be rather guarded as if she expected to be betrayed at any moment. However, as the series goes on and their relationship deepened this began to change with Juliet not only learning to trust not just Romio but also many of her dorm mates and in the process discovering that friendships are something that can cross both borders and social classes. A realization that served to make Juliet realize that her determination to hide her true feelings from her friends while serving to protect their image of her also served to make it harder for people to understand and help her achieve her goals. In light of this realization Juliet began to slowly open up more of her heart to others especially to Romio and while still possessing the confident and dignified traits that define her Juliet also begins to show a more joking and teasing side to him while also showing a gentler side to her personality. The character of Juliet I felt was an interesting character whose confident and strong-willed nature contrasted greatly with the surprisingly fragile inner self that she hid from her friends. Her gradual development from someone who had trouble not just with trusting others but also with revealing her true feelings to someone that was able to forge bonds easily with others while being more open with her emotions and feelings I thought was done well and demonstrated the kind of knowledge that she gained from her relationship with Romio.Romio InuzukaRomio Inuzuka portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Angolmois and Granblue Fantasy fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 1st year of student of Dahlia academy and the student leader of the 1st year high school division of the Black Dogs faction Romio on initial appearances can be seen to be an honorable, brave and confident person by nature that rather than rely on strategy and planning is one that prefers to act in the moment. However, while appearing brash to others as a result Romio is also shown to be an intelligent and perceptive person that’s quite capable of determining the perfect moment to strike at their opponents. While appearing to be grumpy, quiet and possessing a grim aura about him that most assume would mean that he prefers to settle things with fists rather than words its perhaps surprising to note that Romio is someone that prefers to avoid conflict. But due in part to his indecisive nature, these attempts to solve situations via such means often fail to amusing results.As the series goes on however and more of Romio’s personality is revealed Romio’s personality gradually begins to change. At the beginning of the series Romio while possessing both intelligence and confidence was widely seen as being indecisive and lets his sense of honor get the better of him when trying to create plans that would harm their rivals. However, as the series goes on this begins to change. While still retaining his core qualities Romio gradually comes to realize that his indecisive nature while serving to protect him well from potential failure also served to make his attempts to forge bonds with others a major hurdle and that his attempts to protect others which while serving to show his responsible nature also had the unfortunate effect of creating a mistaken belief that he was pitying them. As a result of these revelations, Romio began to try to actively change his personality. While still retaining the caring and responsible nature that he shows to his friends Romio starts to take great care in trying to understand the core reasons that are behind someone’s behavior and try to take actions that would help them solve the problems that ail them. This is best shown when he treated Juliet with fairness during the sports day tournament as well as in his attempt to help Kochou and Teria solve the reason for their inner sadness and thus showing that in addition to becoming more caring and perceptive Romio also learned through his interactions with Juliet how to be considerate as well. While still appearing brash at times it can be seen that Romio also developed a certain amount of cunning within him and is capable of creating some rather creative plans that can be called upon when pressed into desperate situations which is best shown when he takes advantage of the bond that he forged with Kochou and Teria to aid him in his plan to surprise Juliet. The character of Romio Inuzuka I felt was an interesting one whose initial personality traits of nervousness and indecisiveness contrasted well with his initial image of a grumpy male whose grim aura suggested he preferred to act with his fists rather than words. Romio’s gradual development from a quiet and indecisive person to someone that was not just considerate but also understanding of the true feelings of others as a result of his deepening bond with Juliet I thought was handled well within the series.HasukiHasuki Komai portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Psycho Pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Romio’s able right hand among the Black Dogs. A 1st year of Dahlia academy and a member of the 1st year high school division of the Black Dogs faction Hasuki on initial appearances can be seen to be a positive, cheerful and caring person by nature that has earned her great fame within the Black Dogs. A proactive, determined and intelligent person by nature Hasuki while remaining cool and level-headed most of the time is also shown to have a rather short fuse within her that can easily get lit if either the Black Dogs or Inuzuka get slandered a sight that is always a sight to see when it happens. Despite her fiery nature Hasuki is shown to have a soft spot for her childhood friend and superior Romio and shows genuine care and affection for him when she can show well the kind of feelings that she has for him. Perhaps more than anyone within the Black Dogs Hasuki can be seen to be the one person that understands Romio the most and this is something that can be seen easily in the interactions that she has with Romio where she demonstrates the ability to easily see through his lies and at the same time being able to see when something is bothering him.As the series goes on and Hasuki’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Hasuki as a result of her loyalty towards the Black Dogs also has hidden side to her that’s only unleashed when exams take place within the school. This personality that I like to call the director is markedly different to her usual personality as in this form Hasuki is serious, inspirational and has an aura about her that exudes both authority and fear which is helped greatly by the fact that she also dons a teacher like outfit that aids greatly in reinforcing the impression that here she’s a teacher. Rather than treat her fellows with the warmth and care that she’s known for in this form Hasuki is shown to treat them coldly and exhibiting an icy personality that’s akin to a Tsundere. However, while certainly harsh in this form it can be seen that Hasuki is serious about teaching her fellows and ensuring that they all manage to pass the tests successfully. As the series proceeds it can be seen easily that one of Hasuki’s most prominent traits is the loyalty that she has towards her friend and superior Romio a sense of loyalty that ensures that even if everyone dislikes him and views him as an enemy, she will remain by his side to provide him all the support that he needs. This sense of loyalty I felt was interesting as it highlighted very well not just the depth of the feelings that she has for him but also of her desire to repay the debt that she feels that she owes him. However, amusingly enough it can be seen that strong as this bond can be it also has a breaking point as well as shown in Hasuki’s chase of Romio after his confession of his love for Juliet where she amusingly chased him down with a replica sword while adapting a chilling and tenacious personality in the process. The character of Hasuki I felt was an interesting character who within the series functioned well as Romio’s friend and emotional support. In particular while only shown briefly I felt that the contrasting personalities that Hasuki has were interesting as they showed not just how loyal and committed, she was to her dorm mates but also to Romio as well.Weslia ChartreuxWeslia Chartreux portrayed by veteran seiyuu Yuu Shimamura of Koi to Uso and Owari No Seraph fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is a member of the White Cats. A 1st-year student of Dahlia academy and a member of the 1st high school division of the White Cats faction Weslia like Juliet is a member of a noble house and indeed is also the first princess of the Principality of the West.  A childhood friend of Juliet Weslia who prefers to be called by the name Char on initial appearances is seen to be a proud, confident and a somewhat arrogant person by nature that acts somewhat like a typical spoiled princess that’s used to getting what she wants. An intelligent, courteous and cunning person by nature Char while appearing to be a beautiful, cheerful and polite young woman is, in reality, someone that’s the complete opposite. Beneath her cheerful nature Char is shown to be something akin to a trickster for while she often demands strange things from her enemies and allies alike, she also enjoys teasing and pranking them with everything from simple pranks to outright blackmail all to satisfy her desire to seek some kind of fun in the moment.As the series goes on however and more of Char's personality is revealed it can be seen that Char's personality while partly an act also functions as a sort of shield that hides her own feelings that she has about her life. On the surface while widely seen as a trickster and also a violent person by many which has earned her the rather unflattering nickname of the violent princess of the west beneath this it can be seen that Char is someone that cares deeply about the well being of her friends and allies with the strong bond that she has with Juliet being the best example of this. To Char, it’s obvious that Juliet is someone that can be seen to be the center of Char's pride and joy and is someone that she views as akin to a treasure. Given this fact it's perhaps unsurprising that Char’s initial view of her relationship with Romio and her impression of him was a poor one a fact that she did not bother sugarcoating for him when she made that clear. However, as Char began to see the types of changes that Juliet’s relationship with Romio caused and also as a result of seeing just how dedicated and serious he was about it this changed not only her opinion regarding the two but also began to change her own personality as well. while still retaining her usual trickster like personality Char gradually starts to change becoming kinder to others and learning to show consideration to others and more willing to admit her own errors of judgment traits that would have been hard to see in the past. Arguably the greatest change within Char’s personality was the realization that not everyone in the world is willing to bend their knees to fulfill her often selfish requests and that maybe its time to change her ways. The character of Char I felt was an interesting one for while on the one hand her love of pranks and jokes provided plenty of comedy moments within the series the character of char also provided to Juliet the first person that can truly be seen as a close friend to her and one that she can eventually confide in when the opportunity presented itself something that I felt was especially important to both Romio and Juliet as their relationship improved.TeriaTeria Wan portrayed by veteran seiyuu Yui Ogura of Kamisama no Memochou and Vivid Strike fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Romio’s allies within the series. A 14-year-old girl and a second-year student of Dahlia academy’s Black dog’s faction Teria like her twin sister Kochou are members of the academies prefect’s unit. A quiet, timid and somewhat innocent person by nature Teria like Kochou is an expert in a specific field whose expertise in them was what allowed them to skip grades and proceed straight to the second year of high school despite their young age. In Teria’s case, she’s an expert in engineering with a particular focus on machinery.  In contrast to her, more outgoing older sister Teria is someone that can be seen to be calm and composed and true to her expertise in engineering is also seen to be someone that prefers to observe and plan out her moves before committing to them. In a way, it can be said that Teria’s nature also acts well as a foil for her sister’s antics as she is able to keep her focused and on track with their duties as prefects.Similar to her sister Teria is shown to be thankful for the fact that their intelligence managed to allow them to get to high school despite their young age. However, unlike her sister Teria is shown to view the position and role of a prefect with some amount of disdain. While Teria is shown to be dutiful towards her role as a prefect and understands the responsibilities that comes from being one it would seem that she is less concerned with handing out the correct punishment and seems to be more lenient with the rules than other prefects. At the same time despite reaching the role of a prefect at such a young age Teria rather than showing any sign of being proud of the role seems to exhibit the opposite in that she seems rather lonely. From looking at the interactions that she has with both Romio and her sister it can inferred that this sense of loneliness is due to the fact that being prefects means that she and her sister are unable to have the normal high school lives that most girls their age would be able to enjoy due to both the fear that their role generates and the time that they have to spend on their duties. This sense of fear continued until an unexpected encounter with an underclassman of hers opened her heart and made her realize the fear that she had been trying so hard to hide from others. In the aftermath of this revelation Teria largely due to this begins to markedly change in personality. While still quiet and shy to a degree Teria starts to gradually take her first steps of entering high school by not just learning to form friendships with others but also learn to form opinions by herself and not take cues from her sister as she would have done in the past. At the same time, she was also willing to take the initiative and stand up for what she believes in which is best shown when she tried to shield Romio from his brother.KochouKochou Wan portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sword Art Online and Ryuuou no Oshigoto fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Romio’s allies within the series. A 14-year-old girl and a second-year student of Dahlia academies Black Dog faction Kochou like her younger sister Teria are members of the academy’s prefect unit. Like her sister, Kochou is an expert in a specific field that allowed her to skip grades and become a 2nd year at such a young age. In her case, she’s an expert in pharmacy with particular focus in its use in medicine. From initial appearances, Kochou can be seen to be a mischievous, and cunning person by nature that seems to love teasing others and having fun at their expense. Despite this, it can be seen that Kochou views her role as a prefect with something akin to pride and would easily get angry if someone insults either her or the role of a prefect. Unlike her younger sister, Kochou is shown to someone that’s quick to anger and seems to take offense at people who make fun of her figure or looks down on her due to her age or height. As a result of the pride that she feels towards being a prefect Kochou is noted to approach her role with both determination and tenacity and would try hard to complete her assigned duty until either she completes it or her target escapes showing how driven she can be.Despite the strong pride that she feels towards the role of being a prefect Kochou can be seen to place a heavy importance on the main role that prefects should be encouraging. While Kochou understands that part of a prefect’s role is to maintain discipline among the students she also believes that prefects should also strive to guide those that have no talent on to the correct path and to protect them when needed. From this, it can be seen that Kochou is of the belief that talent and not age is the factor that’s most important for people a belief that no doubt came from the complex and struggle that comes being looked down by others due to their age and the authority that others feel they don’t deserve. In line with her determination to guide students is Kochou’s rather curious determination to protect the happiness that students can experience in school which is shown well during the festival in which she in conjunction with her sister acted to break up a fight that if left unchecked would have the effect of causing the fireworks display to be canceled. This showed not just how dedicated she is to the role of being a peacekeeper but also how kind she really is as a person something that I really enjoyed seeing with her character. Similar to her sister after their encounter with Romio Kochou’s personality also began to exhibit changes. While still retaining her teasing and mischievous nature Kochou also starts to think somewhat outside of the box and instead of merely following instructions from her superiors starts to think and act on her feelings. This is shown in the times that she and her sister would infiltrate Romio’s room to have fun and also in the care that she shows to Romio in the aftermath of the surveillance order that was given by her superior and thus showing the increased bond of trust that had been formed between them. The character of Kochou I felt was an interesting one whose introduction to the series helped introduce a great amount of comedy into the series thanks to the many interactions that she has with Romio.AMVIn terms of animation, I thought that the series animation was really impressive being both sharp and clear. I felt that the academy and the town while being beautiful to look at also featured a great variety of locations that was not just well designed but also showed great variety in terrain types as well. The character designs for the series I felt was pretty well done with the uniforms that the two sides wear doing a great job of not just showing the colors of the two countries that the students represent but also in contrasting and showing the differences that lie between the two sides whether in terms of the nature of the individual students and the different culture in which they come from. This contrast between the two sides I feel is also shown well in the physical appearances of the cast specifically in the hair and eye colors that the students from the two sides exhibit that I felt have a synergy effect with the uniform colors that both sides wear and help reinforce the idea that the rivalry between the two sides is not simply a small scare one but in fact one that carries great weight on a national level.Music wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Love With You that was sung by Fripside and Someday Until The World changes that were performed by Riho Iida both of which I thought were catchy songs that resonated well with the series main theme of a teenage love story. The series OST I felt also did a solid job of providing good support for the various scenes that were in the anime.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Ai Kayano, Yuki Ono, Ayane Sakura, Yuu Shimamura, Yui Ogura and Rina Hidaka deserve special praise as I thought that they all did a fantastic job of portraying the characters of Juliet, Romio, Hasuki, Weslia, Teria and Kochou. In addition, I feel that the series also featured a great supporting cast of characters that did well in enhancing the story by injecting both much-needed tension and hilarity within the series. In this I feel that Tomokazu Sugita who portrayed the character of Chizuru Maru, Daisuke Ono who portrayed the character of Airu Inuzuka, Eri Kitamura who portrayed the character of Somali Longhaired and Hiroshi Kamiya who portrayed the character of Scott Fold all did a fantastic job of playing their respective characters who did much to enhance the overall story.Overall conclusionIn overall Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet was an anime that I really enjoyed, and I would say that it’s definitely one of the best animes for this season. Its main strong points, In my opinion, was its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters, sweet and well-designed romance moments between Romio and Juliet and excellent voice acting.The overall premise of Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet which is its reimagining of the classic romance tragedy that served as its main inspiration and its replacement of the tragedy element with that of a romantic comedy as well as its replacement of the classic family feud and ancient Italy setting with the tense relations between two factions whose homelands are being subjected to a tense peace treaty that can be undone at the sign of a single spark I thought was definitely one of the series highlights. Having the main setting of the series be a school where students from both of these nations attend to receive their education before moving into society to help advance their nations goals I thought was also rather creative as while it allowed the students from both sides to enter a setting where they will all enter regardless of their origin while at the same time creating an area where their respective feuds would not just be out of place but also serve as a perfect opportunity to allow the concept of forbidden love to manifest. All of these elements I thought really synergized well with each other to truly make a premise that was unique to this series.The overall story of the series I felt made great use of this premise as while it did well in showing the kind and depth of the rivalries that can exist between the two countries and their subordinate factions It also did well in introducing the two main leads of the series in the form of the student leader of the White Cats and the Black Dogs who in this case was Juliet Persia and Romio Inuzuka. The forbidden romance between the two that served as the crux of the story I thought made great use of the rivalry between their two respective factions as a backdrop as it showed not only their determination to both stay loyal to their respective countries but also did well to show the inner struggles that both have in relation to them as well. Seeing the two of them try to both overcome the ingrained animosity that exists between the two sides and try to break out of their shells as they try to both make the romance between them work and learn about their respective struggles and wishes in the process was something that I really enjoyed seeing. This struggle to both change and at the same time make their romance work within the series was shown well in the many sweet romantic moments that were shown in the series that showed the kind of effort that both were trying to make in an effort to not just change the world but also their lives as well. These cute moments I felt were also used well in conjunction with the school events that were featured within the series such as the sports day event as while the former did well in showing the advancement in the romance between the two the latter allowed us to see the kind of determination that exists in them in their desire to help each other overcome the struggles that they are wrestling with in their own way while providing us with some background amusement in the form of the antics that both perform during the latter event.Overall Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that it handled its use of both the core romance story and the many themes that it introduced into the story and premise relatively well to create a pretty fresh take on the classic tale of Romio and Juliet. It's balancing of comedy moments with the romance and the character development of both the main and support cast was something that I especially enjoyed seeing as well. In terms of the final score, I would say that it easily deserves a final score of 10/10."", ""Story: 7As the title suggests, Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet takes place in a boarding school. The problem is that the school isn't very fleshed out. It is a standard magical school setting with house rivalry that substitutes magic with physical combat. Although the plot is fairly predictable, it is sensical enough to be a ground for a solid 6 (fair) plot. However, I am giving it a 7 because of the ending. For a 12 episode adaptation, Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet chose a perfect stopping point that hints the direction that the story will unfold while leaving me satisfied enough to not need a sequel....I plan to read the manga, though.Art: 8The art is Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is quality work.

No? Me neither to be honest, but this series sets out to show exactly that in the form of a romantic comedy.Story 7/10The show centres around Romio Inuzuka who has fallen for Julliet Persia, a forbidden romance based on the fact that they stem from rival factions. After the two of them enter into a relationship they have to do their best to keep it hidden from their dorms. The risk of discovery is what drives the plot forward and the story often boils down to them...going through hoops to meet in secret or misleading others to meet in public. The series doesn’t really bring anything new to the genre, but is written well enough to keep entertaining. The show is fairly light on drama, but has a lot of comedy-centred scenes, most of which hit the mark.Art 6/10In the art department the show looks pretty average, there are some scenes that are animated a bit better than the rest, but there are also scenes with worse animation. The character design on the other hand isn’t anything special per se, but all the characters look pretty great and their appearance showcases their personalities in a lot of cases.Sound 7/10Just like the animation the sound design is pretty average. Nothing really stands out, for better or worse. The music doesn’t intrude on the scenes, the sound effects don’t subtract from the experience and the voice actors do a good job delivering their lines.Character 7/10All the characters in the show are likeable in their own way, but the majority of them are relegated to the sidelines and mostly seem to serve as a device to drive the plot forward. Character development is pretty much non-existent with a few exceptions. The main cast doesn’t exist of one-dimensional characters which especially shows in the central relationship.Enjoyment 7/10All in all I enjoyed watching the show, it doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t have to.

Even in that description there's divergence from the original play. So if you're looking for a retelling of the bard's tale (which he ripped off of a poem that was ripping off a Greek myth) know that you're not really getting that at all. There is maybe three characters that actually parallel the play. The way the romance evolves is completely different. Considering the selling point of this anime was Romeo and Juliet in an anime, know that is...not really what you're getting at all.Still blowing the hook, doesn't make a bad anime. But does make it more of an uphill battle.  Luckily the two leads are really adorable, which makes any romance anime work. They do put some effort into characterizing the folks around them as well, which is great. Other than the feud itself, everything in this anime makes sense, and there is a nice moment between our two leads every episode.Unfortunately, the way they play the rival factions in this anime often makes the road to those sweet moments between the leads rather ridiculous. I get they're playing it for laughs and all, but it starts feeling very inorganic very quickly.Another thing that was rather off putting for me was just how much fan service is in this anime. I don't mind fan service if it fits the tone of the show, or is not overabundant. But this is a cute romance show where three quarters of the episodes have panty shots, scenes in the girls locker room, shower scenes, you get the point. If it was scaled back, no problem, but it was just a bit much for what we're watching considering none of the rest of the show has that kind of tone.For most anime seasons, I'd say this show is fine for those who want to scratch their romance anime itch. But in a season that has Bloom into You, and Bunnygirl Senpai, there are FAR superior options for you right now. Still, the leads are cute together, and there are some pretty funny moments and some really sweet moments in this show. It's worth a watch, just don't expect it to be amazing. not really what you're getting at all.Still blowing the hook, doesn't make a bad anime. But does make it more of an uphill battle.

I also wrote a review on the manga on my blog:https://blog.topolyan.com/boarding-school-juliet-manga-review/...P.P.S.

At first, I said to myself, ""well its just gonna be average at best"" but oh boy was I wrong. The comedy is somewhat funny and most of the jokes are pretty good. I love the fact that Romeo and Juliet tried their everything to make it a love story; yet hiding it from all their friends, dorm mates, and most importantly, their prefects. Overall, I say this was pretty interesting and definitely worth giving it a shot. However, if you aren\'t into anime like this, no hard feelings.-...Spacecraft555 UwU Spacecraft555 UwU', ""After reading the manga which i thought was truly amazing. The character and story development in the manga was one of the best i have ever read/watched. It was truly a joy to read but after watching the anime adaptation i have to say i am disappointed at the job they have done. It does not do justice for how good the manga is.Story/character :They have cut out a lot of the character and story development making it feel less complete than it should be and it feels like you are thrown into the show without good development of the characters. They have taken some...of the more significant scenes from the manga but the less significant scenes is what makes these scene better however by cutting these out makes less amazing than it should. AN example at the end cause its a spoiler.Art / Animation:Although the story feels incomplete i am glad to see that there is an anime adaptation because it bring some of the scenes in the manga into color and that the scenes in color is quite nice to watch rather than it being in black and white. Furthermore, the animation is clean and quite nice to watch unlike some other shows where their animation is atrocious.******spoiler*****AN example is the method of how Juliet comes and goes from the black dogs house through the sewers in the manga they did a small arc about it and it was one of the most funniest part how they were nearly caught but the anime didn't even go into it and that the people watching the anime should just accept that they can easiest go to each other houses and this is not the cause and that they had to go through more hardships just for them to be able to do this of the more significant scenes from the manga but the less significant scenes is what makes these scene better however by cutting these out makes less amazing than it should.

From a conceptual level, it has so many elements that are right up my alley. A rom-com where the main couple gets together at the start and follows their developing relationship! A take on Shakespeare that remixes his classic characters in fun new ways! Swordfights! Dates! Wacky sidekicks! Performances from a rogue’s gallery of my favorite voice actors! There’s so much to this story that could have- and should have- worked. Sadly, the end product just never comes together in any satisfying way, leading to a show that more often...than not just passed through my system without eliciting a single reaction from me.First, the set-up: as the title suggests, this is a very (very, very, very) loose re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet that transplants the warring noble houses of Verona to a boarding school, in which they take the forms of two rival gangs from eastern and western nations. The Black Dogs of the east are led by Romoi Inuzika, a brash hothead with a secret crush on the leader of the western White Cats: Juliet Persia, a determined young woman fighting to become stronger than the prejudices and hatred between the two opposing forces. A midnight duel leads them to the realization that they’re both sick of their nation’s feud, and that their feelings for each other might be realer than both of them initially realized. So they decide to start going out in secret, all while working from within to start changing their world for the better. In classic Shakespeare fashion, there are mistaken identities, close escapes, big emotional outbursts, overly complicated schemes, and a colorful cast of supporting characters weaving an absurdly complicated net of secondary romantic subplots.And I just wish it all was more interesting than I’m making it sound.The problem, really, is a very common problem that a lot of lesser-tier anime runs into: losing the plot. Once the setup is out of the way and our central couple is together, it doesn’t take long for the enticing premise of a power couple working to change a broken system while undergoing emotional development to fall by the wayside in favor of the blandest, most generic anime rom-com scenarios imaginable. It feels like the story doesn’t have enough confidence in itself to commit to the bolder, more original elements of its premise, so it just settles back to copy everything it’s seen in better anime. The sports festivals, the secret dates gone wrong, the making lunch for your hubby, the romantic rivals, and none of it is fresh or well-executed enough to keep interest until the show finally remembers it’s supposed to have a plot in the final handful of episodes, and even then it never rises above anything higher than passable. Romio and Juliet themselves are both likable enough, but their bolder edges hinted at in the first episode- Juliet’s bullheaded confidence, Romio’s passionate sense of honor- get dropped fairly quickly in favor of blushing moe girl and awkward pretty boy. There’s just no character to any of these characters, and the production isn’t strong enough to be enjoyable just on a pure spectacle level.Which is a shame, because there are good elements in this bland paste of a show. Again, I like that the main couple gets together at the start, and the show is nominally about exploring their developing relationship above all else. I like that none of the romantic rivals to either of them is ever treated as having any possibility of actually breaking them up, keeping the focus on their emotions above all else. And like I said, there are a metric buttload of my favorite seiyuus in here all doing their best to add character to the cardboard cutouts they’re voicing. Ayane Sakura of BNHA fame adds a surprising poignancy to Romio’s childhood friend, Hiroshi Kamiya is having an utter ball as Juliet’s foppish retainer, Juliet herself is admirably carried by Ai Kayano, Tomokazu Sugita shows a surprising restraint as a Black Dog thug, and Daisuke Ono lends his chilling monotone to Romio’s domineering older brother. I like all these performers, and they’re clearing having a lot of fun playing with such broad archetypes. There’s just nothing in the script to let them be anything more.In the end, Boarding School Juliet is far from a disaster, but it’s also not a show I would recommend to anyone. It’s not especially impressive from an animation standpoint, the characters are nothing you won’t get better from a million other shows, the romance is harmless but forgettable, and I’m certain I’ll forget the entire plot in about a week.

Shakespeare deserves to be bigger, braver, and better than this.', 'It would be best to not even think of this as a retelling of Romeo and Juliet.  Yes, that\'s the name of the main characters, but other than that, and the pretext of the warring factions, the similarities pretty much end there.  This is only very loosely based on the Shakespearean classic and would really be more of a representation of two groups not being able to get along like cats and dogs.It would also be best not to go into this anime thinking it\'s main draw is to deliver romance.  This is more a ""Com-Rom"" than a ""Rom-Com""....Comedy is the main driver here and this anime never really tries to take itself or the subject matter its based upon seriously.  There are far more moments where you will burst out laughing uncontrollably, than you will watch with a tear in your eye from romantic sweet moments.  And even in those moments of romance, they always end with some kind of joke.In truth, the Romance in the anime is really rather shallow.  But, it avoids being cliche because unlike most rom-com animes this one presents a world where no one wants to see the main characters together.  That provides the intrigue for the romance aspect of the anime, not the romance itself.  You watch this wondering if they will get caught and what will happen to them, and that provides the drama, not the relationship with Juliet and Romio.As far as the comedic aspect of the anime, it relies heavily on gags, comedic lines and quirky characters to power itself.  And, boy, does it work. I would put this anime on par with Hinamatsuri in terms of the level of comedy, and that is high praise.  The jokes rely heavily on slapstick humor, but it also has some witty lines as well.  There were times I was in near tears at the events on the screen.  (Two Words: IRON CLAW!)When it got time to get serious towards the conclusion of the anime, it didn\'t falter and that\'s what\'s important, because the ending is where so many comedies fall into mediocrity, because they fail to finish strong, because they can\'t handle the dramatic climax.  This anime did it well.  It wasn\'t exactly as well done as say the Zero Requiem, but it was a solid dramatic finish and left me wanting to see a second season.Lastly, the cast was very likable as well.  But, no character really broke the mold.  The cast was similar to every other rom-com.  The MC guy who chases the affection of the MC girl (Romio & Juliet), the MC guy\'s childhood friend (Hasuki), the MC girl\'s childhood friend (Char), and then some tertiary characters to round out the group and provide some comic relief. (Maru & Scott).  I liked these characters, but they weren\'t groundbreaking.Overall, this anime was superbly hilarious.  There\'s really not much to find wrong with it, unless you\'re expecting a serious and dramatic adaptation of Romeo & Juliet.  Then, you\'ll probably not like it so much.  Go into this expecting to laugh, not cry and you\'ll enjoy it.Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 8Enjoyment: 10Overall: 9 Comedy is the main driver here and this anime never really tries to take itself or the subject matter its based upon seriously.

The MC guy who chases the affection of the MC girl (Romio & Juliet), the MC guy\'s childhood friend (Hasuki), the MC girl\'s childhood friend (Char), and then some tertiary characters to round out the group and provide some comic relief. (Maru & Scott).  I liked these characters, but they weren\'t groundbreaking.Overall, this anime was superbly hilarious.  There\'s really not much to find wrong with it, unless you\'re expecting a serious and dramatic adaptation of Romeo & Juliet.  Then, you\'ll probably not like it so much.  Go into this expecting to laugh, not cry and you\'ll enjoy it.Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 8Enjoyment: 10Overall: 9', ""I came across this anime while browsing the options listed in prime video. I had neither read the manga nor had any previous information about it and was just looking for a light anime to hook me up. And boy was it good.It is one of those anime which instantly makes you want a next season. Now that I have come know about the manga and am reading it, I am falling in love with a lot more.But strictly speaking about the anime, it  just has a great balance of humor plus drama. Yes it has the same Romeo and Juliet premise but...it feels much more.While the story is not very great, it is good enough to keep you engaged and watching it. There are literally no fillers and each episode keeps moving the story forward. The art and animation is just great and makes you fall in love with each and every frame. While the fight scenes are not the best, they seem to work in the broader scheme of things.The background score works well to keep you engaged in a scene, though it might seem very moderate in certain scenes. The op and and ed are also good, if not very good. I guess the anime could have done a bit more in this department.Coming to the characters, it feels like there hasn't been given enough time to develop. In case there is any possibility of a next season, I will take it back but if this will be the only season, then the characters are just your normal everyday anime ones. This anime does have huge amounts of potential and as far as I know, the manga has some great character arcs, so I really hope it gets another season.The humor quotient was literally quite high during the first four episode. The anime gradually mellows down to a more serious tone as the relationship takes a serious turn in the latter stages. And that is one of the plus points. You always have some elements to provide moments of humor such as the Maru gang and the protagonists themselves.Overall, I really loved this anime because its like a cool breeze in summer. You don't have to think much or to deep. Just enjoy what's happening.PS - Dearly hoping for a new season it feels much more.While the story is not very great, it is good enough to keep you engaged and watching it.

That being said, Boarding School Juliet is a Rom-com anime that I found myself thoroughly enjoying.The story revolves around a romance between a boy and a girl from opposing factions. They both have to hide the fact that they are in love from everyone in order to proceed in their current aspirations. I feel like most Rom-com I see are too silly or annoying in the main romance. With this one, it has a lot of comedy but the main romance is actually quite heartfelt and I felt myself invested in their relationship.They...actually have a nice chemistry and their romance is filled with sweet moments and minimal tropes that annoy me in the romance genre. I sometime have a hard time finding romances where both characters are likable and compelling, Persia and Inuzuka were each good characters on their own and together they make for a nice couple.The bigger shocker for me is that I also found this anime very funny. Now if a romance anime is hard for me to find one I enjoy, I'd say a comedy is even harder for me to find something I enjoy (hence, rom-com is one of my least favorite). But this anime has a lot of funny moments. From our main characters cute chemistry, to our side characters antics, this anime had a handful of moments that made me chuckle. I'm not sure why this one worked for me while most don't, but it just did. For those who have seen the show, Scott Fold (aka blonde dude with glasses) was the my favorite character in terms of funny moments.Boarding School Juliet is 12 episodes long and was such an enjoyable watch that I kept wanting to see the next episode right after the other. It's not without a couple annoying characters, but overall it was good. It ends on a nice note, leaving you to decide if you feel content or if you wish to continue the story with the manga. Even if you do not continue with the manga, the anime gives you a satisfying story. actually have a nice chemistry and their romance is filled with sweet moments and minimal tropes that annoy me in the romance genre.

But i've watched about 11 romance animes in the past week alone and majority of them have this trope... with that out the way heres what I thought.I laughed a good few times openly which is a great sign of...an enjoyable anime, I had some serious fun watching this and got pretty invested in the characters who for the most part were memorable and distinct, I enjoyed the representation of gothic characters too which is rarely done well, the romance is ofcourse based off Romeo and Juliet but to be honest its very much separate from the actual story of R&J, the final few episodes had me excited, anxious and dying for more which was really well executed in my opinion!I am sad to hear that the anime didn't sell well and there might not be a 2nd season, so maybe for the first time in a long long time will I switch to the manga! an enjoyable anime, I had some serious fun watching this and got pretty invested in the characters who for the most part were memorable and distinct, I enjoyed the representation of gothic characters too which is rarely done well, the romance is ofcourse based off Romeo and Juliet but to be honest its very much separate from the actual story of R&J, the final few episodes had me excited, anxious and dying for more which was really well executed in my opinion!I am sad to hear that the anime didn't sell well and there might not be a 2nd season, so maybe for the first time in a long long time will I switch to the manga!"", 'Man I might already have diabetes from consuming this anime, I can already feel the ants crawling.Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet truly surprised me. I was expecting a something somewhat harem-ly (I don\'t usually take a look at the genre of the show for the surprise factor) show but this was a fairly wholesome piece. It\'s made up of many cliche factors like having this royalty frail girl as main heroine, the you-know-what-mc-does-on-childhood-friends (ofc reject them), and etc. Yet it does not fail to present us with a well-done piece despite its cliches.The characters are full of development.

But from another point of view where we see that the two are from different countries that are enemies and that. Likewise, the best thing they have is that the protagonist is a very good person, you want to support him at all times. The animation is not bad but it is not very remarkable either, then the characters are very cliche. The soundtrack doesn't stand out at all, the character development is poor as it doesn't go as deep as it should.

This time around, it isn\'t so tragic and is actually quite funny, while still having some feels and making you attached to the main characters. I\'ll try to keep the review relatively short, but I\'ll end up writing a lot like I always end up doing. So. I\'ll put a TL;DR at the end that sums up my thoughts.This story follows the two main characters, Inuzuka Romio and Persia...Juliet. Here in a high school setting, both characters are leaders of their own groups (? I\'m not sure what they\'re specifically referred to as) called the Black Doggies, and White Cats respectively. In this school, the two groups, made up by the entire student population split between them, are constantly at a ""war"" trying to show superiority and that they are each the better clan. While not thoroughly explained in the show, it is mentioned how each group has their own views and ideals of the world, hence why they clash (just like politics!).Anyways, as you would expect, the two groups hate each others\' guts, but not in a battle to the death kind of way. This is shown throughout the story with quite funny and entertaining interactions between a lot of the opposing clan members, mainly our main character Inuzuka and anyone else in the White Cats. But as you can expect, there are also some serious parts to it as there are higher ups to the two parties, Inuzuka and Persia being the leaders of only the first years in school. Because of these higher ups, there are very strict rules enforced that can lead to some serious parts and an overlooming threat, which I personally liked. It gives the show something to progress with, even of only by a tiny bit.I absolutely loved the interactions between the characters, and this is what personally gave the show most of it\'s enjoyment. Inuzuka is not the typical ""badass, never emotional"" male lead, and is extremely soft/girly when it comes to Persia which makes for lots of comedic moments. Even the side characters interactions are all very funny, giving it a lighthearted feel to sit back and watch without too much worry of something horrible happening (even though it does get some serious moments).The art is really good and I didn\'t see too many issues with the animation, if any at all. All the girls are cute, so bonus points to that :D (Char best girl). The story flowed pretty normally, and for the most part didn\'t seem rushed until the end like you would expect from most 12 episode/1 cour animes. But I don\'t fault them for it, it didn\'t feel super off or anything out of place, and wraps the show up nicely (but don\'t expect a conclusive ending of course!)The show definitely has a couple flaws, one of my biggest gripes being Persia\'s character portrayed as a bit... bland. She is super cute and everything, but she didn\'t seem to stand out as someone extremely interesting. We get a little backstory to her throughout, her main motives and the like, but nothing too crazy. Just average, which is perfectly okay; my point is to not expect much else from the average main girl in an anime. Inuzuka is a fantastic MC in my opinion however, and helps carry their relationship very much so.Even though I mentioned Persia being a bit bland, she is still a lovable/entertaining character along with the rest of the cast in my opinion. Basically everyone gets humorous moments, a little bit of development for our main two along with a couple of other side girls, and makes for nice progression from start to finish.As for the story, it isn\'t anything to write home about. I do really enjoy the high school setting, especially broken up between the two different clans constantly butting heads. It leads for a lot of interesting moments and interactions between characters of the same party, as well as opposing ones. With that being said however, there is no sort of revolutionary moment or turning point in the show, and doesn\'t really make much progression in any aspects besides the romance.TL;DR: The show is very entertaining, but maybe not for the reasons you would expect. It isn\'t some dramatic, action packed romance of lovers who are separated because of the clans they grew up in. While it does have a bit of drama, action, and a good amount of romance, it also is blended with a lot of comedy and more lighthearted situations. That\'s why overall I\'ll give it an 8; I definitely had a few minor complaints with the story and some characters, but it was thoroughly entertaining regardless of those few issues. I didn\'t rate it higher because it wasn\'t anything outstanding, but was still enjoyable for what it presented. If you\'re looking for a romance anime that is a good comedy with some serious moments, then I\'d say give it a shot. It\'s only 12 episodes, and I found myself excited to watch the next episode from start to finish.[This is my first review in a very, very long time so.. I hope I didn\'t blabber on too much. I feel like I may have strayed at times a little bit, but overall got my thoughts written down. Hopefully it helped you make a decision!] Juliet.

I thought the anime would be like any other high school rom-coms that I have watched, which I was right. BUT at the same time, for me, it was much more than that. When the comedy hits, they really hit, and I laugh. It was sweet (I think I have diabetes now, jk), the characters were very likeable, and the romance between Romio Inuzuka, the main male protagonist, and Juliet Persia, the main female protagonist, was phenomenal. I shipped them all the way to the moon, and up to episode 8, this anime...has become one of my favorite romance anime. I'm not really into the romance genre, so this took the cake. I'm now more interested in more anime similar to these. I would definitely recommend giving this anime a watch. ALTHOUGH I did like it, it does not mean you might also like it.

Nah i don\'t think so.', 'When i first started to watch this anime, i was not really impressed by the cover art of it. I thought to myself that its going to be another generic romcom anime just like the other similar titles that are released in the market nowadays. However i was so wrong after i finished watching the 1st episode and this is where my review of Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet (Juliet\'s Boarding School) comes in.Story : 7/10Just like the title of the anime implies,the plot takes place in a prestigious boarding school where 2 student factions called the Black Dogs and the White Cats from rivaling...countries are frequently enganging in a war among each other since they were in elemantary school. the main protagonist, Romio Inuzuka being the leader of the dorms\' first-years, wishes for a romance with Juliet Persia,also the 1st year\'s leader of her division that can never be achieved easily which what caused him to vow himself to change the world and obtain peace between these two factions someday. It has a mixture of slice of life and shounen genre but the story itself is nothing spetacular and that ""changing the world"" cliche theme can be found in most shounen anime. Now im not going to spoil the plot because it is something that you must watch yourself to gain a better understanding of it but nonetheless, i actually enjoyed it from begining to end.Art : 9/10I absolutely love how the developers implement the graphical animations in this anime from the character\'s elegant movements to the bright and colourful splash of paint on the characters. and speaking of design, they had done a splendid job on the character\'s facial expressions. all of the female characters are cute and gorgeous and this can be said the same to the badass design male characters as well. You may also realised that the artstyle may share some similarities with certain shoune anime considering that it also has a mixture of shounen style as well. overall, one of the best graphical anime of the season for sure.Sound : 9/10Music has always being the key factor in order to make any scenes whether its from video games or movies to be more epic and enganging. and Juliet\'s Boarding School\'s soundtrack is no exception. the osts that they used in the anime are probably some of the best ive listened to so far in any romcom anime. every single one of the soundtracks suits really well with the action scenes and the drama that occur between the characters. Not to mention the OP and ED are great as well maybe not to my taste but still good nonetheless.Character : 8/10Throughout the episodes, the story mainly focuses on the relationship between the main protagonist,Romio Inuzuka and the heroine, Juliet Persia. to be honest, i really dont like romio that much because on how childish and inmature he can be most of the times. he is supposed to be the leader of his group but due to his relationship with persia, he often forgets about his responsibilities and also becomes too clingy with persia. and speaking of which,Juliet is what the enbodiment of a heroine should be. strong,has a sense of justice, and a high motivation to solve all of the problems that her comrades are facing and most importantly,her kindness towards her friends especially to romio. Other side characters have their own fair share of uniqueness as well. Chartreux being persia\'s childhood friend is your ""ara ara girl with a sexy voice"" character. Hasuki,also a childhood friend of Romio is probably the best character in the anime due to her strong will to always keep moving forward no matter what obstacles that she is facing( you will know what i mean if you watch the anime). Overall,almost every one of characters main or support have their fleshed out characterization that makes the story much more interesting to go through.Enjoyment : 9/10I was quite suprised that not a lot of people are talking about the show when it was first came out. what makes it different from the other similar titles is how it tries to break the norms of those cliche and generic drama theme that you always encounter in most shows nowadays. its nice and refreshing to see distinctive things from the show. While some people may consider it as an average romcom anime but for those who had watched it will realise how interesting this anime is.I will rate it an 8/10. countries are frequently enganging in a war among each other since they were in elemantary school. the main protagonist, Romio Inuzuka being the leader of the dorms\' first-years, wishes for a romance with Juliet Persia,also the 1st year\'s leader of her division that can never be achieved easily which what caused him to vow himself to change the world and obtain peace between these two factions someday. It has a mixture of slice of life and shounen genre but the story itself is nothing spetacular and that ""changing the world"" cliche theme can be found in most shounen anime. Now im not going to spoil the plot because it is something that you must watch yourself to gain a better understanding of it but nonetheless, i actually enjoyed it from begining to end.Art : 9/10I absolutely love how the developers implement the graphical animations in this anime from the character\'s elegant movements to the bright and colourful splash of paint on the characters. and speaking of design, they had done a splendid job on the character\'s facial expressions. all of the female characters are cute and gorgeous and this can be said the same to the badass design male characters as well.

That book was Romeo and Juliet. That fuelled my passion to what it is today. My passion of romance and drama. This anime serves as a modern take on the classic masterpiece. Let\'s find out if it still holds strong to my high standards and ultimately, your time.In the first few episodes, I would honestly tell you that it wasn\'t particularly amazing. Sure it had certain elements of romance and teasing and subtle nuance about the fear of being...caught. I was rather impressed with some of method it used to start out this relationship, such as a swordfight rather than a plain confession. There were also some correct verses used such as ""I want to change the world"" which may seem cliché but was impactful at the point of time. It wasn\'t as impressionable as I felt a bit more backstory as to how this love for Juliet actually happened could have made it more vivid. I would also like to know the thought process behind Juliet\'s choice to work with her ""enemy"" rather than just ""changing the world"" knowing how risky it is. Lastly, there was not a very good picture painted of how this tension between two country looked like aside from mere gang fights.What made me impressed however was the middle half. They started exploring the impacts of their relationship as more and more people start to realize their romance. This form of analysis was integral to keep the story flowing and not be stuck in a slice of life loop. For instance the introduction of the various characters that led to some level of jealousy and even sadness when they had to be rejected. This was further extended when the people who got rejected chose to not only move on, but even support in this risky behaviour, while still maintaining some cold hard feelings which I felt were realistic. There was also elements of self awareness, such as the ""brats"" who realized Romio\'s half-assed decisions that led to various unfavourable results. This was somewhat integral into keeping some side characters more proactive rather than just a prop.But taking the cake today is the very last few episodes. The anime showed further analysis into when even the student council realized such suspicion. They tied up the anime into a deadlock when they started giving trouble to the main characters. The reaction was rather intuitive as there was a façade involved but still having a rather rebellious action. Some form of analysis on the student council could have been done to further explore things like the sibling deadlock however I felt it didn\'t hinder on the experience when it reached its peak. The ending was well done as the struggles of each character was flashed out appropriately with frustrations of being apart and almost nearly calling off the relationship due to physical threats,  the impact was delivered in a action punched manner. It showed levels of trust and emotion to pull off a risky behaviour to proof their innocence. The impact was expanded upon when the couple decide to take another step forward in their relationship.What I wished could have been explored for a higher score was how society treats women. There were hints of how Juliet was being ""oppressed"" like savings would only go to men but it never struck to me as something of a big deal in this anime, especially with how ""gender neutral"" it looked and could have been further expanded upon to give a picture of how it\'s like to be a woman and why change was needed.At the end of the day, while it fell short on some of the basics like a good backstory and could have elaborated on the bigger impacts of their relationship rather than saying ""Change the world"" or ""Will create war"", I felt the romance development was well analysed and how the romance changed their behaviour was thought of. I thought Romio was a cliché brat until I learned about his softer side as he matured. And this form of analysis I feel today, was what it needed to make a good romance anime. Well done.Some reviewer\'s notes:- Sound was good, appropriate voice actors, large sound- Artwork was decent, though detail gets significantly lost in action scenes- Relatively smooth action- Really fun to watch, good mix of light hearted comedy and dark moments caught.

If you're looking for a good romantic comedy where you'll find the characters enjoyable then look no further! (SPOILERS AHEAD)Now.. Coming into this I understand very well it was a Romeo and Juliet type story and considering it started as a cutesy type kinda anime I knew that there was not going to be a suicide at the end. The story starts off strong and shows...us that there are these two school groups at war and battle it out frequently, but then the main character Inuzuka seems to be in love with the female main character. It goes on and then it comes to the confession kind of area... and it was kinda stupid. The confession felt so rushed at first, like boom he's confessed to her randomly and for some reason she accepts? Like two minutes ago you wanted to kill the kid now you're in love with him. Things go by and the obvious hiding their romance from people is developed into the story whilst almost everyone finds out some how it ends on a lovey dovey happy note.The Art is very well done apart from those god damn eyebrows on the female characters... Looks like they got caterpillars stuck on there. I really like the way the anime felt and it had a very cute type of vibe to it and I completely understand why it's based as a Shounen anime with the action it which was really well done aswell.The sound I don't really pay much attention to due to not really caring as long as it sounds fine. Nothing really exploded into my mind and left an imprint but it was never bad at any point either.When it comes to the characters I don't think there was anything necessarily wrong with anyone of them. I think that everyone felt right in the story and that everyone had a purpose for being there. I did hate a little of the characters doings but that was personal opinion and others might find it differently.Overall I really enjoyed the series and I think I'm going to look at the manga and see if there's anything developed there.

After smiling throughout, sometimes crying (like the male MC), I was quite happy at the end."", 'tl;dr: An incredibly well made though often slow story based loosely on Romeo and Juliet but with very different but well developed characters.Romeo and Juliet is a classic that has been adapted in far too many ways to count. It\'s core story line behind star-crossed lovers born into opposing factions is even more common. This anime takes a lot stylistically from Romeo and Juliet, enough so that the viewer is immediately able to recognize the Romeo and the Juliet and sympathize and root for their forbidden relationship. However, that is all that this anime takes. It doesn\'t follow the plot line of the original at...all. The original is also a tragedy while this anime very much is not, and thus this avoids a lot of the darker themes as well. Hence, I really wouldn\'t consider this an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet as the title may suggest but rather a new work with some similar stylistic choices that features the core concept of lovers on opposing sides.From that point of view I think that there\'s a lot that it does well. The characters that serve as Romeo and Juliet are both very different from the standard mold and work quite well. Straightforward, awkward, and childish heroes in romance anime are surprisingly rare these days, and Inuzuka felt like an exceptionally well written one, so he was quite interesting to watch. Persia felt more like a standard heroine, but she too was well written wherein her strength of will and emotions were expressed incredibly well. The supporting cast was also incredibly solid, wherein both Hasuki and Char strongly oppose their relationships at first due to their own feelings, but despite that do their best to support those they care about in their time of need anyway, with their assistance often being essential in providing mental and physical support to Inuzuka and Persia. Both of them, and especially Hasuki, simply shine through as amazing people. In terms of the remaining cast, a number of interesting characters were introduced that resulted in interesting plot developments here and there, but largely didn\'t feel like they were part of any larger arc, other than potentially the Wang twins and Airu due to where the narrative leaves off. As for the narrative itself, I feel that the highs were amazing, but there were only a few and for the most part things felt kind of weak. These highs were generally during climaxes, and where it felt like we really got to see the Inuzuka, Persia, Hasuki, and Char really showing their stuff. Outside of that their were definitely some cute moments, but largely it felt like things were taking too long to build up without things of import happening. It seemed to be trying to rely heavily on comedy, but the comedy wasn\'t that great and hence it wasn\'t really able to hold things up all that well. I should note that the final arc, the last three episodes, is an exception to that, that keeps a pretty strong focus and decent degree of intensity from beginning to end, and in the process manages to also be really strong from beginning to end with an amazing climax and incredibly satisfying ending, though one where the story clearly isn\'t over yet.The art style is really good, with the use of different styles to clearly separate the Black Dogs and White Cats working very well. The character designs within that are a bit simplistic but work well regardless. The art and animation are very well done with solid production values. The soundtrack is amazing, with a few tracks like ""I Will Change the World Like This"" standing out as especially amazing. The OP and ED are both pretty good, though not amazing like the soundtrack. all.

To be honest with you the Romeo and Juliet situation was kinda getting a bit too cliche for me but this one made me love the trope. I like the flow of comedy with some drama here and there. I say that the plot is a bit too dramatized but I really enjoyed it. The characters are all sweet and interesting. Persia is literally the sweetest girlfriend a man could ever dream for. Inuzuka is a literal dumbass but was a very likable character. Hasuki by far for me is probably the best girl, and my...favorite character. I swear she is just perfect. The relationship between the main couple and how things go forward have enough romantic oomph that it is enough to put a stupid grin on my face so I kind of like it. The ending got me feeling some type of way and I would really like a season two. The animation was very beautiful and fluid. Some fight scenes even got me hyped up.Overall 8/10 favorite character.

After the first episode we got introduced to the main characters of the anime Juliet and Romio, then it clicked, that this was a hundred percent ,,Romeo and Juliet"" rip-off, my motivation to watch such a anime went down, since I did not like the book, and if it was the same I knew I would drop it after couple of episodes. But this was an...exception, In the first episode we actually got a pretty good introduction into the whole ,,School sides fighting each other"", even got our confession to Juliet, that is rarely seen on any Rom-Coms (mostly they stretch out the story without the MC making any moves and either showing something at the end or just finishing the whole anime), so that really ramped me up. While going through these series, it really felt that it was fulfilling it\'s role as a ,,Rom-Com"", the romance moments were very adorable, and the comedy was top-notch, the voice acting really made it way more fun to watch, and I can\'t say anything bad about it.Story - 9The story in ,,Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet"" was really straightforward, we got introduced with what\'s going on in the first episode, everything went smoothly, there were no skipped bits that were questionable. This anime got the idea from the book ,,Romeo and Juliet"" and it displayed it very well, we can see the ,,tragic"" ending, which happily, it wasn\'t very tragic in the anime, and the whole prohibited romance. I, myself, don\'t have anything bad to tell about the storytelling.Art - 10The art was really astonishing, it was very fun to see something so colorful and well-made, couldn\'t keep my eyes off even for a second.Voice Acting - 9The voice acting in this anime was also really great, I really felt MC emotions being expressed in his/her voice (they were both amazing) also 0 complains about that, but some voices felt off... So I couldn\'t give this criteria a 10/10.Music - 10The music was like an opera, it was really good, you can really feel the situation, either if it\'s intense or all lovely-like. Have 0 complains about anything.Characters - 9The characters were really charming, I thought that introduction to new characters mid-way would be such a letdown, but I kind of wanted for them to be to be more in the scenes, the Prefect twins really were fun addition to the character list, and I kind of wanted to see more of them, although the introduction to Romio\'s brother and the prefect of white cats were a bit of a let-down, but that\'s since I really wanted to get a happy ending. But they were needed, so the anime could keep-up with the ,,Romeo and Juliet""Overall score 9/10.

While a lot of other animes focus on the build-up for the characters to become a couple, this one shows the hurdles the two have to jump over to stay together while simultaneously revealing how they grow closer together as a new couple.One of the few complaints I do have is how willing Juliet was to be Romio's girlfriend despite their rivalry extending to their childhood. It was very strange to me and made me wonder if she would also agree if someone else (perhaps Scott) said...something similar before Romio did. Nevertheless, I am glad that she did agree and that she did act kind of cold and distant with Romio at first. This made the relationship feel more real by showing that she was possibly having doubts which I believe is an appropriate reaction to a relationship that started this way and showed how her view of their relationship changes.This show likes to have fun with its viewers by creating strange but interesting characters (Cait and Rex being the strangest in my opinion), cute scenes between characters (like when Juliet becomes jealous and glares at Romio), and having relaxing moments where the two are just enjoying each other's company. While this show does provide its viewers with its fair share of fanservice, I feel like it's more like a bonus to some because the real enjoyment of this show comes from the interactions between Romio and Juliet.This is my first review, so please let me know if I made a mistake or spoiled something. Also, if you have advice you want to give then I would be grateful to hear it. something similar before Romio did.

This show has good artwork and some hilarious one-liners. Beyond that, there's not much to be found here. The characters as just cookie-cutter stereotypes with no real motivations or thought processes. The setting is a school which is divided in two based on which main character each person is affiliated with. The plot is just a bunch of random events, such as a sports festival, where the characters are somehow thrown into conflict, where they obediently stay, using whatever...excuse necessary to avoid actually solving the problem at hand until the appointed time. In short, it's just lazy writing with a few good jokes thrown in on occasion. excuse necessary to avoid actually solving the problem at hand until the appointed time.

With that being said this show is awful and I would have given this show an even worse score if not for the fact that the comedy can be funny at times. Our MC is probably the biggest loser I’ve seen in awhile in anime history. The show will try to sell to you that he is some aloof strong guy who is supposed to be respected by his people but...that idea falls flat so fast you’d be looking at Persia’s chest. The guy MC is the worst part of the show the girl MC is so forgettable becuase she literally has nothing to do in the show besides do whatever task the mc ask of her to make the relationship work. She has literally no purpose except stand there and look pretty which is ironic considering she’s supposed to be Juliet. Most of the supporting characters are dumped aside whenever the plot doesn’t need them anymore. Char is probably the supporting girl who gets the most screen time and yet literally nothing changes about her for the entirety of the show so does the other girl hatsuki who gets some development and yet nothing comes of it as the show continues and she gets thrown aside. If I didn’t mention other supporting characters it’s because their personality was nonexistent Everybody else in the show is one note and Try to set the tone that the white cats and black doggies hate each other but it’s so comedic that I can’t take any of it seriously, the world definitely needed a better way of representing how serious the conflict was between the relationship. The main gimmick of this show is like a Saturday morning supervillain “who is gonna be the bad guy today?” Or in this case “what made up excuse is gonna try to get in the way of our main character relationship this episode?” If you started at episode 1 and then skipped to like episode 9 you probably wouldn’t miss much since nothing happens for most of these episodes. Honestly I think male MC should have been a white cat because he’s just such a pussy. Every time he has a moment with girl MC he just can’t not act like a loser for one second. If you want an ultra cringe fest this is your show if you wanna see a high-school boy act like a dude who would kiss the ground where a girl stood on this is your mc which sounds funny but I promise you gets old very quick that idea falls flat so fast you’d be looking at Persia’s chest.

Magic Knight Rayearth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/435/Magic_Knight_Rayearth,"[""Magic Knight Rayearth was a fresh new take on the female warrior/magical style back in the 90's, that still holds up very well today.Story: 7/10Basically we follow three high school girls who get sucked in an alternate dimension, and need to defeat the main enemy oppressing the land, and thus make it home in one peace. Its pretty straight forward in that regards, but along the way they end up meeting endearing friends and allies that assist them in their mission(s). You will also be treated to nice little back stories on a majority of the main characters, and learn their strengths and weaknesses alike....There will also be little side quests that the girls have to go on, that steer way from the main plot in order to keep things a bit more fresh and preventing it from growing stale. The plot twists that happen are pretty surprising as well, both with the over all storyline as well as with the characters, but I won't say what because I don't wanna spoil it for ya. The ending, while not truly epic or anything like that, is a most satisfying experience. The action scenes are also pretty nice, very fluid and thought out, even if it may show a bit of repetitious during some of it. However it is not all without its flaws; the most frustrating thing I found with the story is that it tended introduce one too many fillers at some points, and at those times I just wanted them to get on with it already! They also implemented a bit too many characters for this number of episodes, some of the villians we never really got to know much about, and seemed to be their only to keep the cast number large. Wasn't that bad and they worked out a majority of the character's story sequences as much as possibly could. So while it does have a few fillers and may tend to drag on a bit. It has great character interactions, moving moments and good action scenes. I feel I should mention that although it does have a good number of combat and action scenes, it does play about 30% or more of the series in a somewhat more cutesy and comical approach. Nothing too major, but they are there.As far as offensive material goes, there is some blood in this title. Now while a good portion of the episodes can get away without showing any of the red stuff. There still are a few scenes where the girls get stabbed and blood is dripping down from them, or running along their wound. It never really comes off as exaggerated, but is still there none the less.Artwork: 8/10Most people may frown when looking at the clarity of it today, but the colors and detailed background were truly at their best when this came out. Nothing ever feels truly over done with it, and does make you feel attached to the scenery. The character design is also pretty charming to look at, they each have a scenes of style and flare to where you can tell that Clamp (makers of it) really made an effort to give them a nice appeal. My only complaint with it was the facial expressions, they seemed a bit too stiff at times, and I sometimes found it hard to connect with what they were feeling during the appropriate moments.Soundtrack: 6/10Like the artwork, it does show its age as well. Most of it does match well with what is going on, and does have an ere to adventure and struggle, even though the only real main memorable background music plays during the battles, all else of it is pretty discrete and sparse. I loved the opening and closing to this, both are sung by the same singer and are played out like a high pitched kinda of bouncy magical girl beat. I can tell you now though, it certain won't appeal to all, as some may find it a bit too cheesy and girly. Now regarding the voice actors, I think they did a pretty good job of giving the right girl the right role. While some voices may feel a bit over exaggerated, (especially regarding some of the villains) I think they pulled it off pretty well.Characters: 9/10I really dug them, they each have a certain amount of depth and likeness to each. As the story progresses you get to know them more and more, along with what their greatest attribute is, as well as greatest fear. They compliment one another very believable-ly, and you really get a sense of the friendship they all share, as they struggle to make their way home! Nobody ever comes of as a pest or cliche, which really make you believe the story that it implements. Again I only felt that they added a tad too many people for its episode length.Bottom Line: 8/10Magic Knight Rayearth remains a good solid watch that should still appeal to a well rounded majority of anime fans out their, while it does contain a few filler style episodes and a few repetitive fight scenes, if you can get past that then you'll be fine. It overall remains a fun and enjoyable little series that will satisfy you once it ends, all while leaving you with a sense of remorse because its over.Please keep in mind that this review was regarding the first season of Magic Knight Rayearth, the second one is a whole new ball game, and I felt it just didn't live up to the first one.

Just so you are aware of which one I was speaking of."", 'Try to mix Sailor Moon, Fushigi Yuugi and Aura Battler Dunbine and you get this animme but I say it appeals to outside the audiences of those animes as well. In comparison to Sailor Moon, the girls are in another world and have no need to conceal their identities. However, they don&rsquo;t make highly dramatic speeches of why evil is wrong or anything like in a super hero shoujo like Sailor Moon. But like Sailor Moon (specifically in the Stars series), Hikaru does try to emotionally reason with enemies and plea with them that fighting is wrong.  The anime in comparison to other magical...girl animes is more masculine and physical, and the way the characters are presented and developed in being more dependent than just their magical powers, but their own natural fighting abilities and their big hearts.When I say relying on their own natural fighting abilities I mean things such as Hikaru with Kendo, Umi with fencing, and Fuu with archery. It&rsquo;s not like Sailor Moon where she is managing to avoid a fight until she finds an opening to use her signature move of the season. With Fushigi Yuugi, its girls are transported to another world and they are seen as the savior. But these girls in MKR are chosen to be warriors and not celestial priestesses and have to fight their enemies themselves with minimal help from time to time. As for Aura Battler Dunbine, it&rsquo;d be a spoiler if I explain it to you but if you see at the every end of the opening credits, you&rsquo;ll get an idea of what I mean.In the end, with the way the story progresses, it&rsquo;s as if you are watching an old school Japanese style RPG game.The art is of course by Clamp, so you&rsquo;ll be able to recognize the way they draw the size of the eyes and the distinctive style to them. The eyes are the only thing that just looks alike but the characters have good variety to their design such as their uniforms, shapes of their faces and bodies. But in terms of other factors like hair styles and what not, it&rsquo;s typical what you see in other animes like natural colored blue hair and what not so that&rsquo;s always been a basic acceptable standard in anime. Because the majority of this anime takes place in another world, it is at liberty to allow more types of fictional creatures like Innova with his ears and have wicked costumes like Caladina&rsquo;s skimpy gypsy outfit and Zagato&rsquo;s heavy armor. The armor and the costume designs are very captivating and the environment of Cefiro is really breath taking and something out of Final Fantasy almost with floating continents and more in a world of middle ages but with monsters and magic.Of course like other magical girl animes a lot of recycled footage is used such as when they use their magical powers. Like every time Hikaru uses her flare arrow or something, it&rsquo;s the same animation sequence with a red background and so on and so forth. But this was made in mid 1990s and a certain percentage of anime was like that and acceptable. But for those of you that more new into anime, this might annoy you more than it did with me because I got into this anime when it first came out. Then sometimes for humor&rsquo;s sake, characters get miniaturized. I say this it to keep it appealing to the kids and to give it some humor. I can handle it, but for some people, they might find it annoying. Other than that, when they are not relying on magic to fight, the use of their natural fighting abilities plays out well and gives more exciting build up with the fights and makes it more enjoyable like that.The music is very excellent and beautiful. The opening theme Yuzurenai Negai meaning an Unyielding Wish is one of my favorite opening songs of all time. I like how it builds up very slow in the first few seconds and then bam, it becomes more like rock and pop. It has a good sense of tempo and pacing and the lyrics are a great way of telling the overall theme of having a strong will and always stick to your dreams. In other language versions like the English and Tagalog versions, they try to keep the song faithful. I know the Sega Saturn version in English has a different tune to the song from the anime version though. The ending theme Asu He No Yuuki or the Courage to Tomorrow is more pop-ish but shares the same things in a more light hearted context.The background music especially when the next episode recaps the previous is very intense because the situation of the show is presented that way. The music has a variety of ways of setting the atmosphere and tends to be more orchestral because of the setting in a more midevil world.The voice acting in the Japanese version is perfect. I really love the cast. I like Ryotaro Okiayu as Innova. Just perfect. Same with Juurouta Kusogi as Zagato perfectly matches his look. The English voices on the other hand, not too great and is why some anime fans hate dubs. Personally, I thought the Saturn game&rsquo;s dub cast was much superior and more faithful to the characterizations. Such as Hikaru being tomboyish and rowdy, Umi being formal, and Fuu being intelligent. The regular anime dub just didn&rsquo;t cut it for me.This anime is  more universally appealing that other magical girl animes because of the action and story isn&rsquo;t all that feminine in comparison to other predecessors. Before the anime and manga came out, there was the Saturn game that came out in late 1998. It was the last Saturn game to come to America. It comes with some great stickers and high quality box art. The game itself is like the old school Zelda games like Link to the past except you have control of 3 characters. The graphics are still excellent in terms of background but the game play style has the characters chibi-ized like in Zelda. It offers great challenges and the story itself still faithful to the original material, but offers an alternate story with more characters and development. It&rsquo;s a high recommendation for Saturn owners. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the anime for the characters, action, and unpredictable story. girl animes is more masculine and physical, and the way the characters are presented and developed in being more dependent than just their magical powers, but their own natural fighting abilities and their big hearts.When I say relying on their own natural fighting abilities I mean things such as Hikaru with Kendo, Umi with fencing, and Fuu with archery.

That should be enough for some of you, go watch it. For the others, well, I could shill this series all day. I'll talk a bit about both MKR I and II, because yeah the whole thing is cool, really cool. Possibly my favorite work of fiction.Magic Knight Rayearth looks cool. Everything about it, the aesthetic. The armor, the weapons, the robots, the setting, it all looks awesome. Big jewels set into bronze trim everywhere. Weapons and armor that get more powerful and transform as you use them, some hardcore RPG stuff. Red, green, and blue. Fire, wind, and water. Classic...stuff, great stuff, tried and true color-coded magical girls just work. The aesthetic of the series alone is enough to make it worth watching, but it's got plenty more backing it up. I don't want to bore you with a long review so I'm just gonna list some of the stuff that makes it great:Varied, interesting monster fights. Deeply moving villains. Beautiful romantic tragedy. Enormous crystal palaces. Sexy scantily clad women. GIGANTIC MAGIC ROBOT SPACE COMBAT. Come MKRII, political intrigue. Fantastic anti-villains. A literal Iczer chick. Gorgeous hand-painted backgrounds. Spaceships. Shoulder fairies. Demiurgic responsibilities.Take everything that's awesome and put it into one series and you have Magic Knight Rayearth. Hikaru, Nova, Lantis, and Eagle are some of my favorite characters in fiction, they are simply without flaw. Mokona is my self-insert. If I could force everybody on the planet to watch one anime series, this would be the one. Is that enough?

Really the first four words of this review should have been enough."", ""Welcome back to magical girl month. Let's talk about Clamp again. Yes, the same studio behind xxxHolic and Cardcaptor Sakura. Now, I've already talked about their most famous magical girl series and, although I could look at one of its films, this month let's look at the other major one, Magic Knight Rayearth. One of the odd things about Clamp is that their anime adaptations all seem to be handled by different studios. Cardcaptor Sakura was a Madhouse production, Production IG did xxxHolic and this series was handled by TMS, a studio that's done a lot of famous stuff like Lupin, Detective Conan, Sonic X...& Monster Rancher. None of which I've reviewed. So, let's take a look and see how they handle Clamp's work.Story:Our narrative opens at Tokyo Tower where three different schools have all come on a field trip at the same time. That seems a bit convenient, but I'll let it go because I honestly have no idea if that's actually a thing that happens for Tokyo Tower. It is a famous landmark, maybe it's a perfectly normal occurrence for multiple unrelated schools to visit at the same time. In a flash of light three girls, Fuu, Umi and Hikaru, appear in a strange world with floating stones. They meet a tiny man who calls himself Clef, the master mage. He tells the girls that to return to their world they have to revive the Rune Gods, become magic knights and save their land called Cephiro. Their princess and the pillar of their world, Emeraude, has been kidnapped by a villain called Zagato. But Clef's exposition dump is interrupted by the arrival of Alcyone, one of Zagato's minions. Clef buys time for them to escape, telling them to find Presea, a master blacksmith who will forge weapons for them. So, the girls set out on their quest to stop Zagato and save Cephiro.Let's start with the story issues. The biggest one involves a character death. I won't spoil who dies, but I will say that at this point it's been established that Fuu has healing magic and while this character is dying she doesn't do a thing. Later, they tell you that she tried her healing spell off-screen after the events you see, but there's still the problem of why she didn't do it sooner. Why wait until this other character stopped talking and moving to try and help them? Was she worried that she'd interrupt their speech by acting while they were still talking? It just makes the magic knights seem pitifully slow to react and incompetent. The worst part is that there are two easy ways to fix it. Method one, Fuu gets knocked out in the battle and doesn't wake up until it's already over. Method two, the character in question dies instantly. No time for a death speech or for healing magic. Honestly, the fact that they have the scene and only explain quite a bit later that Fuu did anything at all just makes it look like the writers forgot she had the healing spell or didn't think of having her use it at the actual critical moment, only realising they'd screwed up later on.There are some more minor issues too. For example, the magic knights spend way too long fighting the same few minions. Zagato is shown as having five major underlings and more than half the series is spent with two of them. Which results in the other three having really rushed conflicts with the knights and most of them not getting much screen time or room for development. The story is also pretty predictable since it relies heavily on cliches, but it's also intended for a pretty young audience so they'll probably find the events somewhat surprising, at least.So, what does the series do well narratively? Well, it is good at foreshadowing the events that are coming, which will give the intended audience a good head's up and some sources of tension. The heroes journey element is also done fairly well with a nice, steady progression. The romance elements, though not exactly good, are better than what you'd expect from Clamp's usual works. For one thing, only one of the girls gets a love interest, although the sequel might change that. For another thing, he is important to the plot and, in a rare move for Clamp, he's not far too old for her nor is he related to her. Granted, that's only a positive because Clamp is usually pretty pants at writing romance, but I'll give them credit for writing one that isn't gross or overly intrusive. I also do like that all three of our heroines do share the focus pretty evenly with all of them getting the spotlight at times, their own subplots and their own shining moments.Characters:The characters are pretty mixed. Hikaru, Fuu and Umi do get a respectable level of development and are somewhat fleshed out. However, the side characters are pretty weak. The vast majority of them follow a very basic and common character type with nothing to distinguish them from any other character who follows that type. They aren't terrible or offensively written but they also aren't good or interesting. Even the love interest is just your typical charming rogue character. They try to make the villains sympathetic, but most of that just involves using the lazy “they're doing it for love” excuse without putting any actual effort into making them the least bit compelling or three dimensional.Art:I won't lie, the series does not look good. Yeah, it was made back when everything was hand drawn so it's bound to be a bit dated by today's standards, but even when comparing it to other anime that came out around the same time, or earlier, it looks pretty bad. I will grant that there are some interesting designs, both in terms of characters and environments, but the animation is choppy and there are a lot of really noticeable art errors, usually having to do with drawing faces.Sound:Our main three are voiced by Shiina Hekiru (Hikaru), Yoshida Konami (Umi) and Kasahara Hiroko (Fuu). All of whom give competent performances, albeit not the best of their careers. You could say the same thing of the acting as a whole, it's competent but not anything special. The music is... there. It's not bad but it's not really good either. It's okay.Ho-yay:There's a bit. The series does have a lot of moments where Hikaru, Umi and Fuu strengthen their relationship and some of those seem to go beyond the realm of friendship. Still, it's obviously not deliberate and nothing comes of it. So, I'm calling the ho-yay factor a 3/10.Final Thoughts:Magic Knight Rayearth is a pretty standard series. It has some things that are pretty well done and others that are pretty badly done, but most of it is in between the two. All in all, it's average. If you're curious about it then it won't hurt you to check it out but you also won't be missing anything if you skip it. My final rating is a 5/10. Next week we'll continue the month with a look at Umi Monogatari: Anata ga Ite Kureta Koto. & Monster Rancher. None of which I've reviewed. So, let's take a look and see how they handle Clamp's work.Story:Our narrative opens at Tokyo Tower where three different schools have all come on a field trip at the same time. That seems a bit convenient, but I'll let it go because I honestly have no idea if that's actually a thing that happens for Tokyo Tower. It is a famous landmark, maybe it's a perfectly normal occurrence for multiple unrelated schools to visit at the same time. In a flash of light three girls, Fuu, Umi and Hikaru, appear in a strange world with floating stones. They meet a tiny man who calls himself Clef, the master mage. He tells the girls that to return to their world they have to revive the Rune Gods, become magic knights and save their land called Cephiro. Their princess and the pillar of their world, Emeraude, has been kidnapped by a villain called Zagato. But Clef's exposition dump is interrupted by the arrival of Alcyone, one of Zagato's minions. Clef buys time for them to escape, telling them to find Presea, a master blacksmith who will forge weapons for them. So, the girls set out on their quest to stop Zagato and save Cephiro.Let's start with the story issues. The biggest one involves a character death. I won't spoil who dies, but I will say that at this point it's been established that Fuu has healing magic and while this character is dying she doesn't do a thing. Later, they tell you that she tried her healing spell off-screen after the events you see, but there's still the problem of why she didn't do it sooner. Why wait until this other character stopped talking and moving to try and help them? Was she worried that she'd interrupt their speech by acting while they were still talking? It just makes the magic knights seem pitifully slow to react and incompetent. The worst part is that there are two easy ways to fix it. Method one, Fuu gets knocked out in the battle and doesn't wake up until it's already over. Method two, the character in question dies instantly. No time for a death speech or for healing magic. Honestly, the fact that they have the scene and only explain quite a bit later that Fuu did anything at all just makes it look like the writers forgot she had the healing spell or didn't think of having her use it at the actual critical moment, only realising they'd screwed up later on.There are some more minor issues too. For example, the magic knights spend way too long fighting the same few minions. Zagato is shown as having five major underlings and more than half the series is spent with two of them. Which results in the other three having really rushed conflicts with the knights and most of them not getting much screen time or room for development.

I was first exposed to it by way of the Sega Saturn game ads, which showed off classic CLAMP art that I did, and still do, consider among the best styling you'll see of its kind. I wanted to watch the anime, but it wasn't readily available at the time, and I never thought to check out the manga (which Tokyopop had recently put out), because...I was never big into comics and the like.Years later I was able to watch the series in its full glory, and it was everything my 11 year old self could have hoped for: an SNES-era RPG in anime form, executed pretty flawlessly. The CLAMP style is animated better than pretty much anything I've seen (okay besides maybe X/1999?), and the music and overall atmosphere compliment it exceptionally well. You'd almost swear you've heard some of the music in a Square game of old.The characters and story aren't especially deep, but they don't need to be. Every character manages to be likable and/or interesting; so pretty much all of them are memorable in some way. The anime builds interest slowly but steadily, and doesn't feel like it drags on, despite being significantly longer than the manga. The payoff at the end feels that much better for it.The new Blu-Ray release looks and sounds fantastic. Just like I had hoped, the art not only holds up in HD, but looks much better for it.So if you have nostalgia for the mid-nineties as far as both anime and video games go, you'll probably find a lot to love here. It's the perfect anime that really has something for everyone.

The story was made so that children and children at heart...can easily understand it. All about the power of friendship, not giving up no matter what and the power to believe. Its like a typical RPG game.Art: 9This is the part what i like most about MKR. Character design made by CLAMP is always beautiful, specially the uniform of the 3 girls, its soo cute with the color of their respected element. Next is their armor design, at first it looks like a plain armor but as soon as the story progresses and they level up (level up?!) it become cooler and coolerspecially their last armor, same thing with the swords, i love it specially Hikaru\'s sword design. The Mecha design, hmm not that bad...back in the day seeing those mecha makes me excited, specially when they combine. Emeraude\'s design is good too, simple yet elegant. Zagato wearing a black robe make you think that ""oh.. the bad guy"". Love it when they are in chibi mode...Sound: 8i dont know why but i really like the opening song of MKR... maybe because it was translated to my language and i often sing it (until now) when im still a child~ battle theme and SFX is good too. As for the voice actor/actress, they do a good job in their role~ specially Emeraude that\'s always pleading for help.Character: 8Hikaru the small, energetic and tomboyish type. Umi the ojou-sama type, and Fuu the girl with glasses. A little background story about them is fine. i take only a little interest in characters...Enjoyment: 8If u seen many kind of good sword and magic scene, you\'ll enjoy this a little. Well as for me i found it nostalgic. i really enjoy this anime when i was a kid, all those slash and magic scene specially Zagato\'s magic spells... There\'s only a little mecha fight which can be seen in the last two episode. When i saw it now i find those boss fight a little crappy~ easily beaten when their equipment leveled up...Overall: 8This is a great anime for boys and girls of all ages~ all i can say is just watch it...

XD', 'Magic Knights Rayearth is one of my all time favorite anime from the 90\'s as well as my first anime. The story is about 3 ordinary but unique girls: Hikari ( the red-headed tomboy), Umi ( the classy upper-rich Lass) and finally Fuu ( the smart and kind gal) who are mysteriously summoned to a Magical Land of Cephiro by It\'s Pillar ( basically it\'s Leader) Princess Emeraude to save the Land. The Girls are greeted by Master Clef ( the princess\' right hand, Looks like a child but is actually older than the girls) and explains to them that they must save The Pillar...from Zagato ( the main villain), to do that they must find the Rune Gods to battle him and his Henchmen. Though reluctant at first (well except Hikaru) the girls eventually makes up their minds and do their job in order to get back home. As the story progress, they gain new armors, weapons and powers as well as allies and enemies. They are aided by a cute creature called ""Makoto"" ( whose sole purpose is to summon to summon their tent, give comic relief and acts as a compass to the princess). As the story Progresses they eventually findthe real reason they are summoned and must make the ultimate choice. from Zagato ( the main villain), to do that they must find the Rune Gods to battle him and his Henchmen.

Unlike Sailor Moon which also has the same artstyle it also involves mecha in it which I was not excepting since the main characters in this series are girls. Magic Rayearth is another series by Clamp I noticed that  when Makona appeared in the 1st episode. Now I think everyone should give this series a try it's got romance ,adventure,comedy, and  hardships you know like your friend gets captured and you have to save them it's a awesome anime I say it's on my top ten anime list right now. "", 'So, what happens when you cross Fushigi Yugi, Sailor Moon, and a Dungeons and Dragons vibe with way too many comedic jokes? Well, I guess this shows it. The characters are pretty much generic, the story is pretty generic and to top it all off, the main characters seem rather stupid, including Fuu who is supposed to be smart. In fact, the only real character that actually had the right thought in the head during the first episode was Umi who kept trying to get back home. Of course, she slowly gets into the swing of the other characters after the first one.I’m not going...to lie; the characters are dip-shits. They are completely stupid most of the time without any real reason to be stupid. It did surprise me though just how smart Hikaru was once in a while, only to have it crashing down moments later in her stupidity. She has almost no holds bar over going head first into a fight and so its no wonder she levels up faster then the other two. Every single character, not just the main characters but even the side characters seem to have this strange way of explaining far more then they really should at any given time. It pretty much becomes a large monolog as they explain a very small piece of the plot.Umi is pretty much a loudmouth who will always speak her mind and sadly, that means be the annoying whinny brat all the time. She whines about everything, ‘I’m tired’ ‘My feet hurt’ ‘When will we be able to go back to Tokyo?’ stuff like that. She’s one of my least favorite characters even though all the characters do tend to become whinny throughout the show. Fuu is a rather sweet girl who always seems to care for anyone but even with that, she will not go head long into battle without some sort of plan. And then when you least expect it, she will do something stupid without thinking of the other people in her group. It’s like she has multi-personality disorder or something because she never does what she says.Ferio is a rather odd character in that he always seems to be switching sides all the time. I get kind of surprised that anyone actually believes a word that the trickster says. And Clef isn’t any help because he’s a stone who when he talks to them from the heart, his lips don’t move at all so you have no clue if its really him or actually a trickster at times.So, now this paragraph is about a big spoiler that I really have a problem with. The ending although a good twist, comes out of the blue and doesn’t really make much sense. The rune gods turn out to be mecha’s and they have to kill the person that summoned them. So much for saving the good princess from the ‘evil’ sorcerer. Turns out the sorcerer was misunderstood and was killed for no reason at all. I’m all for killing one to save a thousand but in this case, at least four lives were lost all because a princess went gaga over a guy, not to mention whoever else died by monsters and other catastrophes. This princess was a spoiled little brat in that aspect. Don’t take me wrong, I’m all for love, but this just kind of got ridicules.The animation jumps all over the place and goes from normal, to chibi, to overly dramatic rather fast. I believe one of these scenes did this in about 3 minutes. Not only that but they place a lot of still shots or really little movement as though they were hurting for cash, what I consider cheep ass animation tactics. In fact, after Clef is turned to stone, every time he ends up talking, he doesn’t move his lips at all in the hologram that shows him. I mean come on, if you want to show him when he’s supposed to be speaking, move his mouth at least a little bit or just do his voice with no image of him. Every character looks generic, we have the generic looking bad guys, the generic looking heroines, the generic looking side-kick plush toy, and to top it all off, a generic looking princess to bring this whole world into perspective. All the characters have really wide eyes that pretty much take up most of their faces, which have really pointy… jaws and cheeks? Characters are also really long legged like in the Sailor Moon shows, sometimes going to an extremely elongated body like in xxxHolic. Characters do not have to look like they are thrown in a taffy machine one minute, then really chibi the next.The English dubs are all about comedy it seems but I don’t blame it all on the dubbers. The animation also shows this but I already talked about that. Fact of the matter is, they seem to crack jokes this way and that, breaking any good drama the show could have had with a witty little joke. It throws me for a loop that they would do such a thing but I haven’t read the manga yet so not sure if Clamp actually did that as well. I do like that when they are getting a bit to obvious, they actually point it out. When going about picking voices, I believe they decided to pick the generic character voices. Julie Maddalena, who played Yumi from Chobits, Meiling in Cardcaptor, as Hikaru. Bridget Hoffman, who played Belldandy in Ah! My Goddess and Chitose from Chobits, as Fuu. Wendee Lee, who did Urd from Ah My Goddess and Ururu from Bleach, as Umi. Unsurprisingly, they do a good job though I get tired of these characters. to lie; the characters are dip-shits.

Well go for it, with Magic Knight Rayearth, but be warned, don't expect pre-teen romance, glittery accessories and lacy uniforms you won't get it here.Story: 9I – as many of my anime loving friends- am a big Clamp fan.Love the way they can tell a story and how they seem to make original things while doing it. This was no exception.You get really hooked in the story itself, as it slowly unveils through their journey, even though the main plot may be a bit cliché at first – Endangered princess in a parallel world needs rescuing...from evil wizard, and only the chosen ones can do it properly yada yada yada – it all comes out to a surprising twist in the end.This was the first the first Maho Shojo I’d EVER watched  where the girls actually…. Fought?I mean, the main action did not consist in delicate swirls, and heart shaped  attacks. They had swords,they cut beast with it, they even bled occasionally. I’m not all for violence, but in a way is quite refreshing seeing some realism in such a fantastical and delicate genre by nature.Art: 5Honestly, I hated the animation and art in this one.I started watching it because I saw some random scans from the manga, and honestly it looked really alluring. When I started watching it like… 4 years ago, I was a bit shocked with the way they adapted it, even though I don't usually prioritize art over plot when I watch anime.Evey time I say this about this anime I get the quick reply “Oh, but it was made in 1995, c'mon, don't be picky” and somehow that excuse doesn't make sense to me, if you think about some beautiful animes made even earlier than MKR, for example Sailor Moon.Is one of those cases in which you shouldn't even look at the manga before watching the anime, because the art will look pretty bad as soon as you have a reference.Character: 7So, I gave it a 7 just because you don't get that much character development in the series. I mean, you know them superficially but you never get to know that much about each of the girls’s background story, asides from the fact that Hikaru’s family owns a kendo dohjo, that Umi’s the captain of the fencing team in her school, and that Fuu… Ahm… you actually don’t get any info on Fuu, at least in the first season, besides that she can shot a bow.By the other hand, I love the way they don't emphasize any of the girls particularly in comparison, there's never a precise “lead” character, they're all as important, and that's quite interesting. All the characters are interesting, but not explored enough.(and don't get me startedIn the overall this is a solid 8.If you can get past the art – which I eventually did – you get immersed in the mysterious world of Cephiro, with Umi ,Fuu, Hikaru and Mokona in search of the path to saving princess Emeraude and Cephiro from the destruction Zagato represents.It can bee goofy and fun at times, and a bit dramatic some other times, but it's alway enjoyable. from evil wizard, and only the chosen ones can do it properly yada yada yada – it all comes out to a surprising twist in the end.This was the first the first Maho Shojo I’d EVER watched  where the girls actually….

I mean, you know them superficially but you never get to know that much about each of the girls’s background story, asides from the fact that Hikaru’s family owns a kendo dohjo, that Umi’s the captain of the fencing team in her school, and that Fuu… Ahm… you actually don’t get any info on Fuu, at least in the first season, besides that she can shot a bow.By the other hand, I love the way they don't emphasize any of the girls particularly in comparison, there's never a precise “lead” character, they're all as important, and that's quite interesting. All the characters are interesting, but not explored enough.(and don't get me startedIn the overall this is a solid 8.If you can get past the art – which I eventually did – you get immersed in the mysterious world of Cephiro, with Umi ,Fuu, Hikaru and Mokona in search of the path to saving princess Emeraude and Cephiro from the destruction Zagato represents.It can bee goofy and fun at times, and a bit dramatic some other times, but it's alway enjoyable."", 'What makes a ""Fantasy"" anime so good? When someone says fantasy, the very first word that comes to my mind is ""saving the world"". Magic Knight Rayearth is one of those anime who stood up in this kind of platform. Yes, very common and very predictable. The anime aired in 1994, a lot of anime produced this time are fantasies. As a kid, I grew up watching a lot of old school anime and most of them are actually about a group of people saving the humanity, incredible powers and needless to say a very bad animation style..[b]The Story -[/b]The story itself is very common,...nothing new about saving the universe, the world or other countries.. I\'ve seen this anime before when I was a kid but I didn\'t have the chance to finish it actually until yesterday. The story is predictable except for the ending. CLAMP\'s works are known to have unpredictable and unbelievable endings. As you can notice from their other works like Chobits and Code Geass, they went crazy on their endings which makes the story so good and yet so bad (it depends on what kind of people are watching) but imo the ending of this series is not that good but I have to admit that it is very unbelievable. I was caught up watching the series because the pacing was fast but in every end of each episode you will be able to know what will happen to their next adventures.[b]The Art -[/b]The animation is bad but considering that the anime was produced in 1994 I would say there\'s really nothing I can do about it. One thing I like about the series is how CLAMP managed to create a very good and quite detailed robot designs for their rune-god characters. I think this where they got the idea for Code Geass\' Knightmare designs.[b]The Sound -[/b]This is where the anime stands out. The opening and theme ""Yuzurenai Negai"" by Naomi Tamura brought life to the whole series. In my whole time watching anime, this is the second or probably the third time I got mesmerized by a good sound tracks like Clannad and Angel Beats. They made different variations of this song and inserted it in the series and guess what... it really added some good feelings and excitement while watching the series.[b]The Character -[/b]Three MCs got warped into a world known as ""Cephiro"" but surprisingly, they don\'t look like they are scared or anxious or they just lack emotions? The characters are like jobs in a very popular RPGs. Magus, Knights, High Priest, Summoner, Illusionist, Blacksmith and a princess. Each character develops very slowly but surely.[b]The Enjoyment -[/b]I can\'t say I really enjoy the series because of all the plot holes I found while watching it. Bad animation, the story is predictable and other noticeable holes made it hard to finish the series. I can sit for whole day and watch a 24 episode long series if it is very enjoyable but this time I wasn\'t.[b]Overall - 5/10[/b]Nevertheless, it\'s still a good thing that I finished watching a series that I started when I was a kid. The only thing I like about this anime are the OSTs. If you like fantasy anime then you might want to check this out.. nothing new about saving the universe, the world or other countries..

The characters are likable and innocent, but a bit childish. The animation was good, with the nice 90's style that was popular (huge eyes, spiky hair and all).. The characters were somewhat developed, the story really only focused on the main three, not really explaining others who helped them in their journey. It was a good story that was enjoyable. "", ""This season alone would be enough to put the anime into my top 10 favorite of all time.It's a story thoroughly crafted, with a bittersweet lesson about the hardships and injustices of one's life within the world. The soundtrack is simply wondrous, helping the voice actors' perfomance with a solid boost, especially during dramatic scenes.Characters are well developed, with the three main characters having well established arcs concluded into the story seamlessly. The villains also adds to the plot's purpose. Although the last few episodes can feel quite rushed, they still manage to deliver the intended narrative by all metrics.The visuals, though old by...today's standards, compensate for its age with elegant uniqueness. Machinations of the representation for the characters have quite specific deliveries at key times, contributing to the feel overall of the series, even at the naive moments.The show overall deserves a 10 out of 10 in my book, definitely an experience worth revisiting. today's standards, compensate for its age with elegant uniqueness.

Three girls are thrown into another world and are tasked to save it.They overcome a trial after trial, each testing their resolve, their friendship. And in the end...The anime is quite simple in its structure, but it is done with love, and as a result it is interesting to watch. Relatively simple premise works well, fights are interesting, and story is interesting as well, every character is well designed, and the music is magnificent. So in the end you get something that resembles a lot an interesting fairy tale rather than your typical isekai anime.Detailed breakdown...below:Story: 7/10.THe premise is very simple, however actual journey from start to the end is handled very well. Characters develop and get stronger, they experience many fights, and once again, even though many story turns are quite simple, they\'re touching, and have feeling of importance about them.There are minor issues. On some occasion the anime start padding story wit hflashbacks. It doesn\'t happen often, but there are at least two episodes that were quite obviously artificially extended.Art: 7/10Very nice characters done by clamp. Meaning triangular faces and attractive big eyes. Characters are stylezed and at the same time are well detailed, designs of enemies are very interesting to look at as well.The only issue is that in some circumstances backgrounds looked like they lacked quite a lot of detail. That didn\'t happen often, but I\'ve spotted few such moments. I\'ve also noticed recycled animation on some attacks.Overall the art could be described as ""higher quality old-school"".Sound: 8/10:There are some truly amazing musical themes here. The combat theme, for example, adds weight to any situaiton in which it plays, and has both noble and tragic feeling to it. So, sound part is great.Character: 6/10:Well... there is character development going on as gfirls progress and grow stronger, and their interactions looked convincing and lovely enough. However, this is a formulaic anime. Meaning a character follows his or her central idea or role from start to the end. So, It is not an extremely deep psychological analysis of every character. They have a type, they act within bounds of their type, and in the end it looks good.Enjoyment: 7/10:I actually quite like it. This anime has somewhat pure and naive quality to it, and somewhat simple scenario and tropes offer a nice change compared to overly convoluted plots of other anime. This is a fairly straightforward story, and its straightforwardness makes it even more attractive.Overall: 7/10.Overall: I\'d recommend to watch it. It is a quality anime that mostly goes in the straight line from start to finish, but despite that it is still very  interesting. Cute/interesting characters, amazing music. What\'s not to like?So the bottom line is: Even though this is not a Evangelion, it is definitely a solid title, and it is worth watching. below:Story: 7/10.THe premise is very simple, however actual journey from start to the end is handled very well.

It first remainded me of Sailor Moon. It was very cute and nice. But the end was a bit annoying. What I thought was : ""If the people of Cephiro cannot pray for it\'s peace and safety then Cephiro deserves to be destroyed. Putting all this on one person\'s shoulders is too much!"". I did not like the ending and did not buy all that will be reunited in death stuff. Also in my opinion the villans are the Rune-Gods, Clef and Mokona. They all lied...and deceived the girls for the benefit of a world that deserves to be destroyed. I hate liars and those that lie cannot call themselves good no matter of their motives. and deceived the girls for the benefit of a world that deserves to be destroyed.

It feels a bit a drag, all characters besides the protagonist trio are forgettable, Presea is good too, but being a side character she doesn't show up much.Something worth praising is the opening, it has beautiful animation, the singing and the lyrics are great, probably one of the best I ever heard.Honestly, I'm not writing this review about the whole show per se, but for people to skip the whole filler episodes, they are not worth your time, and don't have anything good to add, unless you are REALLY enjoying the anime. thing is that I watched a couple of episodes in the 90's (I have a vivid memory of that waterfall Zagato's minions hide), but I was never interested in this show, even now as I was watching it, I took a long time to watch only 20 episodes of this show.

I have rewatched it once or twice as a teenagaer - and now again, as an adult.Do I still love it, would I recommend it? Yes, with a 'but'.I believe the strong part of Magic Knight Rayearth takes time to reach. The early episodes (or, perhaps, the majority of S1) may be difficult for newcomers to consider captivating enough to continue watching. Season 1 is an adventure story that defines its goal outright, progresses a bit in every episode, has...its share of seriousness and comedy, but only becomes special and begins to stand out - in my opinion - towards the end, from episode 16 on. In these last 5 episodes, as we're heading for the season finale, the atmosphere becomes darker, drama increases and the resolution of the story is absolutely tearjerking.The above is the reason why my previous rewatches of MKR always started around that point. To me it's the moment when the show becomes good, shifts into a darker, more grim setting and remains in it for the entirety of next season (which is my personal favorite) as it explores the consequences of events from S1.Overall: 7/10 (arithmetic mean of 6/10 and 8/10 for the respective parts)If early episodes make you skeptical about the show, it gets better, especially if you're in for the drama.P.S I find music another strong point of the series.

Rayearth is a classic 90’s isekai which is notable for being one of the few mixes of magical girls and mecha. I knew the overall plot for s1 and 2 before watching due to Super Robot Wars T, but figured I’d at least give the first season a watch.--STORY--I will say if you’re here for the mecha action, you’re gonna have to wait a good 18 episodes before actually getting any. The vast majority of the show is your typical DnD/fantasy show with of course various magical girl elements. It’s not the...most interesting thing, but it can be a fun watch here and there. The major twist at the end/ending certainly elevates the story, but it’s for the most part a standard fantasy show.--CHARACTERS--Characters are simple, but still fairly enjoyable. There’s some nice growth for the main 3 girls overall, and the antags too get some nice development. Ferio works well as a side character, and his relationship with Fuu is standard, but done well.--ART/ANIMATION--The actual art is fairly nice to look at. It bleeds 90’s shoujo, and is perhaps the most distinctive part of the show. Character and monster designs alike are quite good, and the eyes in particular are quite striking.Animation varies in quality, but is usually good. I appreciated actually showing injuries/blood, as it enhanced some moments a good bit.--SOUND--OP and ED are very catchy, and the OP in particular has a classic feel to it. Main soundtrack is average. Voice acting is quality, and there’s some satisfying sfx for fight scenes/magic.--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION--Overall I enjoyed Rayearth, but it is a bit of an odd situation as far as recommending it. I would rec it just fine if you're an isekai or magical girl fan, but as a mecha fan? Well there’s no mecha action at all till the final battle in s1, and while s2 has a lot more mecha action it’s a peg below s1 in quality. Still tho you might enjoy it, give it a few eps and see what ya think. most interesting thing, but it can be a fun watch here and there.

I remembered this e-game I played called Season of the Sakura. I found some commentary about it and discovered that the main characters were based on the characters from Magic Knight Rayearth. What a trip! Maybe I should check out the actual series.So I did a little bit. I went through a few episodes of the beginning and a few at the end. Watching 1/2 of the series doesn't put me in good position to write a definitive review. So I'll write a little one....Take it with a grain of salt.StoryThree high school girls get transported to a fantasy world to be its saviors. They meet friends, fight enemies, level up, and eventually discover the true nature of their mission.The set up takes place in the first ten minutes. Our gals get whisked away to the fantasy land. We get the idea that the princess who transported them is in distress and needs their help to save the world. We meet the some allies, the bad guy, and bad minions. It's a decent start.The end of the story, the twist, is actually pretty good. It turns out that Zagato and the princess have something more going on and the princess has a different interpretation of the Magic Knight's mission. No spoilers here.CharactersThere are the three main girls: the smart one, the fiery one, and the calm one. They are designed so you can tell which one is which by looking at them. I love it they do that. From what I can tell, the characters act true to their personalities throughout the entire story. They're cute too.There is Princess Emeraude who summoned the girls to the world. She seems distressed and to need some princess saving. She is imprisoned (presumably) by Zagato, who is the main baddie. He has giant shoulder pads and a deep voice.The mascot is Mokono, a rabbit thing, because animes need cutesy mascots.ArtThe characters have a distinct look: giant eyes, eye shadow & lashes that extend off the face, brightly colored hair, and a color scheme. I like that the personality of the characters can be inferred from their look.This anime looks like it is from the 90s. Everything is hand drawn, frames are reused frequently, the colors are faded, and the motion is choppy. I don't mind it, to be honest.The designs are interesting. The MCs color schemes are consistent with their elements. The backgrounds are average for the most part. Many modern animes have backgrounds that can probably pass as wall art. Not in this anime.The normal animation breaks into cuter animation occasionally to play up humor and panic. It's anime.SoundsThe voices are good. The characters sound the way they should. It's pro work.The music is pretty good. The OP is distinctive, upbeat, and catchy. The ending theme is not quite as catchy. The songs sound very 90s with the light rock/pop feel.

It is like a less girly & more adventurous/ dramatic than Sailor Moon.I think it's kind of funny how I came to watch MKR. It added to the enjoyment.Overall, it was decent.

This is also my first true ""Magic girl"" style of anime, and from what I\'ve heard about this genre this fits it to a tee, there is little explanation of the world, characters, or what the main conflict is other than bad guy is doing bad thing, stop bad guy from doing bad thing. It was not entertaining enough for me to suspend my disbelief for the glairing plot hole of asking the question why, why save good person, why do they suddenly have magic, why can\'t they use magic here, why not just kill them, why must the legend be fulfilled, none of this is answered in the first five episodes. I gave it a fair chance, but to others that just want to watch something in the ""Magic girl"" genre and don\'t want to think, might enjoy this one.2/10Couldn\'t hold my attention long enough before I asked the question why. fail.

Reeking of nostalgia, when magical school girls were all the rage and believing in the self and one’s will, against all logic, was all a heroine needed (never mind the will of the antagonist). Way back, even prior to the establishment of stereotypical characters. Have to give it some credit for being those foundational series before the importance of character growth and narrative became as established as it is today. It’s also so difficult to be harsh on the loopholes, flatness of characters, and inconsistent storylines when it was a children’s show.

This may seem like an interesting choice to some, but I find that it makes sense; the magical girl genre is typically associated with maturity, and motherhood is an element that has the potential to work very well with the themes present in the series previously (traditional views, as well as childhood and innocence). Interestingly, the series manages to have its cake and eat it too, so to speak: the girls grow a strong sense of responsibility in caring for baby...Hana, but maintain their ordinary lives as well as their friendship. The series also fleshes out Witch World with the addition of Wizard World, a counterpart to it of sorts. The series also has a semi-focus on fleshing out the treatment of witches and what caused their dislike and distrust of humans. This leads the series to present more traditional values which are reminiscent of its time period. Many episodes revolving around Hana contain important lessons about loving your child unconditionally and caring properly for them. This is great, as it can encourage people to learn the joy of having children. Unfortunately, the series is unable to keep its stride for long: several episodes are focused on ""health examinations"", which crop up periodically and replace the witch apprenticeship exams seen last season. Generally, nothing of substance occurs from these (aside from a certain character warming up to the idea of humans being mothers). The Queen\'s identity is still veiled in mystery with little information about her available, though we learn important facts about Witch World\'s history and how it affects their current relations with Wizard World. Speaking of, Wizard World was a great addition to the series: fleshing out a certain character as well as introducing many more, it had great potential to bring the series around. Unfortunately, it takes a backseat in terms of the plot. While I\'d believed that a season centered around Wizard World would be really entertaining, the series unfortunately stuck to the main plot of Hana and simply used its new developments as a way to extend the status quo. Regrettably, several items (particularly, those of potential merchandising, such as phones) as well as plot devices were more often than not unused, completely forgotten about, or even retconned out later completely later in the season. This made certain characters come off as inconsistent in their motives. Additionally, there were more than a few handfuls of poorly written episodes; these mostly consisted of one-note side characters who only had a major role in a single episode, possibly a major role in a prior episode. Other times, episodes were ruined due to poor writing, such as the series contradicting its own rules on forbidden magic or not fleshing out the implications of their rules properly, leading to situations where the characters would normally have severe consequences. Some recurring characters also became more of a chore for the series to focus on than anything: these included Dela (who stopping appearing altogether without reason about halfway through the season), Hashitaro and Surumeko, Mota and Motamota, as well as several others. That said, I believe the season was decent in realistically fleshing out Hana\'s potential power, though it often amounted to little more than disorganized chaos. The season ending was regrettably a letdown as well, featuring a twist that came out of nowhere and undermined a previous episode. Overall, I\'ll need to assign the series a 5/10.

Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21573/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear_GX,"['Ah, Symphogear GX, a show that people may have forgotten by now. It’s one of the more underrated series this year and honestly not surprising. GX is the third season of the series’ trilogy that began from the original series. And by story standards, a lot has evolved since then. I’ll state the obvious for now. Watching the previous season is absolutely necessary as you will be completely lost if you come into GX fresh.Hibiki and her friends are now much more experienced in using their technology while gaining respect for one another with as new friends. If you remember the events of the second...season (Symphogear G), they came in conflict with the mysterious Symphogear users composed of Maria, Shirabe, and Kirika. Now that their conflict has resolved, there seems to be a peace in their world. Or is it? Unfortunately, the third season introduces a new threat.The third season establishes a story where the new enemies are no pushovers. Led by a mysterious girl coming from the world of alchemy named Carol, she wishes to bring the world into despair. This also introduces the Autoscorers, mysterious fighting warriors named after holy archangels who support her ambition. The story turns deadly as their first encounter with Hibiki’s friends show the testimony of their power. For what’s worth, the third season makes it clear that the new antagonists are capable of destroying the world. As the story progresses though, startling revelations are discovered when we learn more about their goals. As generic as it sounds, Symphogear GX does able to entertain the audience with its sheer ability to craft conflict.Similarly, the conflict extends more than just the fighting between the two sides. There is an abundant amount of interpersonal issues as well such as with Maria’s background, Hibiki’s relationship with her father, Tsubasa’s tragic past, or Chris’ own self-doubt. Symphogear GX makes connections with the previous seasons as it hopes to remind viewers the purpose of what the characters are doing. By doing so, I think the show has a firm grasp at characterizing the characters. Unfortunately, the story itself is quite predictable with each progressing episode. Some resolutions are swift while the buildup can be a mixed bag. And like the previous season, there’s comedy in it as well although most of it has some ill-timing.The show still maintains a nice amount of visual artwork. From a visual standpoint, it actually improved especially compared to the first season. Character designs looks steady and is resourcefully decorated. The transformation scenes are focused with a good amount of highlight. Fan service on most parts is light while replaced by full throttle action, most of which features well-coordinated cinematics. It’s also noticeable that some of the new enemies are almost unlike anything the first two seasons. Their designs bring a colorful yet malevolent intention with their presence. Finally, some of the newer battle gear that the Symphogear users looks quite stunning.At the core of Symphogear is the music. It’s one of the strongest points of the show as main characters each has their own signature song. And on most parts, I think it’s attentive enough to keep the momentum of a fight going. Even Carol gets her own character song as well because she is the Big Bad. Likewise, the OST is performed with a lot of tense moments that dictates what Symphogear GX is – a show that combines music and action into a battle extravaganza.Symphogear GX may have ended but it’s made some memorable moments. Its storytelling isn’t exactly the best but sticks to the point throughout each episode while getting the fans to anticipate for more. Anyone who is also interested in the music will find that GX will be a nice treat to the ears. By the time you finish watching this show, it might bring somewhat of a nostalgic feeling to know that it’s all over.

It\'s the definition of ""turn your brain off and it becomes awesome"" anime, a popcorn anime in the most affectionate of definitions.I loved the first season, disliked most of the second season, and LOVED about 70% of the third season. The remaining 30% was either meh, or too absurd and poorly done to even be able to turn your brain off enough to enjoy it. Episode 6 of GX was by far the best episode in any anime this season, for what it is; it rivals even...the best of the year. You know the feeling when the side-crew are getting stomped, not even Piccolo can help them and Goku is in recovery? He comes back and unleashed a flurry of badassity that causes your blood to pump and your hairs to stand on edge.That was Hibiki in episode 6, it was such a great episode and despite the first episode being the best opener, and the episodes 2-5 being decent in their own right, episode 6 destroyed any of my thoughts that suggested GX wouldn\'t be prime Symphogear.Then, sadly some amusing characters died, a character is brought back from S2 as more or less a plot-shield to keep the show going, and oh my god was I ever wrong with episode 6. The final episode of this show was absolutely abysmal.It literally felt like the writers were fed up with the show and just wanted it to be over with, the tense build up in the previous episodes, killing off the two new characters with decent character designs, all culminated into a ""With our powers combined... GIANT FIST ATTACK!"" which would be cool if there were a legit explanation for it, which there wasn\'t.Then you have a weird lead-in to a possible fourth season...I was expecting to be really bummed that Symphogear was ending, after finishing it, I felt totally cool with it.Not to mention that last scene.... that was really awkward.However, for the amount of fun I had through the show, if this does get a fourth season I wouldn\'t hesitate to recommend it, but if this were the finale of Symphogear as a series, then I don\'t recommend Symphogear to anyone, period.

Shirabe and Kirika relational development goes full out yuri undertones as well as...their misunderstandings from that gets addressed further, while Maria goes through her hangups of her sins (like Chris did in G) she did in G and finally Chris\' development as trying to protect Shirabe and Kirika, overall for the hero side things, it feels like many of the character developments gets swapped around with other characters (besides Hibiki\'s and Tsubasa\'s anyways).The villains however there are only one to really focus on that being Carol and her motivations, it\'s explained however it ""nearly"" went into a mess, if not it could have been handled a bit better, the four dolls LA mentioned before however are nothing but plot devices to move the plot forward. Overall in terms of characters, interactions and development, if you wanted more growth from the main Symphogear cast then GX delivers.In terms of animation, once again helmed by Satelight, LA will say for the most part, the battle pieces were even higher detail than G (and all the more bombastically batshit insane at times), LA however did some rare facial derps/body anatomy quality dips here and there but LA can ignore it as it\'s still ""rare"".The music once can get HUGE props for this season, from all the singer/voice actors of the Symphogears did an outrageously great job for their character portrayals and battle OST singing (those once again being Aoi Yuuki, Nana Mizuki, Ayahi Takagaki, Yoshino Nanjo, Ai Kayano, Yoko Hisaka and the newly added Inori Minase) where to the point LA saw the battle OST of this season being the best of the entire series, the new OP \'\'Exterminate\'\' sung by Nana Mizuki is a personal favourite in terms of musical score, however LA will say that G\'s \'\'Vitalization\'\' has a special spot for LA still, Exterminate is at best at 2nd in terms for openings, the battle OST\'s overall considering which character you like or the style of music, the OST is stellar and expected of this series.Now onto the technical features of this season, in terms of plot twists, considering how much faster pace this season brings forth much more than G did, the plot twists just comes outta nowhere including an old villain coming back and just ruining LA\'s day, LA ""gets"" the the plot twist and these kind of twists are something of a staple in the Symphogear series, but it really does goes from either ""too convenient"" to outright ""batshit crazy YOU just HAVE to accept it"".Because of the fast pacing however LA will note that although LA really likes the further development of the main cast, some of the characters\' development gets done pretty quickly not even giving LA time to breathe from certain character developments, those being Tsubasa\'s and Hibiki\'s issues getting resolved just like that. Chris however gets some pretty jumpy character development and a lack of focus at times. The other new character that got introduced to GX Elfnein voiced by \'\'Misaki Kuno\'\', however gets good character development and somewhat predictable plot twists involving her but she becomes her own character nonetheless.LA will point out that the newer ""gimmick"" to this season that being the Ignite Module did bring us a new transformation that is oddly reminiscent of Maria, Shirabe and Kirkia\'s previous Symphogear color palette just more sharper and the ""use"" for the Ignite Module becomes rather predictable as to what Carol is planning, but nonetheless it brings up lore that was mentioned back in the first season and LA will praise this little feature for actually having a purpose other than moving the plot (and instead giving us something of character evolution for the Symphogear main cast).Now the fanservice is even more rampant more than G, with just more full body nudity to boob bounces, it however is nothing to rage about as although the fanservice is as rampant as ever it\'s still rare and isn\'t the primary focus.The battle scenes however LA will be completely honest, that almost all the battle set pieces are UP TO AN ELEVEN from G, perfect example is the first episode of this season and the final battle set piece.The ending by all means blew LA away with an even more bombastic final battle than G\'s and did a nice epilogue of every character, in which they resolved EVERY plotline of this season, LA was once again satisfied with this ending although the little plot twist with Elfnein did surprise LA.So LA posed a question at the start of this review, is this season gonna surpass G\'s or be like the inconsistent mess of the first season, well...with all the nitpicking and praising LA had with this season.

The villains are uninteresting this time around and for the first time in Symphogear, the final battle is crap. It has none of the tension the original or G had. Every plot twist is a massive asspull and comes out of nowhere. While thats normal for a show as campy as this one, GX takes it way too far. The subplot with Hibiki's father is overly forced and loses any of...its emotional appeal.  They try to focus on too many characters at once so you feel jerked around all over the place. This season also has a vastly different tone than the last and also uses the dreaded monster of the week format. I almost recommend skipping this season or reading a synopsis if Symphogear AXZ turns out to be good.The biggest problem is how halfassed every fight scene in this season is compared to the first two seasons. Its a complete letdown, considering how awesome the fight choreography was in the original Symphogear and G. Compare the Maria VS Tsubasa fights in G or anyone vs Fin'e in the original. In GX every fight is over in one or two moves.  As someone who likes the first two seasons this is such a massive falloff that I'm reluctant to watch AXZ when it airs. its emotional appeal.

Additionally, the villains this time not only are the most inarticulate yet in terms of motives and methods, but they also add virtually nothing to the theme of the nature of communication and song that the series is supposed to be built on top of. To make matters worse, the concept of Hibiki's berserk mode is ruined, as the mode is now something that is common to all Symphogear users. Nearly all the character drama for the first two thirds of the...show feels incredibly forced and underdeveloped.Fortunately, in the last third, some amount of the season is redeemed. Tsubasa and Hibiki both deal with issues with their respective fathers. While both of these tensions resolve in a way that is predictable and comically simple, it is still fairly effective and by far the greatest source of intrigue and satisfaction this season. show feels incredibly forced and underdeveloped.Fortunately, in the last third, some amount of the season is redeemed.

It was the only time I binged something to the end in the span of about 3-4 days. Which is why it pains my heart to say that GX has shattered my enthusiasm for the series.To avoid overt spoilers, I'll keep this brief. The plot spends far too long with the main antagonists while simultaneously making them too strong to beat, but not willing to actively defeat the main protags. In addition, it makes an active effort to try to redeem some of the most...detestable father figures I've ever seen in anime. They're not even detestable of epic proportions like, say, Gendo Ikari from EVA, they're just unlikeable and impossible to sympathy with.I'm not gonna say it's without positives. I love the  (technically) new  additions to the main cast, and the new forms introduced are also alright. detestable father figures I've ever seen in anime.

Animation budget was through the rough for the most part, but proper direction for the animation was very strange this time around. Lots of jump-cuts between scenes and shots that aren\'t the most cohesive, cliffhangers where they didn\'t need to be, issues getting resolved mere minutes after being brought up. It\'s an ambitious season, with the introduction of alchemy as a new power, and perhaps some of the biggest stakes the girls have faced so far. But it falls flat in places that...truly matter, and even some of the more touching scenes feel hashed in for the sake of being there.Introducing the new villains, Carol and her Autoscorers have very interesting designs, personalities, and motives. The new Alca-Noise, however, are just... they exist to give the girls a reason to power up in this season. Carol\'s motives combined with the Alca-Noise\'s existence is very interesting, but in reality, the show probably would\'ve thrived more in the story department if they hadn\'t brought the Alca-Noise in to begin with. But then, there\'s the issues where a lot of the fight scenes with the Noise would\'ve even exist to pad out the screen-time and give the girls something to sing and fight against.The Noise were a huge threat in season 1 and 2, being spawned in to turn even the most innocent civilians to dust. But in season 3, they really only exist to cause the girls grief and act as dummies for them to swing their new weapons at. It also makes the huge finale of season 2 feel less impactful since... welp, the Noise are back. Yippee.The weakest characters this season, sadly, go to Kirika and Shirabe. I thought before that they were considerably weaker than Maria back in season 2. But now they\'ve had a whole season to get fleshed out even more, I\'m only let down. In season 2, they were more or less vehicles for Fine\'s character arc to come to a close. And while they did have their Ignite module moment in this season, they were once against just used as vehicles for Cris\' character arc when it came time for Cris to use her Ignite module. And not even in such a great way, where they would realise they weren\'t as strong as the other girls, but together, they didn\'t need to be. They simply got back up after being blasted, blocked a single attack for Cris, then fell right back down. It\'s insulting to the two of them, and to anyone that was really rooting for them this season.And I\'m actually really sad to see what\'s happened with Hibiki. Her chararcter arc this season was about coming to terms with her father, who abandoned her family 2 years ago when they were being berated for Hibiki\'s survival of the Zwei Wing concert attack. I\'m sorry if anyone finds this man\'s redemption touching, but it irks me very badly. I simply do not believe that anyone could forgive a man for abandoning his family when they most needed him, simply because he couldn\'t deal with the stress. Rather than embracing his daughter and making sure she was okay after returning from such a harrowing experience, he just shirked that responsibility to his wife and mother-in-law, and left his daughter father-less.Hibiki\'s personality has a lot to do with forgiveness and believing in others who may do wrong. I can understand that she may wish to give her father a second chance. But the man is painted as a saint the moment he realises what he\'s done to his daughter. Suddenly all the bad things he\'s done are swept under the rug, and Hibiki only ever needed her father\'s support to get over the issues she had this season. After we, the viewers, saw how much stress Hibiki was going through after her dad left, we\'re treated to an arc where we\'re told ""He\'s actually a great person! He just made a silly mistake and he\'s working towards forgiveness!""Just, no. It\'s bad. This is bad writing, and a bad message to send. Even if future seasons paint his ""redemption"" as a gradual thing and something that isn\'t just swept under the rug, that\'s what this season has done. It doesn\'t sit right with any of the others I\'ve discussed this with. It is bad.On top of that, the sequence we see of Hibiki whispering her phrase ""Don\'t worry, I\'ll be fine!"" to herself. Those shots were taken from AFTER her father abandoned her? And you could see how badly she was struggling with this burden she now beared. And her outright claim that the phrase her father told her is the strength she had been using all along. It\'s just insulting.With that out of the way, I think season 3 did excel in various different areas. It had a bit of a weak start, but the second act of the anime, where we see everyone gradually activating their Ignite modules with their own reasons to be fighting, was very good. Tsubasa\'s in particular was quite interesting. The revelation that Tsubasa is an extremely pure-blooded member of the Kazanari family, and she was conceived just to be the family heir, is interesting! Family relations like these are always rough topics to cover, but Symphogear\'s writers don\'t shy away from it. They\'re fully willing to admit that some of the traditions in these cultures are frowned upon still. But they can tell their stories in ways that are still moving. Tsubasa\'s ""father"" keeping Tsubasa\'s room exactly as she left it, but keeping it clean and dusted should she come back some day? Seeing how desperately she wished to mean something to her family, to her father, and knowing he must\'ve cared the whole time, despite the circumstances? That\'s moving.The Ignite modules as well, are a very interesting addition to the Symphogear arsenal. And it does make me wish that the finale didn\'t go straight for the X-Drive ending that it has for three seasons now. These newly cultivated forms of Dainsleif modules, that make or break the user of them, and have 3 built-in safeties to protect the user? That\'s terrifying. And it\'s sad to see it didn\'t even end up having much of a difference on the final battle. Ignite modules appear to be the reason they were all able to activate X-Drive, but if these X-Drives had been styled after the Dainsleif, or there was just a new song instead of the same one from season 2, it would\'ve felt like a more utilised concept.Alchemy being brought into the picture is also a strong-point of season 3, that was sadly diminished by the ending. It\'s basically just magic. Straight up magic, which is different from what Symphogears have achieved so far. Having this straight-up fantasy concept clash with the high-tech Symphogear armour was interesting to watch. It added new levels to the combat and fighting, to the destruction and properties of the world. It\'s why I do feel sad that the ending just ended with the villain saying she had a relic of her own, and that this was essentially just Symphogear on a different level. It doesn\'t make alchemy feel as unique, but it\'s still a very cool idea.Music as a whole this time around was immaculate. Nana Mizuki kills it with the intro song, as well as her duet with Cris\' VA, Ayahi Takagaki. I\'m still not the biggest fan of Hibiki\'s songs, but I thought her celtic rock themes were a lot better executed this season than the last. Cris had some bangers all on her own, and Kirika and Shirabe\'s duet was very sweet and touching. Maria has consistently had such strong songs, as well. In reality, the only disappointing thing I\'ve found in the music this season was the reuse of last seasons\' X-Drive song durng this seasons\' X-Drive moment. It felt like they should\'ve had a whole new song, but maybe that was just a choice by the directors. I couldn\'t say, I\'m just thankful that a lot of the music is improved.Over all, GX was a bit of a let-down season for me. I don\'t feel it was nearly as contrived as G\'s plot, but I can recognise where it flopped a lot harder than the other. G had a very strong ending, and very confusing beginning and middle. Where as GX has an interesting beginning and middle, and a very weak ending. Direction wasn\'t fantastic, there was a lot of cliffhanger bait for the sake of being cliffhangers. Lots of cut-aways to other shots, or important bits weren\'t animated that really should\'ve been, but we were just shown a still image instead. It\'s little things like this that\'ll make or break an anime for me.

It\'s little things like this that\'ll make or break an anime for me. And GX sadly doesn\'t have it.', 'To many, Symphogear GX is the weakest link in the franchise, but I actually enjoyed it more than the aforementioned first season! Though the conclusion doesn\'t have the most depurative departure, like many of the other sequels do, there is still a lot of meat clinging to the bones of the plot! This third season establishes the budding relationship between Tsubasa and Maria, more of the circumstances behind Hibiki\'s broken family comes to light, and Chris starts to feel more comfortable as the older sister character, despite her trauma and malignant guilt from her sins of the past.⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis season...had a strong start, I thought the transmutative cityscape fight created a lot of intrigue for our new villains. I remember when Carol first made her stunning appearance, I loved the aspect of her using alchemy as her ability, and the fact that she looks like Marissa Kirisame (東方Project) is a plus, too! Since I have weak spot for gothic imagery, I also loved the idea of Carol controlling a band of sentient, ball-jointed doll demons! That kind of subplot is right out of the pages of a baroque, horror tale! But, their story doesn\'t really lead anywhere; Carol eventually finds closure through her fusion with Elfnein, but the conclusion feels abrupt and unearned.By unearned, I mean that Carol\'s only driving crux is her fixation on the murder of her father, who more or less got Salem Witch Trial\'ed! I can\'t recall anything that could ever vindicate the character of Carol after she murdered hundreds, if not thousands of people in a Tokyo megalopolis, while yodeling ""genocide""! Her redemption felt generic and her angst-riddled madness didn\'t seem to hold much weight, but I do suppose that this is the first MAIN villain that writers tried to completely redeem, instead of being an unforgivable psycho. Even with her innocence being kept within the vessel of Elfnein, it was difficult to fully empathize with a moody little girl, that had such destructive tendencies!I think the juxtaposition of Chris is hard, too, because Chris was sexually assaulted for years, while having to come to terms with the brutal deaths of both of her parents. By comparison, Carol\'s killing-spree feels weak. On the bright side, it was nice to see Maria, Kirika, and Shirabe finally get to live the life of normal girls! There\'s more ""ho yay"" with Kiraka and Shirabe, as well as a burgeoning bond between Tsubasa and Maria! Chris seems to shows a romantic interest in Hibiki, but Miku and Hibiki\'s bond is just as strong as ever. We even get insight into their childhood together, when Hibiki\'s tumultuous relationship with her deadbeat Dad is revealed.Hibiki\'s resolution to the disdain for her father isn\'t adequately solved, the most he does is try to be supportive for her, but he\'s still is a lazy, convenience store worker at the end of the season. He doesn\'t really make a big sacrifice or step towards change! And towards the end, it seems like he\'s trying to get back together with Hibiki\'s mother. But, like the conclusion with Carol, it just seems unearned. The pacing of GX is much slower than the second season, too, so it can be a bit boring at times.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Katsumi Ono (director), notable works:* Beast Saga* Girly Air Force ✅* Hataraki Man* Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle — Rhyme Anima* Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu* Master Mosquiton \'99* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! 5D\'s* Yū☆Gi☆Ō!

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!Yuka Iguchi as Miku Kohinata, notable roles:* Arisa Hoshigaoka, Arata naru Sekai: World\'s/Start/Load/End (""World\'s End"")* Maria Takayama, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (""Haganai: I don\'t have many friends"")* Mako Nakarai, Bokura no ✅* Honoka Sawada, Chibi☆Devi!* Yashiro Hoshimiya, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (""Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl"") ✅* Shima, Devidol!* Sherry and Chelia Blendy, Fairy Tail* Tamaki Irie, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Mako Reizei, Girls und Panzer ✅* Suwako Moriya, Hifū Katsudō Kiroku: The Sealed Esoteric History ✅* Myne, Honzuki no Gekokujō: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen (""Ascendance of a Bookworm"")* Naeka Fujiwara, Kamen no Maid Guy* Kaga, Tenryū, Tatsuta, Tone, and Chikuma — Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅* Shizume Seo, Kara no Kyōkai ✅* Natsuko Ishikura, Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Luea, Lady Jewelpet* Chinatsu Morikawa, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS* Rinna Fuwa, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation* Subaru Konoe, Mayo Chiki!* Tsukihi Araragi, Monogatari (series) ✅* Kaede Mizumo, Nyan Koi!* Mitsuba Sangū, Owari no Seraph* Crusch Karsten, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ✅* Maho Misawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Yū Sonda, Sakura Trick* Hibari, Senran Kagura ✅* Astarte, Strike the Blood* Norie Okazaki, Tamayura* Yuzuha Aigae, Tenshi no 3P! ✅* Mea Kurosaki, To LOVEる ✅* Librorum Prohibitorum Index, Toaru Majutsu no Index (""A Certain Magical Index"") ✅* Aiko Andō, True Tears* Mirei Shikishima, Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid* Aoi Yukimura, Yama no Susume ✅Commentary: Despite everyone\'s dislike for Index\'s voice in ""Toaru Majutsu no Index,"" I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi\'s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character!

In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in ""Rokka no Yūsha"" and Nanako Saeki in ""Aku no Hana"" are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria\'s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!Ai Kayano as Kirika Akatsuki, notable roles:* Akari Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Futaba Ōki, Amanchu! ✅* Mikono Suzushiro, Aquarion Evol* Anya Dostoyevskaya, Aria the Avvenire* Kaga and Atago, Azur Lane* Hana Mutō, Captain Earth* Kanade Ōe, Chihayafuru ✅* Ponoka, Choboraunyopomi Gekijō Ai Mai Mii ✅* Anna Clément, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Mikan Tsumiki, Danganronpa 3* Maihime Shirayuki, Dokyū Hentai HxEros* Mimi, Flip Flappers ✅* Megumi Sakura, Gakkōgurashi!

She\'s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She\'s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!Toshino Nanjō as Shirabe Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Sonia, Berserk ✅* Naoto Miura, Clockwork Planet* Koko Tsukishima, Da Capo* Gankyō Kūrubiyūtei, Joshiraku* Eri Ayase, Love Live! ✅* Matsuri Sengen, Mahō Shōjo Taisen* Robu, Neko no Robu* Panpaka, Panpaka Pants Movie: Bananan Ōkoku no Hihō* Nene Kurio, Penguin Musume♥Heart* Akiho Senomiya, Robotics;Notes* Lise Hohenstein, Schwarzesmarken ✅Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she\'s sweet, smart, and insightful!

Though the character of Carol isn\'t the most compelling ever, Ms. Minase did the best that she could with what she was given. I was really impressed that she was able to fluctuate between the ""loli"" persona and then transform into an evil mistress; great vocal chops!

I personally had a hard time identifying with the Elfnein character, though flawed, I thought Carol was more relatable; despite this, her voice still perfectly fits the character... even if said character may have single-handedly been the weakest link in the plot.

The doll-character that she played wasn\'t the most memorable, out of the quartet, but she still was able to have somewhat of a presence because of her talented actress. Great work!Michiyo Murase as Garie Tûmân, notable roles:* Mogutan, Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama* Sucy Manbavaran, Little Witch Academia ✅Commentary: I am still confounded that SUCY from LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA has the smallest discography out of all of the actresses, in the entire cast! Sufficed to say, Ms. Murase (in my opinion) made Garie the most enigmatic of the dolls; I really liked Micha, too, but Garie\'s charisma and fun with the character stole my heart! Magnificent seiyū!Masumi Tazawa as Phara Suyûf, notable roles:* Mizuha Ichikishima, Re:Stage! Dream Days♪* Kiriha Kurano, Rokujōma no Shinryakusha!?

Wonderful job!Shiori Izawa as Micha Jawkân, notable roles:* Saya Sasamiya, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk (""The Asterisk War"")* Heybot, Heybot!* Mega Drive, Sega Hard Girls (""SeHa Girls"")* Kanata Ubuyashiki, Kimetsu no Yaiba ✅* Noriko Kamomebata, Kuzu no Honkai (""Scum\'s Wish"")  ✅* Nanachi, Made in Abyss  ✅* Sandalphon, Nanatsu no Bitoku (""The Seven Heavenly Virtues"") ✅* Ginko Kuroi, Planet With ✅* Aoi Hioka, Pop in Q* Kafuru, Senran Kagura SHINOVI MASTER: Tokyo Yōma-hen* Verda Kleiman, Star Ocean: Anamnesis* Pina, Sword Art Online ✅* Tanpopo Kuraishi, Witch Craft WorksCommentary: Though her characterization of Micha Jawkân is less emotive and more carnal, Ms. Izawa is a rising talent in the industry. Her role as Nanachi (""Made in Abyss"") was so powerful, that I think she\'s probably the most popular character, out of the main trio! Her cute, nasally inflection is often deadpan, but also able to secrete small whimpers of tender-heartedness throughout her run-time. Very talented seiyū!Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX had a few good character exploration moments, but the plot\'s sail was sunk by the excess of slogging characters arcs... all of which really had no proper closure to each of them! Despite this, there are some really cool fight scenes at the very beginning and the very end, and I think there\'s a strip-mall fight with the dolls that was pretty neat, too; but, compared to some of the previous seasons\' harrowing villains and cliffhangers, GX definitely is less of a gut-wrenching dive and more milquetoast torpor. I give Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) a 5/10!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆ had a strong start, I thought the transmutative cityscape fight created a lot of intrigue for our new villains. I remember when Carol first made her stunning appearance, I loved the aspect of her using alchemy as her ability, and the fact that she looks like Marissa Kirisame (東方Project) is a plus, too! Since I have weak spot for gothic imagery, I also loved the idea of Carol controlling a band of sentient, ball-jointed doll demons! That kind of subplot is right out of the pages of a baroque, horror tale! But, their story doesn\'t really lead anywhere; Carol eventually finds closure through her fusion with Elfnein, but the conclusion feels abrupt and unearned.By unearned, I mean that Carol\'s only driving crux is her fixation on the murder of her father, who more or less got Salem Witch Trial\'ed! I can\'t recall anything that could ever vindicate the character of Carol after she murdered hundreds, if not thousands of people in a Tokyo megalopolis, while yodeling ""genocide""! Her redemption felt generic and her angst-riddled madness didn\'t seem to hold much weight, but I do suppose that this is the first MAIN villain that writers tried to completely redeem, instead of being an unforgivable psycho. Even with her innocence being kept within the vessel of Elfnein, it was difficult to fully empathize with a moody little girl, that had such destructive tendencies!I think the juxtaposition of Chris is hard, too, because Chris was sexually assaulted for years, while having to come to terms with the brutal deaths of both of her parents. By comparison, Carol\'s killing-spree feels weak. On the bright side, it was nice to see Maria, Kirika, and Shirabe finally get to live the life of normal girls! There\'s more ""ho yay"" with Kiraka and Shirabe, as well as a burgeoning bond between Tsubasa and Maria! Chris seems to shows a romantic interest in Hibiki, but Miku and Hibiki\'s bond is just as strong as ever. We even get insight into their childhood together, when Hibiki\'s tumultuous relationship with her deadbeat Dad is revealed.Hibiki\'s resolution to the disdain for her father isn\'t adequately solved, the most he does is try to be supportive for her, but he\'s still is a lazy, convenience store worker at the end of the season. He doesn\'t really make a big sacrifice or step towards change! And towards the end, it seems like he\'s trying to get back together with Hibiki\'s mother. But, like the conclusion with Carol, it just seems unearned. The pacing of GX is much slower than the second season, too, so it can be a bit boring at times.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Katsumi Ono (director), notable works:* Beast Saga* Girly Air Force ✅* Hataraki Man* Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle — Rhyme Anima* Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu* Master Mosquiton \'99* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! 5D\'s* Yū☆Gi☆Ō!

After the first season, I was unsure of whether I could get attached to any of the characters, but the later seasons are a Herculean fusion of some of the coolest action scenes in ""Dragon Ball Z"" with sweet, saccharine shōjo-ai! I play the mobile game for ""Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle,"" so now, I\'m super stoked to try out the anime adaptation!

PreCure (""Tsubomi Hanasaki"")! Ms. Mizuki conveys the anguished, yet distinguished nature of Tsubasa\'s character in a very charming and likable way! Over the span of the series, we deeply sympathize with her feelings of grief over her dead girlfriend, Kanade; as well as the struggle that she has, when pitted against the corrupt system that her wealthy family has implemented. Great character, great seiyū!Ayahi Takagaki as Chris Yukine, notable roles:* Kuro, Ao no Exorcist* Kotoha, Arata: The Legend* Suiren, Battle Spirits: Shōnen Toppa Bashin* Daina Kurogami, Beyblade Burst* Roana Dan, Blade & Soul* Nene, Canaan ✅* Takuto Tatsunagi, Cardfight!!

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!Yuka Iguchi as Miku Kohinata, notable roles:* Arisa Hoshigaoka, Arata naru Sekai: World\'s/Start/Load/End (""World\'s End"")* Maria Takayama, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (""Haganai: I don\'t have many friends"")* Mako Nakarai, Bokura no ✅* Honoka Sawada, Chibi☆Devi!* Yashiro Hoshimiya, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (""Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl"") ✅* Shima, Devidol!* Sherry and Chelia Blendy, Fairy Tail* Tamaki Irie, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Mako Reizei, Girls und Panzer ✅* Suwako Moriya, Hifū Katsudō Kiroku: The Sealed Esoteric History ✅* Myne, Honzuki no Gekokujō: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen (""Ascendance of a Bookworm"")* Naeka Fujiwara, Kamen no Maid Guy* Kaga, Tenryū, Tatsuta, Tone, and Chikuma — Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅* Shizume Seo, Kara no Kyōkai ✅* Natsuko Ishikura, Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Luea, Lady Jewelpet* Chinatsu Morikawa, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS* Rinna Fuwa, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation* Subaru Konoe, Mayo Chiki!* Tsukihi Araragi, Monogatari (series) ✅* Kaede Mizumo, Nyan Koi!* Mitsuba Sangū, Owari no Seraph* Crusch Karsten, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ✅* Maho Misawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Yū Sonda, Sakura Trick* Hibari, Senran Kagura ✅* Astarte, Strike the Blood* Norie Okazaki, Tamayura* Yuzuha Aigae, Tenshi no 3P! ✅* Mea Kurosaki, To LOVEる ✅* Librorum Prohibitorum Index, Toaru Majutsu no Index (""A Certain Magical Index"") ✅* Aiko Andō, True Tears* Mirei Shikishima, Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid* Aoi Yukimura, Yama no Susume ✅Commentary: Despite everyone\'s dislike for Index\'s voice in ""Toaru Majutsu no Index,"" I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi\'s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character! Superb seiyū!Yoko Hikasa as Maria Cadenzavna Eve, notable roles:* Hana Suguruno, 7 Seeds* Hibiki Tenshō, Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel* Nanako Saeki, Aku no Hana ✅* Tio Clarce, Arifureta Shokugyō de Sekai Saikyō (""Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\'s Strongest"")* Tomoe Udagawa, BanG Dream ✅* Farnese de Vandimion, Berserk ✅* Fighter, Bikini Warriors* Erica Blandelli, Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō ✅* Kiyono Amahara, Chu-Bra!!* Ayano Kōsaka, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Sakura Sakurakōji, Code:Breaker* Kyōko Kirigiri, Danganronpa ✅* Sakie Satō, Demi-chan wa Kataritai (""Interviews With Monster Girls"") ✅* Brioche d\'Arquien, Dog Days* Hina Tachibana, Domestic no Kanojo* Freya, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅* Ao Gennai, Frame Arms Girl* Kei Kugimiya, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Aya Akabane, Gokujo* Miu Osawa, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Kurumi, Hal* Emi Yusa, Hataraku Maō-sama!

In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in ""Rokka no Yūsha"" and Nanako Saeki in ""Aku no Hana"" are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria\'s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!Ai Kayano as Kirika Akatsuki, notable roles:* Akari Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Futaba Ōki, Amanchu! ✅* Mikono Suzushiro, Aquarion Evol* Anya Dostoyevskaya, Aria the Avvenire* Kaga and Atago, Azur Lane* Hana Mutō, Captain Earth* Kanade Ōe, Chihayafuru ✅* Ponoka, Choboraunyopomi Gekijō Ai Mai Mii ✅* Anna Clément, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Mikan Tsumiki, Danganronpa 3* Maihime Shirayuki, Dokyū Hentai HxEros* Mimi, Flip Flappers ✅* Megumi Sakura, Gakkōgurashi!

She\'s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She\'s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!Toshino Nanjō as Shirabe Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Sonia, Berserk ✅* Naoto Miura, Clockwork Planet* Koko Tsukishima, Da Capo* Gankyō Kūrubiyūtei, Joshiraku* Eri Ayase, Love Live! ✅* Matsuri Sengen, Mahō Shōjo Taisen* Robu, Neko no Robu* Panpaka, Panpaka Pants Movie: Bananan Ōkoku no Hihō* Nene Kurio, Penguin Musume♥Heart* Akiho Senomiya, Robotics;Notes* Lise Hohenstein, Schwarzesmarken ✅Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she\'s sweet, smart, and insightful!

Though the character of Carol isn\'t the most compelling ever, Ms. Minase did the best that she could with what she was given. I was really impressed that she was able to fluctuate between the ""loli"" persona and then transform into an evil mistress; great vocal chops!

I personally had a hard time identifying with the Elfnein character, though flawed, I thought Carol was more relatable; despite this, her voice still perfectly fits the character... even if said character may have single-handedly been the weakest link in the plot. Great seiyū!Shizuka Ishigami as Leiur Darâhim, notable roles:* Kinoa Ōgi, Bubuki Buranki* Prince Akatsuki, Chōjin Kōkōsei-tachi wa Isekai demo Yoyū de Ikinuku you desu!

The doll-character that she played wasn\'t the most memorable, out of the quartet, but she still was able to have somewhat of a presence because of her talented actress. Great work!Michiyo Murase as Garie Tûmân, notable roles:* Mogutan, Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama* Sucy Manbavaran, Little Witch Academia ✅Commentary: I am still confounded that SUCY from LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA has the smallest discography out of all of the actresses, in the entire cast! Sufficed to say, Ms. Murase (in my opinion) made Garie the most enigmatic of the dolls; I really liked Micha, too, but Garie\'s charisma and fun with the character stole my heart! Magnificent seiyū!Masumi Tazawa as Phara Suyûf, notable roles:* Mizuha Ichikishima, Re:Stage! Dream Days♪* Kiriha Kurano, Rokujōma no Shinryakusha!?

Wonderful job!Shiori Izawa as Micha Jawkân, notable roles:* Saya Sasamiya, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk (""The Asterisk War"")* Heybot, Heybot!* Mega Drive, Sega Hard Girls (""SeHa Girls"")* Kanata Ubuyashiki, Kimetsu no Yaiba ✅* Noriko Kamomebata, Kuzu no Honkai (""Scum\'s Wish"")  ✅* Nanachi, Made in Abyss  ✅* Sandalphon, Nanatsu no Bitoku (""The Seven Heavenly Virtues"") ✅* Ginko Kuroi, Planet With ✅* Aoi Hioka, Pop in Q* Kafuru, Senran Kagura SHINOVI MASTER: Tokyo Yōma-hen* Verda Kleiman, Star Ocean: Anamnesis* Pina, Sword Art Online ✅* Tanpopo Kuraishi, Witch Craft WorksCommentary: Though her characterization of Micha Jawkân is less emotive and more carnal, Ms. Izawa is a rising talent in the industry. Her role as Nanachi (""Made in Abyss"") was so powerful, that I think she\'s probably the most popular character, out of the main trio! Her cute, nasally inflection is often deadpan, but also able to secrete small whimpers of tender-heartedness throughout her run-time. Very talented seiyū!Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX had a few good character exploration moments, but the plot\'s sail was sunk by the excess of slogging characters arcs... all of which really had no proper closure to each of them! Despite this, there are some really cool fight scenes at the very beginning and the very end, and I think there\'s a strip-mall fight with the dolls that was pretty neat, too; but, compared to some of the previous seasons\' harrowing villains and cliffhangers, GX definitely is less of a gut-wrenching dive and more milquetoast torpor. I give Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) a 5/10!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆']"
Shokugeki no Souma: San no Sara - Kyokuseiryou no Erina,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36962/Shokugeki_no_Souma__San_no_Sara_-_Kyokuseiryou_no_Erina,"[""When the 6th week of current season hit, many series decided to take a week long hiatus and air some filler, recapturing the former 4-5 episodes. FranXX did the-making-of video with live interviews. What about Shokugeki no Souma? J.C. Staff gave us a fanservice special and used more money animating it than they have used to animate season 3.1 thus far. Some decisions are just better than others.The episode can be split in two. First half centers around Erina, and keeps creating comedic situations where she struggles to use devices which are self-explatory to common folks. These include stuff like washing machines and vacuum cleaners....The comedy is rather impressive. I found myself laughing at it most of the time. I also nearly died when Soma started pressing dem buttons. The second half is about girls going to bath house and slowly undressing themselves. There really isn't much food present but who could complain when Erina herself looks so tasty, le lenny face.The worst part is the fact that this is an OAD release. Meaning the native resolution is only 480p which really does not serve modern anime. If this was in HD, it would obviously be 2good2breal. I shouldn't have to explain what type of masterpiece this would be if it was uncencored, so I won't. As a whole this is pretty much the funniest special I can think of.

This OVA is broken up into two events:First Event: Erina had ran away from home with the aide of her assistant and cousin, and taken into care by all members of the Polar Star Dormitory. Upon, entering the Dormitory, she realizes how little she knows about using everyday appliances, in this case doing laundry and using the washing machine, and using the vacuum cleaner.Second Event: After, Shouji Satou and Daigo Aoki accidentally destroyed the Polar Star’s bathroom, everyone decides...to head to the public bathhouse. Then, Rindou Kobayashi comes in, and promises to not tell Erina’s father where she is, if Erina can defeat her in seeing who can stay longer in the ‘Famous Inferno Pool’.After Credits: Erina Nakiri, Megumi Tadokoro, and Hisako Arato are all shown in swimsuits for a mere 15 seconds, and it’s lovely. However, Gin Doujima shows them that the powers of muscles and manliness are even more sexy and awesome.How manly. How lovely indeed!Overall, if we ignore the same opening and ending song used in the first cour Shokugeki no Souma season 3, the same voice actors and actresses reprising their roles, and the same decent art and animations, then this OVA is basically a fanservice episode that lacks any cooking scenes, and focuses more on the comedy aspect (i.e. Erina acting clueless and less of a princess, random wild animals, a silly competition, etc) with a special narrator.In short, this OVA was fine, and contained lots of fanservice in the form of Erina acting different from usual, several bathhouse scenes, and images of the main girls in swimsuits. But, of course, Gin Doujima is best because of those lovely muscles. to head to the public bathhouse.

I love seeing rich ojou-sama types have to try and blend in with plebeian society and being inept as basic things like household chores and such. Erina was once depicted as the big bad of the show, despite only ranking 10th among the elite students. Now the last season did a lot to humanize her and this special is just a continuation of those themes. Her haughtiness is almost been completely done away with and supplanted with her more tsundere personality. I predict even more romantic tension with Souma going forward, and plenty more opportunity for her to humble...herself in her new lifestyle.8/10 herself in her new lifestyle.8/10', ""Erina at polar star dormitory is a one episode OVA that is chronologically after the 6th episode of the first part of the third season of Shokugeki no Souma. It has no signifiance for the main plot. In one scene it refers to the OVA the accompanied the second season but this is not significant and it won't affect the anime if you haven't watched that OVA.The story consists of two parts. In the first part Erina lives life at Polar Star dormitory and gets confused by basic tasks such as laundy and vaccuum cleaning which is pretty cute. The second part is a fanservice/ecchi...part where the group heads to the public baths and ends up meeting one of the elite 10 members.The characters are the members of the polar star dormitory + Alice, Ryo and Arato. The animation, voice acting and music are the same as in the third season.Overall this is an okay OVA and it can be fun to watch if you enjoy the main anime. There's no cooking battles here but it's pretty cute and the characters are entertaining. part where the group heads to the public baths and ends up meeting one of the elite 10 members.The characters are the members of the polar star dormitory + Alice, Ryo and Arato.

Saki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5671/Saki,"['I have to admit I went into my viewing of Saki with next to zero knowledge about the game of Mahjong, its terminology, or its rules.  Besides a short wiki article and just the visual similarities to some domino games I have played before, most of it still is quite vague and mysterious.  I was drawn to Saki by the cute character designs, a hint of yuri romance, and my own curiosity over the game of Mahjong.Despite my curiosity, the idea of a 25 episode anime revolving around a table game doesn’t sound all that exciting.  Most likely that is going to...be the reaction of quite a few people who just give Saki a casual glance.  However they would be wrong.  Saki manages to take something that doesn’t have any real action or makes for an interesting spectator sport and injects energy and excitement into it.  While it’s decidedly over the top and completely implausible, it nonetheless works brilliantly.The basic premise of the story revolves around Saki Miyanaga, a high school freshman who finds herself participating in the schools Mahjong club even though she hates the game.  Though she is a very skillful player, bad memories of playing with her family has left a bad taste for the game with her.  However she finds playing with people other than her family to be fun and her love of the game begins to be rekindled.  Soon Saki and her new friends set their sights on making the national Mahjong tournament, and it’s this goal which dominates the plot.As I mentioned, Saki does an excellent job of creating drama and action from something that isn’t in reality exciting.  Characters are animated making special ""finishing moves"" when completing important hands and also some have special powers to intimidate or confuse their opponents.  So don’t be expecting a lot of realism, both in terms of game play or the players themselves.  Besides the game action, there is a fair amount of character building and touches of yuri themed romance.  Saki overall is quite fun to watch and entertaining.However it’s not all positive.  While the actual plot revolving the Mahjong tournament is exciting and compelling the story does manage to derail itself quite a few times.  The most glaring being the open ending.  While it seems extremely likely that a second season is probable, I really wonder if it was even necessary.  There were too many filler and service episodes and way too much story time devoted to developing unimportant and often nauseatingly annoying characters.  I would have much more preferred the story spend its time developing the relationship between Saki and Nodoka.  While the yuri aspects of the story are quite obviously present they are also unsatisfying.  Beyond the wistful stares and blushing glances there is nothing of substance.My opinions of the characters are decidedly mixed.  Saki and Nodoka, as well as their friends in the Mahjong club are very enjoyable and interesting characters.  Particularly in the case of Yuuki who steals the show a bit, adding comedic moments and also just being a funny character.  Saki and Nodoka have a lot of chemistry together and make for a cute pair, though an unfulfilling couple.  We get some background on both of them but really considering how important they are to the story it really is quite small.  All of these subplots are left unresolved by the ending, so it will take a new season for them to be satisfactorily completed.What really drags Saki\'s story and characters down is an enormous amount of dead weight in the supporting cast.  There is absolutely no need to have this many ""named"" characters.  The middle portions of the series give way to much screen time to developing the rival schools and players characters.  This is not to say it shouldn’t have been done at all, but there was no need to have this done with basically everyone!  It doesn’t help that I was completely uninterested in the majority of them and downright hated a few others.  Annoying cat girl Kana?  Please go eat a bowl of cat food laced with arsenic.  Disappearing girl Momoko?  Please get run over by a speeding city bus.  There are a few memorable supporting characters but most are just various standard stereotypes we see in every other anime made.The voice cast turns in a solid performance.  Saki\'s enormous cast is brought out well by a bit of a dream team of seiyuu performers.  However despite their talent the very fact that there are so many of them means that there just wasn’t enough screen time for many of them to make much of an impact.  Additionally I found the music to be pretty plain and uninspired with a few exceptions.  Some of the songs were catchy and they were cute many of them sounded like the singer was off-key.  Others like the second OP theme I just didn’t like.Artistically, Saki is very good.  The character designs are typical of what you would expect in a Gonzo production. Saki reminds me of another series protagonist from this studio, Miyafugi from Strike Witches who is almost identical in both looks and personality.  Also typical of Gonzo, they enjoy mixing in a lot of CGI effects with mixed results.  The Mahjong automated tables looked pretty good but the ""Nodocci"" vs. Touka battle animation looked silly and out of place when compared to the rest of the series artwork.  The visuals did a good job though into bringing in excitement and action into the games.While I would classify my viewing experience of Saki to be very enjoyable, the overload of unnecessary characters and the lack of a proper ending or any substance in yuri relationships bring its score down.  Hopefully a sequel will be coming soon that will address all of the plot issues and relationships that were left unresolved.  I would say my own lack of knowledge of the game also hampered my enjoyment, though I did watch a sub version with notes that explained most of the terminology, it was still pretty confusing.  It’s still overall, a fun and light hearted comedy that I recommend. be the reaction of quite a few people who just give Saki a casual glance.  However they would be wrong.

Saki is basically an anime about moe girls playing mahjong... with super powers. The girls all have their own (incredibly far-fetched) abilities which affect the flow of the game, their luck or even their own physical capabilities directly. However the bottom line is that the exaggerated theme of the show makes it SO much fun to watch. The mahjong games (or moejong as I like to call it here) in this show leaves most sports/game anime in the dust as far as intensity and addictiveness goes. Of course if you've never played mahjong before then it might be a bit difficult to properly understand what's going on a lot of the time, but I know countless people who have loved the show to death even despite that fact.There isn't really much of a story beyond the fact that everyone's playing in various mahjong tournaments for their own reasons, but the sole focal point of Saki lies in the gameplay itself, and that's where it absolutely shines. This is one of my all-time favorite moe shows and definitely the most addictive one.  You can easily marathon the entire anime in one sitting if you have the time to spare. It's very hard to stop watching it once you've started.Oh, and as the cherry on top the entire show is also softcore Yuri... just to give it that little extra nosebleed-inducing flavor.

Does it sound ridiculous yet? Regardless of how you feel about what I just described, Saki somehow managed to take all the above points, mush them up together, and regurgitate one of the most fun and entertaining show I\'ve seen in a while.Story:+ Simple and straight through story+ Easy to swallow and get into+ The mahjong games are SO MUCH FUN to watch and the show has PLENTY of them-...It tries to create drama that just doesn\'t fit in sometimes- It can get really corny when it comes to character development- Game time gets interrupted right in the middle in favour of ""development"" time from time to time.Art+ Cute character designs+ Bright and very nice colour palette+ Special effects used on mahjong games are very cool to watch and greatly increase enjoyment- Animation quality can get poor at times (but not very often)Sound+ An all star cast of seiyuus makes the show very fun to listen to+ The background songs used for the mahjong games are upbeat and GREATLY increases the enjoyment of the matches- I wasn\'t a fan of the OP and ED songs but they are not badCharacters+ Large cast of characters and all with different personalities. You are bound to find someone you will like.+ Every character is likeable and they are all unique in skills (mahjong POWERLEVELS)+ When a series is able to match up  2 or more characters in a game and make you go ""OH SHI- THIS MATCH IS GOING TO BE EPIC"" every time you know the show has succeeded in creating their characters- If you are not into yuri moments, you might feel ackward watching this because girl on girl moments happen.....A LOT!- Although the show succeeds in giving most of their characters reasons to move forward and continue playing. Sometimes some of those reasons can get a little corny (but its not a big issue)Enjoyment:THIS SHOW WAS SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH, every time a game was going on the show suddently became so entertaining that the episode would end and you wouldnt feel like u had just watched 24 minutes of Saki. Even though the show could have some improvements I cannot complain about the work GONZO and Picture Magic has produced here.Overall: Saki is not a masterpiece, it does not have amazing production values, nor does it have a compelling story....however what it manages to produce is a level of entertainment that just leaves you wanting to have more. The ability of taking a generally quiet game like mahjong and turn it completely over the top and extreme and yet still keep it from becoming chaotic is 1 of the reasons why Saki is a show that everyone should give a try at one point, it will surely entertain you.

The art makes the show look like it might be a fluff piece, with very little actual mahjong. If anything, there was more mahjong than moe in this show. Sure, there is plenty of zettai ryouiki, blushing and other elements that make you wonder if the show was actually meant to be a...moe moe romantic comedy, but the show itself and the characters have interesting personalities. I really liked that they didn’t try and teach you the very basics, perhaps that will come later in the series.The art is solid, and as I said above, if there wasn’t so much time actually spent showing tiles moving around the board, you might think this was going to be a harem show. The backgrounds are colorful, with moderate detail. There are a lot of pastoral scenes, which, I suppose, imply that this show is set somewhere in the country. The character animation is very full, and there is some morphing into super deformed mode for comic relief. If anything, I was actually kind of impressed in how they handled the actual mahjong games themselves. They used very agressive cuts and dramatic poses to keep the action during the games moving. They cut out a lot of the middlegame posturing and jumped to the lichi, ron and tsumo for each hand. It really sped up the game, and focused on the scoring. Overall I found the pacing to be terrific, and very well balanced between action, plot development and character development.Iam sure that a lot of people are approaching this title with some skepticism…but if you are into mahjong…or even just curious about mahjong, I think this show will be worth a few episodes of attention at least. moe moe romantic comedy, but the show itself and the characters have interesting personalities.

However, after watching several episodes I realized they are nothing alike.  The only thing they have in common is the fact that they both revolve around games. The game in Saki is Mahjong.  I've tried to play Mahjong in the past but could never completely understand it and hoped this anime could help.  Unfortunately, it can't.Unlike Hikaru no Go, Saki focuses more on the characters than the game itself.  The episodes...will spend a single episode on character development rather than them playing Mahjong.   Plus, there seems to be a redundant trend of every girl liking some other girl.  In some cases this is alright, but in excess it hurts the show.  Basically, every episode has included a moment with two girls showing their affection for one another.....too muchThe writers are also trying to make it seem like personality has more to with winning than skill.  They even made a character that can disappear because she doesn't stand out in a crowd.  I know anime isn't about realism, but come on.  Also, the characters moods change frequently and I agree moods affect play, but not to the extent they show.  Characters can simply go from losing a match to winning because they remembered people want them to win.....at least think of something better!I wasn't gonna write a review, but after seeing a 10 and an 8 I couldn't help myself.

Now, Saki is about mahjong, which really... isn\'t a sport, but it\'s treated like one, and it\'s, as they say, serious business— every character lives and breathes mahjong.The premise is not what you would call exceptional in any case.  You have your protagonist who possesses remarkable talent, and through training and perservance, will become the best of the best.  Who learns lessons through trials and tribulations, deepening and strenghtening bonds with teammates as time goes along.  Your standard...stuff.So why should you watch Saki?I think there are various demographics who would like Saki.  Let\'s list them out first.1. Sports/tournament-style anime fans2. Moe moe kyun~  ♥3. Yuri fansIt\'s pretty obvious why sports/tournament-style anime fans will like this series, \'cause that\'s exactly what it is.  If you like seeing your protagonist face off with increasingly harder opponents, learning new things and gaining others\' respect slowly and surely, then this is definitely for you.  I think Saki reminds me a lot of Hikaru no Go and Prince of Tennis (but, as I\'ve mentioned, a lot lower with the testosterone level).As for moe, 99% of the cast consists of cute high school girls.  I\'m serious.  Let\'s see, the only guys who get more than two lines are the commentator (for the prefectural qualifiers), someone\'s grandpa, and the one guy that\'s the protagonist\'s childhood friend (who is largely absent in most episodes).  And if I told you that there was one guy surrounded by five girls, you\'d think ""harem!"" right away, right?  Wrong.  It\'s remarkable how little presence the guy has in this series.  Half the time you forget he actually exists.  But there are a couple of gratuitous fantasy scenes from him (i.e. well-endowed girls in bikinis), so you might like it if you like harem series, but you have to remember that the guy barely exists.Now, for yuri.  It\'s unbelievable how... yuriffic Saki is.  At first I thought it was my imagination, but it\'s laden with so much subtext that it\'ll send you reeling.  The girls keep blushing at each other (half the time the blushes don\'t even make much sense) and it\'s about as unsubtle as subtext can get.  (If you don\'t like yuri, I suppose it\'s still possible to see it as ""just"" friendship, but you gotta wonder sometimes...)I think the character designs are pretty cute (it\'s moe, after all), and a lot of the mahjong parts are CG, which looks really sleek.  (And who knew about automatic mahjong tables?  I sure didn\'t.)  Gonzo\'s animation quality is inconsistent though, so sometimes the characters look a little blobby, but overall I think it\'s fairly good.The cast for Saki is HUGE.  Nevertheless, the seiyuu cast is very solid, with quite a few big names.  The OP and ED are okay, but nothing exceptional.  And character development is next to none, which is pretty much what you\'d expect for a ""sports""/tournament-style series.  It\'s not trying to be deep or anything; it\'s just entertainment.People who dislike lots of confusing terminology (and who are not familiar with Japanese names for mahjong terms) probably should stay away.  They keep talking about terms and giving 5-second explanations that will leave you even more confused than before.  But if you can take it all in stride, I think Saki\'s a good guilty-pleasure that you can blaze through mindlessly. stuff.So why should you watch Saki?I think there are various demographics who would like Saki.

Nothing is ever explicitly stated, everything is implied, and the light yuri factor whimsically floats in that fun stage before relationships get...all dramatic and serious.Pleasant Surprise #3:The sheer number of characters with depth.  Even some opponents come fleshed out with backstories, allowing us to understand, care for, and maybe even side with the opposition for a match or two.Pleasant Surprise #4:I entered Saki not knowing jack about Mahjong.  I left Saki not knowing jack about Mahjong (except how one must exclaim a string of unrelated but awesome-sounding words as if spewing obscenities when revealing a good hand).  Yet it still somehow managed to hold my interest so dearly!Pleasant Surprise #5:Again, for such a seemingly low-budget title, the visuals are bright, lively, and all-around surprisingly well done.Pleasant Surprise #6:The insane addiction. I don't really get addicted to anime very easily, but from the time I started to the time I finished, I simply could not get this show out of my mind.  Mmmhh, one more episode...Pleasant Surprise #7:Yuuki.  I usually hate watching characters that follow this silly and hyperactive archetype, but she actually synced well with the characters here.  The only character I had a problem with was the only male in the main group, Kyoutarou, for being so uselessly flat and static.

You get to know the characters, come to love them, and feel like you are at the table playing with them. You get excited when they get stronger, are amazed by the opponents strenghth, and feel everything the protaganist does. Don't forget to add in a yuri comedy, a club, and a...bunch of girl fun.

I dont have a clue how to play Mahjong. I know nothing of the rules, and even after watching the anime, i still dont. When i first started this anime, I had no idea what i was getting into.

We have the main character, Miyanaga Saki, who grew up hating Mahjong. As the story progresses, she grows to love mahjong more...and more. Same old, same old. She has this ability to score a +/- 0 every game in Mahjong, which apparently, is even harder than winning. Her skill is crazy, to the point where people call her a national class monster. Haramura Nodoka, another main character, is the winner of last years National Individual tournament. These two students, along with their team, fight to enter the Nationals. As far as the story and character goes, nothing really stands out. What's amazing is the way the manga was adapted into an anime. Every single Mahjong match is epic. What makes this show so awesome is the competitive atmosphere it gives off. To top it off, the animations are out of this world. They're just crazy. Although you wont see any real crazy animations until later on in the anime. The competitiveness and the animations bring the anime to a new level. The sound is not bad. The first opening is pretty good and the second is ok.

Watching Saki felt like eating mapo tofu for 15 hours straight. It\'s so hot damnnnnn. I think I\'m still burning.Art : 10/10Eh its ok.

If it were the manga you were reading that might be a different idea, but the anime is pretty simple. Other than the mahjong element, it is a very moe anime :) You get to know a lot of characters and of course you'll have your favorites.

The fact...that the anime doesn\'t really explain the basics of mahjong makes me rate this plot lower than average though. People that don\'t have prior knowledge to mahjong are probably going to have no clue how this game works. In addition, although the anime is about mahjong it seems like they focus more on character relationships than they really do with the mahjong.Character - 4I don\'t actually see a character development inside this anime. It more like there\'s a strong opponent and they just end up beating them by using the same moves as they previously did.Art - 6Usually, i am really picky with art so i tend to rate it hard.

You won\'t understand a thing. Yes, you could try to learn from the explanations the subbers provide, but honestly, it\'s going to be hard, and you probably won\'t enjoy it.If you\'re familiar with a mahjong but don\'t know the Japanese variant, I\'d recommend skimming over the basics of the scoring system on Wikipedia. Specifically, you should learn how riichi and dora work, and how payouts are handled. Knowing some of the rare yaku and yakuman hands can also help since they\'ll crop up a lot in the series.Character-wise, there isn\'t really...anything special in Saki. There are quite a few characters (roughly five for each of the four main schools, plus several unaffiliated characters), most of whom are girls. The majority of these girls each have a special mahjong trait such as doing well in the east round, or winning with bad waits. Relationships between the girls can usually be boiled down to friends or rivals. There are quite a few scenes that hint at possible yuri relationships, but this never goes beyond massive blushing. Overall, the personalities of these characters are generally pretty flat.The story is also not particularly unique. It can basically be summed up as ""we want to win the national mahjong tournament"". Saki\'s reason for wanting to win is a little more fleshed out than that, but it too is nothing I haven\'t seen before. Well, since Saki could be considered a sports anime, I guess this is pretty much par for the course.To me, where Saki really shines is in the mahjong. Of particular note are the strategies employed by the players. If we accept that some players have ungodly luck (which is true in Saki), all sorts of interesting situations crop up. For instance, if your opponent can consistently make kan and currently has an open pon, why not try to win by chankan? The supernatural play used in Saki opens up a lot of possibilities like this, and most of them are pretty cleverly done. The effects used in the mahjong scenes are fairly well done, and do a lot to make the games more exciting and dramatic.In short, Saki is a show with mahjong and a light smattering of yuri, but not much else. I\'m a pretty big fan of mahjong, and the games were pretty well thought out, so I liked it.

She would only be able to play decent mahjong during the east wind. During the other periods she would just play like a toddler. In addition to the curse, she was also forbidden to have lesbian relationships with the others. CAN YUUKI ESCAPE HER FATE? FIND OUT NEXT...TIME ON SAKI. TIME ON SAKI.', 'I hear lots of people saying that many characters\' development are unnecessary, that the mahjong matches are boring, or unrealistic... Let me rant for a bit and I\'ll get to the actual review.In reality, the diversity of all the characters makes it all more realistic. I used to play in chess tournaments, and ended up knowing and befriending most of the people playing against me in the tournaments. It\'s very hard to know nothing about them except their name and their face, so I believe the addition of the opponents\' backgrounds is very realistic and necessary.Second of all, most of those reviews come from people...who have never played mahjong, but I have played many times and can assure you that some powers are possible given enough skill. You can calculate what tiles or how many tiles are let from the discards and chis, and my sister is a rinshan kaihou player herself (although she can\'t always win that way... She wins like that 1/5 of the time). There\'s lots of calculation of probability going on that is perfectly doable. There is only one power I find impossible and it is the ""disappearing girl"" which is more witchcraft than mahjong XD.Ok for the actual review:Saki mixes ecchi, yuri, story and action perfectly. I can feel comfortable watching it at school, which is a good sign about ecchi (compared to to love-ru...) and the yuri story is one of the best I have seen. The ratio is just right.The story is well balanced with the main storyline taking most of the space, and some background story from time to time. People also complain about filler episodes; for real??? I think anime without fillers are way too dense... They become anime like Death Note (all action and development, unable to stop).The characters are also well developped: Yuuki is funny, Saki has that amazing background story, Nodoka is calm, reserved, shy, Club Leader is energetic... No two character are the same, and all of them are fun to learn about.Music? I didn\'t take note of the music. Not because it\'s bad; because it highlights well the moments, but not outstandingly well, it\'s just average on every aspect.The art is also average, neither good nor bad.Overall: it\'s very enjoyable.

But when it comes down to simply enjoyment, I\'d say a pretty good anime.Story: 8Simple but coherent and well-structured (may be because I read the original manga in Japanese) it has a story and a goal that Kiyosumi Kou-kou aims at, and seemingly intense mahjong uplifts the atmosphere with players giving away some ulti-rare yakus. Sub-stories about relationship between the girls fits in quite well with...the story as a whole. Points are lost from showing too much about second season in the last episode, which hasn\'t come out in 2012 as well! [At least OVA is coming out and looking forward to that]Art: 8Modern graphics and Anime Designs seem flawless at least to my point of view. Bits of points dropped at bad background and some colour flaws. Not much to say here.Sound: 7Voice acting seems to fit well with the Characters [Kana Ueda, voice actor of Saki Miyanaga, is actual mahjong player] and sync themselves well with the character\'s emotion but some points dropped from BGM which sometimes didn\'t fit in my view.Character: 6Couldn\'t give a high score since I personally did not like any character in the Anime, except Hisa Takei. This is one of the parts you guys will have to judge on [I am not ""moe moe otaku"", so speak for yourself]Enjoyment: 10As a mahjong player, it was well, indirect satisfaction from the anime. Just looking at Saki\'s Rinshankaihou and Koromo Amae\'s Haiteilaoyue [believe this is the correct Romaji] and some Chan-Kan, rarest yakus of all Mahjong except Yakuman-Agari, so enjoyment wise, I was satisfied enoughOverall: 8To most of you who do not know what Mahjong is, this would be an Anime with some service-scenes and soft mahjong game with enjoyable plot. To few of who knows Japanese Mahjong, pure enjoyment and satisfaction, but some places you might feel discouraged to play more mahjong after seeing all those Rinshan-Agari the story as a whole.

Saki is kinda like that.  Though it may seem like a contrived coincidence, I actually do play Mahjong, using Cantonese rules though, with family for pocket money.  If not for that link, I probably would not have picked up what my friend described as ""Yu-gi-Oh with Mahjong"".Getting down to business, Saki\'s story is actually quite formulaic.  Not that I dock points for that.  Its all about the Mahjong tournaments.  The preparation, the climax and...the conclusion is logical.  It makes sense since its an anime about Mahjong and what better way to see it being played than in a tournament.  For me it was a foregone conclusion, but that is exactly why they made the journey tense, eventful and generally thrilling from how the game is taken so seriously.  Sadly however, outside the game there really isn\'t that much there for me.  There\'s comedy/fanservice here and there but nothing really spectacular or as moving as when playing Mahjong itself.  The attempts at drama are laughable and most of it can be easily skipped without doing much harm to the main plot or character motivation.  Then there\'s the ending.  It is screaming for a sequel and I cry foul play.  They could have tied it up right there and then with the end of the tournaments instead of hanging on for some cooldown filler just to reach that 24 episode mark.Most of the 25 episodes you will be treated to are of high standard.  That said, coming in to the final stretch, there are bad art shifts. So much that I can\'t believe were deliberate choices to have such jarringly low quality.  Otherwise though, there are good are shifts and probably would not stop the likes of Koromo from being even cuter than this other blond haired, weird eyed little lady with incredible power I know.  On a side note, Nodoka could be a real rich landlady with those huge tracts of arable land.  The animation is smooth and the 3D art doesn\'t stand out like a sore thumb.  Well okay, maybe I still think those tiles are made of some weird otherworldly material and looks so very unnatural, but that really is just a triviality.  Though if you pay enough attention to the scenes you may catch glimpses of reused animations, something I didn\'t really catch during the first run through.  On the second run, they started appearing but at that point I didn\'t care any more because it certainly didn\'t do anything except indicate that production is a bit cheap; mostly harmless.Now the sound, that is something of a treat.  The background music is exactly the reason all the action on screen is so great.  Nothing less would get you pumped when that miraculous draw from the dead wall happens.  Heck, most of the tunes would spice up any of the scenes regardless.  Even the music for the openings and endings are catchy and cheery pop tunes, going on about Mahjong I reckon.  As for the sound effects, I can\'t say they\'re anything special, though I am a bit partial to the clicks of the tiles.  Then we come to the voice talents. Its a great pool of names you may already know or have heard of which you should be able to judge for yourself.In an anime so steeped in Mahjong, you need characters to actually play it.  And play they do, with relish I might add.  Their character really comes out when they play and sometimes this is pretty literal.  Alter-egos, superpowers and godly/demonic luck aside, the characters are not much more than that.  Each of the players are given some sort of motivation from flashbacks when they are in a tight spot and give it their all but mostly, that\'s it.  There is a lot of staring, blushing and hugging.  Yes they\'re a lovable bunch and yes, the anime does like heavy-handed subtext.  Maybe the staring and hugging has something to do with telepathy but I doubt it was going to open up anything special.  Very few of the characters that speak do not get characterisation though, which is a pretty good thing, considering the varied cast (from phase-shifting butler to average salary man father to aloof big sister) is upwards of twenty, maybe thirty of them running around on screen.I was generally amused and entertained though.  The Mahjong is over the top, with enough comedy and fanservice to not have my mind dulled by certain other parts.  Even the small details like the fact that Hagiyoshi plays a mean game of Mahjong online.   I\'ll see if after watching this, I can improve my own game a bit :p the conclusion is logical.  It makes sense since its an anime about Mahjong and what better way to see it being played than in a tournament.  For me it was a foregone conclusion, but that is exactly why they made the journey tense, eventful and generally thrilling from how the game is taken so seriously.

The mahjong scenes, interestingly enough, turned out to be some of the most riveting variations on 'battle' scenes I've seen in awhile.  If lightning blasts and magical girls really popped put when people slapped down the tiles, I'm sure this game would be much more popular in the US.In its two cours Saki develops a huge cast of girls, both Saki's teammates and their...rival schools.  I kept waiting for Saki and Nodoka to make their obvious yuri love official, but other than some suggestive scenes of sleeping together there's never even a kiss.  There's a LOT of implied yuri in this series, but again, nothing beyond excessive blushing at one another and sparkles.  Well, and Saki ogling her girlfriend's huge boobs, but so does everyone else in the series.  There are virtually no male characters to speak of, and those that exist are mostly ignored since every one of the girls is a raging lesbian.  Mahjong makes little girls gay, I guess?The massive cast is as much a weakness as it is a strength, as you almost can't help but pity all these girls who have motivations for winning but are going to get steamrolled anyway by the monster that is Saki.  Seriously, as OP as Ichigo is in most of Bleach, Saki is in her own show.  There are some tense moments where the show almost convinces you she could lose, but a glance at the episode count and/or title will remind you of who the mistress is.My scores:Story 6/10 (largely revolves around two tournaments, a brief training arc, and yuri)Art 9/10 (who knew mahjong could be so badass?)Sound 8/10 (nice and dramatic soundtrack, stellar cast)Character 7/10 (some are a bit shallow but you could fall in love with almost any of them)Enjoyment 8/10 (I followed this when it originally came out, and it kept me riveted from episode to episode)Overall 7/10 rival schools.

And since Zenkoku-Hen is coming up in the following month I thought it was time for a short review.This is probably one of the most charming anime series I have EVER came across. The characters are fantastic, the OST is good and helps to build a very unprecedented amount of both suspense and action during the Mahjong games (A game myself, that I didn't know any of the rules of till I went into it). The animation looks pretty nice overall, with the characters, setting and the Mahjong games being well presented....Glossy MMM is a superb opening track for the 1st season. While the plot lacks some level of depth, it's very simple to follow and doesn't stop it from being up there with some of my favourite shows of all time. Glossy MMM is a superb opening track for the 1st season. While the plot lacks some level of depth, it's very simple to follow and doesn't stop it from being up there with some of my favourite shows of all time."", 'This anime is for the mahjong fans, by a mahjong fan....I am going to state upfront this anime is for mahjong fans and players. As basic understanding of mahjong rules and play is required to understand most of the plays in the game.Saki is an anime named after its main character, Miyanaga ""Saki"", a normal high school girl in a rural area of the Nagano Prefecture in Japan. Saki is a girl who detests playing mahjong, because she gets scolded at home whenever she either wins or loses, and has hence developed a style of always playing just to break even. Not winning or losing...a single point or dollar, regardless of opponent skill and number of games. For anyone who understands basic mahjong, they would realise to make this happen in reality, the player has to be extremely skilled in:1) reading her 3 opponents concealed hands/tiles2) be able to read and control the flow of the game3) have excellent arithmetric skills to calculate the point differential and the exact tiles, play needed to break even4) be able to predict which tiles are being drawn next5) and to have inhuman luck to execute the plays and draw the required tilesin summary, Saki is a mahjong genius!However, through a set of coincidences and making friends with her school\'s mahjong club members, she rediscovered the joy of winning in mahjong and decides to join them in aiming for the japanese national high school mahjong championshipThe story of ""Saki"" is very sports-shonen style. Main character has undiscovered talent in the particular sport/game, finds common minded friends in his school, and they aim to be national champions together. Even though the formula is so tried and used, it works based on the fact that any boy or girl who has joined a school club for competitions can relate to the struggle and difficulty in winning a school competition, as the odds are like usually 1/1000 and you only have limited tries based on how many years you are in studying in the school. All these kids, or in my case, once-a-kid, can fantasize about how lucky they would be to have some gifted talent in their genre, and can dream of the joy of winning.However a anime about a table game isn\'t particularly exciting, given the lack of action sequences. And how this anime pulls this off is through its amazing cast of characters. Saki has so many characters that its almost on the level of ""one-piece"", that the viewer would easily lose count of how many characters have appeared through the middle of the anime series.The amazing thing about the characters is that each and every character appears unique, in terms of looks and personality. Every character has a unique look to them, whether its their hair, shape of their eyes, body shape. And each character has a special personality attached to them as well. Whether they are playful, careless, strict or just outright funny, its amazing and so awfully realistic that each and every single character has this uniqueness to them.Another trick up its sleeve is in the special moves, and their respective animations, used by each key character. Key characters like the adorable, rabbit-like Amae Koromo has her ""deep sea scooping moon"" finishing move. Miyanaga Saki has her ""Rinshan blossoming flowers"" finisher. And the sexy, cute-moe Hanamura Nodoka has her digitial ""Nodochii"" mode transformation. These animations provide tension and excitement to the otherwise dull, intellectual plays in a table game like mahjong.Add to the fact that the show keeps introducing stronger, unique opponents to challenge Saki and her clubmates for the national championship at every tournament round, and you have a anime series that is good enough to hook you in and keep you watching eagerly for every next episode.Of course this show isn\'t completely without weakness, but in my opinion the weakness is due the simple fact that mahjong by itself isn\'t an exciting spectator sport in the first place, especially so if the viewer doesn\'t understand the general rules of mahjong.In summary I feel Saki is a great anime to follow and entertains its viewers. The highlight of the show is definitely in its huge, varied, unique cast of characters (almost all cute, teenage girls). This is a show that any anime-viewing mahjong player cannot miss. I eagerly await its second season, but fans of the anime should continue to check out the side story series ""Saki: Achiga-hen: Episode of Side A"" to see the story that is being developed in the other national tournament rounds, which are omitted in the ""Saki"" main story. a single point or dollar, regardless of opponent skill and number of games.

Basically this anime tells a story about a girl who at first hated mahjong, but decides to play it again because of specific reasons. I enjoyed it a lot because the main character is an absolute monster at mahjong, and can make seemingly impossible things happen. I also loved how the character's relationship improve because of mahjong. It shows how if a person has one thing in common with someone else they can build...a strong relationship, and people don't have to be similar to be friends. a strong relationship, and people don't have to be similar to be friends."", ""I really like gambling anime and among those were some really great mahjong anime like Legendary Gambler Tetsuya and Akagi, which I watched and thoroughly enjoyed without knowing the rules to Mahjong. I decided to learn richi mahjong as a result and now that I have become reasonably cocmpetant I wanted a new anime to watch and see if I appreciate it more now that I know the game.I really didn’t know anything about Saki other than it being a Mahjong anime I knew nothing about it. Its actually not really a gambling anime, whilst mahjong is a gambling game, its not played for money...just friendly points, and it comes off more as a sports manga with highschool girls trying to get to nationals with their respective clubs.The plot synopsis isn’t really much more than that, its about a girl named Saki, who doesn’t like mahjong much, she gets pulled into by her friend Kyou into joining the Mahjong club, after discovering she enjoys playing Mahjong to win her and her club aim to compete in the nationals, which unlike regular mahjong is played a team where you take in turns swapping between members after one has played both an east and a south.Saki isn’t as enjoyable to me as a regular gambling anime what I like is the high stakes thrill the psychological warfare and tension, Saki has this a bit, but it doesn’t have this much. A few characters namely like the president focus on reading people and gauging their weaknesses in order to out play them which I really love, but mainly this anime is about absurd powers, rather than outplaying each other for the most part.Think Kuroko’s no basket, and how you like have emperors eye, invisibility, copycat, but I would say this anime seems even less grounded than that one. Abilities to see the future, being possessed by Gods, and just straight up drawing the tile you want are all abilities you can see in this anime.And that’s my problem its fun in how absurd it is and it can be pretty cool, but to me it’s a bit too ridiculous, that and I dislike the main character’s ability.Saki the main characters, isn't bad per se, but she is quite bland and passivein terms of personality. What's more she comes across as the superman of mahjong despite not playing since she was a kid. She has absurd luck and game sense and the ability to draw any tile she needs when she gets kan. Whenever she  is loosing its because of her own mentality, whether she doesn’t want to win, lacks confidence, or is scared by the other characters, its more her own mental blocks which stops her. Her ability is so op when she is in the right frame of mind nobody can really stop her.The other main character is probably Nodoka who gets sexualised a lot through this anime as the big breasted champion of middle school, she plays a more logical style of mahjong based on probability, which is nice, however she mostly zones out when playing so I don’t get see her thought process as much as I liked.The coolest club member to me would probably be the club president, she is the cool schemer always watching over her group, and her style of mahjong is about exploiting her opponent’s weaknesses, she was always the most fun to watch whenever it was her turn to playThe rest of the club members are there but I don’t think there is much to say they’re kind of flat to me,  I think the worst culprit of this is probably Kyou, he is like the one male character in this show who sucks at Mahjong to the extent they state he isn’t even worth training. Alls he does is run errands and think of sexual fantasies of the other characters, It would be better if they did something with him, as it stands he seem kind of pointless.Going outside the main club members I have to say there opponents get a decent amount of back story and development, that there were some cool characters who I ended up liking. But equally this show could bore me with the flashbacks within in the match with the characters I wasn’t interested in so its equal sums here.So what do I think of Saki? I think it is an enjoyably absurd show, which the knowledge of Mahjong doesn’t help too much as the absurd powers makes it feel pretty detached to me. Its fun but it isn’t great, known of the characters are well developed and the games do feel like they’re a competition of crazy powers rather than skill. But despite that there is a tension and enjoyment to the games in this anime, its just nothing compared to the other mahjong I have seen namely Akagi or Tetsuya.Overall I would give Saki and its sequel a 6.5/10 it could be fun, but was lacking in many ways.A warning if you do want to watch this that it doesn’t finish its final arc, and if you want to swap to the manga to finish it, it is going painfully slow and looks like it will take years to finish.If you want a better mahjong anime which is more tense and focused on skill I would recommend Akagi. Or if you want another absurd sports show there is always the aforementioned Kuroko which has its own crazy powers and is about a highschool team going to nationals as well. just friendly points, and it comes off more as a sports manga with highschool girls trying to get to nationals with their respective clubs.The plot synopsis isn’t really much more than that, its about a girl named Saki, who doesn’t like mahjong much, she gets pulled into by her friend Kyou into joining the Mahjong club, after discovering she enjoys playing Mahjong to win her and her club aim to compete in the nationals, which unlike regular mahjong is played a team where you take in turns swapping between members after one has played both an east and a south.Saki isn’t as enjoyable to me as a regular gambling anime what I like is the high stakes thrill the psychological warfare and tension, Saki has this a bit, but it doesn’t have this much.

It\'s about the other characters and other teams as well...But hey. I\'m here to KILL this animu and receive ""not helpful at all"" points for being honest.* The CRAP treatment of one Kyoutaro Suga* Rie Kugimiya\'s ""mini-b####"" return as one Yuuki...Kataoka* ""Magical Skirts"" and thereby the lack of ""panty shots""* The high amount of lesbianism* The LOW amount of ""straight parings"" (if you can call Kyoutaro and that loli-looking Yuuka an actual ""pair"")It ain\'t worth watching if you want something more or other than CGDCT. And I\'ll NEVER trust the animu industry to make a mahjong anime where men and women are on equal footing (without turning it into ""for the lulz"" / ""women always win"" comedy).I still remember that time when some important Japanese person stated how popular that anime [was]; it was all over ANN.

I love the animation, music, and sound effects that go with every winning play. I love how the game jumps from one character to another, all trying to take control of the game with their unique strengths and weaknesses. It\'s often ridiculous, but also intense, chaotic, and exciting. And speaking as a novice player, it feels true to the spirit of mahjong.I am indifferent to or outright hate everything else about this show.Beyond establishing the characters\' basic personalities and skills for the mahjong tournament, this anime does very little with them. There\'s maybe one scene for the MC\'s family situation...and one scene for her yuri-bait partner\'s family, and we\'re supposed to be led to believe that these are important parts of their characters. But then for the rest of the 25 episodes, we get to see almost nothing new about them. And then they are vaguely in love with each other, but all I can see are cardboard cutouts with boobs making blush faces--hence, ""yuri-bait.""The rest of the main cast is similarly criminally underdeveloped. One of the other club member\'s characterization ends up just being a pedophilic running gag that gets run into the Earth\'s core by the end and wasn\'t even funny to begin with. The club president has so many ways to be interesting with her connections and power in the school, but almost all of that is ignored in favor of repeating her one backstory in the mahjong club over and over. Effectively, the MC\'s school is just the mahjong club.It\'s clear that the anime just wants to focus on the mahjong games and only wants to establish what is necessary to make them work in the end, and if the anime really WAS just mahjong games, then I\'d be more or less willing to accept that. But there is SO MUCH time wasted on yuri-bait pandering and fanservice episodes that are completely devoid of any personality or substance.It doesn\'t help that, in the actual tournament, the anime sometimes struggles to keep every character at the table relevant without bogging down the pacing with constant flashbacks, sometimes to scenes that were IN THE SAME EPISODE. And while I do appreciate characterizing the different opponents the MC and her club have to face, it also means that there\'s even less time to focus on the actual main cast, which makes the yuri-bait sequences feel even more empty and unearned.Not to mention that it\'s just kind of creepy that at some point every loli girl wears very loose or scanty clothing, sometimes both. It happens too often to ignore.This can only be a 6 for me because the mahjong battles are just that good. As someone that enjoys sports and game fiction, mahjong games being 4-player free-for-all make them refreshing to watch. All of the major battles have multiple competing narratives, and it\'s not always clear which one will dominate in the end. A player may be preoccupied with beating one character only to be surprised by a completely different character that was enacting their plan the entire time. It never feels overwhelming either; having 4 players has just the right balance of complexity versus emotional resonance.The game being partially luck-based also works in the show\'s favor, because it gives the sense that anything is possible and any player can still come back from seemingly insurmountable odds. It\'s like the best parts of Yu-Gi-Oh or No Game No Life, but with the added complexity from having 4 players/teams.There are episodes in this anime that I would absolutely watch a second time. Every character has some special strength that gives them the edge, but any other character can disrupt them with their own special strength and take over the narrative. When someone finally breaks through a character\'s dominance of the game, the show\'s excellent presentation does everything in its power to make you feel that high, even if you don\'t play mahjong.Not every mahjong game is a huge hit; there are times when I think the characters\' powers get too ridiculous to the point where, even when another character starts to beat them, it\'s not really clear HOW the other character is winning or what they did differently. The pacing being sometimes interrupted by too many flashbacks is also a bummer. But even the worst mahjong battles in this anime aren\'t a slog to get through, and the highs are still just as high.In the end, I\'m torn, but overall I\'m glad I got to have watched this anime. It helped in my introduction to the game of mahjong and how it can be fun and interesting, but anything beyond that is just a mediocre shoujo ai fanservice schlock. I\'d recommend this to anyone who can at least somewhat tolerate/enjoy those distasteful parts, because getting to those mahjong fights was well worth it. and one scene for her yuri-bait partner\'s family, and we\'re supposed to be led to believe that these are important parts of their characters.

Shigofumi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3420/Shigofumi,"[""Upon reading the summary for this show, most would think it's just another episodic and unoriginal anime with silly stories and characters that have no depth. I, too, was one of those that wasn't expecting much of Shigofumi, but after taking my chances, I was thoroughly impressed.At first we're presented to separate stories that revolve around the delivery of Shigofumi, the letter from the dead. But the themes and characters involved are a lot more serious than you'd normally see in shows like Jigoku Shoujo and Shinigami no Ballad, shows that follow the same basic concept of Shigofumi. Bullying, child abuse, teenage suicide, the list...goes on. They're all recent issues that are so real to us, treated without sugar-coating. The characters are so human and their situations so easy to recognize that it's hard to be indifferent to them.And we're not served of only parallel stories. The main character actually holds a story of her own, some dark secret, and often we think we know something, but the unexpected pops up. A mixture of supernatural, reality, human characters and those that are just meant to be eccentric, mixed with a pretty good soundtrack and a beautiful art that J.C.Staff is known to deliver.Shigofumi is a definite enjoyment if you're looking for a quick but still meaningful series. The ride is good, and it definitely stands out among its &quot;episodic series that deal with death&quot; sisters. goes on.

Even though they are the main characters, the series tend to follow the person/people related to the person in account (person who wrote the shigofumi). The short series is full of episodic stories, with each being different from the last but they all deal with the same issue&hellip; &lsquo;death&rsquo;. Each story varies in the levels of disturbing content so if you thought it would be a walk in the park then you are sorely mistaken but there are also plenty of heartfelt stories...to supplement that.The characters of this anime series are great and that is because they are all well developed. Being able to develop specific characters, bit by bit, in such a small space of time and then move onto the next is an amazing feat. I also must say that the main characters (Fumika &amp; Kanaka) don&rsquo;t necessarily receive the same treatment, as they have plenty of time to be developed slowly.The animation quality both has it&rsquo;s good and minor bad points. The animation is noted for its amazing artistry with marvelously detailed environments, the deaths were nicely dramatized and everything, including the characters move fluidly. On the other hand the characters designs are somewhat lacking, yet I guess it&rsquo;s just me searching for some minor faults.The music was pretty eerie, especially the OP theme but it helps bring about tension and does a good job building up towards a climatic scene.Overall Shigofumi is a sublime short drama series that does an amazing job with tying in the supernatural theme of shigofumi with real life stories and issues. The great thing about this series is that there are episodes that are bound to touch people, due to how close to home it may feel (bullying, suicide, illnesses, etc). Yet it also can remove the uneasy feeling with a bit of light comedy, mostly from the talking staffs. This is a most watch if you want a serious but short drama, but I must say that the ending could have been better.^_^ to supplement that.The characters of this anime series are great and that is because they are all well developed.

No beating around the bush since all storyline will end with each episode in the early parts. Although at first, it may be bit confusing, especially Fumika's story but will eventually be revealed later on.Art: 8/10Not as appealing or dazzy such as Shakugan no Shana but J.C. Staff made good use of the artwork and styling. Some episodes however are...not consistent with the animation quality but only in fair details.Sound: 8/10BGM done in the series was good and very much appeal. ALI Project made use of their stylistic approach for the OP theme making it haunting and adds a mystery around the series. The ED theme also was done fairly but not compared how the OP was done.Character: 9/10Character styles was done nicely in good amounts such as Fumika, Chiaki and especially Fumika's father character of evil but pure intention. Character development leaves a fair amount to the series due to it being short thus focusing mainly on the main character (Fumika). Voice acting is good especially Fumika and Kanaka.Enjoyment: 9/10Considering &quot;death&quot; as one of the factors in the series, the average otaku might be intimidate at first due to some &quot;controversial&quot; topic such as child abuse, suicide, and school bullying. Nevertheless, this series aims to expose the dark side of humans and how people came to notice that death may be the answer.Overall: 9/10Although the sensitive topics the series is shedding light on might be a cause of disbelief and confusion, this anime did aim to teach us how fragile human feelings are. This is a highly recommended short anime series to watch if you are looking for psychological and rare slice-of-life-but-dark theme.

Happy watching! ^__^"", ""For a series  that is only 12 episodes long (at the time this was written I have heard nothing of any plans to make a second season) Shigofumi is an Anime with amazing depth and a very well written story. It is one of the best anime's I have seen in a long time, certainly one of the best anime series I have seen with less than 20 episodes.Story - 9As I said before the writing in Shigofumi is amazing in itself, even more amazing is the fact that it is presented gradually over the span of 12 episodes at a perfect pace....I have seen many short anime's try to rush the plot to make it fit but Shigofumi's story fits so well that it would be madness to have more than 12 episodes. The story itself is filled with multiple plot twists and it really pulls at the heart strings in many parts. One of the hardest points of any story is nailing a good ending in the resolution. Shigofumi does not get a perfect score since it does leave some of the more supernatural elements of the series and the late introduction of a few characters unexplained/undeveloped but in the end these elements only play a minor role in Shigofumi so they hardly take away from this Anime's memorable plot.Art - 8Nothing really special to mention about the art in Shigofumi. Its well above average and I have not complaints about it but I have seen a few anime's that manage to top it (Clannad for example). I wouldnt call Shigofumi eye candy but it is still far above the art found in most anime. Character design in particular is excellent, each of the reoccurring characters have a unique appearance so the viewer should never get them confused.Sound - 8As with the art, the sound in Shigofumi is far better than most but not the best by any means. Everything from the voice acting, to the music, and even the subtle sound effects are very nicely done though they simply do not stand out as much as the story or the...Character - 9In the span of only 12 episodes, Shigofumi not only managed to do an incredible amount of character development (without relying too heavily on flashbacks) for the main characters, but it also even managed to provide some background info on some of the minor characters. Even more so almost all the characters are likable (except for the few who are not meant to be) and you will find yourself sympathizing with more than one of them at at least one or two points in the series. Each character has a specific personality which they follow extremely well, in fact I dont think any of them ever &quot;broke character&quot; in the series. To give you an idea of how well done the character's are in this series, at the end of episode 12, while the credits are rolling, some of the more prominent reoccurring characters are shown. As each was shown I found that I instantly remembered each of them, not for what they did, but for who they were. I can say the same for only a handful of other animes.Enjoyment - 8If you want an action packed anime, Shigofumi is not what you are looking for. If you want an anime with lots of boobs, Shigofumi is not what you are looking for. If you want an anime that will make you laugh so hard that you need a friend on standbye to shock you back to life, Shigofumi is not what you are looking for.But if you want an anime with an absolutely amazing story, well developed characters, and all in the span of only 12 episodes, Shigofumi is certainly what you are looking for. Even if you are just looking for a good anime to watch, you could do alot worse than Shigofumi.Overall - 8Truth be told, I debated giving this anime a 9 (the same score I gave Clannad, Death Note, and both seasons of Code Geass) but I finally decided to settle for an 8 for the reason that Shigofumi does do a few things wrong IMO. First of all it never goes into much depth about the supernatural elements of the story, we are just given the bare basics of it which is really all we needed to know for the main plot, still it does leave a bit of curiosity on the part of the viewer. The other thing that Shigofumi does wrong is that it does introduce about 1 to 3 new characters in the last few episodes that are presented in a way that implies that they are important or that we should know who they are but then we are never told who they are or their character is never developed at all. The main example here is the woman/women who Chiaki talks to in episode 11. It is implied that she and Chiaki have some sort of friction between them and that she is related to the supernatural element (which as I said is underdeveloped) but other than that, nothing else is revealed about her.Despite these tiny mistakes, Shigofumi really is still an absolutely amazing story and I highly recommend it to nearly all anime fans. I have seen many short anime's try to rush the plot to make it fit but Shigofumi's story fits so well that it would be madness to have more than 12 episodes.

Everything from the voice acting, to the music, and even the subtle sound effects are very nicely done though they simply do not stand out as much as the story or the...Character - 9In the span of only 12 episodes, Shigofumi not only managed to do an incredible amount of character development (without relying too heavily on flashbacks) for the main characters, but it also even managed to provide some background info on some of the minor characters. Even more so almost all the characters are likable (except for the few who are not meant to be) and you will find yourself sympathizing with more than one of them at at least one or two points in the series. Each character has a specific personality which they follow extremely well, in fact I dont think any of them ever &quot;broke character&quot; in the series. To give you an idea of how well done the character's are in this series, at the end of episode 12, while the credits are rolling, some of the more prominent reoccurring characters are shown. As each was shown I found that I instantly remembered each of them, not for what they did, but for who they were. I can say the same for only a handful of other animes.Enjoyment - 8If you want an action packed anime, Shigofumi is not what you are looking for. If you want an anime with lots of boobs, Shigofumi is not what you are looking for. If you want an anime that will make you laugh so hard that you need a friend on standbye to shock you back to life, Shigofumi is not what you are looking for.But if you want an anime with an absolutely amazing story, well developed characters, and all in the span of only 12 episodes, Shigofumi is certainly what you are looking for. Even if you are just looking for a good anime to watch, you could do alot worse than Shigofumi.Overall - 8Truth be told, I debated giving this anime a 9 (the same score I gave Clannad, Death Note, and both seasons of Code Geass) but I finally decided to settle for an 8 for the reason that Shigofumi does do a few things wrong IMO. First of all it never goes into much depth about the supernatural elements of the story, we are just given the bare basics of it which is really all we needed to know for the main plot, still it does leave a bit of curiosity on the part of the viewer. The other thing that Shigofumi does wrong is that it does introduce about 1 to 3 new characters in the last few episodes that are presented in a way that implies that they are important or that we should know who they are but then we are never told who they are or their character is never developed at all. The main example here is the woman/women who Chiaki talks to in episode 11. It is implied that she and Chiaki have some sort of friction between them and that she is related to the supernatural element (which as I said is underdeveloped) but other than that, nothing else is revealed about her.Despite these tiny mistakes, Shigofumi really is still an absolutely amazing story and I highly recommend it to nearly all anime fans."", ""Shigofumi starts out with much potential as it deals with issues with sophistication while the brutal unpredictability which never ceases to convey a melancholy yet intriguing experience, however Shigofumi seems to go downhill from there as the short episodic stories thereafter lack the justification for behavior of the characters as the characters don't go beyond the superficial means (just evil and good) and the story writing becomes short of well-written plots because of the questionable disbeliefs by the audience. (ex : episode 6). The ending or major plot (episode 10-12) was quite mediocre but light-hearted nether the less. It could have been a brilliant masterpiece...for a short series as its own uniqueness could be portrayed well-above all the other animes, letting the audience connecting on an interpersonal level and pointing out humanity's flaws. However, it does warrant a score of 8 from me.The animation I must say, was above average and consistent throughout the series while the characters were distinctive enough for the audience to differentiate between them effortlessly.The sound quality and tracks that were chosen for this series matches the unfathomable episodic stories while adding a dramatic effect, I must say, it never bored me once, thought it varies from person to person.The major characters within Shigofumi are well comprehended without contradiction in persona or 180 degree spins, however some minor characters in certain episodes are represented as plainly as 'good' or your typical feeble-minded psychologically-disoriented villains or high school bullies that have a lack of characterization which might of detracted from the overall series.Overall, it was a brilliant series, though I would treat it into three separate series, the first arc(ep 1-3), the second arc(ep4-9) and the final arc(ep10-12). for a short series as its own uniqueness could be portrayed well-above all the other animes, letting the audience connecting on an interpersonal level and pointing out humanity's flaws.

It was also a short series therefore I completed it within 24 hours (barely) the opening couple of Shigofumi were really good, very nice. Kept me intrested until 3am in the morning and that is a task all on its...own. But when I came back to it the next day (very excited may I add) I was sadly dissapointed....I felt the episodes were hit and miss, some were actually quite powerful and moving, and as people have said already dealing with very touchy subjects, it was like a rollercoaster ride, on minute I would be hitting the 'next episode' quicker than a kangaroo on steroids, and then for the next couple of episodes it took me great strength to not just turn it off and drop it.I never felt very close to characters, I didn't feel sympathy, I dont feel they were developed well enough, the main characters I thought were pretty bland and unintresting in my personal opinion. Although the plot had potential, and I did get what was going on eventually, I just felt it could have been handled better (maybe with it being such a short series they just didn't have time to fully develop the characters well enough for my taste)I shall end with some positives for the show because despite it seeming like a loathe this anime, it probably wasn't as bad as what I am making it out to be. First of all I though both opening and ending songs were really nice and atmospheric and went well with the show. I especially like the ending which I have even downloaded. The picture and art in the show is very nice with fluid motion throughout. If anything the sound and art really brought the series up in my eyes, and I have said before some episodes were really gripping and very good, and at points I was actually gripped and thought that it was going to go somewhere.But overall I just think the story didn't really contain any 'wow' factor for me, I did not really care much for any of the characters (especially the annoying and tbh quite useless sidekick staff) and while some episodes were quite thrilling and gripping and I do appreciate and respect that they were touching on real life problems and tragedy's (abuse, teen suicide, bullying etc etc) I still found some of the episodes rather boring and hard to get through.

The final message left by one who's died. Letters from the departed. Strong feelings are required to be able to send a Shigofumi. Passionate love. Deep belief. And... hatred.The above paragraph comprised of lines from Episodes 1 and 2 of this show, Shigofumi was adapted from the light novel series of the same name by Ryo Amamiya by J.C. Staff, known for other anime franchises such as Raildex, Shakugan no Shana, and Toradora! With direction by Tatsuo Satou, character designs, original and anime, by Kouhaku Kuroboshi and Tetsuya Kawakami, respectively, the series revolves predominantly...around the existence of Shigofumi, the people they affect when delivered, and the mysteries of one particular mail carrier, Fumika. One of the usual hallmarks of contemporary J.C. Staff productions are that they are romances, or at least characterized by a major romantic aspect. While there aren't any inherent disparities of story quality between those that entertain strong, budding romances and those that don't, such a model limits what can be expected from this studio. Surprised was I, then, at how antithetically bleak and flat the color scheme is like throughout the show, almost like the show wants to have feel uneasy. The heavy use of fading sunlight, shadows, and symbolism compound that discomfort.Surprised was I, then, that this show felt something more like the content from Kino's Journey, complete with social commentary on disturbing issues of cruelty and callousness, philosophical inquiries on life and death, and an inorganic chatty companion. Even more to the point, the studio went so far as to subvert their informal trademark in the opening episode. In regards to the quality of this content's presentation, it is presented exceedingly well. This show does not hold back the reality of its subject material and its aftermath: exploitation, abuse, abandonment, conformity, parental irresponsibility, public ignorance, teen suicide, and severe bullying all have their place here. Hate and indifference is portrayed acutely, frankly, and poignantly without being unnecessarily violent. However, realism doesn't necessarily equate to pessimism or fatalism, and this series isn't all dark. Faith, hope, and love penetrates through just as much as hate and indifference permeates. It transcends the boundaries of life and even death, promising a better tomorrow, so long as the myriad characters debilitated by suffering allow themselves break the illusions that hold them back and embrace that possibility. On the topic of social commentary, also worth mentioning is Episode 4's applaudable inclusion of a respectable and supportive same sex relationship.These themes prevalent in the standalone material, the mini arcs, and the overall plot, quality wise, weren't executed equally. Encompassing the standalone material and mini arcs are the primarily episodic content of this series, the best narratively rendered portions of the show, the self-contained stories which, upon the simple introduction of Shigofumi, heightens their humanity. This supernatural factor was kept perpetually simple, and simple works with episodic content because episodic content in general reflects day to day life, and the events that occur within this frame aren't less meaningful because of a few seemingly random elements. The supernatural accentuates the experience of this content, rather than defines it. Anything more complex runs the risk of distracting and, consequently, detracting from the content. But as there is a transition from the episodic to the plot-centric, it becomes ever more important to explain the universe that facilitates the existence and mechanizations of Shigofumi, mail carriers, and Fumika herself, not only the major players. Without that, the developments that take place within plot-centric tales run the risk of coming off as contrived, and unfortunately, a fate which ultimately befell Casshern Sins, which also lacked a solid foundation for its universe, some developments, like our mysterious mail carrier's identity, came off as contrived. Doesn't mean the overall plot isn't interesting. It's interesting as hell. The experience could have been better had the staff done a better job building up to it. Or they could have kept themselves episodic entirely. Then there's the issue of moe. This show isn't mainly moe by any stretch of the imagination, and it's perfectly fine to have moe as an element if executed seamlessly, but it isn't. It sorely stands out, like all cheap gimmicks, adding arguably nothing significant to the narrative, characters being such more or less for the fan service of it all, and, compared to the show's rather morbid content, it is tonally inconsistent and potentially jarring.The OP “Kotodama,” or “The Power of Language,” was done by ALI PROJECT, and as far as ALI PROJECT's music goes, liking is a matter of acquired taste for their particular brand of synthetic goth, which is pretty much their motif for every song they compose nowadays. Between the dichotomy of lovers and haters, I sort of fall into a middle camp of liking some of their songs, ED1 of Code Geass R1, titled “Yuukyou Seishunka,” or “Chivalrous Youth Song,” but disliking their current musical approach, and Shigofumi kind of leans left of that spectrum. It's not a bad song, per say, because it certainly establishes a foreboding sense of mystery, but at the same time, it clashes with the slower and quieter moments of the show, which I contend are this series' highlights. The OP's visuals receive the same laud and, to a lesser extent, complaint. The ED “Chain” by Snow, on the other hand, both in terms of music and visuals, matches the simple beauty of these moments to a tee while reemphasizing its theme of light and hope in the midst of a dark and despair-ridden world.Despite the partially wasted exectued potential of its plot, this show is, nonetheless, a great series brimming with sincerity for its material, illustrating the basest and the greatest that people have to offer, through that final message, that final letter left by the departed. Letters full of hatred. Of deep belief. Of passionate love.

Staff Studio in 2008. How well does it hold up when compared to their other works? Let's find out.Story:Our heroine, Fumika, is a postman but not an ordinary one. She delivers Shigofumi, the final memento of the dead delivered to the world of the living, usually in the form of a letter. That's a good sign to start with. It is an intriguing idea and could make for a really good episodic title on the level of Petshop of Horrors. Unfortunately, the concept isn't taken full advantage of. A lot of the...episodes deal, at least in part, with Fumika and unraveling what happened to get her in the position she's in. By itself, that wouldn't be a huge problem. Sure, it would be an odd decision but a major underlying story could work if it was well told. What makes it a huge problem is that Fumika's story is boring, predictable and not very well handled. The ultimate payoff is a letdown too.I will say, to the series' credit, most of the time the episodes that focus more on the concept and have a lot less of Fumika's generic tale are really good. The one about the game designer, the bullying episode and the story of a tennis player who receives a shigofumi from her estranged mother are all really good. The first three episodes, before they really get into Fumika's story, are good too. Just not as strong as those three.Now, there is some really serious content about abuse, suicide, and sexual exploitation. Some of it is well handled, some of it, not so much. So you may want to consider that before deciding whether or not to watch it.Characters:You know how some episodic anime have a problem with under-developed one-shot characters but have really developed and complex reoccurring characters? Oddly enough, Shigofumi has the opposite problem. The reoccurring characters are exceedingly bland and underwritten. In contrast, a lot of the really good episodes that deal more with the concept follow the characters who are important to the story and really take the time to flesh them out, give them verisimilitude and they even develop with their own miniature story arcs. Which leaves me with the same question I had when I watched Shingeki no Kyojin, if the writer can clearly write characters then why are the main focus characters so cliched and drab? Oh, and expect the pop culture idea of dissociative identity disorder to pop up. Although Shigofumi, like Akuma no Riddle, has enough fantastical elements that it doesn't come across as out of place.Art:The artwork is okay. The character designs, backgrounds, and action are all pretty decent. They aren't anything grand or amazing but they do their job just fine.Sound:The cast is a bit more mixed. While there really aren't any people in the cast who can't act, there are a lot of stale characters. Which leads to some actors, like Asano Masumi, Ueda Kana, Terashima Takuma and Chiba Saeko to deliver really stagnant performances. In contrast you get some really strong performances from the actors voicing side characters who show up once or twice. Iwanaga Tetsuya, Hirakawa Daisuke Okano Kousuke, Kitamura Eri & Arai Satomi all do very well in the little screen time they get. The music is pretty good too.Ho-yay:There's a little bit. The episode about the tennis player happens to also feature her girlfriend in a prominent role. Their relationship is pretty cute too.Final Thoughts:Shigofumi has a really good concept and it shines as a series when it takes advantage of that concept. The problem is that far too much of the series is occupied with bland major characters and a generic, predictable plot line that only serves to weaken the series. In the end, it's still decent but it could have been so much stronger. The final rating is a 6/10. If the concept sounds compelling to you, you might want to give it a shot. I would personally suggest watching the first four episodes, episode 6 and episode 10 while skipping the other half of the series.

This is proof that it's never too late to make something both awe-inspiring and soul-crushing.Shigofumi's plot is something that flourishes in its' repetition. Fumika is a postal worker for the final messages of the once-living, bringing them to their destination no matter...what it may be. She is perhaps one of the most elusive characters I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and her interactions with humanity is essentially what this show is. People get in her way, people run away from her, people show their flaws to her. For however long she has assumed her role as a messenger, Fumika has a misanthropic mindset about humanity; there's no other species as flawed as humans are. She and her staff, Kanaka, both seem to believe this on a very deep level, and they both find people very interesting as result of it. As someone who thinks the same way, this makes their personality reflect on a deeper level.During each episode, we get to see the conflicts and flaws that people have in the eyes of Fumika and Kanaka. A few of these said people end up being recurring characters, and it builds an unexpectedly smaller, yet far more complex world around what seems to be a very open concept. There's a lot of both metaphorical and obvious interpretations of depression, spirituality, love, abuse, the consequence of death, and self-hatred, among the more prominent ideas brought up with each character that's introduced. None of the cast overstays their welcome and each of them have their own interesting quirks that make them what they are. Each arc kind of builds up in to focusing more closely on Fumika and Chiaki, the only other postal worker in this anime. It then ultimately makes Fumika go center stage and what results of it is one of the most expressive and vibrant episodes of despair and revelation I've ever watched in this medium.There's been a fair share of anime that are critical of humanity over the past decades, but none have the massive amount of backbone that Shigofumi has to show the world through the eyes of someone who is as disconnected from the living as Fumika is. This is one of the most essential works from this genre, and it may unfortunately go as underlooked as it is now for a very long time.Shigofumi is an insightful blessing.

The story centers around Fumika, a mail carrier from the afterlife who delivers letters of those who kicked the bucket to living, associated people of the ones who...left the world.Though Shigofumi doesn't really feel like it was treated with good care by the makers hence making the story a bit wacky halfway through. I truly enjoyed watching this show and it was probably one of the weirdest yet good experience I've had in a long while.If you're looking for a super drama show which is similar to Violet Evergarden then this is just for you. Though I wouldn't exactly say that you'd shed the same amount of tears or even the same type. Despite the similarities between the two, they are actually quite distinct and shines differently. left the world.Though Shigofumi doesn't really feel like it was treated with good care by the makers hence making the story a bit wacky halfway through.

It starts out pretty decent but then the main plot starts to develop and things get weird. The ending could have been better but it wasn't too horrible.Overall, if you've got the time, give it a watching. It's really hard to give a review on this one without putting in any spoilers but everything ties in together pretty nicely. I still wish the ending was better. "", 'Story. 8Whether it\'s based in Japanese folklore or the author\'s unique idea, this is the first time I see a treatment of a shinigami-style character delivering mail for dead people to the world of the living.  Whoever came up with it, it\'s a neat, compelling idea, and Shigofumi used it well.  Although slightly episodic, nevertheless most of the episodes were thought-provoking takes on various aspects of life and death, from a bullied student deciding to commit suicide to a grown man learning he\'s dying of cancer.  There was also a fairly strong central plot, involving Fumika, the ""dead"" girl delivering the mail,...and what happened to her while she was ""alive.""  I was slightly disappointed by her backstory, but still, I was more satisfied than usual by the end.  This wasn\'t one of those anime that waits until the last 2 episodes to finally address the main plot.  Everything was resolved with time to spare and the ending was fairly feel-good.Art. 7Decent art.  Nothing too special.  Very attractive character designs, especially the costumes for the Shigofumi.Sound. 6Okay soundtrack, pretty unremarkable but it went well with the story.  No tracks that I\'m dying to own though.Character. 8Good characters!  Fumika was strong and capable but still vulnerable, a very likable person who tried to remain objective but had deep feelings regarding her previous life.  The supporting characters were also good, especially the handsome, intelligent Kaname who recognized her early on and decided to get down to the bottom of the mystery.  I was disappointed by the villain; considering that he was the bad guy, his role was really limited, and he was sort of a lame madman you couldn\'t take seriously, but hey, I\'ve seen worse.  In particular, the characters you only saw for an episode were great.  The show had a lot of intense, heavy topics, like bullying, terminal illness, child abuse, etc. and it really made you feel each person\'s individual pain.Enjoyment. 9It doesn\'t happen too often that I find an anime I want to marathon.  I was able to watch this one pretty much in one sitting.  It didn\'t even have many cliffhangers, it was just extremely enjoyable and engaging.Overall. 8A wonderfully done show with a unique central idea that it executed pretty well.  I don\'t think it\'s a shining example of the best anime can be, but it was still well above average.  This is the sort of show I feel I can recommend to people who aren\'t even that into anime; it doesn\'t have any intolerable comic relief or women with huge breasts or any of the other stuff that makes the typical show off-limits for the uninitiated. and what happened to her while she was ""alive.""

Each new episode focuses on a new character and their personal struggles, slowly working toward an ending where the main character Fumika eventually becomes the focus. A lot of the characters cross paths with each other, making the series feel more connected despite its episodic nature.After watching a few episodes however, it became clear that Shigofumi was heavily inspired by other shows. Halfway through I felt that I was watching the cute little sister of such...shows as Hell Girl and Boogiepop Phantom, both of which I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed this. All three revolve around a mysterious girl that ties together an episodic story, all delving into the same themes of bullying, suicide, family-drama, and similar horror-drama scenarios.The presentation is the main point I’d like to bring up. The reason Shigofumi only ends up being the cute little sister of these other shows is because of its tone. The soundtrack is more mellow and peaceful, with a number of great tracks hidden inside. The art-design works well for scenes with grounded drama, yet it lacks the genuinely scary imagery that would fit the psychological horror in it. It simply doesn’t convey the same amount of emotion through its style, ultimately becoming more neutral in comparison.Neutral is the perfect way to describe how the show left me feeling, which also was part of its intent. To paraphrase the main character when she delivers her letters, it’s not about presenting things as good or bad, but simply about being honest. However, there are moments where these honest feelings do come across as clearly good and bad, which brings me to the portrayal of the characters. When looking at the core plot and the people in it, they tended to be very hit-and-miss. Some were enjoyable to follow from start to finish, others bored me to tears, and then there were the occasional WTF-moments where all subtlety was thrown out the window. Once again, the dispassionate tone made the enjoyable characters have less of an impact, the boring characters became more boring, and the crazy characters became less natural.

It aired in Japan on Chiba TV and other networks between January 6 and March 22, 2008 and contains twelve episodes. An original video animation episode was included with the final anime DVD volume released on September 26, 2008. A light novel series was originally adapted from the anime's premise set by Tomorou Yuzawa, featuring story composition and illustrations by Ryou Amamiya and Poko, respectively. Four novels were published by MediaWorks under...their Dengeki Bunko imprint between October 2006 and March 2008. Despite the novels being produced first, the anime is considered the original work, as stated by Yuzawa. The anime has been acquired by Bandai Visual for English language localization. The title Shigofumi comes from the combination of the Japanese words for ‘after death’ (shigo), and ‘letter’ (fumi), which literally translates to an ‘after death letter’.--Synopsis--Shigofumi are letters from the dead. Those who are dead and still have unfinished business can send an after death letter; yet, not any dead person is allowed to do so.These letters are delivered by the supernatural mail carriers, who once, just like their recipients, were humans. They now do not age and cannot be killed. Fumika, the main heroine of the series, is, perhaps, the most competent mail carrier, and sometimes it seems like nothing can disturb her work, even a troublesome recipient. However, unlike her colleagues, Fumika, for some reason, continues to age.Moreover, on one of the Fumika’s delivery missions, she meets a high school student, who knows her. It appears that in addition to the fact that Fumika is now an entity no human can comprehend, she has many mysteries behind her persona that are, little by little, discovered by Fumika and her closest friends.--Story-line--Shigofumi is an anime that every person will see differently. It does have quite a normal start that will probably make you think that it is just your usual slice of life. However, after some time, the most interesting part begins, and you realize that everything is not that easy as it might seem. The series shows you that it is not a moe SoL with female mail carriers, it shows you that Shigofumi is actually a very dramatic story that also has many mysterious elements. The story of Shigofumi touches upon many different topics, including: bullying, teen suicide, child abuse, mental illnesses, and different ugly parts of our society.Of course, the dark side of Shigofumi is not the best thing about it. Although, I have to say that the series is not trying to be dark all the time: sometimes it tries to show that there is still hope, proving that there are still good people. That being said, the story is so disturbing that some people might not appreciate it. On top of that, there are also some logical mistakes in it. By the way, it is also worth mentioning that the story does not just immediately give you all the answers you are looking for. In most cases, you will have to build your own theories to better understand what Shigofumi truly is.If it is not that big of a deal, Shigofumi is worth it. As it has been stated before, this series shows a very realistic picture that depicts how flawed our society is. Its story-line does look like a mix of Kino’s Journey and Hell Girl, but it still is something you will never see in other anime. Think for a second, if someone truly has a pure soul and some unfinished business, that person can write a letter to their relatives to ease their sufferings. This idea has never been touched upon in any other anime series before. This fact might help you appreciate the story-line.--Art--The animation for Shigofumi is fine. Character and background designs are pretty good, but nothing amazing. Definitely not the best animation I have seen, but it was okay.--Music/Voice acting--Not only the music, but also voice acting in Shigofumi are simply breathtaking. The OST was composed by Masumi Itou, who is also known as Nanase Hikaru. Masumi Itou is a Japanese singer and composer from Ibaraki prefecture in Japan. She has composed the soundtracks to many anime television shows and is part of the bands ‘Oranges & Lemons’ and ‘Heart of Air.’ Thanks to her, Shigofumi is sometimes really dark and disturbing. In addition to this, Ali Project and Snow also made amazing OP and ED themes for this anime.--Characters--There is only one character that matters, Fumika. Everybody else in this series is supporting cast, or only relevant in his/her episode. As it has been mentioned before, Fumika is a mail carrier that delivers shigofumi. All of the mail carriers are dead and no longer age. However, Fumika, for some reason, continues to age. This is all the viewer knows. As for the supporting cast, that is the main problem of this series. Although, it is not horrible, some supporting characters are just not as interesting as the others. Also, another thing, which might annoy you, is magic staffs. All mail carriers have mahou-shoujo-like magic staffs that are annoying as hell and are the only companions mail carriers have. To be perfectly honest with you, they should not have used these magic staffs in the series. But, well, I guess Japan is weird, so it is okay.--Enjoyment/criticism--Shigofumi is a very enjoyable show. The only two flaws this anime has are: insufficient character development and the fact that this anime should not have used these magic staffs. But, at the same time, these flaws are too trivial to criticize Shigofumi for. Shigofumi could have become a masterpiece with a better character development and without these magic staffs.--Overall--Shigofumi is definitely a show that needs more appreciation. While it is not flawless, it has many unique elements no anime has ever used before. It also features a lot of strong writing and shows the viewer the ugly part of our society, hinting that there are still good individuals, who are the only reason our society still exists.--Grade--Overall (sub): 8Story: 9Animation: 7Art: 8Music: 10Voice acting: 9Enjoyment: 9 their Dengeki Bunko imprint between October 2006 and March 2008.

It was just sad...Will explain shortly...Firstly, will start with the magnificent sounds. There are only OSTs and 1 Ending song. That ending show is top tier. Just brilliant! The OST are touching and fitting. But really big credit to that Ed. It just sooooo gooood!!Continuing with plot and story. The anime touches some really brutal, deep and harsh topics...and it does it perfect. Topics such as murder, childs abuse, bullying,suicide and other brutal philosophies.

But it didn't do anything captivating or any praiseworthy moments.Finally the characters. Remember my words the ones who live short lives are the best ones.

Shigofumi features a grim look into a number of touchy social issues faced by characters that Fumika delivers letters from the dead to and explores some tragic developments concerning Fumika's own past. This is a series that isn't afraid to explore the more harsher side of human society concerning the characters we encounter as subjects such as bullying, suicide, child abuse and pressures with conformity are delved into. The characters we are witness to are fleshed out enough where we have...enough sense of their suffering and what led them to the predicaments they face. For the most part, the morality that the series tackles is grey meaning there are reasons for what drives the developments faced by the characters. Even with its touchy matters, the series still has its heartwarming stories that Fumika becomes involved with such as delivering letters to a cat and straightening out personal matters involving a talented high school tennis player.The one defining element to this series which keeps it from totally being an episodic focus like Mushishi and Kino's Journey is the ongoing developments concerning Fumika. The series drops hints at first concerning Fumika's past and her unique existence as a mail carrier of Shigofumi. Yet as the series presses on, it does eventually explore the girl's past. Like many of the dark stories Shigofumi tackles, Fumika's past isn't a nice one and much of the show's second half is spent on her coming to terms with her own identity and dark past.The story development is not without its faults. It does portray some characters as being shallowly evil such as some bullies in one episode and the lack of exploration on many aspects of being a Shigofumi carrier makes the entire concept feel like a plot device just to explore its various character stories.Visually, the series looks solid for a 2008 title with vivid scenery and a good amount of visual detail given to characters and scenery designs. While I didn't notice any shortcomings with animation, there was nothing notable about it either. Aurally, the show's soundtrack consists of soft musical tracks that do well at complementing the various dramatic developments we see of the characters and the ED choice is a calm and gentle musical piece that does well at easing the mood from some of the depressing outcomes that Shigofumi often whips out with its characters.While having a few snags, Shigofumi made for a solid and sometimes emotionally powerful anime drama that wasn't afraid to tackle touchy social issues and delivered well-developed characters connected to the issues the series tackled. It also averts from the episodic storyline setup you would usually expect from similar titles of its vain by focusing on ongoing developments concerning Fumika's character.

Aurally, the show's soundtrack consists of soft musical tracks that do well at complementing the various dramatic developments we see of the characters and the ED choice is a calm and gentle musical piece that does well at easing the mood from some of the depressing outcomes that Shigofumi often whips out with its characters.While having a few snags, Shigofumi made for a solid and sometimes emotionally powerful anime drama that wasn't afraid to tackle touchy social issues and delivered well-developed characters connected to the issues the series tackled. It also averts from the episodic storyline setup you would usually expect from similar titles of its vain by focusing on ongoing developments concerning Fumika's character.

The contents of these letters, however, are not always uplifting.Story: 8I really enjoyed the originality of the story.

This cult classic combines the aspect of cute girls with the morose subject of the dead and their wishes. Much like Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya, there are talking staffs and magical girls with thigh-high stockings, but imagine if Miyu from Prisma☆Illya had a revolver as a weapon and transported messages from the dead to the living as a Shinigami. That’s Shigofumi in a nutshell.•\tShigofumi was more than what I was expecting; conceptually it’s a bombshell that’s teeming with cool ideas....Many people compared it to Hell Girl, but Ai Enma and her gang of ghouls didn’t seem particularly interesting to me, while Fumika and Chiaki had more of a human element to them. While sometimes very dark, this series carried a relatable tangibility to it that many episodic, grotesque, morality-centered series have a hard time encapsulating.•\tWhile the series, Vampire Princess Miyu, is one that I have droves of nostalgia for―the side characters felt more like props than people most of the time because they were lured into destruction after a demoniac entity tampers with their lives, discarded them, and the series left their legacy behind (rinse, recycle, repeat); the only characters you really watched the show for are Miyu and Larva. Shigofumi breaks the mold of not caring about nameless side characters and is able to make you care about those characters as human beings in the span of one to two episodes.•\tThe first arc with Asuna Ayase, a girl who seems like an ideal maniac pixie dream girl until her veneer of superficiality is peeled away, and a later arc with a character named Takehiko Hibiya, an unemployed video game developer, particularly got to me and made me tear up. The visual direction in majority of the episodes are inventive and visually stunning as well and I was shocked that a series with such a unique visual presentation didn’t cause more of a clamor among anime consumers in the US or Japan (unfortunately know that it wasn’t very well received because of the lack of figures made, moe or ecchi shows with memorable female designs usually, at the very least, have one or two; the one that was made of Fumika looks like a garage kit).•\tI would say that the weakest episode, in my opinion, is one that discusses bullying and karmic retribution. I disliked that one because it fell into the easy trap of something like Hell Girl and Vampire Princess Miyu, where it had a more detached look on the folly of humanity and humans foolishly hurting one another rather than the more empathetic and thoughtful take of Shigofumi’s sister episodes.•\tI would have rated Shigofumi higher if the reveal of Fumika’s alter ego didn’t make the last few episodes so confusing. I feel that the story could have easily been resolved in the episodes with her abusive father. This series is absolutely worth a venture, especially if you’re looking for an outside-of-the-box experience that is drowning in sublime melancholy and an uplifting narrative about love and compassion.

Together they hand deliver letters from deceased individuals to persons whom they've left behind. The specific contents of these letters vary from case to case but the themes can usually be summarized into stories of love, hatred, despair and regret between the departed and the recipient.The first half of Shigofumi is incredibly well executed. Most other series of this kind end up becoming saturated in melodrama to the point that they're completely unbelievable - boring even. However, the characters responses to receiving the last words of dead...loved ones and friends are very human. Each case is handled so poignantly that it's easy to sympathize with each character and their situations.Alongside the excellent writing is an equally exceptional soundtrack. It's a solemn tune that isn't overly moody but does a great job of creating a serious atmosphere and sets the tone for the entire show.The artwork is a bit of a letdown as it's rather generic in appearance and the animation is a little sloppy even in comparison to other shows released around the same time. I will say that Fumika and her father’s appearances were attractive but, I wish the same level of creativity was used in the design of the side characters- all of whom look rather dull.Unfortunately my problems with Shigofumi don't end with the art. The second half of the show isn't handled with the same smartness and drama as was with the first. All of the built up tension from the first 6 episodes is wasted on cheesy plot twists.

The fact that the other...Fumika will come into play we will have a very shocking, yet surprising truth about how the two Fumika are related is what made it very good.How this main plot has been include in the rest is something difficult to achieve when a series is defined by the secondary plots, but it has been implemented very well. The two element flow like it was destined to flow together without anything that seems forced. Even if I said it was a main plot, it hasn’t more time than the secondary plot in general. It’s just that it’s directly linked to Fumika.Now, for the entire secondary plot, these are the letters.We have letter that are addressed to a cat, to a kid from his depart mother,  letters of vengeance, in fact, two kind of vengeance, and some others...By the end of the show, I wasn't able to think of anything else the author can put into this story to complete more the subject, in fact, I think he was able maybe to do everything he could have done with it and if it's the case, that's why I have given the 9/10 for it. After all, I don't think we will find similar subject soon, and it was very interesting to watch.Art: 8/10Very good art and I can't say much more because it does a good job rendering the scenes, but not really more. Here we have some of the normal exaggeration of the animation in general. Like wind the hair, abnormal reflection of light. To compensate these little normalitys, the shadows of every form in the anime are greatly rendered.  In fact, the light reflection is greatly rendered on others things than the hair.Sound: 8/10A funny opening song, gothic comedy that I think fit the show. (In fact, it is rare to see this kind of music in anime, the only other I can think of for now is in the beginning of Shiki) Good voice acting too. The song is fitting because the show isn’t all serious all the time; it is sometime a bit funny, while the general subject tells about the last words of a living. While Fumika doesn’t have much intonation in his voice, it’s probably something linked to her abnormal status of her been a postman of the dead while not be like other that do the same job. I must applause the secondary character that has strong voice acting that help a lot to be drive in the emotion transmitted by them.Character: 8/10Fumika and Chiaki are the least interesting character in there. (But they actually act close to very good) The most interesting character will come from the sides stories and will be more than compensate for the two little bit less interesting central character. The anime has some cliché moment but the two main characters. That’s exactly why I think that this series worse characters are the main ones. For the secondary characters, we have ones of many kinds, that go to a lone boy that is been intimidate seriously by other students, to the girl that hasn’t take the departure of her mother. There’s also another that has been use by her father for money.Enjoyment: 9/10I sure have liked to see it. Maybe one day, when I will have more time, or will want to see anime that I already know about, I will see it again. Just think before starting it that you’re going to see a variety show.

"Kumo desu ga, Nani ka?",https://myanimelist.net/anime/37984/Kumo_desu_ga_Nani_ka,"['If you made it past that widely undeserved score that was given to this show because sadly, everyone has a right to an opinion, then let me try to convince you as to why this show is actually one of the best isekais that exist. I\'m writing this thing hoping at least one person decides to pick up the animeSo so so, so far the story isn\'t anywhere near its peak and I think it is rather obvious. For now we have the exhibition scene that is ""class gets transported into this other world"". So we\'ve passed the checkmark, this show is an isekai.This show...has 2 very different anime mixed to each other. On one end, you have the actual important stuff, where we follow the cutest spider in the world (don\'t watch it if you can\'t enjoy the cutesy character trope in anime, because this will put you off) trying to live and thrive in a massively difficult dungeon with many dangerous monsters while our spider is... a spider. This part is actually great, we see our character using to their full extent her build as a spider and her human intelligence to deal with odds she shouldn\'t realistically be able to face.The skill and evolution system is also the best I\'ve seen from any isekai so far, with several ways to obtain skills and a clear, while very fast growing curve that our spider has to face.Then, we have the human parts. As a manga reader, I didn\'t have to see those, and I can understand that one may find those boring. But they are still rather helpful in giving away information that you otherwise would have to guess. The human parts are rather bland but serve to compare how easy they have it compared to Kumoko who has to live her life on a very thin thread.Artwise, yeah it\'s CGI, and the first few episodes aren\'t pretty to watch, but episode 6 has actually been delivering something very good, and I can safely promise that it isn\'t Stockholm Syndrome speaking for me.So, in short, don\'t watch the anime if:-You don\'t like cute girls (what kind of monster are you)-You can\'t wrap your head around a rather complex skill tree-You can\'t handle a few episodes of bad CGI-You have terrible prejudice even before starting (seriously the score is already at least 1.5 points too low)-You don\'t like to have LN readers spoiling major plot points. Trust me, I\'ve been there, it\'s not gloriousAnd if you do want to watch the anime, I recommend picking up the Light Novel and even the manga if you just want to see Kumoko\'s grind and ignore the pesky humans.----Also, addressing the whole ""Slime rip-off"" thing, since it can possibly make or break the decision for some people, let me tell you that this is what Slime should have been and has the potential to be much more, granted that this studio doesn\'t ruin everything (so far it\'s been so-so, but at least it\'s not Crunchyroll). Now let me explain myself-I didn\'t praise nearly enough this glorious skill system, I\'m a huge fan of it and no other show will ever scratch that itch-An actual grind, no eating a dragon and becoming stupidly strong in the first episode. Trust my words, she\'s in this cave, and she will stay for a while-It\'s a survival of the fittest type of anime. No building random cities because you don\'t have a challenge, every step Kumoko makes, there is and there will always be someone above-The human parts, sure they may only seem to ruin the pacing of the show, but they bring valuable insight to the world and so far, both worlds can be compared in terms of depths, and we\'re 6 episodes into Kumo desu Ga while we\'re about 20 episodes in Slime-It may feel a bit more nitpicky but it\'s also nice to have things not always going the MC\'s way. I swear everyone in this show likes Rimuru after one hour of hanging out with the dude.And I guess that\'s it has 2 very different anime mixed to each other.

In today\'s modern world, there are limitless possibilities. One dream I\'m sure most people don\'t want to become a reality is being a spider. I mean, who actually wants to be a spider?Announced back in 2018, there were some concerns about the production schedule of the series. Promotional material surfaced online but they caused some controversy with the amount of CGI content. It also didn\'t help that studio Millepensee helms the production. It\'s a studio that have produced mediocre projects and seems to specialize in...CGI content. Don\'t believe me? Just check out their infamous Berserk project or Cop Craft. Watching this show at first glace gave me a feeling of uneasiness and it didn\'t take awhile until I realized what the show really had at its disposal.Now imagine being stuck in the body of a spider and then thrown into a danger with some of the most dangerous creatures you can imagine in a fantasy world. That\'s the raw fate of Kumoko, a former high school student who was hit with some misfortune. Kumoko must adapt, survive, and with her new circumstances, she\'s going to need all the help she can get. Do note that Kumoko isn\'t her real name but was given by universal fans. Thankfully, she lives up to her name because not only is she a spider, Kumoko also retains all her human personalities and knowledge. In essence, she\'s almost like an RPG character in a vast and mysterious world.But that\'s not all. Kumoko isn\'t the only character that reincarnated. In fact, a whole group of students got reincarnated and has their new roles set. These include Sophia, Katia, Filimos, Shun, among others. It seems when the author made these characters, they wanted to dress them into RPG skins. Let\'s face it, we got vampires, elves, princess, heroes, and just about any light novel trope you can imagine. Of course, it\'s not an original idea although Kumoko remains one of the more unique characters. In fact, why don\'t we talk about a bit Kumoko and know who she really is?Kumoko\'s character and personality is protrayed as a happy-go spider with a hopeful vision of survival. Yes, she feels terrified and overwhelmed at first but is also prone to make sarcasm at any chance she gets. It\'s to prevent her psyche from being harmed and honestly one of the more unique dynamics about her character. What I mean is that despite being a spider, she thinks like a human and even retains useful knowledge. Kumoko\'s main goal is to survive and escape the dungeon that she\'s trapped in. Think of her situation as a video game protagonist trying to beat a level or even the game. The world she is in is one huge game playground and that dungeon is only a part of it. Kumoko\'s progression also translates into a RPG-like system with skills, development, and learning to level up. It\'s funny to see just how far she make use of her system and it isn\'t an easy task to adapt. That\'s because the monsters in that dungeon are easily some of the most dangerous in the world. Like with its core characters, the author threw in dragons, giant arachnoids, wyrms, and the typical type of creatures you\'d find in a light novel. There\'s even a danger level scale that determines how deadly these monsters are. Kumoko\'s personal challenge is to survive against these monsters because she\'s only got herself to rely on. And trust me, it\'s no simple task. There\'s no reset button or an ""easy mode"" like in video games. She has to rely on the skills she learns and her human knowledge. Watching Kumoko overcome such obstacles shows that no matter how small she is, there\'s always a beacon of hope.Then, there\'s the other side. I\'m talking about the main core cast besides Kumoko. Unlike them, they took on more advantageous roles such as vampire Sophia or the warrior hero Shun. In particular, we follow the adventures of Shun and his former clasmates as they take on personal challenges of their own. And that doesn\'t come easy either. This is seen an in early example when they face off against Hugo, a character with dangerous abilities of his own. Every prominent human character in the series has his or her agenda. The bottom line is, when getting transported into a new world, characters needs to learn, adapt, and find their place. That\'s exactly what the cast has to do in this show to not just survive but ultimately discover their purpose. And true to its premise, this anime aims to entertain with the personalities of the cast. Every relevant character has a role whether they are human, spider, or demon. Among the most prominent character in the demon community is Ariel, perhaps being Kumoko\'s biggest obstacle. Indeed, Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka feels like playing a RPG alongside a spider and a group of daring adventurers.Although I\'ve mentioned about the art style of this anime, it\'s still hard to ignore the fact that it\'s animated in CGI style. Fighting scenes can look a bit clunky at times but qualifies for fast paced action that you should expect. Hilariously, your eyeballs will probably be glued to Kumoko as a spider trying to beat enemies multiple times her size. Watching the fighting scenes in this show convinced me that when she needs to, Kumoko will do anything to ensure her own survival. She has truly untapped potential and with each level up, Kumoko feels like a video game character bought to life.Set at 24 episodes, Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka is not a very easy anime to get into at first, even for a fantasy isekai. There\'s also the novel series that the anime didn\'t fully adapt. I mean, how many anime do you know about a main protagonist turned into a spider? Not many I assume. Fantasy isekai these days tends to jump the gun with its themes and indeed, this anime does love to flirt with its RPG-style ideas.

The only jarring scene you guys can really come up with is the cgi monster in the 2d human world And even if we do get elitists, I'm pretty sure the majority audience wouldn't even care about this minor personal inconvience.

Not even the fact she revives as a spider monster is something new or original at this point (but at least is more striking than a lame slime!). But what it lacks in originality, it makes up for in personality and self-awareness, while taking enough care of...important things that other animes of the genre don’t bother to even show. Let’s address it by parts.Our protagonist, simply and unofficially named Kumoko, was reborn as a spider monster, the weakest monster race, inside the most dangerous dungeon in this new world, while still remembering her previous life as an antisocial loner otaku (of course it should be that way). Sooner than later we are introduced to the main selling point this serie has: Kumoko struggling really hard to survive in this new world, trying not to get devoured in the process, while getting new skills, becoming stronger and learning about the world. All this is done in the most energic, charming and amusing way, thanks to Kumoko charisma and positivism. Now, this is not the only thing we’ll see, alongside Kumoko, her classmates and the teacher died and reincarnated as well, having enough luck to get way better lives.Don’t let this innocent and rather simple premise taunts you. Which may initially appear just a fantasy story about a spider monster striving inside a cave, turns out to be a way vaster and more convoluted plot as it appeared, borderline on pretentiousness. Outside of the dungeon we see there are factions, nations and politics issues, going for wars between races and churches ideologies clash, which get more fraught as the series moves on, to ancient god and demons scheming over the world origins. Not only that, the skill system by itself, initially just appearing as a hook for RPG fans like in many other isekai animes, ended up being an important part of the mystery of the world, and the reincarnation itself.Yet those topics are touched in a very basic way, the serie fills up this ambition with a solid narrative going hand in hand with the story. The narrative switches over two different POVs: the inside of the dungeon with Kumoko, and the outside world with a little group or reincarnates. Yes, this isekai does focus on story and worldbuilding, and while these two perspectives are rather different, they actually complement each other really well, sharing information actively, and explaining terminology that is going to be used in the next segment, without feeling forced. Subtlety is well-handled as well, mentioning topics or terms that are going to be important later on the serie in a very natural way (ex: talking about a skill that will be important to explain the MC motivations, or why the skill system by itself can be dangerous). Some people couldn’t notice at the beginning that both perspectives, Kumoko’s and the reincarnates’, are actually from different timelines, considering they were born in this world and the same time, but we see Kumoko from her birth, while we see the reincarnates when they are teenagers, and it’s only later on when the reincarnates’ side mentions Kumoko existence as a kind of legend, without directly telling it’s her; they don’t even cross paths until the very end of the serie. This kind of subtlety and naturality to show and explain important topics in a narrative this ambitious is pleasant to see nowadays.Story and narrative are very good by themselves to support all the serie, because the rest of it is… not so impressive. Characters, for example, are like day and night:>On the one hand, we have Kumoko. As previously stated, she’s pretty much the main selling point of the serie: if we search the definition of “charisma” in a dictionary, it would be her. Kumoko is charming, funny and very optimist, always doing her best to survive even with all the rough situations she goes through. Her role in the serie is pretty much acting like a guide to the viewer, constantly breaking the 4th wall and making comedy with a lot of references to popular culture, yet she’s witty enough to be aware about her situation without unnecessary edgyness; this serie touches dark themes in the least dark way, and Kumoko it’s the living proof. For a lot of people she alone carries all the serie over her thorax, but she’s not so perfect, she got little to no development along the serie (it’s not like she needed it) and remained pretty much the same even with all the harsh moments she went through, the things she learned and the power she got. Still the most solid character in the serie.>On the other hand, we have a little group of reincarnates who were Kumoko classmates (and the teacher). While Kumoko, as plain as she is, can still be described with a lot of adjectives, those guys can be described with just two words: boring and generic. Unlike our eight-legged MC, this group reincarnated as humans (most of them), living in prestigious families, so most of the outside world is showed by them:-First, we have Shun, we can say he’s the deuteragonist. There’re not enough words to explain how PAINFUL and INSUFFERABLE is to see this guy taking the lead. He’s pretty much your generic isekai protagonist, with all the cliches included in the pack: bland design, lack of personality, cringe hero complex (and yes, he was born in the Hero family, so he got blessed by the power of script) and harem pandering. He’s basically an Emiya Shirou, less pretentious but way naiver. And is this naivety by far the worst part, to the point every time he got the spotlight, the serie handled to make fun of it for being such a silly. He’s so misplaced to the point he got into a war he has noting to do just because “I can’t allow these people to suffer” (yep, even his sentences are prefabricated). Honestly, I can’t blame people for thinking human side is boring just because this dude.-Katia is Shun best friend in this and previous life, and your typical tsundere chick, with the plot twist that she was a boy before reincarnating. Actually there was a moment when this character faced her inner conflicts and decided to be honest with herself and becoming a full girl instead of a boy trapped into another body…moment that was never well-developed.-Hugo is your edgy vain and power-thirsty villain who thinks he’s better than anyone else.-Filimos is the students’ teacher who got reincarnated as an elf (excuses to introduce a loli character it seems). While started as a mysterious and a bit interesting character, later on it’s revealed her motivations, which are very dull, and she’s way naiver than Shun.-Generic crazy yandere girl is a generic crazy yandere girl who got brainwashed by the church.-Fei was actually the most decent character in this group. She, like Kumoko, reincarnated as a monster (a dragon), and she was a bully in her previous life, especially with her (she doesn’t know she’s alive living as a spider). She feels guilty, she feels this new life is a divine punishment for her actions, and she was always concerning about Kumoko and wanted to meet her to apologize. Sound like something that could drive to an interesting catharsis… except when she gets a human form and forgets about all of this.Initially, the serie got a 50/50 split between Kumoko and humans sides, but in the second part of the serie, when the politics themes and war calls became the main focus, human side got more spotlight. If it weren’t because, again, story and narrative by themselves are good enough, this would be really painful to watch because of this bunch of generic character. But at the same time, watching Kumoko getting stronger and destroying any trace of tension would be even more boring (and we don’t want such a thing to happen, right, Rimuru?), so the change of perspective was more a win than a miss. But actually… there is a third side here! Kumoko goes in her way, humans go in theirs, but there are a bunch of character that walk another path, this includes other three reincarnates (only two of them are worth it), some demons, and even Kumoko can be placed here under certain circumstances. What makes this group different from the other reincarnates, is that they were born under different circumstances, which push them to live under this new world rules, instead of being attached to their previous lives like Shun group. This group is by far more interesting that Shun groups, it’s a shame they weren’t fully showed in this season.Having this ambitious story and this charming MC would be worthy of a decent direction, right? Sadly this was not the case. I don’t really need to explain why this show has a very hideous animation, especially the CGI, everyone can see it, but the direction has to be the worst I’ve ever seen in many years. Not only it was disastrous in action-packed moments, where transitions and cuts were so random that was really hard to tell what was happening, and it seemed director forgot some frames in the middle, but also covering up all the scream with that hideous CGI instead of trying to hide it a little at least with dust or light rays. Even in slower or more serious moments it was a mess, like the catharsis of some characters like Katia and Filimos, they were so shallowed portrayed it’s hard to even care about what they said, even more to care about them at all. Luckily the music was decent enough to partially conceal this, and seiyuus work is really good, especially Aoi Yuuki as our favorite arachnid girl, big part of her charm was there. Yet there were a couple of good action moments with a decent -in this context- direction, like Kumoko vs Alaba.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka is how an isekai should be made, with an interesting and promising new approach to an already burned-out genre, focusing on a deep plot with a witty narrative but shallowly developed, and a great main character to carry the serie.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka is how an isekai should not be made, with really bad side-characters, going hand in hand with an appalling animation, and a very weak direction that doesn’t do justice to such an ambitious premise.Even with all its cons still is one of the most decent isekai animes out there, and I'd love to see another season, considering all the potential it has. important things that other animes of the genre don’t bother to even show. Let’s address it by parts.Our protagonist, simply and unofficially named Kumoko, was reborn as a spider monster, the weakest monster race, inside the most dangerous dungeon in this new world, while still remembering her previous life as an antisocial loner otaku (of course it should be that way). Sooner than later we are introduced to the main selling point this serie has: Kumoko struggling really hard to survive in this new world, trying not to get devoured in the process, while getting new skills, becoming stronger and learning about the world. All this is done in the most energic, charming and amusing way, thanks to Kumoko charisma and positivism. Now, this is not the only thing we’ll see, alongside Kumoko, her classmates and the teacher died and reincarnated as well, having enough luck to get way better lives.Don’t let this innocent and rather simple premise taunts you. Which may initially appear just a fantasy story about a spider monster striving inside a cave, turns out to be a way vaster and more convoluted plot as it appeared, borderline on pretentiousness. Outside of the dungeon we see there are factions, nations and politics issues, going for wars between races and churches ideologies clash, which get more fraught as the series moves on, to ancient god and demons scheming over the world origins. Not only that, the skill system by itself, initially just appearing as a hook for RPG fans like in many other isekai animes, ended up being an important part of the mystery of the world, and the reincarnation itself.Yet those topics are touched in a very basic way, the serie fills up this ambition with a solid narrative going hand in hand with the story. The narrative switches over two different POVs: the inside of the dungeon with Kumoko, and the outside world with a little group or reincarnates. Yes, this isekai does focus on story and worldbuilding, and while these two perspectives are rather different, they actually complement each other really well, sharing information actively, and explaining terminology that is going to be used in the next segment, without feeling forced. Subtlety is well-handled as well, mentioning topics or terms that are going to be important later on the serie in a very natural way (ex: talking about a skill that will be important to explain the MC motivations, or why the skill system by itself can be dangerous). Some people couldn’t notice at the beginning that both perspectives, Kumoko’s and the reincarnates’, are actually from different timelines, considering they were born in this world and the same time, but we see Kumoko from her birth, while we see the reincarnates when they are teenagers, and it’s only later on when the reincarnates’ side mentions Kumoko existence as a kind of legend, without directly telling it’s her; they don’t even cross paths until the very end of the serie. This kind of subtlety and naturality to show and explain important topics in a narrative this ambitious is pleasant to see nowadays.Story and narrative are very good by themselves to support all the serie, because the rest of it is… not so impressive. Characters, for example, are like day and night:>On the one hand, we have Kumoko. As previously stated, she’s pretty much the main selling point of the serie: if we search the definition of “charisma” in a dictionary, it would be her. Kumoko is charming, funny and very optimist, always doing her best to survive even with all the rough situations she goes through. Her role in the serie is pretty much acting like a guide to the viewer, constantly breaking the 4th wall and making comedy with a lot of references to popular culture, yet she’s witty enough to be aware about her situation without unnecessary edgyness; this serie touches dark themes in the least dark way, and Kumoko it’s the living proof. For a lot of people she alone carries all the serie over her thorax, but she’s not so perfect, she got little to no development along the serie (it’s not like she needed it) and remained pretty much the same even with all the harsh moments she went through, the things she learned and the power she got. Still the most solid character in the serie.>On the other hand, we have a little group of reincarnates who were Kumoko classmates (and the teacher). While Kumoko, as plain as she is, can still be described with a lot of adjectives, those guys can be described with just two words: boring and generic. Unlike our eight-legged MC, this group reincarnated as humans (most of them), living in prestigious families, so most of the outside world is showed by them:-First, we have Shun, we can say he’s the deuteragonist. There’re not enough words to explain how PAINFUL and INSUFFERABLE is to see this guy taking the lead. He’s pretty much your generic isekai protagonist, with all the cliches included in the pack: bland design, lack of personality, cringe hero complex (and yes, he was born in the Hero family, so he got blessed by the power of script) and harem pandering. He’s basically an Emiya Shirou, less pretentious but way naiver. And is this naivety by far the worst part, to the point every time he got the spotlight, the serie handled to make fun of it for being such a silly. He’s so misplaced to the point he got into a war he has noting to do just because “I can’t allow these people to suffer” (yep, even his sentences are prefabricated). Honestly, I can’t blame people for thinking human side is boring just because this dude.-Katia is Shun best friend in this and previous life, and your typical tsundere chick, with the plot twist that she was a boy before reincarnating. Actually there was a moment when this character faced her inner conflicts and decided to be honest with herself and becoming a full girl instead of a boy trapped into another body…moment that was never well-developed.-Hugo is your edgy vain and power-thirsty villain who thinks he’s better than anyone else.-Filimos is the students’ teacher who got reincarnated as an elf (excuses to introduce a loli character it seems). While started as a mysterious and a bit interesting character, later on it’s revealed her motivations, which are very dull, and she’s way naiver than Shun.-Generic crazy yandere girl is a generic crazy yandere girl who got brainwashed by the church.-Fei was actually the most decent character in this group. She, like Kumoko, reincarnated as a monster (a dragon), and she was a bully in her previous life, especially with her (she doesn’t know she’s alive living as a spider). She feels guilty, she feels this new life is a divine punishment for her actions, and she was always concerning about Kumoko and wanted to meet her to apologize. Sound like something that could drive to an interesting catharsis… except when she gets a human form and forgets about all of this.Initially, the serie got a 50/50 split between Kumoko and humans sides, but in the second part of the serie, when the politics themes and war calls became the main focus, human side got more spotlight. If it weren’t because, again, story and narrative by themselves are good enough, this would be really painful to watch because of this bunch of generic character. But at the same time, watching Kumoko getting stronger and destroying any trace of tension would be even more boring (and we don’t want such a thing to happen, right, Rimuru?), so the change of perspective was more a win than a miss. But actually… there is a third side here! Kumoko goes in her way, humans go in theirs, but there are a bunch of character that walk another path, this includes other three reincarnates (only two of them are worth it), some demons, and even Kumoko can be placed here under certain circumstances. What makes this group different from the other reincarnates, is that they were born under different circumstances, which push them to live under this new world rules, instead of being attached to their previous lives like Shun group. This group is by far more interesting that Shun groups, it’s a shame they weren’t fully showed in this season.Having this ambitious story and this charming MC would be worthy of a decent direction, right? Sadly this was not the case. I don’t really need to explain why this show has a very hideous animation, especially the CGI, everyone can see it, but the direction has to be the worst I’ve ever seen in many years. Not only it was disastrous in action-packed moments, where transitions and cuts were so random that was really hard to tell what was happening, and it seemed director forgot some frames in the middle, but also covering up all the scream with that hideous CGI instead of trying to hide it a little at least with dust or light rays. Even in slower or more serious moments it was a mess, like the catharsis of some characters like Katia and Filimos, they were so shallowed portrayed it’s hard to even care about what they said, even more to care about them at all. Luckily the music was decent enough to partially conceal this, and seiyuus work is really good, especially Aoi Yuuki as our favorite arachnid girl, big part of her charm was there. Yet there were a couple of good action moments with a decent -in this context- direction, like Kumoko vs Alaba.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka is how an isekai should be made, with an interesting and promising new approach to an already burned-out genre, focusing on a deep plot with a witty narrative but shallowly developed, and a great main character to carry the serie.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka is how an isekai should not be made, with really bad side-characters, going hand in hand with an appalling animation, and a very weak direction that doesn’t do justice to such an ambitious premise.Even with all its cons still is one of the most decent isekai animes out there, and I'd love to see another season, considering all the potential it has."", 'The story is the best, light-hearted--- but somewhat dark comedy.

Well let me explain to you how it is so far!Story and charactersThe story follows Kumoko, as she's reincarnated as a spider as the title suggests. But she's not the only one! It seems her entire class has also been isekai'd! As we follow two different sides of a tale. Where one in Kumoko, showing us how one survives, how one levels up, how one gains skills and perks. All sorts. In the most over the top and energetic way. But it's done in a good and entertaining way....The plot of the more human side of things however, seems so less interesting compared to what the spider is doing. The spider IS the show, she carries it so much. You're left wondering what she is doing, rather than caring for what the others are doing. They aren't bad, nor is their plot bad, but they do feel generic in some ways. Which can really bring down the show a little. But they aren't too bad, as it seems that they do in fact want to find Kumoko, which is more shown in Feirune, whom seems to regret who she was before, and really wants the entire class to be safe, which is sweet. While there others on the human side that do share that same sense of justice and respect. As they're learning about the world themselves, through attending a school like academy together, as they learn more about things, while living their new isekai lives. While Kumoko herself, as I said is the entertaining parts of the show. She's wild, energetic, fun, and I could watch her for ages, going through the motions.Art and soundSomething could be called into question when it comes to the art, but I'd say it's pretty decent style. It's calm in terms of it's brightness. But also the right shade when it comes to being in the caves. Certain monsters can look funny, much like how some in Arifureta were looking. While some monsters don't look bad at all, mainly Kumoko herself, she's got a great colour about her, and the areas she is in, are well done. Much like there are good colours on the characters themselves, and the backgrounds. While the sounds are real good, like the ED theme is a banger, you should go listen to it right now!Kumo for now seems a mix of two shows that are coming together, much like another show in Arifureta did beforehand. It's fun in parts, and entertaining in others, for sure, I'm gonna keep watching for the Spider alone. So give it a watch!

Well, not really, but so what?This is an anime that has been on my radar for some time now, mainly because it was originally slated for last year but got delayed due to production issues. Covid-19 must have not helped things there as well. But we did eventually get this year in the stacked winter 2021 and pretty much got overshadowed by Re:Zero season 2 part 2, Mushoku Tensei and Slime season 2. But I definitely thought to myself that I should not sleep on the spider isekai, especially as more episodes aired as time went on. And of course,...I’m writing this review to tell you that you should also not sleep on the spider (mainly because you’ll squash it) but because it’s definitely one of the more interesting narratives that I have watched recently, even if it is burdened of being an Isekai. Which honestly, wouldn’t have worked anywhere else.So get your drink, put your feet up, sit back, relax and don’t squash that spider next to you as I present to you the anime review for So I’m a Spider, So What? Let’s begin shall we?Story: 8.5/10A great catastrophe strikes a school and kills everyone hit by it. But fortunately for some, they get reincarnated to a fantasy world. Some even more fortunate than others. Like one of our main protagonist Shun who gets reincarnated as a son to the king and his brother (or one of his brothers) being designated the hero of the kingdom as well as reuniting with some of his former classmates and appreciates the life he have. But one was not so lucky. Kumoko was reincarnated as a weak spider at the bottom of a labyrinth with dangers from all over the place. Alone with no help, Kumoko must adapt and get stronger to survive the horrors in the labyrinth.The story does start off quite slow and in a rather typical Isekai fashion with our characters learning about their surroundings and the fact that there is a RPG like system that helps make people stronger and uses that system to get stronger themselves. It’s the standard Isekai affair to get viewers comfortable with something familiar but the problem with that is that it does make the first few episodes rather boring because it very much feels like we are going through the motion to get us introduced to the series and characters.Now, the real meat occurs around episode six and where things start to get interesting. I won’t spoil anything but let’s just say that the thing that kept me most interested in the story and the show in general was how Kumoko and Shun’s story were connected to one another. Throughout the show, we are given clues and leads as to how this connects to that and how this one action can affect the other story. It was essentially playing connect the dots to see how these two stories connected to one another. It did make me engage with the story a lot better than it did to begin with because I wanted to see all the little details that can have effect on the show overall. After an episode finished, I didn’t immediately move on to the next show I needed to watch, no I sat there thinking of what could this mean in the future. It got me thinking after the episode was finished and made me want to find out what happens next to see if I am right with my thinking. The show does a great job with how it leaves clues and hints to keep you theorizing and get you hooked to watch what happens next.What also helped with this was the show’s good world building. It’s not amazing but it was solid enough to help me understand the world better, especially as we get more episodes and more things are explained due to the situation going on in that episode. As well as the RPG like system that helps tell how strong an individual is. Although the walls of text you have to read when looking at the skills is just ridiculous. But the show does highlight the skills and titles that are important to the story so you won’t get swamped or confused when trying to read that wall of text.Characters: 7/10I want to start with the characters from Shun’s story because honestly, I didn’t care too much about them but still enough to be interested (So a sort of middle ground). I mainly was interested in them and their side of the story was to see how they were connected to Kumoko’s story and vice versa. They all have a role to play in the overall story and I will admit that they do a solid job when it comes to it. Some of them I do like more than others like Sensei who who definitely has some secrets to hide behind that lively personality. By the end, I was interested to see what would happen to them and if they make it through alive. Although I will admit, I don’t remember all of their names but their personality (as well as their designs) do help them distinguish one another.The star of the show though was obviously Kumoko (mainly helped by a great voice acting performance by Aoi Yuuki). Being alone and no restrictions with the harsh environment she’s in and well, being a spider, she does a great job at being entertaining and try to have a positive outlook on things. What I like about her character though is her growth but not by sheer luck or by just being born overpowered. Through strategy and thinking quickly on her feet, we see how she progressively gets stronger, both mentally and physically. While she does get really strong as we go through the show, she’s always having to go against characters and monsters that are clearly stronger than her or not being simple pushovers and having to adapt and stratergise makes her fights more enjoyable than the ones in Shun’s story because of them being well paced and fleshed out to be more engaging. In fact, more attention was put into Kumoko’s fights and Shun’s fights but I will get into that in the animation section.Animation: 5/10Okay this is going to open some unnecessary can of worms because I actually do think the CG looks good. Not top tier but good enough.  Monster designs look good and some of the human looking cgi models like Ariel look good as well. And then there are the fight scenes which look fun, fast and has plenty of action without it looking jarring at all; making for the best fights of the show. Kumoko looks great as well, skittering along like a spider and her expressions are quite funny. What I also like is that while Kumoko’s perspective, she is a cuddly little spider, but from everyone else’s perspective, she is a scary ass spider that has the ability to kill you just by looking at you. Though that being said, they kind of phoned it in at the end, especially during Shun’s story segments. It looked rough and did not have the same polish as before.That’s where I think the animation budget went to because the traditional animation just looks really sub-par with the exception of the character designs as they do look good and do transition alright into CG. Compared to the CG fights, the 2D fights don’t have near as much attention put into them and sometimes boils down to still images that seem to be poorly ordered as well as to how the fights transpire. Episode 14 is the peak of this. Anyone who’s watched that episode can agree with me that the main fight scene looks janky as all hell and was difficult to keep up what’s going on. It’s weird that that the CG animation looks better than the traditional animation.It was clear near the end of this show that there were some major production issues going down relating to this show. And while we did get confirmation about what happend, it didn’t change the fact that it caused the animation to suffer by the end.Sound: 6.5/10I didn’t really care much for this show’s soundtrack in all honestly. It’s not bad but it’s the usual standard fantasy orchestra you hear from other shows with little to make it stand out on its own. The only exception to this is any ost that relates to Ariel as it does help with her menacing and overpowered presence. It’s the only part of the ost that stood out to me because it does help set the tone of dread that Ariel has her sights set on you. In fact, all of the haunting tracks do a good job at being, well, haunting and setting the tone. So it ain’t all that forgettable.Really, the standout thing when it comes to the sound department were its OPs. Both, ""Keep weaving your spider way"" by Riko Azuna and ""Bursty Greedy Spider"" by Konomi Suzuki are both very similar as they both have great songs, great visuals and are chock full of spoilers. Considering both seemed to be tailored for this anime, they both nailed it out of the park for getting you pumped and ready to go to watch the episode.  So it really comes down to personal preference as which one is the best and I would give it to “Keep weaving your spider way” because I like the fast craziness the OP provides with a little bit of a dark undertone to capture what the show is like from Kumoko’s perspective.I would group both endings together because they are basically the same and something I would believe Kumoko would do given the opportunity and are appropriately sung by Aoi Yuuki herself. ""Ganbare! Kumoko-san\'s Theme” and ""Genjitsu Totsugeki Hierarchy,” are both fast paced and crazy EDs and relay to us how Kumoko feels about her situation while still acting like her usual self. I actually did like them because they do rub off Kumoko’s personality well and they are fun to listen to and watching them as well.ConclusionI really liked, “So I’m a Spider, So What?” The way the narrative is structured combined with its solid cast made it turn from a show I was ready to dismiss to a show that I want to see more of. It gave me incentives to keep watching and to find out how the two narratives connect to one another. It was the main hook that kept me going and wanted to find out what happens next and to see if I was right. As well as actually having good CG; which most modern anime out there can’t really say. Yet despite that, it still has some noticeable flaws. The narrative was slow to begin with and it started tapering off in its last few episodes, Shun’s cast of characters could be better but are thankfully not bad, the 2D animation was sub par and the ost could’ve been better. It’s a show that has plenty of flaws that prevent it from being a truly great show. But it didn’t truly affect my enjoyment of the show. Again, the interconnecting narrative was the core of what made this show so enjoyable and thinking about how this relates to that while waiting for the next episode made this show so engaging to watch.There is clearly more to be told and more that is going on so I really want to see what happens next. But given this show’s past production issues, we might not get it and if we did, it might not be for a long while yet. Which would be a shame because there are plenty of things to work with here that could lead to one of the best narratives for any Isekai anime. One that actually gets you to think about what it all means instead of it being strictly another bog standard power trip fantasy or light hearted comedy (Not to say they are all bad, but there are quite a lot of them). It is an imperfect show, I will give you that, but I found this show better than I thought it was going to be and something I would eagerly wait to see if we get any more of this show (Or you know, go read the light novel or manga but where’s the fun in not waiting with anticipation?)My Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall Score: 7.1/10 Recommendation: Watch it I’m writing this review to tell you that you should also not sleep on the spider (mainly because you’ll squash it) but because it’s definitely one of the more interesting narratives that I have watched recently, even if it is burdened of being an Isekai.

And while we did get confirmation about what happend, it didn’t change the fact that it caused the animation to suffer by the end.Sound: 6.5/10I didn’t really care much for this show’s soundtrack in all honestly. It’s not bad but it’s the usual standard fantasy orchestra you hear from other shows with little to make it stand out on its own. The only exception to this is any ost that relates to Ariel as it does help with her menacing and overpowered presence. It’s the only part of the ost that stood out to me because it does help set the tone of dread that Ariel has her sights set on you. In fact, all of the haunting tracks do a good job at being, well, haunting and setting the tone. So it ain’t all that forgettable.Really, the standout thing when it comes to the sound department were its OPs. Both, ""Keep weaving your spider way"" by Riko Azuna and ""Bursty Greedy Spider"" by Konomi Suzuki are both very similar as they both have great songs, great visuals and are chock full of spoilers. Considering both seemed to be tailored for this anime, they both nailed it out of the park for getting you pumped and ready to go to watch the episode.  So it really comes down to personal preference as which one is the best and I would give it to “Keep weaving your spider way” because I like the fast craziness the OP provides with a little bit of a dark undertone to capture what the show is like from Kumoko’s perspective.I would group both endings together because they are basically the same and something I would believe Kumoko would do given the opportunity and are appropriately sung by Aoi Yuuki herself. ""Ganbare! Kumoko-san\'s Theme” and ""Genjitsu Totsugeki Hierarchy,” are both fast paced and crazy EDs and relay to us how Kumoko feels about her situation while still acting like her usual self. I actually did like them because they do rub off Kumoko’s personality well and they are fun to listen to and watching them as well.ConclusionI really liked, “So I’m a Spider, So What?” The way the narrative is structured combined with its solid cast made it turn from a show I was ready to dismiss to a show that I want to see more of. It gave me incentives to keep watching and to find out how the two narratives connect to one another. It was the main hook that kept me going and wanted to find out what happens next and to see if I was right. As well as actually having good CG; which most modern anime out there can’t really say. Yet despite that, it still has some noticeable flaws. The narrative was slow to begin with and it started tapering off in its last few episodes, Shun’s cast of characters could be better but are thankfully not bad, the 2D animation was sub par and the ost could’ve been better. It’s a show that has plenty of flaws that prevent it from being a truly great show. But it didn’t truly affect my enjoyment of the show. Again, the interconnecting narrative was the core of what made this show so enjoyable and thinking about how this relates to that while waiting for the next episode made this show so engaging to watch.There is clearly more to be told and more that is going on so I really want to see what happens next. But given this show’s past production issues, we might not get it and if we did, it might not be for a long while yet. Which would be a shame because there are plenty of things to work with here that could lead to one of the best narratives for any Isekai anime. One that actually gets you to think about what it all means instead of it being strictly another bog standard power trip fantasy or light hearted comedy (Not to say they are all bad, but there are quite a lot of them). It is an imperfect show, I will give you that, but I found this show better than I thought it was going to be and something I would eagerly wait to see if we get any more of this show (Or you know, go read the light novel or manga but where’s the fun in not waiting with anticipation?)My Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall Score: 7.1/10 Recommendation: Watch it', ""I honestly don't know why I am watching at this point, it is pretty infuriating to watch.Like this show is bad, but I need more new shows to watch on Fridays this season so I stick with it for now. However, dropping this show is not a bad option.6 episodes in and I'm not seeing the goal. There's a difference between having the skill development happen like the slime reincarnation one (I know some people don't like the comparison, but come on... they are pretty similar. Atleast conceptually) but this just takes too long. The show is too slow, the classroom characters are pretty bland,...and since they are not even the main focus of the story their worth just goes down.The comedy isn't great, the action isn't either, the CGI is not something I really care about, but even I can tell it's laughably bad. Overall I really don't really get what this show is trying to achieve.All I can say is I'm not enjoying it a lot, it's boring. Although it seems to be picking up it does not seem great. In my honest opinion, whenever I try to sit through an episode without using the 5-second skip normally, I honestly might break my headphones. It is too slow for too little enjoyable content. and since they are not even the main focus of the story their worth just goes down.The comedy isn't great, the action isn't either, the CGI is not something I really care about, but even I can tell it's laughably bad.

I am a massive fan of spiders, being an arachnologist myself, and I've enjoyed cutesy stuff in the past like Welcome to Demon School, so should have been an easy sell. The problem is... everything. I found myself fighting the urge to sleep.The dialogue is generic, boring and uninteresting. The story is split between the spider and the other classmates who were reincarnated as humans. There was no introduction to these characters before reincarnation so what the point of this reincarnation is I don't know and yet the...characters constantly make references to their old relationships with each other that we haven't seen and so don't care about. By the fourth episode I chose to start skipping the scenes with the other characters because there's nothing of value there, just nonsensical character developments and cliches.The scenes with the spider can be genuinely fun as she is forced to fight strategically and there is a sophisticated skill tree levelling system. However the actual animations and creature designs let this down. The art style is trash.I do not understand the score of 7 at all. I've watched many anime in the past with much lower scores that I've enjoyed.

Midway. How is the spider isekai going?It started off with very slow pacing in the first few eps, but it's been picking up the story quite quickly in the last few eps. Though it may be slow to begin, but that's what makes it more believable. That's how the grind works. Perhaps a bit too slow for regular anime pacing, but there is still a lot of development going on with the world and Kumoko in the first few eps. The skill system is quite unique and extremely detailed - it's hard to follow at times but all easily understood in the end...(albeit with a bit of telling instead of showing).The human half of the story was quite uninteresting at the start, with many cookie-cutter characters. However, as the two story halves begin to converge, the anime is starting to make a lot more sense. Still not much has been developed for the humans though. There are times when context would be very helpful, but they just throw the story at you and only slowly explain later. It can be a bit jarring at times, but much of the context can be implied. Either way, I am expecting a lot for the second half of the show.CGI is a bit weak for the first few eps but manageable. The animation, particularly during fights, has improved significantly over the past few episodes.The main character is a huge redeeming quality of the show. Huge props to the VA, her emotional expression is fantastic, particularly pride and frustration. Main character development is quite fast; other characters, not so much. Not a lot of plot armor which is good - if there is, it is reasonable/justifiable.Overall, this is quite an enjoyable isekai. The leveling and grinding is something many can relate to. MC is portrayed excellently. Some work can be done on the human side, as well as the way the context and story is relayed in some parts. Nevertheless, a fun isekai story to follow along.

But this one is different.This is an opinion, I should add, but it has a really good story so far.There is a detail, which I won't spoil, that kinda lurks in the back and as you watch and watch you keep getting more and more suspicious, and at around the 6th episode, you realise what is going on, if it went the same way for you, as it did for me, than your mind gets blown, and even after that episode, where...it gets more clear, it is still not said outloud, and you have to piece it together.I think it's absolutely fantastic the way the story was done. I really hope it wasn't just me missing a dialogue, or something like that, because my mind was actually blown.I cannot fathom, how much I recommend this show just for that one twisty detail.That's enough of that, ama talk about one big thing, I saw others say or point out:Yes, it has CGI.But d onot run away. Tell me, when was the last time you saw good cgi in an anime? Never, I'll answer for you, so the argument, that the CGi looks bad, is invalid, because it can't look good it seems, and only if you could tell me an anime of this level which has beautiful cgi, then your argument could be valid.CGI is used to hasten the production, so I do not care, and even if I admit that it doesn't look good, it's not as bad as you think.For example, Arifureta, at what I am really angry, for getting so much attention despite how awful and vague the story was, had sooo bad CGI, that when Hajime was running from the monsters, he wasn't afraid of them, he was scared of the worst animation I've ever seen in anime to this day.So, yes, it has cgi elements, but the main character is very rarely that, and even if she is, you can't really see it, because the cgi animation is decent in this show.I expect great things from this, as I am writing this there are 14 episodes out, and I can't wait for moreWould recommend to anyone who likes an isekai done goodHave a nice day and thank you for reading. it gets more clear, it is still not said outloud, and you have to piece it together.I think it's absolutely fantastic the way the story was done.

Not unwatchable bad, more like so boring and uninteresting that you will likely forget everything that happened one week later. There is a lot of killing, intrigue, elves, demons, church fanatics ( why is the church always evil in isekais? ), dragons and pretty much everything you could ever think about when someone mentions ""fantasy"". But it just does not come...together well, I would say the worldbuilding is incoherent and the story lacks any remotely interesting characters. The plot itself is kinda melodramatic and, 21 episodes in, a lot has happened, but it is still makes little sense and I personally could not care less.The spider-girl half is better. Most people around here say they watch only for this part and I believe them. It is enjoyable to see her win tough fight and level up. Still, you could find her annoying, as she talks all the damn time that she is on screen. Her rants are either funny or stupid, funny in as you will have some laughts and some smiles, stupid as in she is explaing every stupid shit she is doing at the moment and if she would get rid of this I would like her character a lot more. I guess the target audience are 10 years old that don\'t understand simple stuff that happens on screen. I am sure I would enjoy this show more if I was 7 to 12, so most of those high ratings are probably from kids.The animation is kinda bad for 2021, in episode 21 it was downright horrible. Low budget comes to mind. Music is passable I guess, I can\'t remember anything about it, so at least it never annoyed me.Putting it all together? I am definetely watching this only because I am bored and I finished pretty much everything else that is good. It never annoyed me so much that I would drop it and I am curios how everything will turn out for spider-girl. It\'s direct competitior would be ""That time I got reincarnated as a slime"", which is better in every was possible and I would not rate that show higher than an 8.

The team does a wonderful job mixing large rig CGI monsters with...wonderful textures, flowing movement, and interesting camera angles. There were only a handful of times when i seriously noticed some annoyances in the CGI but that did not subtract from the overall enjoyment of the series.the story: It's especially tricky to talk about the story because its a twin narrative. for most of one episode you may be following the main character and her rewarding growth as she fights tougher and tougher monsters, outwitting her opponents using every skill at her disposal. Next episode you may be following the students as they learn more about the nature of the world and how they are adapting to their new powers. the show is very effective at weaving these two narrative along, being careful not to overlap them (too much) in order to avoid them becoming repetitive.I would recommend this series to any isekai fans. it takes the tired cliché of overpowered hero doing overpowered things and instead focuses on telling two story's of people learning and growing in two very different environments. The mystery behind why the world is built the way it is and when/if the two story's will converge is a powerful driving force within the anime.I would not recommend this to someone without an open mind, like i said earlier there are moments of bad CGI and if you already have a hate boner for the Isekai genre this show might not do enough to subvert it for you; however, if you think you might be interested in watching a twin narrative with great world building, mystery, and a delightfully fun to watch main character, then this is a show you should definitely take a look at. wonderful textures, flowing movement, and interesting camera angles.

The mystery behind why the world is built the way it is and when/if the two story's will converge is a powerful driving force within the anime.I would not recommend this to someone without an open mind, like i said earlier there are moments of bad CGI and if you already have a hate boner for the Isekai genre this show might not do enough to subvert it for you; however, if you think you might be interested in watching a twin narrative with great world building, mystery, and a delightfully fun to watch main character, then this is a show you should definitely take a look at."", ""If you like Isekai, Action, Fantasy Elements, and a good Story you will like this anime. The only bad aspect of this anime is the CGI and few direction choices, but you will get used to it as the episode progresses.I don't usually write anime reviews although I have watched much Anime until now. I wrote this review just to show my appreciation to the VA of Kumoku i.e Aoi Yukki. She makes every episode of this anime enjoyable. Because of Her godlike voice, I really enjoyed even the bad CGI and animation.I am a huge Isekai fan and like to read many Isekai...with new Ideas and cool stories. I first stumbled upon the source material of Spider when I was looking for Stories similar to Slime. I was bored so, I started with the Manga but then after reading few chapters I dropped the Manga. When I heard the anime announcement, I thought I will again give it a try. The Anime did not disappoint. Aoi Energy was too good that I fell in love with the Anime.The anime is soo good that it helps me release all the fatigue and stress of the day, I really enjoy it from my bottom of the heart. I'm always looking forwards to every episode.The Story is 10/10 for me, Up until now in the anime, everything has been so damn good. Although anime has skipped some content from the source material according to light novel readers, It always happens with every adaptation.The Art is 6/10 for me. Animation sometimes looks like a PowerPoint slideshow and the CGI is not polished properly but is tolerable due to the Sound of our goddess.The Sound is 10/10 for me. The sound of the goddess and amazing soundtrack makes this anime really powerful, I never skip the opening and ending of this anime. It's so damn good.The Enjoyment is 10/10. Like I said before, It releases my stress and I'm always looking forward to the next episode.Character is also 10/10 for me. The way they showed different aspects of the characters, their development is really good.Overall this anime is 9.2/10 for me.I won't be reading the source material after the anime ends, but I will surely watch Season 2 if it ever airs.If you are looking for an anime to watch if you like Fantasy Stuff then it's the anime for you. If you are really a hardcore CGI and Bad Animation Hater, you should at least give the first 3 episodes a try and then decide to watch it or not.This much from me.Have a good day and keep watching anime! with new Ideas and cool stories.

But what happens when you get an anime based on spiders and merge it with an isekai? You get this gem and it's worth the rollercoaster ride you gonna enjoy.This is why we need better Isekais like this and not the same old formula after formula...we keep seeing on your feeds. Keep in mind - not Isekai is bad but it's those out there that people say are BAD when anime is not getting good. This one is a hidden gem. Unlike Slime and Sao this one is all about adventure done right. Like I am gonna be real. I prefer when Isekai sticks to its side and does not go off topic when most anime tend to just reuse this formula way too much and not understand what is happening anymore. It's because we don't see why people are nowadays too vulgar and not listening to themselves and jumping on the bandwagon to insult good shows. This one does have quality but it has flaws (apart from the terrible CGI) it is mostly made for one reason to actually understand Isekai and how it's about when 100% of Isekai modern or retro are complex and need critical thinking to see the bigger picture. One thing I forgot to address is the whole split plot with the humans and the spider girl that might be a problem for you since the humans take sometimes up way too much space.The Spider Isekai takes place in an RPG post setting where our MC is a shut-in self-aware Spider-type of being who is kinda funny. It takes you into lore once the first couple of episodes. Kumoko has a wicked sense of humor. I like her design and really adore her VA which I am a huge fan of as well.Wait, does this mean that Isekai is good when it's not just trouped you see all the time? Yes, and probably yes, you need to understand how Isekai is made when almost every Isekai coming out this next season is gonna be the same old formula and mostly be sub-par and just make me want to sleep. This on the other hand is unique on its own and doesn't fall flat like Slime Isekai (which btw uses way too many troupes that I am sick of). See, part of the problem with Isekai is that there are WAY too many shows with Isekas that do this same get sucked into another world and become a bland-self insert character and don't act in character and be overpowered because it makes the show less interesting and more horrible to watch.Final Verdict: Recommended 100%. It has flaws. It has good writing and i love it. Give it a chance and don't be shy.Score: 10/10 we keep seeing on your feeds.

Alot of the fight scenes look like they took a single drawing of a character and moved it around a back ground like they were using MS paint. Which really blows because once you get past the awful visuals there...is a really solid story with incredibly likable characters, but this just aint it chief. The voice acting started off fantastic with Kumoko literally stealing the show Aoi Yuuki took a great character and then made her feel alive putting tons of emotion into scenes. Its honestly a complete joke that this studio managed to take such a solid show and dive it face first into the ground with poor visuals and awful pacing. I can only hope that if we get a season 2 that they change studios or that the studio currently working on it put the proper amount of effort and time doing the source material more justice. is a really solid story with incredibly likable characters, but this just aint it chief.

There is a lot of CGI in this series, but IMO this is it done well! There are some monsters that are weirdly shaded, but the MC looks great, and it melds very well with the non CGI. I would still say Houseki no Kuni has better CGI, but this isn\'t far behind. Animation overall in this anime is really good.But, yeah, I haven\'t read the light novel, so I will say this as someone who has only watched the anime - I think it does everything right. It is a silly and fun,...quite morbid tale about a girl who absolutely rocks her spiderness.If there is a stereotypical spider in this world, it ain\'t this one. The light-hearted and energetic comedy in the spider-adventure is counterpointed by a more somber telling of the non-spider characters that are also reincarnated. ""How did we change, and where are the other people from our class?"" There is a lot of set-up and I don\'t know how it might pay off in the future, but I think it\'s interesting. I hope it won\'t drag out too long. Honestly, I\'m happier the more spider I get in my life.One thing I appreciate with the writing is the meta narrative. Typical of isekai is that the gamefied aspect of the story is more or less accepted as is. There are some hints that the very nature of the reality they have been reborn into will come into question - quite interesting. I will likely read the light novel going forward, the setting is intriguing.But to be clear - this isn\'t a philosophical exploration of what it means to be a spider - this is a really idiotic premise done right. I don\'t want character development - I want spider-guitarsolos and spider-interior decoration. And that\'s what I got!

If it sounds fun, watch it!', ""There are two reasons as to why a lot of people are hating on this show and it's the CGI and confusing way the story is presented, Yes there is a lot of CGI in this anime and most fights are done in CGI and there are even moments where there is no fighting but somehow we still get CGI shots and I understand as to why some people might hate that but this isn't even one of the worst CGI's we've seen in anime there are some other Isekai shows that have it way way way worse than this one and to be completely...honest despite the fuckton of CGI in this show it did not reduce the amount of enjoyment I got when I was watching it.Now Let's talk about how the story starts off, Basically an explosion happened while the whole cast of students in japan we're in the middle of class and all of them got reincarnated in the fantasy world that they now live in.(that's basically how it starts and don't worry the reason for the explosion will be explained in the anime).Now lets talk about the story and why some people hate it, The story is presented in this show is that there are 2 timelines that are presented at the same time (MC's POV of when she got reincarnated as a spider which is 15 years prior to the other story) and there is the other classmates who were reincarnated as humans and elves 15 years later after the events of the MC's reincarnation. And it makes you think that both of these stories we're occurring at the same time when it is not, that's why most people are confused, Yes you will have some questions about the story and its world and about the plot holes but as the story goes on most of your questions will eventually be answered although some of the plot holes you're seeking answers might not be answered but most of the things that confuses you will be cleared after you've seen all 24 episodes of the anime because it gives you the answers as the story makes it's progress. And the reason why it is like this is because if the anime we're to be faithful to the original source material or the LN then probably the first like 10 episodes of this anime would just be solely focused on one single character which is the MC and the POV of the other character like the classmates and elves wont come until later as the story they are in is in a different timeline than what the story of Kumoko's evolution is, I mean imagine the first 10 episodes of this anime just the MC grinding her skills and levels and evolving I mean personally I'd like it but most people might find it boring and maybe that is why the anime is directed this way and not like the LN or Manga. And oh yeah they skipped some parts of the LN but that's just normal in anime adaptations so yeah.Most of the characters in the show we're pretty generic I'd say, none of them particularly stand out as an interesting character or anything other than I guess our MC Kumoko who is also the best girl of this show, She's a cutesy hyper girl who is just the best character to vibe with and her spider form is cute too(human form slaps tho fr fr). Compared to her most of the other casts weren't really anything special I mean there is the other classmates who we're reincarnated as nobles and royalties, hero, adventurer's, elves, vampire, and there are a few who we're supposedly dead but yeah no one really did stand out to me I think they're all very typical and all but they're fine, Kumoko is just way too lovable and cute she solos fr fr.Now the animation and art, Animation is good if I'm being honest probably the only bad thing about it is the large amount of CGI in it but personally I don't mind it that much because first It's watchable and second is this is not the worst CGI I've seen and other shows have it way way way worse with CGI than this show so there is that. And as for the art I'd say it's pretty good, I liked the monster designs and the Kumoko Spider design was cute as for the human characters though I think they're okay more on the average side but nothing too bad just fine. Lastly we got the music, Don't have much to say about them but the first ED was super catchy and the the OP's we're good too and the other ED was pretty nice as well and as for the OST's I didn't really notice much about them but I guess they did the job.Overall I highly recommend this show if you're an Isekai junkie like myself, If you're only here trying to look for action then this show is definitely not for you because the fight scenes in this show isn't crazy good because of the CGI. But I'm not telling you to skip it at best I'd say give it a few episodes and you can decide whether you will continue or not because trust me this is one of the best Isekai shows you can find in the mass of 5/10 Isekai's you will find. honest despite the fuckton of CGI in this show it did not reduce the amount of enjoyment I got when I was watching it.Now Let's talk about how the story starts off, Basically an explosion happened while the whole cast of students in japan we're in the middle of class and all of them got reincarnated in the fantasy world that they now live in.(that's basically how it starts and don't worry the reason for the explosion will be explained in the anime).Now lets talk about the story and why some people hate it, The story is presented in this show is that there are 2 timelines that are presented at the same time (MC's POV of when she got reincarnated as a spider which is 15 years prior to the other story) and there is the other classmates who were reincarnated as humans and elves 15 years later after the events of the MC's reincarnation.

Boy was I wrong.As the show progressed the art quality kept tumbling down, both the 2D and 3D. They mixed both together in the worst possible way, the editing went to shit, and finally they just replaced about 80% of the show with CGI. It\'s worse than Arifureta, worse than Berserk and by god, I...never even thought I\'d be comparing this show to Ex-Arm (bleh).Even the sound effects are somehow misplaced and poor and... eh, it\'s just so bad. My guess is they gave the studio a budget for a 12ep show, then said ""make it 24 episodes"". I sympathize with the animators, but that doesn\'t change the abhorrent art.They even butchered the story, the pacing is all over the place, many of the most important events (the monkeys, the earth dragon fight), feel like they have no weight. I just can\'t fanthom how they made a 24ep first season and still rushed the whole thing.They should\'ve just made a 12ep show with just Kumokos perspective, and either made a spinoff for the humans or just not bother with that at all.All in all this was worse than Berserk (2017) and that was horrid in and of itself. never even thought I\'d be comparing this show to Ex-Arm (bleh).Even the sound effects are somehow misplaced and poor and... eh, it\'s just so bad.

The skills she acquires and how she has to sort...out what they all do and how to use them is fascinating - her talking to herself/her parallel minds is a great way to do exposition and set up the next scene, and the tactics she prepares to outclass her far stronger opponents are ""EPIC GAMER MOMENTS!"" at their finest. Her journey is such a surprising joy to watch, that it reframes the rest of the show - mediocre to a fault - as a pleasant foil to the far cooler spider stuff. Her fellow reincarnators, the demon lord who is probably also ""System Administrator D"", and the goofy magic school are the wholesome seasame seeds on the bun of the sandwich. It\'s nice to have them, but they don\'t really matter.Several times an episode kicked off following characters other than Kumoko, and you can\'t help but think wait... who the hell are these people? I literally forget whether I have seen most of the characters on the poster by the time I tune in to watch the next episode. I do not know their names, and I have a feeling I won\'t until they meet up with Kumoko if ever. I don\'t care one way or another, to the Spider\'s credit. Tip of the hat for the voicing actress and animators - you can really tell that they put their all into making this weird looking spider one of my favortie Anime characters.A strong recommend. out what they all do and how to use them is fascinating - her talking to herself/her parallel minds is a great way to do exposition and set up the next scene, and the tactics she prepares to outclass her far stronger opponents are ""EPIC GAMER MOMENTS!"" at their finest.

(that's winter 2021, if you're from the future. Hello from the past. This season was pretty bumpin' overall, so this isn't trivial praise). The main character is well written and interesting, and the supporting cast is fun, if not profound. The plot is interesting enough to hold your attention, without taking itself so seriously that you'll forget you're watching a comedy-- And the show is just dumb enough that I don't have to get emotionally invested into it. This is the perfect combination for a bing-able, fun-&-light...watch: and honestly, that's exactly what I wanted this season. It really hits the spot for me. Take it or leave it for what it is, a fun show, nothing more, nothing less. watch: and honestly, that's exactly what I wanted this season. It really hits the spot for me.

On one hand you have Studio Millepensee and director Itagaki Shin, creators of the excellent wacky comedy Teekyuu delivering much of the same with the Spider segments; on another you have Studio Millepensee and director Itagaki Shin, creators of the dreadful CG mess that is Berserk 2016 delivering much of the same with the Human segments.It is a show of two distinct halves where one is clearly much better than the other. The Spider stuff with Kumoko is great, playing on the conventions of an Isekai with an intriguing plot and ends nicely, while the...Human stuff is boring generic isekai shit with an admittedly interesting hook that is poorly executed and ends on a ""Read the LN for More!"" ending. Honestly, if they made a cut with solely the Spider segments, not only will it look better, but it\'d be also more entertaining with actual likeable characters instead of the Human\'s segment\'s awful unlikeable jackasses. Even then, the show rarely uses this dual narrative to its benefit. I can maybe think of one moment where it\'s done well, though benefiting only the Spider side of things. I understand that the novel is really lengthy, but if they had done a 13 episode show with just Kumoko, not only would it be paced better, but it wouldn\'t end on a terrible cliffhanger.It really can feel like total whiplash as episodes switch between the two narratives. Every time the human parts are on I just zone out and keep on hoping that I\'d be getting more Spider. No one is likeable, and the plot is frankly a mess that is taken absolutely seriously, highlighting a compete contrast with the lighthearted-but-with-a-dark-secret plot from the Spider segments. To highlight the discrepancies, in the Spider segments, Kumoko is a talkative girl with many weird and wonderful things to say about her predicament despite having no one to talk to, while in the Human segments, Kumoko is a mute despite being surrounded by many others.The only fair way to recommend this show is to do so with an asterisk: Whenever the Human parts come up, just skip the show to the end until you see a spider or the end credits. It\'s a damned shame such a good show is mixed in with a lousy one.

One is hideously ugly, and the other is mind-numbingly boring.The hideously ugly plotline is led by an overly enthusiastic girl who was reincarnated as a spider. She must fight for her life in monster-infested caves. That explains the English name: ""I\'m a spider, so what?!"" If that sounds intriguing, you will be disappointed. The title is misleading because the mind-numbingly boring half of the show is a bog-standard isekai plotline: A high school class gets reincarnated in a generic fantasy setting… How original.The first plotline follows Kumoko, a high school girl who...was reincarnated as the titular spider. It primarily takes place in caves where she first hatches. Wherever her journey takes her, she is isolated in the body of a spider—talking to herself, personifying the ghoulish monsters she fights, and creating imaginary friends. Her portion of the show is practically plotless, and it is written like a stream of consciousness, often repeating the same events with no progression. Unfortunately, her plotline is marred by repetition, plot armor, and hideous 3D animation ripped straight out of a Playstation 2 game. The second scenario was produced on the generic isekai anime assembly line: It follows Kumoko\'s classmates, who were also reincarnated, but primarily as humans. It takes place in the same world, years in the future. All of them were reborn as babies, though the story is about their trials and tribulations as teenagers in a strange new world. The show randomly swaps between scenarios 1 and 2—sometimes, the whole episode will follow Kumoko. Other times all we\'ll get is the infinitely less interesting teenage class (much more common in the second half). Needless to say, I preferred Kumoko. She is the only reason why I continued watching.As a heroine, Kumoko has potential. She\'s charismatic, resourceful, and she has a unique character design to boot. Her sarcastic quips are funny, at first. Over time, I grew gradually less entertained by her overdone and forced sarcasm. Kumoko\'s wide variety of facial expressions were consistently amusing, reminiscent of Konosuba\'s ridiculous character art style. The animators chose to give Kumoko a CGI model with facial expressions drawn in during close-ups. That creative decision suits Kumo’s chaotic fights with monsters and beasts, allowing for dynamic camera movements. At first, I was charmed by her zany personality and Aoi Yuuki\'s energetic performance. That stopped being the case halfway through. Her \'jokes\' devolved into yelling loudly (no, that doesn\'t count as a joke). Either the dialogue is yelling or bland exposition dumping. The screenwriters included pointless light novel narration rather than using visual storytelling. This obsession with ""telling"" rather than ""showing"" is the root cause of every mundane light novel adaptation; this is no different. From the start, Kumoko fights for her life against horrid CGI monsters, but each one follows the same pattern. The monster is far stronger than her; she nearly dies, then a contrived mechanic will keep her alive. Right before getting ""killed"" Kumoko either cracks a joke, ruining any chance of taking it seriously, or she gives a long monologue as the animators slowly zoom in on the giant CGI monsters looming over her.You will hear her say HP, MP, SP hundreds of times. The show spends excessive amounts of time explaining surface-level RPG mechanics, but Kumoko is so plot-armored that, ultimately, none of it matters! I know someone will say, ""She\'s not like other isekai protagonists because she worked for her skills."" No, shut up. Stop. Even if a character starts weak then becomes overpowered, they are still overpowered. Of course, there\'s nothing inherently wrong with that; One Punch Man is one of the most successful comedy anime, and being overpowered is the whole joke. Just because Saitama trained his ass off to become all-powerful doesn\'t change what he is. But Kumo desu ga doesn\'t realize that WE KNOW Kumoko is overpowered—so it puts on an act: pretending like she\'s in danger. Tons of censored blood spattering, limbs get torn apart, screaming, ripping and tearing sound effects—then she gains a power-up to save the day!Kumoko\'s fights have no stakes, but there\'s an effortless way to fix this. Suppose she had something, anything to lose. A companion, a McGuffin, a tiny spider buddy, or some power that could get taken from her—then there would be a sense of danger. What about her personality? Characters who go through traumatic events should have some long-term mental effect. In a better anime, for sure. After the most violent and harrowing fights, Kumoko is still the same old peppy spider. Her near-death experiences never cause a lasting impact on her personality. In the second plotline, the generic male protagonist has more to lose. He has friends and family to create stakes, even though he is torturously dull.Above ground, the archetypal isekai characters stare at each other with unconcerned looks as they deliver exposition in the most literal manner possible. Perhaps the animators just couldn\'t be bothered to animate facial expressions and body language. If we\'re lucky, one will make an ill-timed joke to keep us awake—but even if there\'s a punchline (very rarely), it bounces off the protagonist\'s thick skull. Shun, the protagonist in question, is about as compelling as watching paint dry—and he has even more plot armor than Kumoko. Even when he grieves or suffers due to some contrived conflict, it\'s impossible to feel anything for a piece of cardboard with eyes and a nose.The rest of the students are either one line nobody\'s destined to die unceremoniously or mouthpieces to dump exposition. All of them are named, but trying to remember them would require caring. There are a few intriguing characters; one girl was reincarnated as a dragon and another as the opposite gender. Of course, neither of them gets enough screen time to be memorable. A running theme was: What would happen if you were forced to live out as a different identity? They could’ve used this theme to explore the insecurities it’d cause each character to feel. None of that happened, it was swept under the rug in favor of generic male isekai protagonist #304. One thing all the characters have in common is plot armor. The show hints at them having more depth in the source material. A few minutes here and there are spared to info dump one of their backstories. Of course, that information is utterly irrelevant and never brought up again. At least the light novel fans got some scraps amid the doubtlessly butchered adaptation. I feel sorry for anyone who likes the source material, you did not deserve this affront to humanity.There\'s an antagonist for both storylines—A vacuous demon lolita in dominatrix gear and a kid with an inferiority complex for the cardboard protagonist. They’re 1-dimensional, but they cause enough harm to motivate at least one of the protagonists. Neither do much except attempt (and fail) to look menacing. How do they expect us to get engaged in a \'Good vs. Evil\' power struggle if the \'Evil\' is neither intimidating nor relevant?Four years ago, studio Orange animated Houseki no Kuni with luxurious CGI... Unfortunately, Studio Millepensee is not Orange. Previously, they made the stunningly awful Berserk (2016) CGI adaptation, and since then, their animators have not improved. Houseki no Kuni had excellent fight choreography, it utilizes 3D art for smooth dynamic camera motions, and the CGI models look good. Unfortunately, Kumo desu ga has none of those. The fight choreography is incomprehensible: Nauseating camera movements flying around dark 3D caves. Splotches of dark colors spurting everywhere, random magic circles tossed in, and that\'s only Kumo\'s half of the show. The 3D models constantly phase through objects like a poorly made video game. The 3D models have different lighting from the background art, so they stick out like a sore thumb. The jarring visuals look similar to a video game running at 5 frames per second. The only thing that prevented me from dying of boredom was my struggle not to vomit.Once the studio ran out of either time or money, they began using low poly CGI models for every character. I don\'t care if people call me a ""CGI elitist,"" but someone has to say it. The final four episodes of this anime are some of the hideous I\'ve seen in an anime, rivaling Hand Shakers, Arifureta, and Ex-Arm for the worst three-dimensional art in a TV anime. But unlike those three, it wasn\'t enjoyably bad. It was just nauseating and boring. Imagine a burning dumpster filled with used diapers that rolled off a cliff and landed in a pile of steaming manure.The 2D art is hideous too, though at least it\'s not as nauseating. First, there\'s almost no animation. It’s entirely panning shots, still images, zooming, and animation loops. Second, the transitions look like they were done in IMovie—simple fade to black and jump cuts. Third, the character designs are entirely forgettable. In both worlds, the sound design is amateurish. They used the bare minimum stock sound effects. It took me time to realize the vocals don\'t sync with the mouth flaps. Sometimes the voices cut out altogether while the character\'s mouth is still moving! It\'s no surprise the two subplots look and feel entirely different from each other: Studio Millisenpe made the 2D half, and they outsourced the CGI to Exsa, a studio no one has heard of. The first OP and ED are good, but the second two are ear piercing. These intros might have the worst credit integration in any anime ever: With text barely fitting on the screen in a jarring font that blocks the intro visuals. They would’ve been better off letting high school students design it.Regardless of Kumo desu ga appalling art, animation, sound, and directing—the storytelling and character writing is still awful. It is filled with tedious exposition and stale comedy. If the anime was true to its title and focused on the spider portion, perhaps it could\'ve been halfway decent.

The ONE saving grace of the entire anime is the spider side, Aoi Yuuki did an absolutely perfect job portraying Kumoko and I could sing her praises for her role in this show forever.

I highly recommend this show, although it was marred somewhat by production issues.First let's talk about the setup: our protagonist is reincarnated as a Spider in a fantasy world following an explosion during a classics lesson in her classroom in Japan. Now being reincarnated as a monster of some sort is not exactly Earth-shattering, but the fact that she has been reincarnated specifically as a spider is actually part of the plot, as is the explosion itself. So we're already a couple...of points up on the standard Isekai trash. The author here actually cares about what is going on and why.Two of the shows biggest strengths are made very clear from the very first episode - firstly the MC has a HUGE personality and her VA does an outstandingly enthusiastic job of letting us in on Kumoko's hilarious inner monologue. Secondly, the MC is a long way from being OP, in fact she is actually born as the weakest monster type there is - not just a Taratect (spider), not just a lesser Taratect, but a small, lesser Taratect. She is constantly being thrown into life threatening situations in the vast Monster-filled labyrinth she finds herself in (her being here is part of the plot by the way). She can't go so far as to repeatedly experience death, like Subaru in Re-Zero, but her constant scrapes with mortality are genuinely exciting and far better executed than in most other shows of this genre. Kumoko suffers horrific injuries in her fights, losing limbs and eyes, suffering severe burns or being impaled, and is frequently saved by a strange ability she has to instantly regenerate on level-up. And guess what - that's actually a plot point, not just a contrivance.The game-style level, evolution and skills System come across as very thoroughly worked out, with actual stats being shown on screen as a sort of HUD that Kumoko can browse when she appraises herself or other entities, human or monster, including some very long lists of stat points, skills and titles. And - this is something of a spoiler but, again - this is actually part of the plot.I hope i'm getting this across, because it is a major part of why this is such a great story: everything about Kumoko's Isekai'ed circumstance and the very make-up of the RPG-style System in this strange world is bound up tightly with the main plot (I must confess to being partly spoiled by the wiki here). This level of coherence and fore-thought in approaching an apparently tropey story and setting is second to none that I know of in Anime.Spider actually interweaves a second narrative into Kumoko's survival story - it is made explicit very early on that she is not the only person to have been reincarnated, and we follow a secondary protagonist - Shun - as her follows a more standard Isekai Hero's journey parallel to that of our loveable MC. Shun has an antagonist, a group of girls around him and falls foul of political and religious shenanigans. Many viewers have been critical of this second thread, but it actually does almost all the hard work of world building beyond Kumoko's very limited scope.The human-side narrative also acts as a counterpoint to Kumoko's experiences - it should be very clear to the viewer that our poor, endangered spider is getting considerably more experience than her fellow reincarnations while she fights her way out of the most dangerous place on the planet, than Shun and his friends are coming across training at the academy. And at some point everyone watching realises that there's an additional catch that makes Kumoko's hero's journey far more advanced than poor Shun's.I'm afraid we have to talk about the CG. Quite a bit of the spider animation looks CG to me, but it is very well done - with the camera smoothly panning around Kumoko as she spiderman's her way around the labyrinth and its denizens. This quality does not last, alas. During the second cour there is a noticeable drop in some of the quality and this becomes positively glaring during some of the human-side story towards the end, particularly when CG models are used for fight & battle animations. They look very clumsy compared to the earlier or more traditional work.Apparently the production was farmed out and came back at such low quality that much of the CG was re-worked but the time, and presumably budget, available grew less and less as the series came to an end. The final episode itself was actually delayed by a week, but honestly it was worth it, it's a cracker, with a thrilling fight and some key reveals for the future.I have to dock spider a few marks for the art quality, but in all other respects i'd regard it as a classic in terms of writing, voice-work and direction. You must watch this show. The second OP 'Bursty, greedy Spider' is a classic to boot. Looking forward to a S2. of points up on the standard Isekai trash. The author here actually cares about what is going on and why.Two of the shows biggest strengths are made very clear from the very first episode - firstly the MC has a HUGE personality and her VA does an outstandingly enthusiastic job of letting us in on Kumoko's hilarious inner monologue. Secondly, the MC is a long way from being OP, in fact she is actually born as the weakest monster type there is - not just a Taratect (spider), not just a lesser Taratect, but a small, lesser Taratect. She is constantly being thrown into life threatening situations in the vast Monster-filled labyrinth she finds herself in (her being here is part of the plot by the way). She can't go so far as to repeatedly experience death, like Subaru in Re-Zero, but her constant scrapes with mortality are genuinely exciting and far better executed than in most other shows of this genre. Kumoko suffers horrific injuries in her fights, losing limbs and eyes, suffering severe burns or being impaled, and is frequently saved by a strange ability she has to instantly regenerate on level-up. And guess what - that's actually a plot point, not just a contrivance.The game-style level, evolution and skills System come across as very thoroughly worked out, with actual stats being shown on screen as a sort of HUD that Kumoko can browse when she appraises herself or other entities, human or monster, including some very long lists of stat points, skills and titles.

In fact, I was extremely apprehensive because I was a huge fan of the manga.Now, I do wish they had gone with the manga appearance of Kumoko. It is more Spider-like and honestly cuter. Really I mostly wanted the more blank spider eyes than super anime eyes, but I understand the choice. Human eyes portray emotion that we can understand and connect to, much moreso than blank spider eyes.This is a great Isekai and what I like...about this Isekai, is that it isn’t totally grim or bursting with fan service, which I feel are heavy themes in quite a few manga and anime. The story of this anime really does not need any of that kind of that sort of thing to keep it going. It even starts out rather sudden and we aren’t quite sure what happened to get Kumoko into this situation.Instead of living in full out fear, Kumoko really makes the best of her situation on her own with no supporting characters with her. There are points where it breaks off into the rest of the world where there is more interactions going on, but honestly, the lack of it is what gives this anime so much of a refreshing feeling.The story becomes slowly more complicated in a way that really makes sense and I find myself really rooting for Kumoko. I haven’t read the Light Novel, but the anime is nowhere near the same as the manga. Those of us who have read the manga might immediately be wary hearing that, but the changes are overall very gratifying.The songs are also really fun and really catchy so far. I love them to death. The ending theme really brings out Kumoko’s feelings as a character and even if you only watch it once, I think many will find it fast-paced, yet gratifying.The big elephant in the room, the big bad apprehensive thing that people are really clinging to, even though it is still so early in the anime, is the CG. There is no hiding that the CG is bad. In fact, in one episode, it was so bad that I almost dropped the anime completely. No lies, it was just that bad. Those graphics do get a bit better later on so far, they really have.This was an ambitious anime project and I really enjoy how it is going so far with the exception of that one really poorly animated CG episode and I have found myself devastated at the end of the week that there isn’t more, even though I already know what is going to happen.That is how good this anime is. I really encourage you to give the current first 8 episodes a real chance and you will see the visual improvements as it goes. It is still iffy at times, but I hope that the animators can still pull it through! about this Isekai, is that it isn’t totally grim or bursting with fan service, which I feel are heavy themes in quite a few manga and anime.

It is still iffy at times, but I hope that the animators can still pull it through!', 'The spider isekai is another case of trying to subvert a few things, only to fail in the longrun because you focus on the wrong things. One twist the anime went for was about having two storylines developing independently while at the same time feeding off each other. In one story you had the main heroine getting reincarnated as a spider and having to survive in a very dangerous cave, and in the other story it was about her fellow students reincarnating as various people and monsters in the human world where they are given proper upbringing and military training. The antithesis of seeing the...spider having to fight hard in order to survive while the humans are having a mostly easy-going life was funny for a few episodes. Another twist in the second half of the show is the characters helping out the demon lord. Instead of having the heroes being the good guys who are gradually leveling up in order to defeat some distant evil party, in this show they become the evil party. With proper presentation, the anime could have been a very good subversion of a done to death formula. But as I mentioned already the presentation was far from perfect for the following reasons.1) The production values are not very good. The CGI monsters are standing out too much and that takes you out of the experience. The artwork is also getting worse after awhile, resulting in the final episodes where things get more serious and should be given more attention to come off as very ugly to look at.2) The tone shifts are not transitioning well. When the show wants to move from comedy to tragedy, or from lighthearted moments to more grimdark ones, it usually does it in a sudden way, which again takes you out of the experience. For example, the spider is constantly joking about things that a second later will try to kill her, and that can be very jarring.3) The storylines are uneven. Instead of being treated as equally important, the spider side of the story is far more interesting than the human side. Every time the scene changes to show what the humans are doing it can be very boring since it comes off as a generic fantasy adventure with way too many bland characters who are doing close to nothing. As a result, you never care about the humans as much as you care about the spider, which means half of the show is very bland.4) The videogame terminology is off-putting. Since everyone has levels and skill trees, you get this constant narration of an AI telling you how many experience points you earned and what skills you unlocked. If you are not fine with everything playing out like a videogame, you are not gonna like the show. In traditional stories you learn something new by studying or training. Over here it just appears as an extra ability in your mind because you did something. It’s artificial since it doesn’t happen in an organic way and it’s always followed by huge infodumps and statistic screens.Thus, despite its good intentions, the spider isekai is another failure of an anime that doesn’t improve the image of isekais as overused, badly written and badly presented escapism. spider having to fight hard in order to survive while the humans are having a mostly easy-going life was funny for a few episodes.

My god this show is really terrible drawing 2D scenes. At one point after episode 6, the art scenes were improving and 3D renders were making sense until halfway through this season the animation quality just drops. We're seeing slideshows as fighting scenes and as an anime that involves serious moments, it was poorly portrayed.Art 1/10.The pacing of the plot is all over the place. I don't even know who is who anymore only the spider is the only one relevant the...way this anime is showing. The human part is the worst, the made the hero look so ignorant and dumb it looked like he was pretending hard to be a good guy hero. Although, the story  intriguing during early parts of the show as to how it connects with Kumo. But near the end, they cut in the human and spider scenes too much and too often it looks like they are forcing themselves to make it much more interesting. It had the opposite effect for me.The Story. The season is ending and i am still confused about the whole story. The actual story behind this anime is outstandingly good but the show ruined it for me that I had to look up into fandom Wiki to make sense of what is going on. I have to compliment the complex skill system though, most isekai anime would cut down the info of certain skills to fit the show's timeframe and some are removed/changed completely which completely differ from their sources.Story 6/10There are good moments this show had. Seeing the spider rise from zero to op is satisfying as it took a considerable amount of time. Not to mention she had help to an omnipotent being which is in fact another whole level of twist that the anime won't cover. So the story overall is really great the only disappointment i have is that the anime can't portray that mystery well.Characters. I don't know about this one, the only one that has impactful backstory during the anime was Kumo the spider. As for the human part, it would be best to look up to the fandom wiki as I am still confused about them like their power, how is their previous life helped them in the new world and new personality mixed living in the new world. The anime never explained that well.The other mysterious characters were well written however, like the vampire girl which has close connection with Kumo and her story as to how she got powerful. The omnipotent god which helped Kumo which was shown in just a brief moment tells how much her character is involved. The elf teacher was confusing at first but I understand her current situation and her motive to protect her students.Characters 6/10.Overall, I did enjoy watching and will probably watch the last episode.

It had the biggest rating jumping between episodes I've ever witnessed. By episode 6 I had this at 1/1.5. By episode 12 it was at a 6. By 18, it back down to a 3. And finally, now at 24, it's at a 7. Seriously what the hell.Its animation at times is absolutely atrocious. And I hate, hate, [b]hate[/b] the human side. It was just so dull and uninspiring. Typical shounen shit. Loved Kumeko though.

I don't drop, so it wasn't too much of an issue there.The op is actually pretty nice, sonically at least. Visuals wise, it was pretty standard. The ED was pretty rough unless you're into Iruma-Kun styled music (ie: brainless dancing and vocals).It was really hard coming up with a rating for this. It made me smile at times for sure, but just as many times it made me cringe and question your taste in anime.

It was not grandiose by any means, but it certainly was better than people initially expected, especially in the beginning.[!] Story: 8The anime has two primary perspectives to tell: Kumoko\'s, and the human, Shun\'s. Albeit the plot itself could have been better managed, that is not much of an issue because the story is heavily focused on Kumoko\'s intense yet simultaneously comedic adventure; It\'s not everyday that you become so invested in a spider living her life in another world. That said, Kumoko\'s story...alone ultimately carries this entire show, even making up for the mediocrity of the human perspective.[!] Art: 7Despite the use of CGI, it was actually pleasant to see. The 3d models were smooth, detailed, and blended well when used in tandem with 2d art. This is also consistent throughout Kumoko\'s perspective. The overall art however, deteriorates the further one goes down the human perspective. Even the animators didn\'t bother to put much effort in the boring human side and instead focused on maximizing entertainment on Kumoko.Sound: 9The sound effects are generally good. What are more impressive however, are the voice acting for Kumoko and the songs used for the endings. The voice was very fitting for the comedic internal monologues of Kumoko, and the singing was just fire. Then again, the person who voiced Kumoko and sang both the endings is none other than Yuuki Aoi herself; truly splendid voice actor.[!] Character: 9Kumoko as the main character is not an understatement, she absolutely carried this entire show. Other characters are either just bland or outright annoying plot pawns. Meanwhile, Kumoko does not even need other people to be entertaining, as her own adventure and monologues are a gold mine for smile-inducing and laughter-bursting entertainment. Her battle experiences are also not just battles fought using pure brawn, dumb luck, or cliche excuses, she cleverly uses her skills, gathers info on her opponent, and takes advantage of their weaknesses while minimizing the potential of their strengths; An aspect that is rarely found in action shows these days: intelligence.Enjoyment: 10The most important factor for any form of entertainment, enjoyment. That said, if was not already obvious, I really evidently enjoyed this anime. Whenever a new episode came out, I start watching it with a smile on my face, eager to have a good time.

It's similar to Reincarnated as a Slime, only the main character is born as a spider, and we spend most episodes (so far) in the dungeon where the main character is born.We see her fight new monsters, level up, gain new skills, and slowly learn the mechanics of the world. She is alone, struggles immensely, and talks to herself. So it's similar to Arifurea in that respect, but the tone and comedy is similar to Slime. We get a sense that she'll eventually become OP in the...world.However, she isn't the only one who was transported to the world as (like Arifureta) the rest of her class is also here, but in a different part of the world, and as humans (mostly). I think this is where the story gets decent for me.The character dynamics is interesting, especially when they reference to life back at school. The character foundation feels pretty solid. There's some conflict. And there's anticipation of when the rest of the class will meet the main character and she'll be overpowered somehow. I think that's what keeping me engaged so far.The animation and art is good. There is some CGI, which some might hate, but I don't mind it as it isn't too strong in my eyes. world.However, she isn't the only one who was transported to the world as (like Arifureta) the rest of her class is also here, but in a different part of the world, and as humans (mostly).

I heard praise of the manga but never cared, heard that the anime would have cgi - whatever. I don't mind CGI. I don't mind a few things here and there. But god damn this has to be the worst animation quality I've seen in a hot minute.Even calling it animation is far too high praise in more than one instance. I started reading the manga after they made Kumoko as annoying as possible and I couldn't bear it anymore. The manga is fine. But the anime is about as good an adaptation as Black Clover was.It's...a shitstain. The only reason it's not a 1 is that I have to think of the animators who probably didn't want it to end like this.They must've run on a super tight budget for a 12 Episode anime and made it 24 episodes. They used CGI to cut a lot of work, let Kumoko talk to herself in the most annoying way possible for many minutes a piece and on top probably didn't read the manga themselves because the story is all over the place.And all this corner cutting still didn't save them from birthing a disgrace. Episode 14 in particular is so abhorrent it makes Way of the Househusband look good. Seriously there's less fps than Cyberpunk 2077 on a 20 year old system.

Also, I\'ve only read the manga (and seen the anime), but if time let\'s me, I\'ll read the light novel.Story 7/10The story is a generic isekai. But one that has a special twist. The female protagonist is a spider monster with nothing but enemies arround her. The usual game-like aspects like stats, magic and levels are mixed with real life problems. These make the story in line with game-isekai, but her personality is what makes it funny and enticing to watch. Also she\'s female wich we don\'t get alot of, so...yeah, that\'s nice!Sad thing is that another story is mixed in with it.

In this case, we have a decent story in the light novel that has been butchered by dreadful production. It's hard to take a CR series seriously with titles like Gibiate, Noblesse, and now Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?.First of all, the graphics in this show are beyond appalling. It feels like a middle school project rather than streamlined professional work. I am tired of the extreme reliance on CGI in CR productions. Is CGI bad? Absolutely not. Watch Land of the...Lustrous or Dorohedoro and you'll agree with me. What makes a CGI good? Well, for starters, not being reminded every 5 seconds that you're watching CGI and being able to focus on the actual story. In the case of this show or Gibiate, that is simply impossible. Monsters in Gibiate and Kumo Desu ga stand out as poor execution. The expressions of characters are rushed and it's hard to take anything in the show seriously.Another thing that actually stood out to me as a musician is the poor sound quality. If I had to judge an anime based on sound quality alone, Kumo Desu ga would be the worst show I have watched. It's hard to believe that this has been recorded in a professional studio. It sucks because they have pretty good Seiyuu in this show such as Aoi Yuuki (voice actor for Tatsumaki in One Punch Man) and Kazuyuki Okitsu (Jonathan Joestar in JoJo). Some people might argue that Kumoko's voice was intended to sound the way it did especially since she is underground. I understand the intent but I suggest comparing this show with Dorohedoro as a reference.Character development falls short of the LN. They should've slowed down to give meaning to any character beyond Kumoko. At this point it feels like anything other than Kumoko is cocophony.The only redeeming quality about this show is that it is watchable because the original story is decent.

No spoilers bellow, I think, just story-writing-concepts.And mixed feelings.In short, this anime is somewhat badly made. There were times when I couldnt tell in which direction main char was moving due to poor (CGI) animation. CGI is just bad. And for some reason everyone but main char is animated properly ... and ... boringly? I know that most people hated sidestories because they are so unremarkable compared to the main char, so ... studio replicated those feelings? Who thought that is a good idea? It makes you HATE them. They are not entirely pointless, there...is a lot of messaging going on inside of them, but they are slow and boring.Besides poor animation ... I quite like it. I quite like this anime. It is less than I would hope for, like what Re:Zero fans got, but I can feel like someone seriously tried to make it great but there was not enough money or it was just poorly done. But the feeling of WN is there, I hated 1. episode, I just dislike it, but at the end of 3., I am enjoying more than watching Neverland and at 6. I guess I am becoming somewhat immune towards bad animation, bad pacing, bad exposition and just love it for same reasons I love WN and manga. Story and characters. But mostly story (and one character).For those interested, manga is amazing and WN is a fun read with WTF storyline. It does have its faults, I think that author knew where story was going and got bored of it half way trough (like how Vinland just mentions main char went to Greece ... a great journey of great importance that didnt get a single chapter of storyline because ... you know, people want to know how they get to Vinland, not Greece) so it started speeding it up with entirely avoidable fights with ""high stakes"" combats, but to me they feel like stats raisers so she-spider can become OP as fast as possible. If you wish main char would die because it took too much risk then it is just a bad storywriting and it happens many times, but besides that, I love it and fully recommend it.PS: I also read a review that said that main\'s voice (main in general) is annoying ... that is our girl :D , she is one hell of a spider <3 just wait for her to become [SPOILERS] is a lot of messaging going on inside of them, but they are slow and boring.Besides poor animation ...

And based on the high ratings of the source material light novel, I can assume that the story will only get better.The anime was developed and released in two separate cours, each cour lasting about 12 episodes. The first cour is so much better. The animation is good, and the pacing is decent. But the second cour was sort of a let down. They really didn't do much justice to the light novel with its poor animation and pacing. It seems like the studio outsourced half of the work out. And it's that half that shows the greatest problems in...quality.I still believe the story is great and I will pick up the light novel to continue the story.

It should be noted that CGI while been mediocre across the show ends up been hideous in latter episodes (sadly).Kumo Desu ga, works because the VA pulls out an incredible job doing a one person Manzai with her ""other selves"". This makes her commentary and observations enjoyable to follow throughout the show.It also works when it shows the world from her perspective where she is a cutesy spider, while the rest of the world views her...as a horrible monster freak.The fun part of it is the fact that it\'s a world of Overpowered demons and creatures who continuously gain even more power which is also played out during the fight scenes themselves.

Why? Because this anime is absolutely worth doing so.To put this into perspective I have been a MAL member since 2012, and I have watched hundreds of anime, and at least half of the MAL top 100.If you can not wait to read the entire review, the summary is this:It is one of the best Isekai ever made, and it shares the top 5 and rivals Overlord, Slime and Mushoku Tensei.If anything, it will be an anime you will not regret watching, even if you would not rate it as high with the best.So what is Kumo...Desu ga, Nani ka? It is an isekai. DON'T RUN AWAY YET!!!Why? Because it is one of the rare Isekai gems that is out there in the flood of Isekai we had over the last years.All the characters, especially the MC, are top notch. They all have their own hopes, dreams, desires and above all the willingness to live. They feel... Real. Something that is a rare sight in anime, especially a shounen.Character: 10What is an shounen isekai without RPG elements and action? Don't worry, again Kumo Desu ga shines in this area. Every episode will have at least one entertaining combat event, if not lasting an entire episode. The RPG elements, class and skill systems, are also one of the most indepth I have seen yet. Better than Overlord, and better if not rivalling Slime.It truely is one of its best selling points.Action + RPG elements: 9The story itself is also very good. Its still a shounen, so it won't have the complexity of some other anime, or some deep philosophical meaning and hidden layers. But as Shounen's go, its definitely in the top.The world feels real and harsh and the narrative of survival of the fittest rings strong.Alot of stories, both in anime/movies/books, have loopholes or all the strands do not seem to tie together well. Not a single time have I been able to find these in Kumo desu ga.In fact there have been numeral times I have been set on the wrong foot, could not predict a certain outcome, and be happily surprised when a part of the story got revealed.Story + World: 9Art and Sound might be one of the weaker parts of Kumo desu Ga, but its still good. In fact if you do not mind the occasional CGI, it's on par with slime and overlord.It is definitely not the most beautifull of anime, that praise goes to some special stars and no Shounen or Isekai I can think of, but is the quality of a top studio.Art + Sound: 8Enjoyment. This is absolutely personal, but with all previous things said I can only say my enjoyment is stellar.There are only a few anime that have ever left me with wanting the next episode every time I finish one. I want it to be next week, i want to see more.I went even as far as reading the manga and even part of the LN because I could not wait. Something I have pretty much only done with One Piece. And in my view already putting parts in the same line as One Piece is a compliment by itselfEnjoyment 10My overall score for this anime would be between a 9 and a 10.It is one of the best Isekai ever made, and it shares the top 5 and rivals Overlord, Slime and Mushoku Tensei.If anything, it will be an anime you will not regret watching, even if you would not rate it as high with the best.Overall score: 9.5 Desu ga, Nani ka?

It goes far beyond just being bad or generic. No, it isn’t that, this is worse - this show aims to confuse you, and confuse you a lot, making you scramble to buy the source material in a desperate attempt to make sense of what is going on. Horrible graphics and animation only prove they never had a budget or even a genuine interest to turn this into a decent story...Imagine this anime as a puzzle....Or rather, several boxes of puzzles, all mixed into one pile, with a third of it burned and another third of it shipped to another continent. Have fun trying to piece together a cohesive story from a mangled mess of two protagonists, several timelines divided in both space and time, several changing viewpoints, joined together with an abrupt cut designed to leave you as confused as possible, even resorting in jumping between the same character in two different timelines next to each other in one instance. There is almost zero worldbuilding done in this - or to be more precise, there is worldbuilding, someone just deleted, to force you to pay for an explanation to even the basics, as almost nothing is explained to any meaningful degree. References proving that there was worldbuilding once are usually thrown in a random conversation, but you will easily miss that if you don’t have a context from reading the light novel, and considering how dedicated this anime is to obfuscate even a piece of the basic information you may also miss something that is actually present too. Actually, it is quite shocking how little exposition there can be in the show where the protagonist is almost constantly monologuing.I was repeatedly accused of not paying attention as something was clearly foreshadowed in volume 11 of the novel. But I didn’t read the novel, and the anime adapts events up to volume 4. 4 is before 11, so it can’t be foreshadowing, but … who cares, this anime doesn’t understand the passage of time either, why should anyone else.This is something that makes this anime the worst, it straight away expects you to see the future, be precognitive, psychic, or be at very least able to memorize the events of the novel till its latest chapter, because the anime you are watching is not the anime you are supposed to like. It actually abruptly changes to a very different show, changing the genre from fantasy to sci-fi, without any real explanation, and it expects you to somehow see this through from puzzles.I hate puzzles.This show isn’t even a mystery, it’s a pretentious puzzle where its own narration either straight away lies to you, forgets things, or at least leaves out important bits in order to create a fake sense of mystery. Answers are either not worth waiting for, or are completely absent.And if you think you can watch the show for an eccentric spider talking to herself while killing stuff … Well, think again. She was turned into a side character in her own show, with a generic harem protagonist taking up all the screentime with his idiotic harem drama.If it was about a psycho spider killing people with laser eyes, I would have fun with it. Eight laser eyes out of ten. But it isn’t. It's a barely coherent mess of contradictory information.If you are even remotely interested in the story, read the novel straight away.Or just forget about the show. This show deserves to be forgotten. Author forgot about its own plot powers in her own self-insert character, she forgot what genre she is writing, so why shouldn’t you forget her in turn?

Character Story and Development.There is really not much to say here. Our MC starts weak and get's stronger every single episode through the countless hardships she faces. Her Character, specially once she starts to get strong, is at times hilarious and pretty down to earth, yet interesting as she has a lot of character development. She stops being a scaredy cat and starts aspiring to achieve greater heights. The skills she gets and the ways she uses them are interesting and cool. I guess because we barely have characters with...spider characteristics.What really sucks in my opinion, as someone who reads the Manga, is how they are implementing the very boring side characters (Isekai'd classmates) of our protagonist.Note:Their Story is not too boring or too bad as it is, it's just super bad compared to what we see about Kumoko.Every scene so far was either boring or uneeded and is ultimately making the whole anime a lot worse than it would be otherwise. It took the Manga over 40 chapters (40 pages+) to include the first Isekai'd class mate and here so far around 40% of the story is centered around them. This is heavily disappointing and really destroying the pacing of the story because unlike in the Novel, the implementation simply doesn't work here (Probably why they barely have appeared in the Manga)They also scrapped a lot of interesting and important stuff from the Manga including more stuff about the classmates.I'd give everything around Kumoko a 10/10 and everything so far about the classmates a 6/10.I really hope the next episodes get the balancing around the heroes and kumokos screentime right, since they will likely not scrap them altogether or make them interesting in a way that doesn't over-shadow our Spider-girl.Ultimately the name of the show is Kumo Desu ga, and not Yuusha Desu Ga... spider characteristics.What really sucks in my opinion, as someone who reads the Manga, is how they are implementing the very boring side characters (Isekai'd classmates) of our protagonist.Note:Their Story is not too boring or too bad as it is, it's just super bad compared to what we see about Kumoko.Every scene so far was either boring or uneeded and is ultimately making the whole anime a lot worse than it would be otherwise.

Sadly they decided to just run it into the ground for some reason.What started out great ended more dreadfull than even Animes like Arifureta.Story: This is probably the best part of the Anime. While it does have some of the typical Isekai problems the story itself is rather unique and had the potential to be really fun.Art: One of the big problems. While the Art started out decent, nothing special but decent, it went to complete Crap in the last few Episodes.Sound: The sound is ok. It's nothing you gonna remember for long...but it also doesn't take anything away.Characters: This is where this Anime failed from the start. The characters are mostly bland and don't really add anything.Enjoyment: Now let's talk about why i actually rate this Anime so low. I really liked it at first and as i already said it had the potential to be one of the better isekais out there. HOWEVER i don't know what the f happend during the last 5 or so episodes...Did they run out of money? Did whoever was responsible for this project quit and got replaced by someone so incompetent he wasn't even able to keep up an almost finished project?I have no clue but let me tell you those last few episodes are like a completly different Anime.The Animation never was the best but in those last few episodes it got so bad it sincerely feels like they just didn't give a damn anymore. The story basically came to a complete stop with nothing happening at all. What did happen was a jumbled mess of stereotypes, bad animation and useless character interactions that could have just as well been left out and you would not miss them at all. What could have been one of the most fun series this season ended in a major disappointment.(Disclamer: At the time of writing there is still one episode left but i doubt it will be able to safe the mess this series is in right now)Overall this anime went from a 8 in the first 2/3 to a 4 or even less in the last third which makes me really sad. but it also doesn't take anything away.Characters: This is where this Anime failed from the start.

In the same season, three awful anime series with horrible animation quality started airing. The worst was Ex-Arm, with a CGI animation so bad nobody could actually watch it. There was also Redo of Healer, a very badly animated rape fantasy targeted at incels. And lastly, there was Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?, or “So I'm a Spider, So What?” in Shakespeare’s language, the train wreck of an anime that I’m reviewing today.--- The premiseThis is yet again another “isekai” (or should I say, “shitsekai”), that is to say, an anime where the protagonist is transported to...a parallel world. In that case it’s the whole classroom – teacher included –  that are reincarnated as newborns, and the parallel world is a RPG-like fantasy world featuring elves, demons, monsters, and also tons of video games mechanics. Our protagonist is a girl who is reincarnated as a spider in a cave full of atrocious CGI creatures, and must fight them to survive and get experience, levels and skills. That’s the spider arc. Then you have the generic isekai arc which follows the boring adventures of the rest of the classroom, who got the chance not to be reincarnated as ugly monsters.--- One of the ugliest showsThe spider arc is mostly animated in CGI, and oh boy does the CGI of this anime sucks ass. It is ugly, badly animated, and the movements are very jerky. Most of the spider arc happens in a cave, so the backgrounds you get to see are boring 3D backgrounds that look less detailed than the caves in The Battle for Middle-earth, a real time strategy video game that was released in… 2004. The spider looks very ugly, too. With her human eyes and her spider body, she looks like one of those abominations I used to make in the video game Spore when I was 10. The other CGI monsters look even uglier than the spider, and when these cursed creatures fight it is hard to understand what the heck is happening on the screen.The animation of the generic isekai arc isn’t better. In the first half of the series or so it consists mostly of 2D animation, but as the series progresses there is more and more CGI. Just as in the spider arc, the CGI is very ugly. It is not an overstatement to say that the 3D hentai game Koikatsu Party looks better than the CGI of this anime. Some characters such as Sophia or the demon lord are made out exclusively of CGI, and you often see 2D characters and CGI characters on the same image. CGI is also used for monsters and armies, not just for background crowds. Towards the end of the series CGI is used in all fight scenes, making them look like utter shit. This is supposed to be the climax for god’s sake! Oh and did I also mention that the ground looks uglier than old video games’ textures?The 2D animation is also very bad. Character designs are comparable to those in The Irregular at Magic High School – they are generic and soulless. 2D backgrounds look like they come from a low budget visual novel from the 2000’s. There is little actual animation, and most of the time it is jerky. 2D fight scenes don’t look good and consist for the most part of static images with movement lines. Not only this, but as the series progresses, the animation gets even worse! There are more and more face inconsistencies, with ugly faces and characters’ eyes looking in two different directions. In the second half of the series or so, there are entire scenes with absolutely no goddamn animation. Characters leave or appear on the screen with no actual animation as if it was a shitty PowerPoint presentation! There are some episodes where the animators tried very hard to spare effort by hiding the characters’ mouths when they’re talking, for example by putting a character in front of them, or by showing static images of silent characters.In short, the animation of this show is so ugly it’s near impossible to take the story seriously.--- The most insufferable protagonist ever createdThere are three things that make the spider insufferable. First, as I mentioned earlier, she looks ugly. Second, her voice acting is extremely annoying. Third, she can’t help complaining and yelling all the time with her irritating voice. Since for most of the series she is alone in caves, she is always talking to herself, describing what’s happening to her, reading stats and skills’ description, talking to the AI, making cringe-worthy jokes and references, and so on. And this is what makes her insufferable: she is always talking. When the spider appears on the screen you should have your Paracetamol ready because her high-pitched voice is going to give you a goddamn headache. And if her dialogues aren’t enough to make your ears bleed, do not worry: she also sings the ending song!--- The rest of the cast sucks assThe rest of the cast on the generic isekai arc’s side is a bunch of stereotypical and soulless characters. There are too many of them to remember about and I will not waste my time describing why they suck. In a nutshell: there’s the generic anime main character who is kind, brave and whatnot, and the bad guy who is mean and pretentious. Oh, and the demon lord is a little girl with a cuteness fang, how original. With the former teacher there’s a failed attempt at character development which can be summed up in this: “I wanted my students to like me so I studied video games and light novels”… absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that’s good with these people is that they are less annoying than the spider.--- The story is nonsenseThe first thing that’s wrong in the story is that it follows two arcs – which are actually two different timelines – at the same time, making the show confusing. To my knowledge, it wasn’t the case in the light novel or the manga adaptation.The spider arc is about accumulating experience, leveling up, getting new skills and evolving. It has everything a MMORPG has, including skill points, MP, HP and SP. There’s tons of talk about skills and other video game mechanics, lots of annoying terminology, and walls of text that are unreadable. Video-game skills play a huge role in the story, but they also make the fights unfathomable. Stuff happens on the screen (stuff meaning orgies of bad CGI), that’s all. There’s no real tension because you know that the spider is going to win any fight thanks to some skill she pulled from her ass.The generic isekai arc is about generic isekai stuff. In the beginning of the series the characters are in a generic magic academy where they do nothing relevant to the plot. Then there is a conspiracy and they are forced to leave the academy to fight the demons in atrocious CGI battles.As the series progresses the story gets more random and ridiculous. There is an “administrator” who talks to the spider with a smartphone and gives her overpowered skills, there are elves with mechas, there are clones, there are computers, there is future technology… And in the last episodes, which is supposed to be the climax of the series, we get to see disgusting fight scenes between ugly CGI models and mechas that have nothing to do in a medieval fantasy universe.--- SoundPerhaps the least failed aspect of the show, but it’s still horrible. The quality of the background music ranges from meh to alright. The voice-acting is meh, as the lip-sync is sometimes badly done, and as I said earlier, the spider’s voice is insufferable. The openings and endings are also very bad and skippable.--- VerdictOne of the worst anime series I have seen in my life, both in terms of story / characters and technical value. The only reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because Ex-Arm exists. It is absolutely not enjoyable. Avoid it at all costs, it is not worth your time or the money spent on Paracetamol. a parallel world.

I imagine the criticisms levied against it have more to do with the animation quality than the story being told and the adventures being had.Well, watching a Spider start from the bottom of a cave, dead set on becoming stronger in a world where only strong survive, emerging victorious against powerful monsters through preparation and intelligence, becoming traumatized by the sight of power overwhelming, and spending the rest of the first cour overcoming...that trauma, all to a kickass soundtrack, is, hands down, an unrivaled thrill unseen in any other anime.Now I imagine there are those of you who did not appreciate the Humans aspect of the anime. Understandable. But that part of the show was not intended to bring a thrill, rather, it was to help you, the viewer, understand what the outside world is like, a necessity considering our Spidery protagonist was stuck at the bottom of a cave and unable to present its story for us.

Particularly if the focus is on Kumoko and not on the other reincarnates who were formerly her classmates.The manga adaptation and its spin-off actually went with this route and focused more on Kumoko's solo adventures. I guess production wanted to see some human faces, but who would want these humans who have treated Kumoko so badly in her previous human existence. I certainly wouldn't.The main draw for this story has always been Kumoko, she's the spider in the title after all. She's a spider,...but her character is designed to be cute, with how she consumes her victims, creates the juxtaposition of cute and gore side by side for irony and comedy. The viewer never sees if Kumoko was a cute high schooler but now she's a cute spider with a bestial charm to her.This show features a lot of CGI animation, especially of Kumoko and her cavern environment, but I guess that is how future productions will go now. Especially if it will reduce the sweatshop-like conditions of animators working traditionally.Even if anime takes a story route similar to the manga, it still isn't a perfect show. It's an isekai with game elements, and those status screens can be distracting. However, Kumoko's struggle to overcome her disadvantageous start in a new life, and rise to the top of the food chain of her ecosystem, is a story that deserves this anime adaptation.

It proves how the story is brave enough to separate from the typical isekai stories, by giving a monster perspective of isekai life and a character that doesn't focus on OP power scaling or harem fanservice stuff but more on how they can develop progressive power to fight an enemy that way more powerful than both of them, this what makes me believe that this is one of the most underrated stories this season. so what they give? the stories want to paint a different point of view by focusing on kumoko struggles on living as a small spider girl in a dungeon full of monsters that thousand times bigger and powerful. this anime focusing on character development in every aspect from their personality, humor, and power scaling, she always needs to live in life and death situations to survive her usual day by day.  in other side we meet schalin, the human side that has normal power scaling as everybody else, even tho that he is a prince. everybody said that the story on the human side is boring, I passionately disagree with that, I think the story has many things to value because it brings the background of the story like how their life before, what they value, and what they will face in the future, and they have other monsters like feirune that have interesting character traits dan background. understand that this is not anime that has human OP stuff, but more on the monster that has more OP power stuff. you will feel more attached to the story compares to another isekai story out there.Art: 5/10This is the part that everybody hates, and tbh as a person that not a CGI elite, I feel the disappointment toward the art in this anime is normal, personally from the studio that creating berserk, I don't expect much. even AOT needs to put certain CGI to help fill the gap for the story, so for the anime that just a budget isekai anime, I think they have done it well. the fact that they have 24 episodes to work on, I think is a logical move. but for me, it's not even a  bad CGI, and tbh its makes kumoko way funnier and matches for some reason, so I enjoy it so much. take a note that the drawing on the human side doesn't use CGI and looks good, so don't drop this anime just because of the art, because it will develop more later,  it deserves your try.Sound: 8/10The sound for kumoko is great and well-voiced, I can't believe that Aoi Yuuki has this witty and humorous side of voice. his voice makes the character so interesting to watch, how his reaction toward a certain condition is just pure gold, it fits so much, and I can't believe that I simp for spider because of it. you will not disappoint by kumoko voice 100%, for other characters it's mediocre. for the background music and ending theme (really important) is fun to hear because it delivers a certain vibe that fits kumoko personality, like a genuine fun vibe. even in a stressful condition, I still can feel that the sound gives such a vibe.character : 9/10Kumoko kumoko kumoko, I think I need to keep repeating the name for you to remember that Kumoko is the best character for this series and really what makes this series so enjoyable, from his past, his hobby, his progress, his wittiness, his humor, his reaction, everything about her is well round a perfect example of a likable character that deserve your emotion and attention, such an underrated character for this season. kumoko has this realistic reaction toward his situation, and somehow has this relatable story that pumps your curiosity on her. it's fun to see kumoko try to grow as a strong likable spider from a girl that closing himself from the real world. for other characters that really interest me a lot is feirune, the other monster that lives in the human side with schlain, because she has the background that relates toward kumoko. from someone that has a bad villain's side to a dragon that feels sorry for his past action and tries to grow himself as a better person, for another character is forgettable.enjoyable: 8/10Kumo desu ga nani ka? really brings new hope for me to watch the isekai genre again, because of how boring isekai anime nowdays. it's just your typical OP mc with harem fanservice stuff, yack. this is the anime that I seek for a long time, the anime that wanting to deliver another perspective in an isekai world. what if you become a monster, what if you are weak, what if you are alone, what if you die. this is a type of thing that spices the isekai genre, not just some deus ex machina and plot armor stuff. and it gets more interesting for now because of how the story paints the enemy as something that so powerful, in contrast with the good guys that just NPC power scaling.so this for me I just want to say don't sleep on this anime, it deserves your attention. it will not disappoint you even you dislike the art of anything. you will love it Story: 7/10The story follows the life of kumoko (the spider girl) and schlain (The human side), at first the fact that this anime has 2 focus characters is already gives a new value to the isekai genre. It proves how the story is brave enough to separate from the typical isekai stories, by giving a monster perspective of isekai life and a character that doesn't focus on OP power scaling or harem fanservice stuff but more on how they can develop progressive power to fight an enemy that way more powerful than both of them, this what makes me believe that this is one of the most underrated stories this season. so what they give? the stories want to paint a different point of view by focusing on kumoko struggles on living as a small spider girl in a dungeon full of monsters that thousand times bigger and powerful. this anime focusing on character development in every aspect from their personality, humor, and power scaling, she always needs to live in life and death situations to survive her usual day by day.  in other side we meet schalin, the human side that has normal power scaling as everybody else, even tho that he is a prince. everybody said that the story on the human side is boring, I passionately disagree with that, I think the story has many things to value because it brings the background of the story like how their life before, what they value, and what they will face in the future, and they have other monsters like feirune that have interesting character traits dan background. understand that this is not anime that has human OP stuff, but more on the monster that has more OP power stuff. you will feel more attached to the story compares to another isekai story out there.Art: 5/10This is the part that everybody hates, and tbh as a person that not a CGI elite, I feel the disappointment toward the art in this anime is normal, personally from the studio that creating berserk, I don't expect much. even AOT needs to put certain CGI to help fill the gap for the story, so for the anime that just a budget isekai anime, I think they have done it well. the fact that they have 24 episodes to work on, I think is a logical move. but for me, it's not even a  bad CGI, and tbh its makes kumoko way funnier and matches for some reason, so I enjoy it so much. take a note that the drawing on the human side doesn't use CGI and looks good, so don't drop this anime just because of the art, because it will develop more later,  it deserves your try.Sound: 8/10The sound for kumoko is great and well-voiced, I can't believe that Aoi Yuuki has this witty and humorous side of voice. his voice makes the character so interesting to watch, how his reaction toward a certain condition is just pure gold, it fits so much, and I can't believe that I simp for spider because of it. you will not disappoint by kumoko voice 100%, for other characters it's mediocre. for the background music and ending theme (really important) is fun to hear because it delivers a certain vibe that fits kumoko personality, like a genuine fun vibe. even in a stressful condition, I still can feel that the sound gives such a vibe.character : 9/10Kumoko kumoko kumoko, I think I need to keep repeating the name for you to remember that Kumoko is the best character for this series and really what makes this series so enjoyable, from his past, his hobby, his progress, his wittiness, his humor, his reaction, everything about her is well round a perfect example of a likable character that deserve your emotion and attention, such an underrated character for this season. kumoko has this realistic reaction toward his situation, and somehow has this relatable story that pumps your curiosity on her. it's fun to see kumoko try to grow as a strong likable spider from a girl that closing himself from the real world. for other characters that really interest me a lot is feirune, the other monster that lives in the human side with schlain, because she has the background that relates toward kumoko. from someone that has a bad villain's side to a dragon that feels sorry for his past action and tries to grow himself as a better person, for another character is forgettable.enjoyable: 8/10Kumo desu ga nani ka?

', ""I very much so am enjoying the anime, and was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't exactly the same as the manga, which excluded the human side of things. Now, I know that people are complaining about the human bit, but I'd say it adds a lot to the story and puts a lot of things into context compared to the manga, which was confusing in terms of story at times due to the lack of the human side of things. It also keeps it fresh for us manga readers, though I do believe the LN includes the human parts, which the anime is...based off of a bit more.I'd say the story is a solid 8, it's interesting, and while confusing at times it gets context around it pretty quickly for the most part, and you quickly begin to figure out why the two storylines feel different from each other. And there is also some pretty interesting twists, which still makes the human story interesting.The characters is something I'm putting at 10, though Kumoko is what's carrying this so hard. The human characters are interesting at times but for the most part average, while Kumoko is Kumoko and her personality makes the spider side of things entertaining, along with the views of what she looks like from the other side of things.I'm putting sound at 9, as it isn't bad, and I feel like it's pretty good, but I'm not a music professional so I can't give any in depth explanations.Putting enjoyment at 10, as it's one of my favorite manga and I'm enjoying the anime a lot as well, it can be a little rough at times but it's still enjoyable nonetheless, and I don't feel like anything really takes away from the enjoyment.As for art, I'd say 7 or 8, for what it is it's good, nothing special maybe but it isn't bad either. I was a bit put off at first, which is why I took a while to watch it, (Literally binge watched the entire thing today.) but it exceeded my expectations, after the first few episodes at least. So basically, it's not the best, but it's good enough for me, and I'd say the rest of the story and the fact that two different art styles are in here (2d and 3d) is enough for me to put it somewhat high.Overall, I'm giving this a 9 or 10, as it's just very enjoyable to watch, and it holds a special place in my heart in general. I also feel like, for what it is, it's pretty well executed. I feel like it may have been a bit better if it wasn't CGI, but there is times where the CGI performs well and results in some pretty good looking fights and scenes. based off of a bit more.I'd say the story is a solid 8, it's interesting, and while confusing at times it gets context around it pretty quickly for the most part, and you quickly begin to figure out why the two storylines feel different from each other.

Sure, many of the stories told are rehashes of the same thing, but I thoroughly enjoy them, and I enjoy the video-gamey ness of the worlds in how they interact with their magic/skill systems and with otaku becoming powerful as hell. I\'m not saying that this genre is deep when it comes to a writing sense, but I am saying that regardless of the means and the small/menial differences between each series as a...whole, I thoroughly still enjoy them, and there\'s no problem with that.That being said, ""Kumo desu ga, Nani ka?"", or Kumoko, is absolutely a blast for someone who thoroughly enjoys the isekai genre. I can\'t pretend to recommend this more to anyone that is really big into these anime/videogame style worlds with overpowered main characters. In fact, overpowered main character is also one of my favorite genres, too.Art: 7/10 CGI: 2/10The biggest downfall of this series as an anime is the overuse of CGI, where I can tell the budget was heavily straining towards the end few episodes. Without going too much into detail, in the beginning half of episodes, the CGI is slightly bearable for me. Mostly used on animal-like creatures with potentially complex movement animations, let alone magical casting animations and effects. I can justify the use here, because this is a longer running anime series being 2-cour with high fantasy expectations. Where it gets really grossly overabundant is in the sword fights with playdough like models swinging with the same animations at 15fps toward the latter half of the episodes. Quite a cinema sin for me, but the story carries well through intent. I was still thoroughly invested in learning the fates of the characters despite the major infraction that the animation quality was for me at the end.Story: 10/10Not gonna sugarcoat it, the subversions of the isekai genre that this series attempts to take are fresh and nuanced for me, as someone who has watched/read way too many isekai. If you\'re an isekai fan, you\'re genuinely love this series. If you\'re not an isekai fan, and you\'re still watching this and expecting more out of isekai, dude, you have a problem. I\'ve seen a couple other reviews have high criticisms of the comedy/action fusion that this series attempts, but I personally see it as something hilarious that falls completely in line with several isekai tropes. Also, Kumoko is hilarious! I was genuinely laughing at the gags thrown at me, which can easily fall flat in a series that attempts to take itself semi-seriously in the same vein. The writing of Kumoko\'s character seriously justifies her use of sarcasm/comedy to handle the situations she\'s presented with, so I can totally justify why she is the lovable sarcastic way she is.Overall: 9/10Lastly, as a creative-type person, I have to say I completely enjoyed this series, and I am about to pick up the light novel and read it from the beginning. I am a Dungeon Master in a campaign with friends, and this series has inspired me to no ends on themes to tackle for my campaign, and the fact that I\'m sitting here oozing creative prowess is a testament to my enjoyment of Kumoko.Where it genuinely falls off for me is the CGI, but that\'s by no means a real reason to stop loving this series as much as I do. I\'m sure this is executed much better in the Novel/Manga.I highly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves fans of the isekai genre. It\'s one of the best ones in the genre, and one I would absolutely recommend you don\'t miss out on! whole, I thoroughly still enjoy them, and there\'s no problem with that.That being said, ""Kumo desu ga, Nani ka?"", or Kumoko, is absolutely a blast for someone who thoroughly enjoys the isekai genre.

It\'s one of the best ones in the genre, and one I would absolutely recommend you don\'t miss out on!', 'Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka is at the time of writing this my single least favourite TV anime out of 315. I don\'t think this show had a single redeeming quality apart from the openings which were both pretty good. Aside from that I absolutely hated every other aspect, I genuinely can\'t think of one single thing that brought me any enjoyment in this show apart from one of the character\'s designs??? If that even counts??? I\'ll get into specifics but before I do please do not watch this show you will be bored out of your mind and regret every minute of it.Firstly the...story, I will try not to spoil too much (not that it matters anyway) but for the first 13 episodes (that\'s more than half the entire anime) the plot is ENTIRELY absent, every ep is an exact carbon copy of the last - spider finds big ugly CGI monster, spider kills it against all the odds, spider levels up, maybe there is some stuff with the human timeline sprinkled inbetween but that doesn\'t matter because who cares, the show certainly doesn\'t make you. That\'s it. For 13 episodes. This all takes place in an incredibly dark and claustrophobic cave too, which certainly doesn\'t make it any easier to sit through.The ""plot"" after this skips around so many timelines and flashbacks that frankly I was entirely lost, I don\'t think I can recall a single event because my brain was so switched off because NOTHING happened for OVER HALF of the show\'s runtime prior to this. There is one moment I remember feeling interested in but it\'s shown in a few minute long flashforward in episode 9 and they seemingly forgot about it afterwards until nearer the end. This is the only time I can ever recall being into this show. They also skip over seemingly very important details in the plot, without spoiling I remember there was a fight that should have been pretty pivotal to the plot but it was entirely skipped over????? For what reason????????? It\'s so annoying because the plot seemed at least promising in this show that has absolutely nothing else going for it, but they explain it so poorly and entirely omit it for over half of the shows runtime which completely removes any interest you could have had in it.The art and animation in this show might be some of the worst I have ever seen in an anime. This anime is done by the same studio as Berserk 2016 (go figure) but they managed to screw it up even more which is certainly an achievement. First of all the CGI, my god it\'s the worst I\'ve EVER seen in an anime. It it just so horrendous and ugly, there are some scenes nearer the end that LITERALLY LOOK LIKE A PS2 CUTSCENE THIS IS NOT A JOKE! It\'s just laughable. There isn\'t one bit of even decent CGI, and like I mentioned earlier the first 13 eps feature it constantly and it\'s just such an eye sore.The art itself is absolutely nothing remarkable, it\'s about as generic as it gets. And my god the 2D animation is horrible too. Characters often slide into frame instead of properly walking which is so jarring, and I can\'t think of one moment in the show where I thought ""hey this is a cool fight scene"" because there were none. I really have nothing good to say about it, I\'m racking my brain trying to find something but I just can\'t.The sound isn\'t worth mentioning, I don\'t remember any of the OSTs. I did as I mentioned like the openings they were pretty good, but my god did I despise the EDs they were horrific.Oh boy the characters, I don\'t think I\'ve seen a show with worse characters maybe ever. I\'ll start with the main protagonist, who is probably my single least favourite character in all of anime, at the very least she is by far the one I found the most annoying. God bless the voice actress this is absolutely nothing against her, but god there wasn\'t a single moment where I could stand the main character\'s voice. It was just so obnoxiously loud and annoying, the over-the-top voice acting is painful to listen to and I absolutely hated all the stupid visual gags that I\'m sure were the show\'s attempt at ""humour"" but all they made me do was cringe incessantly. The spider itself is just so damn ugly, how people found her cute is completely beyond me. I don\'t wanna say much more because again I don\'t want to disrespect the poor voice actress\' work.The other characters in the show are about as bland as I\'ve ever seen, I can only remember two of their names this is not a joke. None of them stand out even SLIGHTLY they have no traits they are so boring they don\'t do anything of any note whatsoever they all have pretty generic designs minus a couple which were at least sort of cool. I have nothing else to say because frankly I can\'t remember anything else about them.Overall Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka is an absolutely abhorrent piece of ""media"" if you can even call it that, it fails in every aspect catastrophically and has absolutely 0 redeeming qualities. It easily takes the place as my #1 least favourite of all time, overtaking The God of Highschool, a show I didn\'t think could be dethroned but that AT LEAST had good animation if nothing else???? SO disappointed with this show, the fact that people seem to have enjoyed it baffles me like no other thing, I am so glad it\'s over. story, I will try not to spoil too much (not that it matters anyway) but for the first 13 episodes (that\'s more than half the entire anime) the plot is ENTIRELY absent, every ep is an exact carbon copy of the last - spider finds big ugly CGI monster, spider kills it against all the odds, spider levels up, maybe there is some stuff with the human timeline sprinkled inbetween but that doesn\'t matter because who cares, the show certainly doesn\'t make you.

SO disappointed with this show, the fact that people seem to have enjoyed it baffles me like no other thing, I am so glad it\'s over.', ""This show is really good when it comes to spider and then, when it suddenly switches to human side, you are kind of disappointed as the humans' story is not engaging as that of spider's. But, as time goes on, you start to get invested in humans' side of the story as well.It basically starts as a survival horror as the spider who is a reincarnated girl from earth, tries to survive by fighting various monsters inside the cave. She does whatever she wants and struggles to eat and live. As she survives each encounter with different beast, she levels up gains new abilities...and eventually kills her own mother, who is a gigantic spider, and get OP as hell. It is so satisfying to watch her leveling up, surviving, fighting different enemies, eating food in her perspective as a spider. I hate spiders IRL but the anime made her cute and especially her inner monologue and VA were fantastic to watch. Its a constant dopamine hit.At half way point, we realize that, the story is little more complicated than it actually is. It is split up in two timelines - human side story take place several years ahead of the spider's counterpart. I don't understand how people hate this non-linear approach to the story. For me, personally, this made the story much more engaging to watch, because, now I had to constantly be aware of not only what is happening, but also when it is happening as well.I would say that main negative of this anime is the CG, which was not bad at start but then it becomes really horrible toward the end of the show. Especially, in one of episodes at the end, we can clearly see that CG was mixed in with hand drawn frames, which made it even more terrible. Music and sound design was alright, overall. If they fixed all these negatives, I would give this anime 10/10, but seeing that it is not, I can definitely give it 9/10 for the enjoyment it provided me. I am excited and hopeful, that we would get a next season soon, and that, it gets better animation as well. and eventually kills her own mother, who is a gigantic spider, and get OP as hell.

This is where the story although interesting, becomes extremely boring for what it was worth. Not because the human\'s side of the story is lack of any work, but throughout the majority of the times they\'re on screen, it\'s normally a good 4 - 8 minute span of pure discussion....

In the first episodes I didn't notice the different timeline it tells in 1 episode, but...after watching it for a bit, it seems to force you to understand that it has different timeline told when the mc Kumoko is a spider. For example, when Julius was killed, I'm guessing that white girl that kills Julius is transformed Kumoko, and you get the point, it made me lost for a quite bit maybe because I'm dumb, but when I realize it it was quite interesting story, not some typical reincarnation shit.In any case, in my opinion, the story are great, but the anime adaptation are bad at least for me.

Characters (who weren't previously) were turned into 3D CG monstrosities for the sake of battle scenes which were tedious, unnecessarily drawn out and just plain uninteresting, the production team then got lazy with all other characters who remained 2D (there was a scene where a character just VANISHED). Honestly, the last few episodes just seemed to...be full of glitches and were sloppily done. An anime that I had fully enjoyed to begin with became one I was suffering through because I only had a few episodes to go.

The anime is blending past and future events together into a bit of a mess. In the novel, there is a reason most of Kumoko's story is told before introducing the other reincarnations, but sadly that is not what's done here. Don't get me wrong, I love the anime, I just wish they did things a bit different. They also like to make the audience think the demon lord (Ariel) is Kumoko in the first half of the show, until the 2nd opening when it's...made clear as day she isn't.Putting aside how they decided to mesh storylines that take place in 15 year different timespans, the storylines themselves are great, lots of characters with different motives and goals, as well as a clear divide in mindset between the reincarnations, some want peaceful lives, where as others want to live this new life to the fullest, and fulfilling their desires by recognizing that it's not Japan anymore, not just one or the other like in other reincarnations stories.Overall a pretty nice anime thus far, might be a bit confusing for those who haven't read the novel, but for those who have everything will make sense, so as one who has, I give this a good rating. made clear as day she isn't.Putting aside how they decided to mesh storylines that take place in 15 year different timespans, the storylines themselves are great, lots of characters with different motives and goals, as well as a clear divide in mindset between the reincarnations, some want peaceful lives, where as others want to live this new life to the fullest, and fulfilling their desires by recognizing that it's not Japan anymore, not just one or the other like in other reincarnations stories.Overall a pretty nice anime thus far, might be a bit confusing for those who haven't read the novel, but for those who have everything will make sense, so as one who has, I give this a good rating."", ""When I found out an anime was coming about a spider I immediately decided I'd watch it.

Annoying charactersYou can tell me that it was for the comedy all you want, but the spider (MC) was definitely annoying. Period. I got used to it at some point but she was still annoying, and still so dumb and even hypocrite in some situations. She literally killed a noble in the house of another noble of another country, so a war started between the 2 nations. Like shit, couldn\'t you think a bit before doing that at least?

The progression is addicting. The narrative is well thought out. Plus the main is pretty entertaining (though a bit of an acquired taste). But all of that is squandered by a studio that bit-off way more than it could chew.I won’t sugarcoat it, the fight animation is some of the worst I have ever seen. Keep in mind that I have watched almost 100 days of anime. I would rather watch the fights in Ex-Arm over the worst fights in this anime. Granted, not all of the fights are THAT bad (most of the ones featuring the spider girl Kumoko are...coherent), but a lot of ones with the human characters are really THAT bad.The CGI animation on the monsters is atrocious. Sure, you get used to it after watching many episodes, but it doesn’t change the fact that they look awful from episode 1.

It doesn’t help that the sound design is also awful for the human fights, so now we have nothing to help us process the clusterfuck of images thrown together pretending to be a fight.But, I never dropped this anime despite the animation. That’s thanks to the world and progression system.This anime taps into the rewarding nature of RPGs very well (given that it essentially is one). Watching Kumoko (the spider girl & MC) grow and evolve is addicting because she is almost always leveling up and/or evolving in an episode, constantly keeping you hooked with what new skills or new forms she will get next episode.The world is also much more interesting than I had anticipated. There are monster hierarchies, prophecies, and a meta aspect that makes up for the absolutely dull side story with the human isekais. While I feel that people are overhating the human side of the narrative, boy I would be damned if it didn’t have all the worst parts of this anime. The characters aren’t very interesting and it takes FOREVER for it to even connect to the Kumoko side of the story, making it feel like a waste of time for many episodes.Would I recommend this anime? Not if you read manga or light novels. All of the good aspects seem to come from the source material, so just read that if it’s your thing. If you are an anime-only, then maybe???

It was nice figuring out the entire story over time, as we kept getting hints at what was really happening. The biggest issue with the show is definitely the animation quality, specifically with monster models. I didn't mind it that much except for a few of the earlier fights, but nonetheless it was signfiicantly offputting. Furthermore, I did enjoy watching the MC, and I know a lot of people got a bit pestered by having to watch the human characters who were a bit less interesting...that the one-girl-army. I'm sure that if people didn't like the MC though, they wouldn't like most of the show. I liked her though, and the anime wasn't long enough and focused too much on her for her personality and bits to get annoying. It was a good watch, and I would definitely be down for a season 2 if it came out. Just don't show me those horrible frog and monkey models again. that the one-girl-army.

Is an anime I never thought I'd get into it, and now I like it so much that as the final episode about to air hours from now I really don't want it to end😭.Alright so, Plot: On a norms I give any other isekai a 5 in plot cause that's like the primary purpose of what the entire thing Is about. Some have escaped this 5 as the story gets more interesting and deeper, this too...has a good story going on, and the execution of it was just good, this is what I wanted Arifureta to be so bad. And I love the interesting part bits set for MC and other characters. Story for me is a 7/10Art: The animation is decent, watchable at least but damn that awful CGI, so poor, the fight scenes are the worst parts of the entire thing, sadly this turned a lot of people away from this and it's just unfair. No matter how much I enjoyed this, the Art remains a 3/10 for me.Sound: the music is a masterpiece, The 2nd cour opening and ending tracks are bops! I have never skipped them since they started, I find myself bopping along with it gosh! I love the soundtrack, and I love the voice actors, love love love Seiyuu for Kumuko, the voice acting was spot on. Any ways, sound is a 10/10.Character: The characters are great, Wakaba is my favourite, she's one of the most interesting MC I've seen in a while, the others too are decent, but Kumoko carried the entire show for me, character development She got it too. The Hero guy was annoying but he was still enjoyable to watch. Characters For me is a 10/10.Enjoyment: 10/10.

Pleaseeeeeeee"", 'You know what, despite all the bemoaning I have for the last few episodes (or really the last quarter of the show) I still find this super enjoyable. The first half was really enjoyable and I can’t lie that a lot of the enjoyment is derived from our fantastic and extremely entertaining Kumoko (our endearing nickname for the mc).Some foreknowledge, the human side is very bland and rather uninteresting, no doubt on my part and I think many would be inclined to agree. It’s almost negligible so I’ll just ignore that and review what I came here for, and that’s the spider side of the...story. Also this is a completely anime only review - I haven’t touched neither manga or light novel but I very well may just pick up the latter.Honestly it was a breath of fresh, rejuvenating air in the cesspool of power-fantasy isekai that we see all too often. Here, us viewers work with Kumoko quite literally from the ground up - underground for that matter. Don’t expect a quick first episode for the mc to get magically souped up and get a harem by the third episode; I find it really captivating to grow with our mc and see her and her super self-aware personality, to struggle and make it through the myriad challenges she faces.Admittedly, the show dipped in quality near the later half of the season; frankly speaking, the cross between 2D and cgi was rather glaring and wasn’t the most seamless of attempts. Simply, the fights could have been done a lot more tastefully. However, the story and the fantastic mc carry the anime, and I’d like to argue that that’s what a lot of us come here for. If you want mindless action, go watch something else.Despite the studio takinv just only a week longer, they managed to come up with a satisfying finale. It was a good tie-up and helped to clear the haze the show was bogged with, what with the human side of the story stealing focus from the real story. You could argue that because I’ve missed it for 2 weeks and the previous episodes were far below average in quality, something decent would seem a lot better but I disagree. It was a genuinely enjoyable last episode, if only for Kumoko’s reappearance and surprisingly decent animation.tl;drI really enjoyed this, and I think you should give it a try - a few episodes wouldn’t hurt. However, look away if you’re expecting fantastic animation all the time the likes of the Fate Series or Demon Slayer… or hate spiders (which I do but they’ve somehow made Kumoko cute; shortening of legs and lack of hair) We came for the odd title, we stayed for our spider waifu, hooking plot and the intricate but well thought out skill system that other isekais lack more often than not. Solid 8.5/10 story.

Solid 8.5/10', 'Looking past the CGI, what lies beneath is an endearing story of a reincarnated person as a spider in a world full of plots and schemes. And honestly, all the plotting and scheming part is the worst part of the story. But we\'re getting ahead of ourselves. Let\'s start from the most important factor for manyART: 4/10Art and animation-wise, it\'s decent. Passable.Has that overly saturated isekai color palette which I find obnoxious but hey the character designs are pretty good. Honestly, One Punch Man season 2 had better animation with the fights. Many dramatic scenes had me laughing at how awkwardly they were animated....So many awkward zoom-ins on low-resolution drawings and re-used scenes. poorly tracked still drawings on CGI dragons. But somehow, the quality added to my enjoyment. I laughed my ass off as I was pulled out of the dramatic tension of scenes with the janky animation and if you can get over it you\'ll enjoy it more.STORY:8/10Story-wise I believe this is what Slime isekai could\'ve been. We spend most of our time with our protagonist as she explores the cgi labyrinth as she discovers how dangerous this world is and how she can survive and grow stronger. Compare that to Slime Tensei where after a couple episodes he\'s already left the cave and begins on world peace. The story here isn\'t something to marvel at, at times it becomes painstakingly boring as it switches to our protagonist\'s other classmates who also got reincarnated. I just wanted to skip it all and go back to our energetic spider protagonist. But yeah, the parts with our protagonist are always a blast and feel satisfying. Every time we think she has the upper hand in a fight the enemy always has a trick up their sleeves. A great example would be in one of the later fights with her and the mother spider. When Kumoko thinks she\'s got mother cornered, she rushes in without thinking and ends up getting trapped by her webs. We had the assumption that just because her stats were half of what they were that she wouldn\'t prepare a counterattack and I think that\'s what makes the parts with our protagonist great. She is constantly challenged both physically and mentally. She experiences trauma and has to cope with it and use that fear to get stronger. Just like another popular web-slinging arachnid hero, no matter how many times she\'s beaten. She keeps getting up.SOUND: 5/10While the Openings and ending themes are great. I also put into consideration the sound design. Some scenes just don\'t have the right feel due to the sound effects used/CHARACTER: 6/10I rated the story 8/0 for the parts with Kumoko, and with the characters I rated it 6/10 cause I couldn\'t care less for all the other cast. When the elf sensei started talking about her past I literally lowered the volume and opened up discord to pass time until she was done with her monologue. All the other characters just aren\'t interesting. They can be but with how well developed our protagonist is. Everyone just pales in comparison. There\'s never a dull moment with our protagonist while when we switch to the others I just wanna die of how boring they are. There\'s so much possible stories they could\'ve told with the whole reincarnation part to make their characters more interesting. They could\'ve made Shun feel imposter syndrome due to the high amount of pressure and responsibility put on he as he is given the title of hero. Or maybe the red hair genderbent girl. They could\'ve made things interesting with her questioning his/her gender and sexuality. Sure it could be controversial but I think it\'d be interesting and maybe even comedic to ask questions like ""Is it gay if I got reincarnated as a girl with the mind of a dude?"". That\'d make them more interesting characters and make them feels real-er in my opinion as in this case, they\'d be reacting to their own circumstances brought by their reincarnation. What about Fei? Sure she feels guilty and thinks this is her punishment for treating our protagonist poorly but couldn\'t we get more characterization than that? I\'d be freaking the fuck out if I suddenly became a dragon. It\'s just disappointing seeing such interesting prompts for characterization not used that much. Everyone just falls down to generic tropes and cliche isekai characters.Enjoyment: 7/10I might\'ve shit on the characters but eh I did enjoy my time. Even if I found a lot of mistakes. Past the weak side characters and animation issues. I enjoyed my time.So overall: 8/10If u looking for a good isekai that\'s more interesting than others then give this a shot.

It\'s lighthearted and easy to smile at as getting reincarnated as a spider is not something we\'ve seen before. There are many good things that stand out such as the fact they come to terms with weakness and a spider\'s cannibalistic tendencies. It\'s a comfortably realistic anime.But as much as I like how they also expand the range by focusing on the others who got reincarnated and how they interact, (probs to the writer, they did a good job expanding the isekai range) the problem arises from the...fact I am simply not interested. It\'s because the MC\'s story was so well written, the rest pale in comparison. Sure, they have the hero, the awesome skills, the ""defeat demon lord so the world is at peace"" storyline, it simply anti-climatic in comparison. At first, it was put in at good doses but it\'s become tedious and the pacing became slow. Honestly, you can skip episode 21 and still understand the storyline.Eh... it evens out as an okay, fun to watch, probably a one time never rewatch thing. fact I am simply not interested.

I didn't think it was possible in 2020, but that was as bad as some of Naruto scenes. The studio couldn't decide if they wanted 2D or 3D and started a really weird mix that looks terrible.The fights scenes are so absolutely terrible it becomes hard to watch.And if you have survived for a few episodes, you'll quickly realize there are a lot of those.I guess the story itself, albeit hard to follow, saves the day and makes it a 6, but any remotely decent studio would have done it better. "", 'Ever play Halo 2? Do you remember how it would switch sides and show the arbiters and master chiefs journey? Well this is it but in an anime form.(and a bit different here and there)Story: I really like the direction they took and how they portrayed it. I like the switching back and forth between both sides so see how they\'re doing and advancing. I would of liked more of the current time though but I still like it. 10/10Art: I liked the normal drawing part but the cgi was a little off putting. I don\'t know why they had to make Sophia cgi when...the person next to her wasn\'t and he was hand drawn but eh. cgi dragged it down for me :/. 7/10Sound:  I always say it\'s hard to mess up on sound and I still stand by that. Oh cool the swords make sword noises the water sounds like running water and the fire sounds like something sizzling yep that\'s sound. 10/10Character: Kumo. Yes very yes. I like how she changes from loud and outgoing when she\'s alone but right when you put her in front of people she is reduced to nods and whispers. The bad side about this is the other sides characters the ""hero"" that side is rough. I just didn\'t really feel to bad when things go down with them. They\'re all rather dull. 7/10Enjoyment: If you like isekai you\'re going to like this. idk I liked it so that means I enjoyed it. 9/10Overall: ta da 8/10...

I thought it's just another shitty isekai with boring and emotionally numb characters and have no development nor actual story. But surprisingly it's not. The show focuses not only at the main character, but also the side characters and damn they actually have an actual personalities unlike some other isekais where every side characters are just brainless people that exist only to show the main character's greatness. The story..well, in the beginning it's actually really mainstream where the main character got some game-like abilities, leveling up, getting skills (Actually this is the only part that disappointing for me because...how often these game interfaces are used in isekais) But at the show goes on the story is actually pretty interesting, We got to see Kumoko's side and the other reincarnators' side that isn't boring because it actually have progresses and hint to the stories. Every episodes just make you more curious to what is actually going on here, unlike other isekais that only purpose is to help some random girls in the street and making them as part of the harem, this show is just... Different.

The magic school kids ares SOOO boring that i literally fastforward through thier parts in every...episode except finally for episode 19(this is the only anime i've ever done that with).    thats 19 episodes of boring trash.Imagine the generic boring cliche characters from goblin slayer,   now give them exclusive episode time for like half the episode.    Thats how the this show is.    The only reason you dont hate them in goblin slayer is that they interact directly with the MC.  so they are a foil for his character.   Im not sure what the director of spider isekai was thinking when they split the episodes and told both stories in parallel like they did.What they should have done was tell kumokos story until episode 7 or 8 then introduce the magic school kids  around the point they are in episode 12 or some,    then delve into the back story later on when you know who they are and understand WHY they are important to the story.How they did do it was have this robin williams sized personality character,   then cut to characters with the personality of styrofoam for half the episode,  completely ruining any momentum the story was trying to build.    what you got was basically a 10 minute episode that was good and a nearly unwatchable 10 minute episode of the worst filler arc by  a writer who's given up on life.And kumoko's side of the story isnt without fault either.     her constant txt walls of powerups for instance is almost nausea inducing.   as someone whos watched anime for like 20+ years now,  im brain is trained to read everything on the screen,  so when the text walls(which happen A LOT) get thrown up,  i try to read it,  but its basically meaningless rpg powerups.kumoko's constant talking to herself gets really annoying at times.    for instance,  rimiru from slime isekai talks to himself quite a bit,   but the difference is that his monologues are broken up with narration by rimiru.   Kumoko has none of that,   she literally talking non stop for entire episodes.     I guess the author has never heard of the concept of show dont tell.also kumoko's constant fighting and leveling up JUST as shes about to die happens WAY too often.   like every fight it happens. really.     she just happens to level up at the exact moment shes going to  die every single time?      I'd rather she outsmart an opponent then rely on plot armor thicker then narutos.and fighting,  man,   kumoko is literally fighitng battle after battle for 11 or 12 episodes.   We get it,   have you ever heard of pacing man.Thankfully by about episode 13  the world opens up and the story improves by A LOT.And by improve i mean it becomes a 7/10 story.  maybe a 7.5/10 story.   but for the first 10 episodes at least this show is definitely no more then a 5/10.so if you dont know if you want to watch this,   definitely give it a watch,   but know that you are going to have to slog through the first 10-12 episodes of poorly paced and boring episodes before you get to the good stuff. episode except finally for episode 19(this is the only anime i've ever done that with).    thats 19 episodes of boring trash.Imagine the generic boring cliche characters from goblin slayer,   now give them exclusive episode time for like half the episode.

We get it,   have you ever heard of pacing man.Thankfully by about episode 13  the world opens up and the story improves by A LOT.And by improve i mean it becomes a 7/10 story.  maybe a 7.5/10 story.   but for the first 10 episodes at least this show is definitely no more then a 5/10.so if you dont know if you want to watch this,   definitely give it a watch,   but know that you are going to have to slog through the first 10-12 episodes of poorly paced and boring episodes before you get to the good stuff."", ""I was so confused with the timeline. I only realized that the spider's story throughout the anime was just completely a flashback at the end of the anime. I feel so dumb right now.Overall, it was really enjoyable. The main character was very fun to watch since she had many emotional yet hilarious moments. One thing I didn't really like was how they incorporated ex-arm-like 3D drawings into the anime, making the art look a bit sloppy.I'd give it a 9 if it weren't for the art :)and don't get angry at me just because I'm criticizing the art. "", ""Ok, so let me start by saying that I watched only 4 episodes by the time I decided I couldn't wait for more content...so I read the manga up to the point where the translators stopped. I was convinced that the story was a masterpiece, and couldn't get enough of it.I watched over 800 anime series at this point, and this is my first ever review. The reason I wanted to talk about this anime is that it has a huge shortcoming in the animation department, and I want to address it. The action scenes are choppy, sounds that should be there are missing...(such as sword clashes and arrows landing), and the 3D models are trash. All that said, the character design is top tier, and the manga is a must read when it's finished. I simply stomached the bad animation quality because the series had so much else to offer.If you are new and are reading reviews first before watching the show. Please give this one a shot. If you can look past the terrible work of studio Millepensee, you will be rewarded with one of the best isekai anime out there.PS: If there will be a second season, please choose a different studio.

I know many people dont like CGI, and it might not be picture perfect at times it really isnt that bad and you get used to it. It doesnt diminish the story of the episode.However, at some point they weave in the Humans and those characters are flat and boring. They also mess-up the timeline and story. Introduction bits for background info was fine at some point, but they should have kept it at that.Really good anime that could be worth...10/10 if it wasnt for all those human eps near the end. If you binge watch it you could consider skipping them.A season 2 would be very interesting as there is lots of story to develop further. 10/10 if it wasnt for all those human eps near the end.

There are ones that are so bad they amaze you. There are ones that are so bad they make you laugh. This one, however, is so bad that felt apologetic. Let this show be by no means a representation of the source material. I feel like this series is a crime to whoever created the story and my deepest, deepest condolences to the author who lives on knowing that their child was massacred in the most brutal, inhumane method known to man: Millepensee. Come, lets throw those hands in a prayer circle and...discuss this war crime that has been forcibly bestowed upon our eyes.The story is very convoluted, and just the fact that people who\'ve read the source material need to constantly explain the goings on for anime watchers is evidence enough. There is some sort of circus trick going on where the scriptwriters attempted to juggle having storyline be as ambiguous and tricky as possible to plant plot twists, covering as much of the timeline as possible, and throwing in as much source material as possible. You\'re either lost, stuck in a tidal wave of unnecessary exposition (probably copy-pasted from the LN) or just bored from repetition. These guys are trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole with the paper handle of a screwdriver. This bastardization of a plot leaves you with little to no investment to the world and its characters. Speaking of which...Watching the characters made me feel like I was watching a murder scene. Apparently, the light novel goes into the backstory of several side characters to explain their situation and how they ended up. This show said screw that and skipped to ""present day"" as quick as possible. To rub hydrochloric acid into the wound, you are often forcibly ripped away from the main character\'s storyline to watch the side characters make stupid decisions in their petty arguments, which is nothing short of torture. The only form of enjoyment in this show was watching the main character get OP after spawning in their underdog position, but even then...This whole show is still torture because the main character herself isn\'t interesting at all. Her past life as a social outcast is way too much of a contrast to her annoyingly persistent and ignorant happy-go-lucky attitude. The show attempts to describe her as cunning but we are never shown her setups or strategies -- just ""she already planned for this, trust me"". Her jokes are awful to the point where you don\'t cringe, rather feel sorry for the voice actor. The MC is proof that no amount of enthusiasm in VA\'ing can make up for a dreadful storyline. There never seems to be any stakes involved and you soon learn to throw away any feelings of tension from the fact that nobody treats the situation seriously. Not the main character, and definitely not the script writers.If I had to summarize the production, it would be [cutting corners]. The whole this is a circle at this point. People say all the camera angles and pans are weird because they were done to avoid animating 2D scenes. The running animations in particular are dreadful. They are a rapid loop of a couple frames which make the characters look like they\'re spazzing out. Then the CGI. Oh, god, the CGI... Not even the brightest and hottest burning of liquid napalm would compare to the damage done to my visual senses from the CGI. All we can hope is that the war crimes committed by these 3D renders are simply a rite of passage to an eventual glorious future where 3D animation holds a candle to current 2D. Now please excuse me while I huff a long, thick line of cope and cry myself to sleep.If you thought this review wasn\'t funny, then don\'t watch the show. Comedy is subjective, but trust me when I say this show is objectively less funny. It\'s hard to decide whether it was rushed, low effort, or the priorities for it was heavily misplaced, but the poor production quality will stick out like a sore thumb that\'s gushing blood like a geyser. You will be hard pressed to grow attached to any character, even the main character, unless you\'re easily pleased by a cute, ditzy personality. Occasionally the show will throw you a bone to show how OP the MC has gotten, but by then I had already lost interest. This show was the first one that genuinely put me to sleep and also my new record for the fastest I\'ve finished a 24-episode series since it was more interesting to constantly fast forward until actual action happened. Tell, don\'t show is the motto of this series. The producers owe an apology and their firstborns to the author of the LN. And that\'s right, I hate watched this entire series and got what I deserved.

So what?', 'Finally, with a delay cause of ""production ussues"", this anime ends. And to be honest, I am happy it did. I admit, I actually enjoyed the web novel, as well as the manga adaptation but this... Lets say, it is a mixed bag.First things first, about the structure/story: there are basically two separate plot lines, one for our beloved Kumo, one for the rest of her class. In web novel Kumo part took about 80% (if not more) of all chapters, while the rest was given through small interludes. In anime, however, they decided to increase the part with her class and throw out stuff...from Kumo part. The problem is obvious: while Kumo part is pretty solid (even though the plot is simple, it is executed very nicely), the rest of the class goes through the most boring, basic and unimaginative isekai story you could get. Do I need to say that it is very, VERY dull to watch?And to make the line between fun and unfun part even more obvious, the creators of this anime decided that it would be a great idea to outsource all of the combat scenes to some obscure Korean sweatshop (or something like that). So while Kumo gets a pretty cute 2D animations and rather solid CGI fighting scenes, the boring part gets a gif-tier animation that consists of 3-4 frames per action, with 3-4 repeats on every action. No nice explosions, no cool moves, it looks like the outsource studio decided to recreate the infamous CLANG of 2016 berserk. It just looks awful and makes your eyes bleed.Sound - well, apart from 10/10 endings where Kumos voice actress goes all out,  there is nothing worthy of note. Sound is just there (better for Kumo, worse for the rest), it is not bad as visuals.Characters - you have a 10/10 best spider girl, and you have trash. That is basically it. While Kumo as a character has a lot of charisma and the voice actress, once again, pulls this entire show on her shoulders, the rest of the cast are an army of poorly written nobodies that work more like furniture and not like characters. Even the ones that had a good story written for them in the source (basically, all of MCs subordinates), got hacked with their arcs completely removed and their inclusion in this adaptation is barely enough for ""at least they were not thrown out"" achievement.Enjoyment... Kumo part? 9/10, really solid, very fun, highly entertaining. The class part? It is not even 1/10, cause it looks bad, sounds bland, story is lacking, characters don\'t look real and are just dummies. While overall I\'d rather say that I enjoyed the anime, but I will also admit that I started skipping heavily in every episode that had no spider in it.So overall I will say this: if you are a fan and want to check it - don\'t have your hopes high. If you are new to the series - check Kumo episodes and go read the novel if you liked what you saw. If you want to watch it whole - you will just ruin the enjoyment you got from the fun part and waste a lot of time. from Kumo part.

The spider being the main character is what makes this different from your other generic isekais. However, as the story progresses the focus changes more and more onto the other reincarnations. Unfortunately these guys are uninteresting, generic, naive, and have the intelligence of a 5 year old despite being in their teens. These other reincarnations turn what was an enjoyable anime into a boring, generic isekai that has nothing special about it. When we're focused on the spider my enjoyment is 10/10 but the episodes where the focus is on the...other reincarnations my enjoyment is a 3/10. other reincarnations my enjoyment is a 3/10."", 'Short-review and no spoiler.I really wanted to talk about this series but I just can\'t.So basicly, you bundle up 2 timeline and make a mess out of it, and thinking(oh both of them will met someday and become happy-end together), no.One is a Painfully-ugly and hideous for an over-cheerful Spider MC Kumoko who was isekai\'ed from her School and finding way to survive in the most harshest dungeon world where only Spiders and Monsters living there. And food gains stats, and get evolved into stronger spider... which looks exactly the same, but you should watch the final transcended form of her, its awesome.Most of...her line was based on her hopeful nature, despite with trouble with the surroundings, so she\'s quite fine tbf. Even she make her own ED song, which is based on her stressed life of being a Spider.But hear me out, this is the only Plot I WISH to watch the most.And one of them is Painfully-Boring Shun Arc, where he and her school-friends got transported into Isekai but on ""Different Timeline"", with quote because Kumoko was earlier.Most of this arc consist of Humans, Politics, War between Human and Demon Clan, and also Massive Plot-twists between Elf Clan who was common in Fantasy Theme.And here\'s main problem. Its extremely boring. Story is basicly, get this... ""Revenge of his Death Brother""... which he had totally no relation on his Real-Life.95% of my brain stop working and even the Comment Section in Ani-One completely dislike this part.I think huge part of the issue is how ""Bad"" the design choice of series.Where I think they put huge budget on Kumoko 3D works, while some parts were 2D, which I still think she looks better. But on most part in Dungeon area, its so Hideous and Ugly, infact I feel like I\'m watching a PS2 Flat Textured 3D Animation, while the (Milipensee\'s Animation at Work) camera of ""Berserk"" panning and scrolling make it a bit wonky... but I can see they had improved more than previous work. Still ugly.While the Shun arc... ugh. I can\'t even stand it.I can see most of things gone wrong here. Emotionless face, flat animation to laughable ""hand-drawing"" sketches sword-fighting, a Pan-Scroll 2-3 frames of animation, A monkey-load of cameraman, and copy-paste animation, and... Episode 23.The reason why I said ""Episode 23"" is where budget just gone to $0 with shameful 5-FPS animation without Trees, which they did have in manga, and the Studio who ""they"" mention had animation trouble with them, so they had to stop Outsourcing and had to do it themselves... which looks a lot way better on Episode 24.OP song were seems fine, but ED is kinda out-of-place but still cheerful but suddenly goes SPEEDCORE, which I didn\'t expected.TL;DR, I don\'t hate the series, I just hate how they adapted and handled out the series.

The first few episodes are really dragged out and monotonous I initially dropped it after 7 episodes as it wasn't going anywhere, the pacing is just terrible, so the first few episodes end up becoming dull with its monotonous repetitionIf the aim of those episodes was to show her struggle to survive, and just how slow and painful her levelling up journey was, they achieved that fairly early on, these episodes did not need to be so drawn out and so void of progression, they could have been easily condensed into three episodes and the series would have been improved by it.All I found myself thinking was, Arifueta did a better job than this.I need to stress that in the first seven episodes the events surrounding the MC lacked plot, they lacked progression, there were no events driving the story (levelling up for levelling up sake is not progression, seeking to leave the labyrinth is not plot, just needing to survive is not enough, something else has to happen)The problem is that the story, the plot is happening elsewhere, it is happening with the other students, and although I haven't touched on them yet, they are just dull, they are a vapid waste of space bunch of generic side characters that the series has the gall to waste the actual events on.It should be no surprise that I stopped watching after seven episodes, but, three years later, I came back and finally finished the seriesComing back and skipping the first six episodes and skimming the seventh was the best choice I made, it made me see that the best way to watch this is to just watch the first episode, then skip to episode six, as you miss nothing of valueAfter those episodes, things DO get betterYuki Aoi finally has someone to talk to and interact with, the MC's other personalities played by Yuki Aoi, to say that she carries hard is an understatement, she is hands down the best thing in this anime, but as good as Yuki Aoi is, she can't carry an entire anime on her own.While it may take a while, the story and plot eventually land at our MC's door, this was long overdue but changes the dynamics of the anime, our MC is given actual agency in the story, we actually have the beginnings of a story.It also changes the dynamics in a really big way, before the other students 'side story' was the only scenes where we actually got the story and plot, now because we're finally getting a functional series cantered around the MC, the 'side story' with the other students feels like an unwelcome distraction because they are so bland and uninteresting, I don't care about those characters, this actually created a problem with the ending with the series.I didn't care, I just wanted more Yuki AoiEven though it did improve after the first seven episodes, it didn't stop it from being a bad animeThe pacing is beyond dreadfulThe writing is bad, the story / plot isn't that good, for the most part, the only interesting areas come in far too late and aren't given enough focus because time and energy is wasted elsewhereThe characters are bad and poorly developed beyond the MCAnd the animation is terrible, the CG is just bad, we know that studios are capable of doing better, but it just shows that a lack of time and budget was put into this thingThe fact that Arifureta is a better anime than this, speaks volumes, because as bad as that is, at least it is entertaining throughout, at least they got the MC out of the cave early and meeting and interacting with other characters. as well as involved with the story early on. one else to talk to, so all she can do is level up and seek the exit while talking to herself, if that sounds bad, then it is.

It is an isekai about an entire school class being transported to another world. They will all grow up again and meet each other and it sounds very interesting to see how the group dynamics play out now that the situation is entirely different.Sadly it does not feel like the anime executed this very well. The story is split 50/50 between the main character who reincarnates as a spider and the rest of the class. This leaves very little room for interesting dynamics to properly develop. Something to be aware...of is that even though the anime is showing two stories at the same time. All events happening in those stories happen during entirely different times. Combine that with a few flashbacks and it makes the story hard to follow and the events hard to place until you're relatively far into the anime. Another problem is that the stories stay separate for a long period of time and when they finally come together they do so in a relatively unsatisfying fashion.The different ways all of the characters reincarnated was really interesting and the anime did a good job having basically everyone end up in a different way because of their reincarnation. Its skill system was relatively interesting as far as unique skill systems go and most of the enemies were different enough from other anime.Do not watch the anime if you dislike bad CG.

(2021)The reviews kind of confuse me, like what is this really but a pretty mediocre twin story Isekai that does past and present at the same time whilst using some pretty dire CGI.Story: Isekai with a class that is transported and you see 1 character get two simultaneous stories that are supposed to be some big reveal which is obvious from the beginning. This is due mainly to poor storytelling that leaves much to be desired.The art isn't the worst and can be pretty fun at times, but even so, the CGI sucks so badly and becomes more...and more frequent as the show goes on. I mean how clunky soldiers march is just weird. Copy and paste, copy and paste.The OP and ED are standard for an Isekai comedy style show. The voices are funny and good overall. The battles and such have 0 depth, like literally none. Not even a nice boom from an explosion through a sound system.The characters are pretty dull, I didn't really feel like I cared about anyone, particularly as so much was done in 24 episodes that you sort of just don't really care about them. Like I cared about Wakaba in her past memories of being bullied but apart from that everything just sort of doesn't develop enough or just skips over things so quickly that you just sort of see characters appearing and disappearing.Overall, for me, this is a 3. Whilst it isn't the worst looking and the story had good intentions it just sort of sucks from being pretty dull. There are far worse shows out there but I am glad I didn't watch this as it aired since that would have been a right struggle and a big pain.3/10.

The progression is uninteresting and the characters are way too fabricated.It's such a shame because Spider-san is really enjoyable to watch!There was absolutely no need to split this show up; focus on what makes the show unique and it would've been much better.

While main character's scenes are looking awesome, anything else will be bad.So despite all that would i recommend this anime? Yes. The story is what drives it. We start small with each episode being focused on survival, then we add layers on top of the story adding mystiers, plot points and sometimes straight up...outsmarting the viewers. All that mixed with plenty of references  and comedy.Voice actress for main character did fantastic job. I couldn't remember any other voice that would spark my interest but since the most important role is well assigned you gonna enjoy it.I strongly recommand watching this anime and I shall wait for season 2.

In my opinion, it is a masterpiece. Definitely one of the best Isekai out there and definitely a high tier anime (IMO).But it definitely isn't perfect.One thing I don't like too much about it is that it is a bit chaotic, you have two semi-parallel storylines, the humans' beginning something like 15 years into their lives in the new world, the spider's beginning at birth. There is a time-disparity between the two storylines that caused me a bit of confusion...at times because I didn't realize this until a point in story where the spider meets a human character that in the humans' storyline is at their age.Maybe my brain is dumb or I missed some key plot point that showed this. I always found this switching between different times annoying.Next up, maybe it's just me but I found the first couple episodes to be better looking then all the ones after since the CGI usage shoots up a lot and becomes much more obvious. Some animations look awful, especially in later fighting scenes.Putting this aside, it is an incredibly entertaining anime that has lots of comedy, mostly on the spider's storyline, which sets a stark contrast to the general theme of bare survival of that storyline as well as the more drama-laced human storyline. It is a pretty much rounded out package storywise, holding everything you might expect from a more serious Isekai and much more beyond that. It's poking fun at other Isekai, as well as other animes as well with tiny, skit-like parodies.Another big plus in my books is that this anime isn't Just another run of the mill Isekai with characters that are beyond broken or ultra edgelords. It is original and exciting, with incredible world building, having a properly worked out underlying MMORPG system e.g. at times because I didn't realize this until a point in story where the spider meets a human character that in the humans' storyline is at their age.Maybe my brain is dumb or I missed some key plot point that showed this.

I'll keep it short.In short, Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka? is a terrible adaptation of a great story. The use of CGI, art, pacing is just so atricious that it kills most of the enjoyment. I haven't read the visual novels, but from what I read in various places and what I've seen from the story, it's definitely a top tier-one. If I ever purchase a visual novel, it's going to be this one, so in a sense, this anime succeeded as a marketing for its source material...by being so terrible.Still, there are 2 things I can say that makes watching the anime worthwhile. The first one is the story. While the pacing is not too good, you can see that under the CGI monstrosity, a really good story lies hidden, and to get the gist of that story, the anime does its job decently. The other reason is the VA of the MC. Half of the anime is her talking to herself as she is alone in a deadly dungeon, and the VA's performance is top-notch, you could say she is carrying the show on her back. If it wasn't for her, I'd definitely wouldn't recommend this, but she just makes the whole thing so damn entertaining that I can still say it's worth the watch if you like isekai stories and OP protags. Bonus reason: the ending sung by the MC is top-tier. If anything else, just watch the first ending, it conveys the show's style pretty well. If you like that, give it a go.So all in all, I definitely recommend reading the light novel, only watch this if you are a sucker for isekai or if you can ignore the terrible visuals, or if you like the first ending. by being so terrible.Still, there are 2 things I can say that makes watching the anime worthwhile.

But i will say this, this is one of the best Isekai. Half way through the show i felt that the story had great potential and i got curious and began to search about it and i was spoiled to many things from the light novel and web novel. ( which i don’t mind as I’m still enjoying it very much regardless) From what I know from that is that if this gets a proper adaptation...this will be a top tier Isekai. The skill and evolution mechanics are one of the best I’ve seen as there’s different ways a character can level up. The story is told in a unique way, where there’s 2 sides of the story being told at the same time ( which makes it kinda confusing but you eventually figure out why it feels confusing) The world building is really good and the plots twists are good too. The mc is not op from the start, but actually starts off weak and had to work and grind to level up. I enjoyed watching kumeko struggling to survive and learn about her new world. The human side of it can be a tad bit boring compared to kumekos side of the story but helps with the world building and provides useful information. Genuinely a good Isekai and i hope and cannot wait until future chapters get adapted. This can possibly be better than slime and i hope it lives up to that potential.

I loved the idea of...3d graphic 15 years before the main plot and 2d in the present, but I was kinda disappointed when they started mixing both styles in fights in the end of the series.Music was really nice and on point, but yet it wasn't some sort of a masterpiece.Overall I'd like to give a general score of 10, because it was super enjoyable for me and I could watch it again and again 3d graphic 15 years before the main plot and 2d in the present, but I was kinda disappointed when they started mixing both styles in fights in the end of the series.Music was really nice and on point, but yet it wasn't some sort of a masterpiece.Overall I'd like to give a general score of 10, because it was super enjoyable for me and I could watch it again and again"", ""This is an anime about the journey not the destination, meaning everything up to the end is great, the character is fun the situations are interesting, but that ending.Lets start off with what I mean when I say character. Kumo is really the only thing that makes this show stand out, there are other characters, but if you read the ln/wn, you find those chapters exceedingly hard to care about, the same thing for the anime, you just want to see more about kumo.I won't go into spoilers here but the nature of the topic could be a spoiler itself, the way the...story ends, with literally mid fight in an episode that feels like it was heavily condensed, is really the only blemish on the anime, but that blemish further extends when when you realize the whole pay off for having humans in the story at all is gone. The manga did a great job of this, knowing that the human aspects are just not fun at all to read/watch so they removed them entirely, and I 100% believe this is the right call to make, there is no time or dedication to them that make me care at all about what they have on the line, so the attempt to make me care just falls completely flat. The story could have ended in a better spot if they never put the human focus there, they could still have them, but not a focus on them for the ending.Up until the end, and when I say the end I mean the last 3 episodes and the build up to those episodes where human focus was, this was easily a 10 for enjoyment, but as the ending and byproduct of that ending happened it gets points docked. art is also low, the spider and monsters are fantastic, however the humans look like they got outsourced to someone who had no idea how to use a 3d program or any principles of animation I have seen worse, berserk, but damn were these not much better.I came into this from reading the manga and the wn/ln so im perfectly happy with where it cut off, but if you are anime only, this would destroy the anime for you, with no season 2 announced that I know of, and if they dont season 2, this could easily just make you mad.overall have fun watching the anime, don't get wrapped up in any human side crap, and you will have a good time. story ends, with literally mid fight in an episode that feels like it was heavily condensed, is really the only blemish on the anime, but that blemish further extends when when you realize the whole pay off for having humans in the story at all is gone.

It\'s tasteful in the sense that this isn\'t thrown in your face throughout the whole thing, though you\'d often forget that ""it"" is female on account of being an androgynous monster for 99% of the show. This kind of sets the tone for the whole affair as having a lot of potential to hit a lot of boxes we don\'t often see in an isekai; and marking the tick just slightly outside of each. With its only redeeming feature being a plot twist towards the end.Whilst the...protagonist is a charming enough character that guides us through the show with a laid back comedic attitude, this sits in stark contrast to the original persona of said character before getting isekai\'d. This glossed over fact kind of haunts you through the entire show and for some reason the show keeps making a point to remind us that the original female lead was actually someone remarkably dull and a victim of bullying despite not actually elaborating on why the current MC has different character traits. You\'d be forgiven for thinking these were two completely different people. I haven\'t read the LN/Manga so i\'m not aware if this info was mistakenly omitted in the translation into animation, but at least if it was elaborated that the MC in fact had a joyous alter-ego they kept for online or a hidden Chuunibyou syndrome or something, you wouldn\'t constantly ask, ""but who the hell is this person i\'m watching right here"".The progression feels nice because it\'s non-linear, but the fights are consistently the same recipe of fighting a tougher opponent only to win through some arbitrary mechanic beyond raw stat padding; and exploiting a level up mechanic that basically allows you to recklessly damage yourself because you get a ""new"" body each time you progress a level. Allowing the writers to give a false sense of danger when ever our hero gets hurt, only to explicably recover to the point of re-growing entire lost limbs (this happens a lot).The last bug bear is ""the other half"" of the show which follows the lives of the MC\'s classmates who were also isekai\'d along with her, but managed to spawn outside of the labyrinth our MC is stuck inside. This does a fantastic job of expanding on the world building that would otherwise be stuck exclusively in innumerous ambiguous looking dark caves. But as the show goes on it becomes increasingly disparate as we eventually come to understand that these two sides of the same story are actually occurring at different times, ~15 years apart. Making the second half of the series incredibly confusing and frustrating to follow.The best and more original part of the show is the part where we see the MC interacting with people and towns as a monster once outside of the labyrinth, but this is short lived.All in all, the show manages to just provide the barest minimum to keep you going only to end what feels like right before the best bit, where everything is about to be explained before the stakes are raised, presumably, once more.Oh yeah, and at the risk of being ""that guy"", the CGI is god awful. protagonist is a charming enough character that guides us through the show with a laid back comedic attitude, this sits in stark contrast to the original persona of said character before getting isekai\'d.

When the show started it really looked promising with a very engaging main character and an interesting premise, but for some weird reason that I cannot even begin to understand they kinda ruined it.You might be thinking: Didn't you say the premise was interesting and the main character was good? Yes, but for some reason the creators of the show decided that on some episodes we weren't having any of that. Instead of focusing on the main character a significant part of the show would just be...about this cast of husks of human beings without any personality. So my experience watching this show was basically enjoying the main character do her thing and then the massive flaccid member of the boring crew would just come out of nowhere and slap me in the face while curse the screen for exposing me to this narrative diarrhoea. In my haven't watched that many shows only about 90 at the time I'm writing this review, but I don't think I ever skipped episodes out of boredom before. The scenes with the other normal humans we're so awful I would just leave timestamps for people to skip the bad parts and if they were the entire episode my options we're either sit through it waiting for the show to be good again and being disappointed or just to look ahead and skip them entirely.Other aspect of this show that utterly pissed me off was that they used a pretty good animation for the pointless characters and for the main character which is the only likable thing about this show they would use this god awful CG. I really don't understand why they didn't just made this show a 12 or 13 ep anime instead of just making half of it utterly unbearable. I really wanted to like this show but this crap is just unbearable in case you are a big fan Aoi Yuuki and want to watch the show because of her awesome performance just make sure you skip the human parts, if you do that it becomes a pretty nice 7/10 show.TLDR: half of the show is good and the other half unwatchable garbage that spits on the face of the viewer.Aoi Yuuki parts: 7/10Other: 0/10Overall: 4/10 about this cast of husks of human beings without any personality.

Most notably the human side of the story has basically al characterization and development removed and have become very boring as a result which will make the craziness that happens them have absolutely no impact on most viewers as there is no reason given in the adaptation to care about them. \u200bEven the titular spider main character has been made a pretty one note hyperactive comedy character as her calmer moments have been removed and arguably one of the most character defining events when she first meets Earth Dragon Araba had it's tension removed and the start of her main character motivation: to live with pride.Then there's the story which has been utterly butchered, so many things that got cut while exchanging them for pointless anime-only scenes that bring way less to the table than what they replaced, the reordering of things completely losing the parallels between the two sides of the story and the intricately written mystery aspect is simplified to the point of being pretty predictable. bad; weird motions, an inability to stay on model, overall choppiness, characters sliding around, it also uses a lot of 3D CG and while that part is usually less bad than the 2D animation, the quality of the models and the animations can vary greatly.The directing and shot composition is mind boggling and surprisingly for a show that uses 3D CG so much shows a lack of understanding of how to locate characters in a 3 dimensional space.The characters have almost all been reduced to less than a shell of what they are in the novels.

But If you’re unlucky you will be stuck with the human characters doing fantasy stuff for an entire episode - and trust me, if it wasn't for the story progression I would’ve skipped that part.The anime is a one man show (or one woman show to be precise) and that’s the best part about the show as well. The center character Kumoko rules the entire series to the point you will despise the rest of the...characters (even the ones on the ‘positive’ side) and story parts.Like I said the story can be split into two - one where Kumoko is the protagonist, and one where the Hero and random humans  (well, reincarnations to be precise) do typical fantasy stuff.  The first part is peak entertainment and the second part is utterly boring, failing to compete with even the worst of Isekai anime.Another important part is the overuse of CGI. You can see it everywhere, almost every fight and some random shots as well. The CGI itself is below average, but I understand that’s all we can expect from the current generation of seasonal anime. The main negative side is the  frequent and untimely transition from normal art to CGI, which totally kills the viewing experience.Even with all these negative aspects in place, I would still  recommend watching it. Especially if you like anime like That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. IMO,  Kumoko is one of the most entertaining characters in Anime. Plus, her voice actress did a magnificent job in giving life to a spider.

I love the manga and novel so much and was hoping to enjoy the anime. I am so disappointed because I was hoping the show was going to at least be mediocre so that it would draw in more interest for the source material. Quite frankly if this was my first experience with kumo desu ga I would not even think about watching a second season. I know how good the story is and how much I had fun with the manga and light novel but this adaptation was so frustrating because I knew how great this anime could...have been.I feel that the show did not bring any justice for the novel. It seems as if the charm of kumoko has completely vanished. In the novel we see kumoko as being quirky. Much of her personality seemed sucked out and warped in this adaptation. It was not just about her overly upbeat cutesy attitude which the show seemed so focused on. I noticed that this part of her seemed so emphasized to the point that she seems annoying. This was not how the character was intended. SO much of her was left out. In episode 20 we see kumoko conversing with Gülie, and in episode 24 with Ariel, but in both cases kumoko talks in her own head without ever saying anything out loud. How come? In the novel there was a heavy emphasis on how in her previous life kumoko was a shut in and had trouble communicating with others, even after reincarnated there would be pages of her talking to herself mid conversation with someone, only for her to choke out a few words, but this was never mentioned in the anime. What we have instead have is an awkward silence and a confused audience that does not know the reason for her silence. The only reason the producers might not have included this was the fact that the gimmick of the split timeline was not revealed yet and the mystery of who kumoko was before reincarnation was planned to be reveal later down the line. The only problem with this is that even before we got a glimpse into who kumoko was before reincarnation this personality trait was fleshed out and explained when she first talked to administrator D on the phone.Honestly I tried to like the anime as much as I could, I really did, but lets address the elephant in the room.This show is hideous.You often hear people cry about cgi at any given opportunity, and usually I pay this no mind. I often think that people exaggerate their distaste for cgi and often think of these people as whiny and painfully fastidious, but my god is the show ugly. Taking a look at any comment section of review of the show you will find one thing in common. There is always at least one comment mentioning how badly ""animated"" the show is. The thing is animation is not the problem, the main problem is how the fight scenes are drawn and choreographed. In every fight there is several cuts in every action a character does. From one stroke of a sword to another the camera angle cuts multiple times while having zooms in and out. Cuts like these are not a problem when done right, but when a fight happens so zoomed in, the whole scene seem disoriented and unorganized it completely ruins any suspension of disbelief. At every fight I stop thinking about the show itself and become distracted by how badly choreographed the fight is. It feels less like a fight and more of random jerky movements as the camera switches in random directions.I dont mind 3d animation, I really don\'t, but when it is done this badly it is actually painful to watch.I will give credit where credit is due. I respect that the show decided to follow the original source and did not go down the route of the manga, which decided to completely cut out the story of all of the other students. Yes, the story with the hero was handled very poorly, but with how much more complicated the story becomes and how hard it is to divert the story away from our main protagonist while still trying to keep the audience invested, I respect the writers of the show for at least attempting. I understand how much time the producers could have saved and how fewer episodes would have been required if it had followed the mangas story and for that aspect I will respect the director.In the novel there was also a split timeline. One following kumoko and another with Schlaine and his friends. The last episode of this show was when it was revealed who kumoko really was (lady white) but, with this it was never really mentioned exactly how or why the story is the way it is. Much like how we were not told of kumoko\'s communication problems the ending of the show never explained why the timeline was split. Clarification was yet again left out the story making the show confusing. The story was split in two because kumoko as a spider was able to be hatched while her other classmates were not able to do anything until later down the line because humans developed much slowly and can not do much as an infant, giving kumoko a head start in leveling up in the dungeon. This allowed for the writer of the novel to make it into a mystery as who kumoko will eventually become, adding another layer to the story, but was not done justice in the anime. We did not see as much of lady white in the anime so i\'d imagine the surprise was less exciting for anime viewers.I STRONGLY encourage those that have watched the anime to give the story a second chance and read the novel. This anime by no means do credit for the source material and it was very painful to see how negatively the show was received because I feel that less people are willing to read the novel now.I realize that because I read the novel my perspective may be warped, that the story may seem alright for those that have only watched the anime and may not see the flaws that I do because the novel provides me a kind of hindsight. But, I was so harsh on the show and compared it to the novel in the case anime exclusive watchers felt that something was missing or that the story felt incomplete to hopefully motivate them to pick up the light novel because yes, the novel is indeed much better than the adaptation as cliche as it sounds. have been.I feel that the show did not bring any justice for the novel. It seems as if the charm of kumoko has completely vanished. In the novel we see kumoko as being quirky. Much of her personality seemed sucked out and warped in this adaptation. It was not just about her overly upbeat cutesy attitude which the show seemed so focused on. I noticed that this part of her seemed so emphasized to the point that she seems annoying. This was not how the character was intended. SO much of her was left out. In episode 20 we see kumoko conversing with Gülie, and in episode 24 with Ariel, but in both cases kumoko talks in her own head without ever saying anything out loud. How come? In the novel there was a heavy emphasis on how in her previous life kumoko was a shut in and had trouble communicating with others, even after reincarnated there would be pages of her talking to herself mid conversation with someone, only for her to choke out a few words, but this was never mentioned in the anime. What we have instead have is an awkward silence and a confused audience that does not know the reason for her silence. The only reason the producers might not have included this was the fact that the gimmick of the split timeline was not revealed yet and the mystery of who kumoko was before reincarnation was planned to be reveal later down the line. The only problem with this is that even before we got a glimpse into who kumoko was before reincarnation this personality trait was fleshed out and explained when she first talked to administrator D on the phone.Honestly I tried to like the anime as much as I could, I really did, but lets address the elephant in the room.This show is hideous.You often hear people cry about cgi at any given opportunity, and usually I pay this no mind. I often think that people exaggerate their distaste for cgi and often think of these people as whiny and painfully fastidious, but my god is the show ugly. Taking a look at any comment section of review of the show you will find one thing in common. There is always at least one comment mentioning how badly ""animated"" the show is. The thing is animation is not the problem, the main problem is how the fight scenes are drawn and choreographed. In every fight there is several cuts in every action a character does. From one stroke of a sword to another the camera angle cuts multiple times while having zooms in and out. Cuts like these are not a problem when done right, but when a fight happens so zoomed in, the whole scene seem disoriented and unorganized it completely ruins any suspension of disbelief. At every fight I stop thinking about the show itself and become distracted by how badly choreographed the fight is. It feels less like a fight and more of random jerky movements as the camera switches in random directions.I dont mind 3d animation, I really don\'t, but when it is done this badly it is actually painful to watch.I will give credit where credit is due.

It's a fairly solid generic fantasy story, but it goes off the deep-end towards the end and it feels like the creators didn't know what they wanted to do with the anime.

The music is good, but it's entirely dependent on your own tastes, you will either love it or hate it.Characters:  Some of the characters are a lot of fun, however, others are extremely shallow and the anime could probably work just as well if they never even existed.Overall:  The series isn't perfect, but it's clearly not trying to be.

One, spiders are cute and two I am really intro transformations and it includes reincarnations.

I expected something of a cute fantasy story, but instead... well that\'s definitely not what I thought Kumo desu ga, nani ka? will be...At first, I thought ""Oh, so it\'s a totally comedy anime"", but then some thing were more intriguing and a little more serious. Then it was sad when I learned...one fact regarding Feirune and her wish for some person. But it didn\'t last long until the anime became very ominous in nature. Yes, that\'s the word. From a simple fantasy story to gag anime to seriousness to actually very ominous thing. Especially when they hinted what will Kumoko do or what she was doing at that time. She wasn\'t the sweet overjoyed overexcited character anymore. I mean, she was... but she was also merciless.Kumo desu ga, nani ka? is a story that is more than it seems at first glance. It starts as very innocent cute gag anime, but quickly becomes gravely serious. And the amount of plotting, twists and unexpected turns are hard to count. I guessed some thing right. But then I still was surprised by other stuff. And after watching the whole season, I still have more questions than I had before.Kumoko is cute character, but don\'t be deceived by her nature. She is often merciless to these who get in her way. She isn\'t a bad character, but she isn\'t Your average good hero either. Story is about two paralel event that will be linked from time to time also explaining some stuff periodically. You will get some answers, but then more question will pop up and after watching the whole season You will have more to ask...The world there revolves around group of reincarnated kids that become people and monsters in another world. How and why that happened? What is their role there? They use skill and level up systems. Sometimes even evolving into more powerful creature. Skills are important part of the show. They sometimes make something available, that wasn\'t before. Also there are titles that gives bonuses.

It looks like cute, non-serious story, but it\'s more ominous than many shows I ever watched. Main character is actually very interesting. She is kinda hilarious, but she can also be serious when she needs to. And there is more drastic gore than You would expect too. Sometimes the gore is even caught in the joke as well.

Just look at it. Normally I wouldn't even bother to attempt a viewing of something that insults my eyes this much, but I enjoy the manga and was interested to see how they had adapted the story. The interpolation of this human side of the story then acts as the 2nd crippling nail into my skull that makes this truly intolerable. Good fucking god.I really don't believe this should have been made. I'm sure there are other shows out there with aesthetics this bad, but this probably takes the cake for...the worst example of a modern isekai adaptation I've seen. Every single thing I saw looks drastically worse than the manga. The editing and animation then does little to order the visual slop placed before us.Having a read through the reviews and also some of the comments on Crunchyroll I can see my disdain for the human story line is rather common. Is it really surprising. The whole selling point of Kumo Desu Ga is the fact it's the told from a monster perspective. Instead at least half of the run time of this anime is spent on the most generic isekai cohort I have had the misfortune of spectating in quite a while. There is the lightest of dusting of interesting elements. Character designs are wack. Personalities are eye-clawing levels of boring, cringe, trite and redundant. The only potentially good moments involving humans are those that I previously witnessed in the manga. But they didn't look like they had been shat out of a Dell made in 2001 there.So fuck me. This was an experience that recontextualised my perceptions. It makes me feel quite a bit more positive about the Slime anime. It makes the CG in Overlord look positively resplendent (well...). I would like to say that this is bottom of the barrel, but I know there must be even worse out there. The terminal sludge factory that is the industry that makes it's measly living through the most cynical of adaptations. I hate it. the worst example of a modern isekai adaptation I've seen.

The other is a human drama that's frustratingly incoherent and boring.If you're here for worldbuilding and political intrigue, skip this one.

When Kumoko is on screen, it\'s an absolute blast; a spider monster with a zany isekai personality goes on survivalist, monster hunting, and leveling-up adventures, with Aoi Yuuki doing a fantastic job bringing out the best parts of the character\'s unique personality. It\'s genuinely delightful to watch; a refreshing change from the typical isekai formula. Sadly, the spider\'s adventures are all too frequently interrupted by a timeline shift to a dull story about one of the most slow-witted generic isekai ""hero"" characters around, accompanied by a jarring tonal and genre shift away from comedy,...action, and adventure.This is a problem rooted in the source material; even if the smooth-brained adventures of Shun and his motley crew of ignorant fools are ultimately relevant to the plot in the long run, the story gives very little reason to have any serious interest in them or their actions until much later on. Millipensee has magnified this problem in the anime adaptation by trying to balance Kumoko and Shun at a 50/50 ratio, which is not the case in the source material. The result is that much of Kumoko\'s early development and struggles have been cut in favour of showing Shun and his pals merely existing. Despite this, this adaptation also cut many small character development moments that might have made the characters on Shun\'s side of the story more bearable to watch.My optimistic understanding is that Shun is intended to be an unlikeable character in the context of the overall story, and deliberately demonstrates a vast array of the worst tropes of isekai heroes. He\'s an unapologetic bastion of pseudo-morality that believes he can do no wrong and thinks he can do anything if he tries, but is detached from reality; he fails to ask obvious questions or make crucial observations, and interferes with events even though he is clueless as to what\'s really going on. That this is intentional is much less obvious in this adaptation, and at the end of the day it turns out that an intentionally unlikeable character is still just an unlikeable character - even more so when he keeps stealing the limelight from the much more entertaining spider fun times.To be frank, it\'s extremely difficult to resist skipping ahead every time Shun appears on screen, and I imagine viewers who haven\'t read the light novel will struggle even more to see the point of his segments. I\'m of the opinion that Shun\'s story would have been more appreciable as an entirely separate adaptation - perhaps a movie or OVA released to provide backstory and context when those characters actually become relevant in Kumoko\'s timeline. The manga adaptation has already proved that cutting out anything not directly related to Kumoko makes for a fun experience (although we are yet to see how it will handle the converging timelines) and I really pity anybody coming from the manga to the anime to meet Shun for the first time. As it stands, Shun\'s involvement really hurts my enjoyment (and ratings) of this adaptation.My other biggest gripes are with the CGI and direction, but this is nothing new for Millipensee, who also made full use of these shortcomings to absolutely butcher the Berserk 2016 adaptation. The direction is poor throughout with awkward transitions, weird camera angles, and unnecessary camera pans that really remind you that Millipensee is running the show. The CGI is at least much more bearable on Kumoko\'s end of the story; it\'s consistent and fairly well animated, so you kind of get used to it eventually. Shun\'s side of the story is mainly animated in 2D, with CGI only thrown in occasionally. Because of this it\'s especially jarring when it does show up, and episode 21 in particular - which had a grand total of zero spiders, by the way - was a CGI disaster on par with some of the worst scenes in Overlord\'s third season.Overall, I feel this adaptation was a swing and a miss at a source material with immense potential (much like Berserk was), but it\'s worth watching purely for Kumoko. For viewers who are struggling to get through Shun\'s segments, I recommend turning up your playback speed up rather than skipping them entirely; they\'re worth watching as many of the characters and events will become relevant to the story, but you don\'t really need to pay too much attention to understand. action, and adventure.This is a problem rooted in the source material; even if the smooth-brained adventures of Shun and his motley crew of ignorant fools are ultimately relevant to the plot in the long run, the story gives very little reason to have any serious interest in them or their actions until much later on.

The only interesting thing about Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? is that the main character is a spider with multiple brains who is hyper and overpowered. The generic isekai stuff with characters who are as bland as drying paint is not what anyone got into this anime looking for. And it seems that we get less and less of our MC's PoV every episode.Take episode 10 for example. We get a little over 2 minutes of Ms. Spider's situation before...the OP. It's kinda cute, and a little funny. Not amazing but it's at least interesting. What do we get after the OP? About 5 minutes of generic blue haired Isekai boy talking to boring humans about boring stuff. Yeah his brother died but his brother was barely a character. I don't care. After that? 12 minutes of an old man talking about how OP a certain spider is (our MC) and a fight with said spider from his PoV. So our MC only has speaking lines for 10% of the entire episode. She appears for about 50% but most of her screen time is a voiceless enemy to an old man.Oh wait sorry I forgot about the 2 minutes of extra time she gets AFTER the end credits. Yeah. So our MC is relegated to before and after credits now.Hopefully the next 12 episodes are decent or my score is going to drop even farther. The human characters are bland and uninteresting.

The two intertwined plotlines set a decade and a half apart from one another COULD make for a great show, and the mystery of how ""this"" came to ""that"" really did keep me hooked the entire time, so, technically, it did work to a sufficient extent. But no more than that: quite unfortunately, it\'s not even that every single isekai...character archetype seems ages old by this point, rather, the blandness of most of this anime\'s characters beats even that. In fact, the aforementioned mystery of what led to whatever is happening in the later plotline was the only reason I kept myself from skipping that plotline completely.As other reviewers I see have already pointed out, Shun\'s story is morbidly boring. And it is made so by the characters, so much that the viewer\'s likely indifference towards them might actually distract from how generic the story events for them are. Which is basically what happened to me.Kumoko\'s storyline, on the other hand, still feels to me like one of the best isekais ever thought up or at least something that had the potential to be that. And, if anything, there haven\'t been many Isekai protagonists whom I\'d enjoyed watching learn the ropes with their new abilities and make acquaintance with the unfamiliar world more than I did Kumoko.Would I recommend the show to someone who has never watched an Isekai anime? No. Would I recommend it for someone who has seen too many? Oh, definitely. Especially the first few episodes seemed like a breath of fresh air for the genre, until the ""Hero\'s"" storyline started ruining it bit by bit.P.S.: the music was alright, the cgi battle art can such my watchlist and, weirdly enough, I\'m actually looking forward to season 2, which I\'m still pretty sure isn\'t happening.. character archetype seems ages old by this point, rather, the blandness of most of this anime\'s characters beats even that.

The first is a fairly unique isekai focusing on a solo story surrounding Kumoko, a girl reborn into the body of an RPG Spider and her fight for survival, her adaption to her new form, and ultimately her descent into a kinda hilarious madness. It's not exactly pretty, but the 3D gets the job done and some of the effects can be fun just due to how many flood the screen, besides that it has charm. There's some decent intrigue and world-building in the background, but the main heroin's goals remain generally...relatable (survival, comfort, shelter, ect.) and most importantly enjoyable to watch.The second is the worlds most boring one-note stock standard isekai featuring a massive cast of characters who all still manage to blend together like soup. The animation switches to 2D but it's so stale it honestly makes you want the janky 3D back. The plot is one we've all seen before, and it takes a long while before this show's plot and the first one even begin to show hints of connecting over the course of 24 episodes (and then the show ends).Let me make it clear that my 7/10 rating applies only to the former show, the latter would receive a solid 3/10. Unfortunately once the spider shenanigans draw you in that's when every other episode suddenly gets hijacked by the blandest isekai of your nightmares. It typically switches off from Kumoko's perspective and back to the snoozer crew from episode to episode.After having finished all 24 episodes I can honestly say watching only the episodes from Kumoko's perspective would have made this show a lot more enjoyable, even if it had cut the run-time in half. relatable (survival, comfort, shelter, ect.) and most importantly enjoyable to watch.The second is the worlds most boring one-note stock standard isekai featuring a massive cast of characters who all still manage to blend together like soup.

Do you enjoy watching a likeable MC struggle and slowly become stronger?

The show has 2 separate narratives and figuring out the connections and putting all the pieces together is really fun.Art - 4By far the weakest aspect of the show is its animation and art style. While the style is fine and how it looks is subjective, the animation will be the biggest reason people would drop this show or avoid it. It uses heavy amounts of CG, and while it does work sometimes, more often than not it looks meh or bad. Its not so terrible it would take you out of the experience however. You will get used to it.Sound - 7A very good voice cast really makes up for the lackluster sound design. The soundtrack is fine, but forgettable. The sound effects are passable but it doesn't add to anything.Character - 8Characters are the shows best attribute. The MC is very likeable and the supporting cast is also very solid. It uses the isekai plot to really do something with every character.Enjoyment - 10This show is a blast to watch and a joy to get through. Its very bingeable. I watched it weekly as it came out and just finished rewatching it in 3 sittings. This show as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Any aspect of the show that is lacking gets carried by just how easy it is to watch. The show has very good pacing and knows when to move on and when to stay in an area, it never drags.Overall - 8Conclusion:A very good anime and a great isekai. Without a second season its hard to put it up there with re:zero or tensura, but its on par with shows like Shield Hero. This is the type of show almost anyone can turn on and enjoy.

The designs are actually pretty good. Voice acting is great.But as an adaptation it fails, it understands only like half the humor and almost none of what is interesting about the original light-novel. The storyline is insanely rushed and warped; whoever thought that giving Shun half the spotlight when he should be basically a background ""serious relief"" character in a comedy setting needs to lose their job.Has some good moments overall, but if you like the web//light novels you won’t be happy. ', '-50% Following the MC in her journey to survive life in a dungeon as a spider. Fighting monsters, gaining experience and learning new skills (You know, the cool stuff). Would be great, except the MC has a completely different personality than what her backstory suggests. Also, skills are barely (and poorly) explained. Oh, and the fight scenes are terribly choreographed.-50% Following Not-The-MC Background characters that are doing the same stuff. However, besides setting up a few plot points (that could have been explained in a few ""flashbacks""), their story has next to no impact in terms of how much screen time its given. It could...(and should) have been summarized rather than taking up half, or sometimes full, episodes.Conclusion: Another likely instance of ""the manga was better"".

It does a pretty good job of telling each character\'s experience for the most part. However, you figure out halfway through that the timelines of the two stories are completely different. The spider\'s experiences in the beginning happen 15 years before that of the other characters. The spider and the Ariel fight during a time Julius was still alive. Then we figure this out in a brief 4 minute flashback that shows that we have no freaking clue as to when this stuff is happening. It\'s truly a bizarre way of storytelling, and is pretty frustrating to deal with, because it\'s formatted in cutting from the stories of the various characters, from the humans to the spider to the demons to the Elves, like it was all happening at the same time. Most often these different perspectives are from scenes happening on the same timeline, but this story bounces from character to character, from timeline to timeline, giving no indication of when these things actually are happening.The actual stories themselves are quite solid. I enjoyed the experiences of the human characters, and how they must overcome terrible obstacles. The spider\'s story is one heck of a crazy ride, but also a great one. The VA for her is not what I would imagine when I think of ""quiet loner who spent most of her time in isolation"", but maybe I\'m just sensitive. Plus she has great energy throughout the show, and really brings the character to life, though it it does seem like she just replicates her previous roles and gives them the same personality for the most part.The art style is hard to handle. It switches from 2d to 3d constantly, and, while I understand using 3d technology to save some time, it looks absolutely abysmal. The monkeys in the beginning especially look terrible, and all of the 3d models seem incredibly rushed and unfinished. The Elves in the battle in their forest look like copy-pasted Link models from Breath of the Wild, and the facial expressions in particular look absolutely terrible.I enjoyed the spider battle scenes. The ""underdog victory perspective"" is always enjoyable; knowing that a character is weaker, but using clever tricks and techniques to overcome stronger opponents is always cool to see.

One from the POV of the classmates who were blessed with prestigious backgrounds and another one of the MC spider.Honestly, I cannot say I like this 2 POV idea, because it essentially splits the story into two right from the start. IMHO, having the 2 POVs right from the start kind of pits them against each other. The classmates' POV had a relatively weaker start compared to the MC spider POV. Having them side by side almost every ep really highlights how the classmates' POV is not as engaging.After ep...8, the story starts to pick up and the 2 POVs start to converge.  I'm 22 eps in (definitely gg to finish the show) and I still struggle to get through the scenes with the classmates. I simply don't care what happens with them since I could not attach myself to the classmates from the start. All of them are pretty standard..?The story will always be the most important aspect for me when I rate an anime. I'm not an expert in CGI so I can't say much about the overall animation.

Being 24 episodes instead of just 12 really saved it. I feel if it had ended at 12 there would be so much disappointment the staff could even get lynched.Even with 24 episodes though, covering all that content comes at the cost of feeling like a rush job. Novel and manga readers will still be a bit disappointed by the lack of details or completely skipped scenes.On the plus...side, manga readers will get to see the story of the other reincarnations and not just Kumoko, which was interleaved with the main story in the light novel but entirely missing in the manga. This surely will appease them a bit. Also, the anime actually overtakes the manga (or at least it\'s English translation, idk how far the raw is) and shows the ""season finale"" a bit before it.As for the story itself, it is a mixed bag of good and bad sides, but overall I think worth watching/reading.The parts about the weak spider having to overcome ever-growing odds not with some god-given overpowered skill (at least initially) but with wits was quite fun when I read it originally. Some degree of that fun is lost now with the rushed adaptation and lack of details. But I guess even with more time, the anime medium is just less conductive to long inner monologues, trains of thought or explanations, so it\'s sort-of understandable.On the other side, there were LN/manga parts that I felt had become boring or repetitive, like just another fight we get over with, using just another trick, or luck, or new skill, as those kept piling up and we got more and more overpowered. So I guess rushing those parts can eventually be seen as bonus too. Alternating between the Kumoko and Schlain stories is also a welcome distraction from that repetitiveness.When I was reading those parts initially, I couldn\'t help but get my hopes up for Kumoko\'s eventual encounter with humans, and how she would handle it. And boy, did she manage to let down those hopes grandiosely. If we\'re talking about plot holes or bad writing, it is that. Being bad at socializing is hardly a good excuse for how that part of the story went.

I read what\'s available in LN form, and I feel the bad, irrational aspects of the story increase by a tenfold there, but there is still plenty of good and interesting stuff to keep me hooked.

I honestly thought for at least several of the first episodes some parts were overtly bad on purpose, hoping later that they were in some way a reflection of the tropes in various manga/anime, but I was sorely mistaken. ""It gets better after X or Y episode"" Is always a lie, no it does not suddenly get better, it\'s your perception of what is good and not. If anything this...show begins to take several nosedives all while already nosediving. Is that even possible? The climax of the show is littered with bad directorial decisions, janky, bad 3d mixed in with 2d animation that is horrendous. Some sections of the show are littered with information dumps that sometimes can span over a whole episode, and its drawn out as hell. Just a tip: Put the playback speed at 2x at these points. Nothing will change at all, you wont miss out on anything.All that said, there is a reason I kept watching for 24 episodes the Spider Kumoko carries the series hard. She is the only slightly interesting thing here and her scenes are ""fun"" I say that in a very biased manner and honestly I wouldn\'t be surprised if most people despised these scenes.Is the manga probably better? I have no clue, but that\'s what I hear, from what I\'ve seen I don\'t think there\'s any saving grace to this series from here on out. show begins to take several nosedives all while already nosediving.

The second half had more of the issues so the first half was alot better in terms of animation.The voice acting especially for Kumoko really brought the characters to life and made watching very enjoyable even with the issues. I enjoyed the openings and endings although it did take a bit for them to grow on me. The ending song in the final episode I especially enjoyed.In terms of story at first, it may seem similar...to lots of isekai other than the fact the MC is a spider, however as the story continues it is clearly different and not following the common story path for isekai's. While one of the biggest surprises gets revealed at the very end of the anime, there are other things that are shown at the beginning but aren't obvious but do get slowly more apparent over time. It never goes right out and tells the audience but over time it becomes obvious enough that its used lots in the storytelling. Its the kind of thing where overtime several pieces slowly come together.On a personal note, I read lots of the manga but after the anime showed parts the manga left out, I went out and read all the light novels that have been published so far and its become one of my favourite isekai and I've reread the light novel several times.I recommend giving the anime a try and if the story seems interesting I suggest try out the light novel. There were several production issues so if you watch it, try to enjoy it for the story it tells. I hope the production issues it had doesn't dissuade a season 2 from being made because I really love the story and want to see it animated. to lots of isekai other than the fact the MC is a spider, however as the story continues it is clearly different and not following the common story path for isekai's.

Nothing too special and nothing too boring. Just somewhere in the middle.There are many comparisons between this show and ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" but in reality, the similarities are as barebone as comparing any two random Isekai shows. Sure, in both cases the protagonist is supposed to be the creature at the bottom of...the fantasy/video games ""food chain,"" and in both, there is a disembodied voice notifying them of what they acquired next. The approach to telling the story in each show is completely different, the characters are different, and this show doesn’t center around fan service.The major problem with this story is that it seems to go nowhere. Sure, that exploration and fighting random opponents is nice for the first, second, or third episode, but at some point, it becomes tedious and, quite frankly, boring. Similarly to watching someone who plays a video game and being privy to their inner monologue, with very little else happening. No interactions, no concrete goal, no story progression, and repetition ad Infinitum.In each episode, I’ve been expecting and wishing for some meaningful interaction or maybe flashing out of goals that our dear spider might aspire to, beyond acquiring skill after skill just for the hell of it. At some point, the protagonist expresses a wish to go to a different part of the cave but with no reason attached to it that doesn’t boil down to “well, it’s different, I guess.”In tandem with the story of the spider, we are given glimpses into the lives of the other students who were transported to that world and their interactions with each other, but again, no concrete goals, no real need, no hint of a reason of why they’re there. Even their dialogue with each other is limited to how they hint at certain things, with characters refusing to tell important information because the story needs to reveal that information in episodes 12 or 17. The other characters, of course, resigned to accept that “can’t tell you” excuse, because it’s not their time to know anything of importance yet.The show also suffers from the “tell, don’t show” problem. You don’t see the behavior, actions, or interactions of the characters, but you need to be told via dialogue what they feel, think, or believe. I don’t want the characters to tell me how they feel, I want to understand it from watching the characters and looking at the minor changes they go through that lead them to a certain position or compels them to act a certain way. This is mainly an issue when we see what the other students are doing, but only because we’re not seeing anything of note in the spider’s story.This is the frustrating part: The show has something that could be interesting, it can have meaningful interactions – but instead, all of that is ignored for the benefit of showing another colorful battle in our spider effort to be more powerful or a clash of swords by the other students, in utilizing the most boring and expected storytelling.Part of the problem, I imagine, is the length of the season, with its 24 episodes telling a story that doesn’t need 24 episodes to tell, or perhaps the author believed that telling every little acquisition of skill is vital, for some odd reason.The show might start getting good in a few episodes, but based on what I’ve seen thus far, I don’t think I’m all that interested. A show shouldn’t need to waste seven or more episodes doing nothing of note. I don’t think I understand any character better now, after seeing those seven episodes, than I did in their first few minutes of screen time. the fantasy/video games ""food chain,"" and in both, there is a disembodied voice notifying them of what they acquired next.

Everything involving the classmates was incredibly boring and a copy paste of every other crap fantasy anime. Full of clichés and generic crap.The episodes revolving around the main character were a lot better but at the same time, those episodes are filled with crap 3D work. It's bad but it's not so bad that it's not watchable at least..I could have made it through this anime if it were just the main characters story and the cheap 3D but I can't with the cheap 3D AND the shit classmate story. "", ""Decent isekai anime, but the first half is the only part you should watch,i.e., the first 12 episodes.The anime starts off pretty well, even makes you sink back into your chair as you see your friendly spider level up in the isekai world, all so she can survive and escape her house. That's it, that's the point where you should stop the anime.You will feel nice and even though you have dropped it in the middle, you will not have a salty taste. But if you care about completing it more so than enjoying it then proceed. The latter half is sour in...taste, I would rate Episode 13-24 a whopping 2!, inversely I would give the first half a 7.What is so bad about the 2nd half ?[SPOILER REGION AHEAD]Ok so the first half has 2 stories going on at the same time, on 1 hand you got a spider who is all interesting and is trying to give you entertainment, she struggles, she survives, she's cool. On the other hand you got an entire class that got isekai'd in a bomb blast, they are all very generic and edgy but they aren't completely bad.Now in the 2nd half, their stories start overlapping, you get to know that our lil spidey went on to become a villain and the isekai'd class as heroes, albeit misguided heroes. Our spidey is horrific and unreasonable for the most part while the heroes are somewhat reasonable. And to add more twist, the timelines are all over the place. The point our lil spidey's story is told is much more earlier in the timeline than the class' story which isn't told upfront and there are a few plotholes in their conjunction. This raises some obvious questions, why did they need to run 2 different stories, at 2 different points of time, in the same anime ?The only time  they actually meet up and recognize each other is the end of the anime which is very poorly put in my opinion, since we have no reason to watch the other guys if they didn't have any interaction till the end, even then the story is left in a mess.My review is just an advice, for the sake of trying a different isekaitry this anime, try the first 12 episodes and then forget about it. Maybe if the 2nd season drops, pick it up and continue but until then steer clear of the latter half or the entire anime.Have a nice day (or night :) ) taste, I would rate Episode 13-24 a whopping 2!, inversely I would give the first half a 7.What is so bad about the 2nd half ?[SPOILER REGION AHEAD]Ok so the first half has 2 stories going on at the same time, on 1 hand you got a spider who is all interesting and is trying to give you entertainment, she struggles, she survives, she's cool.

It can be mind-numbingly boring at times and the CGI is used too much. It tries to bring elements from ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"", but fails at it. If you don\'t have time to read this review, then I will just say it\'s decent if you just wanna watch something dumb, but if you want a really good Isekai anime, then you might wanna go somewhere else.The story is your basic Isekai plot. High schoolers get blown up by some magic bomb and then are all reincarnated in a fantasy...world. The story goes mainly between 2 characters, Wakaba Hiiro and Yamada Shunsuke. Both stories are set 15 years apart from one another (I think). Wakaba is reincarnated as a Small Lesser Taratect that hatches in the Great Elroe Labyrinth and tries to survive within it. Yamada is reincarnated as a prince and goes through magic school. The story is confusing however, due to things like administrators, gods, and many other things that I feel like were rushed through. I give the story a 6/10 because it\'s generic and confusing as hell.Now the characters. I don\'t really like any of them. Wakaba is just cringy as hell. The entire time when she\'s the main focus, she just talks to herself and does stupid things. Yamata is your classic Hero dude that almost every bad Isekai has. He cares a lot about his friends and he doesn\'t wanna hurt anyone at all. The side characters here are all boring too. Wakaba was the only character I could kinda enjoy without wanting to pull my hair out. Characters are a 5/10Did I enjoy it? Yes, because I expected it to be like this. Should you watch it? Not if you want an actual good Isekai anime to watch (Jobless Reincarnation or Slime), but if you just want a stupid show to sit back and watch, then this is the one for you. I give it a 7/10 just because I did somehow enjoy it, but It does have a lot of flaws so it\'s not for everyone. world. The story goes mainly between 2 characters, Wakaba Hiiro and Yamada Shunsuke.

The story drive pretty fast indeed but still quiet interesting. The only biggest letdown is Hero side story is kinda boring and pointless for me, because...hero side is kinda like nathing important thats it. Because this story approach it with 2 timelines, u probably confuseThere is 2 timelines, Demon and Hero sideHero side happened after Demon side finish, so its basically S2 but not technically S2Demon side happened before Hero side story tell, and its basically start when everyone in Kumo mc class got isekai and some of them reincarnateArt : This is biggest letdown, They use almost 70% CGI and its all crappy, the animation itself wow, i m speechless, even CGI arifureta more smoother than this animation. Tbh if they want adapt S2, i gonna said this, change studio, they are not good even tho they will adapt 24 episodes but pls change it, I watch in 2x playback speed when i see CGI, because damn its so crappy and movement so clunkySound : No comment, its goodEnjoyment : Really enjoy watch this, i finish it in 2 days (i watch it when all episodes aired) the only problem is i cant stand watch CGI fight is so clunky feel like watch Robot with command walk and swing hands onlyOverall : i give it 10-3/10, -3 why? The art is one of disappointment in this anime, i probably watch it again if they remake but guess it wont happened.

So from the start, I instantly feared the...worst for this anime, and the worst happened.From horrendous CGI, to animation in the later half of the anime which was so poorly made, that I wouldn\'t even be exaggerating if I said that my dog could probably animate better than that. (And no, I know animating is hard, but trust me, you have no idea how poor the animations is in the later half of the anime. I will however, give them props for the animation at the start of the anime.)I will delve into everything in detail below:\u200e\u200eStory 9/10:The Story of this anime is quite literally the only thing that managed to keep me entertained and wanting to watch more of this anime. The story doesn\'t have the best start, but after a few episodes, I guarantee you that you will definitely be hooked, and want to watch more of this anime, just for the sake of exploring the story. There are many unexpected twists, all of which are explained eventually, and make sense, and the overall world building is pretty interesting. Unfortunately, I am a bit skeptical of some of the scenes that take place at the end of the end of the anime, which may or may not downgrade the story in the long run, but I will maintain a positive perspective on this series, and as such I shall not comment on what may or may not occur in the future.\u200eArt 3/10:When delving into Art, I mainly look at two aspects within an anime. The Aesthetics (i.e. how the anime looks) and the animation within the anime.In terms of overall Aesthetics. it starts off at a fairy nice light, nothing visually astounding, but not bad either, so I would say overall mediocre. However, as the anime progresses, there is less and less detail placed into the artstyle, which results in the anime being visually painful to look at.In terms of animation. This was where the studio adapting the anime mainly failed at producing. While at the start the animation was decent enough, it was absolutely horrid at the end. Furthermore, this anime frequently switches between 2D and 3D, without trying to smoothly transfer between the two, which results in pretty weird scenes. Especially considering that some scenes have both 3D and 2D characters next to each other at the same time.Adding onto this, 3D is not necessarily a bad thing, I have seen several 3D anime which manage to use 3D well. There are also western cartoons such as ""The Dragon Prince"", which I absolutely love, which is entirely in 3D. However, this anime fails in the 3D aspect. Fights are poorly animated, especially at the end, and the anime never takes advantage of the 3D models to make stunning camera movements or anything of the like.\u200eSound 5/10:In terms of sound, the music in this anime is okay, there aren\'t any really memorable soundtracks, but at the same time, there weren\'t any moments where I felt the music didn\'t fit the scene.In terms of voice acting, this really depends on you, I personally really enjoy the voice actress of the main character, so do most of my friends. However, I know that the majority of the community dislikes her voice acting, as such I shall not comment on this aspect.\u200eCharacter 6/10:Similarly to what I mentioned inside sound, the characters in this anime are really hit or miss, meaning you either like them a lot, or else you hate them. Unfortunately though, apart from a few main characters and side characters, I feel that some of the major cast have rather bland characters. However, I didn\'t find any of them to be annoying, or too bland, as such I believe a score of 6 is justifiable.\u200eEnjoyment 6/10:I overall enjoyed watching this anime. However, to be frankly honest, it wasn\'t really the anime I enjoyed, but rather the story that was portrayed within the anime. I will definitely not watch any second season. However, I do plan on grabbing the light novel and reading it through to see the story that got me hooked into this anime.\u200eOverall 6.3/10:The Anime Studio honestly ruined the adaptation of the light novel. While the anime is still pretty watchable, and as long as you like the story, you should remain entertained. I would highly recommend reading the Light Novel instead of watching this anime. worst for this anime, and the worst happened.From horrendous CGI, to animation in the later half of the anime which was so poorly made, that I wouldn\'t even be exaggerating if I said that my dog could probably animate better than that.

Unfortunately though, apart from a few main characters and side characters, I feel that some of the major cast have rather bland characters. However, I didn\'t find any of them to be annoying, or too bland, as such I believe a score of 6 is justifiable.\u200eEnjoyment 6/10:I overall enjoyed watching this anime. However, to be frankly honest, it wasn\'t really the anime I enjoyed, but rather the story that was portrayed within the anime. I will definitely not watch any second season. However, I do plan on grabbing the light novel and reading it through to see the story that got me hooked into this anime.\u200eOverall 6.3/10:The Anime Studio honestly ruined the adaptation of the light novel. While the anime is still pretty watchable, and as long as you like the story, you should remain entertained. I would highly recommend reading the Light Novel instead of watching this anime.', ""This anime makes a lot of fun of the Isekai genre and tries to be funny at it. This does not always work. Generally I enjoyed the watch and I think it is not wasted time. But the story gets a little trainwrecking in the second half so I was not really getting all the stuff.The story starts as your usual level up setting. But the main is quite funny. What I don't buy is her approach and personalitly which is a 180 to her shut-in live. The story gives us every so often little hints and unfold the setting nicely until ep19 from...there on it is just trainwreck. I look at you Terminator.Nice touch to tell the story in 2 seperate stories, but the human part is very boring.Animation in the first 12 episodes was really good, the CGI was there but good integrated and didn't bother me at all. Also the 2D was ok.The second 12 episodes did show the production trouble they had. 3d Human look really bad and also the monster, while still ok, did not look as good. And there was really reduced and partially bad 2D fight animation.Sound was really good and on point the BGM was excellent and differs enough to really create ambiente.The characters beside our main are quite plain and follow our normal formula, a lot of potential was lost considering we have a whole class isekai'd.I did enjoy most of it, especially the first 12 episodes which had some clever fight orchestration and good animation while the second 12 where more to find out what the heck was going on.Sadly at the end we enter the harem isekai train hard and I fear bad thing for the second season. Which is sad as the first half was almost free of the annoying sister, girlfried, furry girl crap. there on it is just trainwreck.

The story is basically split into two views, that are playing out in the same world/universe, however, you want to call it. The main reason for my overall review score of 9 is the Story and therein lies also the enjoyment, which is also why I cannot go into a detailed description on why without spoiling the fun :DStory 10, why:Since the story is split into two parts, the viewer keeps constantly wondering on how they are connected. The anime gives an explanation very quickly, but that explanation is...lacking in more than one way, which leaves the viewer yearning for more and keeps them involved. DON\'T SKIP ANYTHING! This story is quite complex. On a superficial scale(What tf is going on?) but also, the more the viewer tries to find out, the more social commentary can be found!Art 7, why:This isn\'t your Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen, or Mushoku Tensei level animation. And even though, I think that every anime should rise to that level, it isn\'t needed here. The animations are fine are helped by CGI, which does not look terrible. Quite the opposite, actually! It integrates really well into traditional animation. For comparison, I would say the CGI in ""Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?"" looks better and takes the viewer less out of the action than the CGI in Shingeki no Kyojin: Final Season Part 1.Sound 8, why:The sound is partly high, because of the comedy effects, which are greatly influenced by soundbites. The music is fine, and nothing that is distracting, but also no masterpiece.Character 9, why:This score mostly stems from reasons, I cannot get into, since It would spoil a lot of the subtle social commentary, found in the anime. On the surface, that character design was really well done, with some minor exceptions, which I would call, lazy solutions. But since they are minor in my opinion and do not interfere with the main plot, they don\'t subtract much from the score.Enjoyment 10, why:I found myself constantly theorizing what would be the cause of certain events, the connection parameters between the twos sides of the story, and the motivations of characters. This will make the viewer constantly want to know more and keep watching. The best thing is, that the anime will not spell out a lot of information. On the surface, sure, enough information is explained, to keep the plot going and make sense.

There are also some episodes of this anime that I didn’t completely watch or skipped entirely for personal reasons which I’ll elaborate on later. Take my review of those particular parts or episodes with a grain of salt, as I can only really speculate about how that part of the story may have turned out, though I genuinely doubt that my interpretation ended up being far off.I’ll be honest when I say that I’ve never been much for the fantasy isekai genre, particularly those inspired by video games. Arguably spearheaded by the .hack series and popularized by...Sword Art Online (though not entirely, of course), anime of its ilk are often just not my thing. I find that each incarnation of the next big fantasy isekai tends to feel derivative to me. Its only innovation is most often in one aspect that may or may not change the overall trajectory of the anime, but that innovation is gone with most of its surrounding world, which tends to feel interchangeable. Never mind that quite a few of the most popular of these anime seemingly have a male protagonist to whom any woman in a five mile radius is inexplicably and wildly attracted to. I know that this seems like a generalizing and uncharitable perspective and, well, I would kind of agree. Regardless if it’s nuanced or not, it’s obvious that I enjoy very few of these fantasy, video game inspired isekai. So when I say that I really wanted to enjoy ‘Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?”, also known as “the spider isekai”, you know I mean it.Now, my history with this series is pretty extensive. I read the bad fan translation of the light novel roughly five years ago. And while I enjoyed it despite being simple and a little formulaic, the terrible and I mean TERRIBLE translation really didn’t do it justice. Some sentences were nearly incomprehensible and some were clearly a case of being lost in translation. Eventually after getting well into the story, I decided to quit, as I didn’t see myself getting very invested. Roughly a year later, I read a few chapters of the newly released manga and was actually surprised by how much I ended up liking it. It wasn’t anything particularly groundbreaking, but the artist clearly did a great job adapting the story from a written medium to a visual one. However, since I had already read most of the light novel, nothing that I was seeing was new to me and the thought of waiting months to finally read a chapter that I wasn’t familiar with wasn’t one I was going to entertain for even a split second. Then, in winter 2021, I saw an anime listed on the front page of seasonal anime on MAL by the same name and I honestly have no idea why I checked out a piece of media I had dropped twice already. I’ll be coming back to this history later on in this review. Put a pin in it.The first thing anyone will notice when starting up the first episode of this anime is also one of its biggest problems; its visuals, AKA the dreaded 3D animation. Normally I’m not one to focus heavily on visuals in reviews, because I’m much more interested in the story and characters of an anime. But to only mention it in passing or even completely gloss over it would understate how much of an eyesore the animation can be at times. The environments and textures are very hit or miss, sometimes looking pretty decent and sometimes like I’m playing classic RuneScape. The model for Kumoko, while not at all terrible, takes a lot of time to get used to. It and any other models clash heavily with some of the 2D artwork though. This isn’t too much of a problem in the beginning, as most of the monsters in the labyrinth that Kumoko shares the screen with are also 3D. This problem then becomes much and MUCH worse when Kumoko escapes the labyrinth she was reincarnated in and meets some of the important figures in the supporting cast. Because when some of the characters in a scene are clearly less important and thus drawn instead of given a full model and one or two aren’t, it looks extremely awkward. Just to pick a few random examples that I can remember from the top of my head, when the Demon Lord and Kuro are standing over the corpse of the Earth Dragon in episode twenty-two or when Wrath and Sophia are talking and literally standing right next to each other in episode twenty-four. These two scenes and scenes like it give me total visual whiplash. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying the 3D is necessarily the problem here and I won’t demonize 3D animation in general. The models look fine and some are obviously somewhat competently made, but the team over at Millepensee just didn’t manage to make it look good. Studio Orange productions such as Beastars and Houseki no Kuni are great example of anime that utilize this combination of 3D and 2D in a way that doesn’t just look good, but enhances the experience. They do actually use the 3D animation in a clever and logical way to avoid having to constantly animate things that would be too difficult to animate in 2D, such as Kumoko’s spider legs and the occasional rotating camera angles, so it’s not as if there was absolutely no reason to make it 3D. However, the main problem still stands; it doesn’t look good most of the time. It’s also kind of sad to imagine what the anime could have been, as some of the shots that are meant to be more expressive, particularly the small visual gags that Kumoko does throughout the story, are animated in 2D. These scenes always look great, but make me wish the anime was made by a completely different team and/or studio.The animation isn’t the only big problem the anime has. It has one, arguably bigger issue on its hands, which I’ll illustrate in an small anecdote. Episode one. Despite some of its flaws, I’m enjoying watching the wacky hijinks I expected to see. Even though I’ve already gone through the beginning of the story twice before, seeing it animated still feels like somewhat of a new experience and Aoi Yuuki’s voice acting makes the character of Kumoko even more endearing. Cut to three quarters into the episode and suddenly, the story takes place at a party. Outside of the dungeon. With humans. And no Kumoko. This scene seems inconsequential and pretty uninteresting, but I brush it off and assume it’s some early set-up for later into the anime. Come episode three and these same human characters show up again. But this time, they take up almost half of the runtime. And that’s where the problem starts.I’m not exaggerating when I say that the low score that I’ve given to this anime is almost entirely because of the human part of the story. With every one of these scenes, and sometimes even full episodes, the story stops dead in its tracks to show something OTHER THAN the primary draw of this anime; the reincarnated spider girl. It completely takes away focus from and doesn’t aid the main story and its existence is almost completely irrelevant to it. They influence each other in only a few ways, but more often than not, it’s Kumoko influencing the human story and not the other way around. You could theoretically skip all of the human parts and still understand the main story just fine, which is what I ended up doing about a third through the anime. Its lack of influence on the overall story is obviously something I only noticed in hindsight though, so then why did I end up skipping these parts? Simple! The human parts are also excruciatingly generic and uninteresting. The world and its magic are par for the course. Nothing even remotely unique or compelling is introduced in these parts that I did end up watching. Its characters also seemed just as generic. With its bland, cookie cutter protagonist; its token adult “loli” character and its brother-complex ridden sister character that were all introduced in the first or third episode, I already had a feeling I was going to end up skipping that part of the story entirely. Now, remember that pin that I mentioned about nine hundred words ago? Because when I originally watched these episodes, I was really confused. I didn’t remember reading anything about these characters, especially not so early into the narrative. So, I took to the forums and asked about this storyline, only to be met with the claim, ‘it was supposed to be a satire’. I can’t find any particular interviews where the author made this claim, but I see fit to debunk it regardless. That can be done easily by saying that no matter if it was originally written as a satire, the anime plays that part of the story completely straight. Derivative characters and character archetypes are regurgitated with seemingly complete sincerity and none of these, in my opinion, rather grating tropes of generic isekai anime and its fans are questioned or mocked like a satire would do. But even if it was a well-written satire, I don’t really know if that would’ve helped the main story either. It still probably would’ve ended up taking away focus from the main story. While I do understand that these parts were likely added so the story wouldn’t be spending half of the runtime in the same cave environment, they should’ve been much shorter, if included at all.To round-up this review, I’ll shortly talk about some things I didn’t get to work in between the more pressing matters about this anime. The music wasn’t really anything to write home about and the voice acting seemed okay across the board. Nothing particularly memorable about either, except the stellar voice acting of Aoi Yuuki, who voiced the main character. Kumoko, by far, is the best part about this anime and her performance really helped with that, even with the questionable script at times. Her voice acting managed to make her isms very endearing, though I do know that some people find Kumoko to be a little grating. Different tastes, I suppose. Other than that, the designs were decent. The villains such as Ariel and Keren definitely had way better designs than the heroes, who all ended up having rather stale and uninteresting designs and, although it was only used in part of the last episode, Kumoko’s half human, half spider design was extremely clunky. Because it was animated entirely in 2D, I imagine it will be disposed of pretty quickly, but that doesn’t really excuse the fact that it ended up literally being a female torso stuck on a spider’s head.TLDR; The main character is very fun to watch and it could’ve been just an entertaining though somewhat generic anime. Unfortunately, it ended up being dragged down by the lack of effort at blending the 2D and 3D animation together and the human parts of the story, which were almost completely inconsequential and extremely generic. I ended up skipping these parts later on and if you’re planning on watching this anime, I would advise you to do the same. Sword Art Online (though not entirely, of course), anime of its ilk are often just not my thing. I find that each incarnation of the next big fantasy isekai tends to feel derivative to me.

She is energetic, fun, entertaining, and a joy to root for.The story itself is what makes this show so good in my opinion. There is a mysterious disconnect that you can detect early on, and the show...leaves you trying to piece together clues to figure just what exactly is going on. It was one of those shows that was intriguing enough to make me read the light novels because I couldn't wait to find out what exactly was going on.Now the bad. While I do have to admit it isn't my favorite, I am not an anti-CGI elitist or anything. However, that is if the CGI is reasonably well done.

If you wanna review the story in the light novel, there\'s a separate page for that; go review it there. This is the place to review the anime adaptation, and the fact of the matter is that as an adaptation, ""Kumo desu ga"" is just fine. It\'s not that it doesn\'t have some great peaks -- just that the overwhelming amount of valleys sort of counterbalance those highs. Ultimately, I\'m enjoying it, but that\'s very much in spite of its problems and not because it lacks any. Giving...this series a perfect 10 is simply delusional. Whatever praise it may duly earn, it duly earns just as much criticism, and the end product is just...fine.Let\'s get started with the story. Kumoko\'s trials and tribulations are, in fact, very engaging to watch. While it does, at times, struggle with Mary-Sue-esque power creep, it almost never feels unearned. She usually manages to get the upper hand on her opponents through strategy rather than brute force (though in recent episodes, she\'s been able to essentially insta-kill people from miles away, so let there be emphasis on the word ""usually""). As a result, when she manages to take down much stronger enemies, it feels roughly as hard-fought as you would expect fighting a boss while underleveled to feel in any video game -- and the experience payout seems generally pretty analogous to the severity of any given fight. Moreover, she\'s definitely got a dynamic personality (which is more than you can say for most of the other named characters), even if at times its constituent traits don\'t seem all that consistent, leading the writer to lean a bit heavily on references to otaku culture that I\'m sure won\'t age poorly whatsoever to plaster over what would normally be seen as some pretty drastic mood swings. She\'s not a perfect isekai MC, as some have made her out to be -- but she does bring a relatively unique and refreshing perspective to the genre. If you want a new and engaging take on the isekai MC, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse.HOWEVER, then there\'s the B-plot. And yes, it is a B-plot -- even though it may intersect with or connect to the A-plot at some point in the future. In fact, it\'s the promise of that eventual reveal that gives the B-plot any degree of tension or mystique. Shun is a milquetoast ""chosen one"" with no real motivation -- though not for lack of opportunity. Remember, this is an entire class of people who\'ve reincarnated into a fantasy world. You\'d expect some of the politics of their former high school life to crop up, at the very least to contrast with how life in this new world has changed them. However, pretty much universally, whatever potential is offered by their background is squandered or outright ignored. Plus, by the age they are when we first see most of them, any motivation that may have come directly from their life in this new fantasy world is ancient history, left to be revealed in flashbacks that feel like an unearned afterthought in service of whatever trivial conflict the writer felt like constructing. The result is a cast of characters who are mostly interchangeable with one another, except for the villains, who are themselves pretty archetypal and one-note.In fact, the only member who really showed any promise as a multifaceted and complex characterization was Fei, being the only other reincarnation to be born as a monster aside from Kumoko, who also accrued a Taboo level early on as the result of making a hard choice. Her circumstances are made all the more intriguing when it\'s revealed that she was sort of the popular, mean-girl queen bee of the classroom in the previous life, and she\'s having to adapt to not only being non-humanoid, but being branded as sinful as well. This is the closest we get (as of e21) with a non-MC character to seeing the unique ways in which the mechanics of this world affect and motivate the day-to-day lives of the reincarnations. However, when Fei gains a humanoid form -- in a pretty transparent attempt to simply not deal with the potential conflict set up by the somewhat unfair hand she\'s been dealt -- she immediately reverts to an uninteresting, ultimately interchangeable member of the Hero\'s party, except with a hint of sass to hopefully make the viewer not notice how little there is to her character. With this transformation, the series reveals its hand: It\'s incapable of handling meaningful conflict between intelligent, autonomous characters, and only really succeeds when it\'s either a) Kumoko against other monsters, driven by either survival instinct or a rudimentary monster hierarchy or b) Fei against her own self-perception. This is likely why almost all of the villains so far have a single, unwavering, highly ideological reason for opposing Shun\'s party -- anything like two characters having a difference of opinion despite seeing the same facts, or coming to oppose one another in the course of pursuing conflicting goals, is too complicated. Half-earned, full-throated hatred is the only motivator the writer knew how to incorporate. The series relies on the intrigue of a non-humanoid MC who mostly fights other non-humanoid (and exclusively non-reincarnation) opponents, banking on the MC recognizing and manipulating the game-like setting against targets that will always act a certain way. Complex, unpredictable, or contradictory human actions are too much for it to handle deftly, so it doesn\'t even try.So, yeah, most of the cast is bland and only characterized briefly and exclusively through flashbacks. The B-plot can\'t stand on its own two feet as a compelling story. It would be irresponsible to overlook that, were it not for the interesting and relatively well-executed A-plot with Kumoko, this series would be the most bland and uninteresting standard nothing-burger of isekai filler material we\'ve seen to date -- easily a 4 or below. But what else does it have going for it?Well, the art and sound design are a mixed bag. The OST (by which I mean the songs used which aren\'t the ops/eds) is fairly limited and slimmed-down, but it\'s versatile enough that a single song can be used to convey different feelings to the viewer in different contexts. The OPs and EDs themselves are very memorable, and I challenge anyone with a rockin\' bone in their body to avoid bobbing along with either OP. They slap so damn hard. However, the sound design of each episode -- eating noises, fight sounds, etc. -- is nothing to write home about, and at times is even a bit...amateurish. Perhaps that\'s because it\'s so often accompanied by the *drumroll* lousy 3D CGI!Now, don\'t get me wrong -- I\'m no 2D or hand-drawn purist. There are plenty of shows with CGI that looks downright stellar, and it would be the musings of an idiot to write off the entire medium as if it isn\'t already being used to make some of the masterworks of anime. But this is not good CGI. Character models seem to be in a constant sliding or floating motion even when they\'re supposed to be relatively still, faces are static and lifeless, and the models for the dragons look like they were taken straight out of 2008. The CG really drags down the series when it\'s used so haphazardly, without regard to the current limitations of the technology and what sort of subjects CG tends to animate best. That\'s not to say that this series shows no promise for the role of CGI in anime, though. There\'s a fight scene with a puppet-like enemy that\'s genuinely one of the creepiest and most well-animated CGI portrayals of a humanoid character I\'ve ever seen -- but that\'s likely because, as a puppet, the animators would\'ve been less worried about making it appear like a breathing, living human, and by leaning into that uncanny aspect you only make it more effective as an intimidating foe. Most of the time, however, the CGI is appalling for 2021 standards, especially when it\'s appearing next to or even *within* some of the drop-dead gorgeous hand-drawn 2D animation this show has to offer.THAT\'S RIGHT! I have very good things to say about the other art on display in this show! The backgrounds are absolutely stunning, and the animation of the 2D characters is often astoundingly well-done -- especially Kumoko\'s many battles. So well done is this animation, in fact, that it often leaves me wondering: ""Why on Earth did they opt for CGI in that other fight, then?"" I give the art here a 6 because while the CGI is a 5 at its best, the non-CG artwork is sometimes up in the 8 or even 9 range. Once again, it\'s an example of how ""Kumo desu ga"" is a series full of ups and downs to the extent that the entire show just ends up solidly middling.And that\'s sorta what I wanna hit on again to wrap up. Can we all stop pretending that this is the best thing since sliced bread? Can we stop with the grandstanding against supposed ""anti-CGI elitists"", and stop singing praises for a story that frankly wasn\'t told by this adaptation? It\'s a fine adaptation, but it\'s incredibly far from perfect. It has several glaring issues that make people rightfully enjoy parts of it less than others. There\'s 3 episodes left in this season, and it\'s frankly running out of runway to offer any sort of satisfying closure to the main mystery, let alone any degree of compelling characterization for the ensemble cast of reincarnations. It\'s an enjoyable ride, but an enjoyable ride isn\'t always a well-designed or well-planned ride. It\'s unique enough to keep you engaged, even with the less interesting bits, but only so long as it still has the offer of a good payoff at the end -- and we\'re running out of time for it to achieve that. It\'s good enough for what it is, but it\'s not phenomenal or revolutionary. Stop lying to people in your reviews, saying it\'s the best isekai in the world just cuz it plays around a little bit with the formula, or that it\'s gonna be an amazing story later on if you just stick with it. It\'s just OK in the state it\'s in right now, and that\'s what we *should* be reviewing, because that\'s what people who read our reviews *will* be watching. You can only do it a disservice by making it out to be something more than it really is. this series a perfect 10 is simply delusional.

One half which is brilliant, another half which is nigh on unbearable. And, once again, I find it difficult to properly review something with paramaters such as this.Let's start with the good: the Spider side. As always, Aoi Yuuki is a goddamn juggernaut of voice acting. She plays the titular Kumo, an isekai'd spider. And she's so brilliant in the role that I can barely find the guts to see her flaws (she's a bit Mary-Sue-ish at times). Put alongside her...some top quality animation, fine world-building and the occasional supporting cast (e.g.: Saori Hayami as Administrator D - which, given their previous work together in Youjo Senki makes for a funny realisation; or whatever, can't think of the word - you know, when something is funny for the audience that the characters don't know about? Anyways), and you have a masterclass of an anime that I could safely call one of the best of the year......if it weren't for the Human side. Deary me, was it a chore to watch Shun the Generic Isekai Protagonist and his Bland Harem. I very nearly dropped the series during the Dungeon exploring episode; and I had to skim and eventually skip the only-Humans episode near the end of the series. It's not even BAD for the most part; the voice acting isn't the worst, and it does have some good world-building if you can get past the obvious. It's just so atrociously written and abhorrently boring that I would rather watch paint dry, ESPECIALLY when you go from a few episodes of Kumoko's shenanigans. Bad plot-writing and characterisations mixed with some Berserk2016-style 3D animation (B A D), and you get half of an anime that is genuinely difficult to watch.In summary, this anime is... well, hot and cold. Half and half. If you listen in to the Human side for a few tidbits of world-building and then skip most of it for Kumoko's awesome fun-times, then you'd probably have a blast (which, given the fact that the whole season is out now, so you can watch it on-and-off, rather than waiting a week or two only to find you're faced with an episode of Mr. Wannabe Hero and his Sidemen - the benefit of retrospective would be a blessing for future viewers, I imagine). Yet, when the Human-side makes up nearly half of the viewing time, I can only reluctantly recommend this season.Heaven willing, they'll make a second season, and scrap the Human side to focus on Kumoko. If they don't, then... I hear the manga and LNs are pretty good. Maybe that'll satisfy me... except Aoi Yuuki can't give her cheery remarks to it. Damn shame, really. some top quality animation, fine world-building and the occasional supporting cast (e.g.: Saori Hayami as Administrator D - which, given their previous work together in Youjo Senki makes for a funny realisation; or whatever, can't think of the word - you know, when something is funny for the audience that the characters don't know about?

I hated it, and I confidently said so.This is by far, the most complicated isekai I have watched, and I have watched plenty of isekais. Here is why:SPOILER!!1. StoryThe anime seems to have two separate stories with a different timeline, but the show makes it so that it is the same timeline. Not to mention, the shift between these timelines makes you think that this is the same while (idk) if its even the same timeline.e.g. During the war between Demon clan and Humans, you see the strongest wizard talks about the past (15 years...ago) where he fought with Kumoko, the MC. But, from the MC perspective, she had just fought the guy like few hours ago.BUT, the MC and some people in the Human side, is a reincarnator. Are you saying that all of the students get reincarnated in different timeline? (Also I tried reading the wiki, and just got even more stupefied). Apparently, the Demon Lord (in the war) is the origin of Taratect, or the grandmother of the MC. WHICH, makes the timeline even more confusing.Ah, I don't even understand what the flip is going on, that's how bad the story in this.2. ArtCGI, CGI, and CGI. The studios just asked some artist to draw background, animate it a little, and put CGI monsters on it.3. SoundThe OST isn't bad, but the SFX during scenes is annoying, cliche, old-school.4. CharacterOverall annoying. Basically, they tried to make a gag-anime with isekai, but missing all of the comedy. Many, MANY times, I have to stop, pause, and think, why am I still watching this.

Night Shyamalan, but on a budget.I spent the last half of the season waiting for the plot twist that was sure to come in the last episode or two. I think that\'s pretty characteristic of this show; spending most of the time bored or annoyed, waiting for an interesting plot point or fight.I have extremely mixed feelings about this anime. One one hand I want to praise it for the lack of fanservice, lack of guilds and quests, and lack of walk-over enemies. Yet on the other hand I want to slap it for the repetitive and annoying 4th wall...breaks (or 3.5 wall breaks) as well as the weak supporting cast and poor CGI.I for one actually liked the plot. I liked that the MC spawns as a relatively underpowered non-human and has to struggle to even survive. Everything that they do (almost) has a reason to it beyond a simple ""here have this quest"" and the fights throughout the whole of the show are competitive. For me this is a refreshing change from your regular isekai, where the MC is born or otherwise begins in an advantageous situation or with overpowered skills to correct for any minor starting disadvantages.The one complaint I have about the plot ties in with my next point. The side characters are just too weak, in both power and development. While I enjoyed watching our spider MC getting into tough fights and earning skills as result, the time I spent watching the side toons in what was essentially hero simulator felt wasted. I for one like numbers and stats and Kumo Desu did a pretty good job of introducing moderately powerful but most importantly reasonable skills to its main character, but this came at the cost of the side characters.And on the topic of power and side characters, I\'d like to mention that the CGI was appalling. I don\'t usually notice things like this, but during the fight scenes it felt like I was watching an amateur Blender animation at times. Not the effects or anything but the characters or mobs\' movements were just so... disjointed. This might put you off especially during what are supposed to be high intensity scenes. Though to be fair the ridiculous dialogue from the side characters might put you off more.Overall, I think that this show is worth a watch. At 24 episodes long, simply skip the portions that don\'t contain spider MC (you won\'t miss much).

Though to be fair the ridiculous dialogue from the side characters might put you off more.Overall, I think that this show is worth a watch. At 24 episodes long, simply skip the portions that don\'t contain spider MC (you won\'t miss much). While I rated it average, I\'ll still watch the second season, as the show took a really interesting turn near the end.', 'I was genuinely so surprised that people really enjoyed this anime but hey people got different tastes.It\'s a below average anime-storywise. Generally I don\'t mind those filler-like isekai animes.Concept and setting seems interesting enough. Everything else is just below average but still kinda watchable. It REALLY takes patience for some people, I guess.BUT, I do be finding myself feeling like I\'m being tortured because of kumo\'s long self dialogues. Every time when she starts talking to herself and trying to exaggerate her accomplishments etc. I find myself shouting ""stfu."" I get that the character is trying to be positive but it just...seems soo forced.It gives me the impression that this anime is trying so hard to be funny when it\'s actually really really boring. The reason why everybody feels that its slow-paced is due to the long long dialogues of Kumo talking because most of the time the story stops and her dialogues would take up more than half of the episodes. It just comes off as annoying. There were a few parts that had potential to be an average comedy relief but, they always fk it up by dragging the bit for too long.I liked a lot of Yuuki\'s work but the way that this character was portrayed took a LOT of patience.Overall, If you\'re really really really bored and have nothing else to watch you should give it a go. Honestly, this anime could\'ve been one of those enjoyable bad animes but because of -once again- the extremely long dialogues its a 3/10 for me. seems soo forced.It gives me the impression that this anime is trying so hard to be funny when it\'s actually really really boring.

felt like “Why am I watching this?...”So yeah this is my review about (Kumo desu ga,Nani ka?)~OPENING & ENDINGOP1:6/10ED1:8/10OP2:6/10ED2:5/10~STORYLINE:7/10...~STORYTELLING:7/10=This kind of show that we call it “pay off” which for kumo is episode 24 where the plotwist was revealed.(however it's kinda predictable for me)=The storytelling is so slow that I had to skip a certain scene=The whole 24 episode of this anime is literally [INTRODUCTION TO THE EVERY CHARACTER & THE WORLD].However I gotta say I still don't give a f*ck for any character which is poorly written(I summarized this in the character section below.).......Spoiler:I still don't understand why they gave kumoko the spotlight even though it's better for Shun to be the mc of this arc knowing that most of Kumoko's scene was from the other timeline.Its made the viewers felt so hard to get in the show the fact that you're viewing from 2 different perspective of 2 MC,Kumoko & Shun.If this was the 2nd season I'm not gonna complaint about it cuz everyone had knew who's the actual mc but after knew the plotwist it's made more sense to give the spotlight only to shun so that its gave the viewers more depht about the character itself knowing that most of the important character are from his perspective,before revealing the plotwist & giving less of Kumoko scene just like other character.Let's be honest, no one care about Shun's brother death lol.Shun's Brother~He's a good character but sadly he doesn't have enough screen time.His death is supposedly impact the storyline yet I felt nothing about his death.But I love every details in the story of the past timeline, like the egg of earth dragon that kumoko found was her friend & her skill hinting towards Shiraori.All that kind of thing made the show good but still you don't need to give kumoko that much of spotlight.Just start the show from shun perspective & made him the MC of that arc.It's 100% better that way......~Animation:6/10~CGI:7/10(I hate CGI but gotta give the credit of how well & decent the CGI in this show is)~Expression:5/10~CHARACTER=The whole 24 episode of the anime is about introduction

""[Short Review]# Pros1) Outstanding Story no matter what, its beyond typical Isekai Anime that i would not expect would be this good2) Very Good Enjoyment as there so many balance between grinding points / level, along with humour, relax time, conflict, etc. This Anime has that great balanced story. Kudos to whoever picking up the story part.3) 2D+3D CG with good graphcis, texture and those 3D Model. Altough the 3D CG has its own lackness wich i'll cover in #Cons.4) The character is really well build in 1-20 episodes, i can say that its zero to op. Its beyond my expectation actually.....5) There's also some character balancing.. between serious, moe, try-hard scene. You got the point.. so the balancement isnt only came from the story.6) They did really improve the MC from the manga when it comes to Spider mutation into human form. Well i guess its also good to mention that.# Cons1) Altough it has really good texture & 3D Model.. the CG movement is kinda rigid. Im expecting some cloth simulation or just add more face expression. Im thinking that the model isnt really have much nodes to handle with expression.2) At the last 20-24 episodes, the story is kinda mixed up / rushed. So im kinda a little left out with the story. I wish they could more better for the ending (like the the rest of it).3) Also the fighting scene at episode 21-23 is kinda meh. They decided using 3D-CG for battle scene wich is not very clever. Its lack of movement, and angry expression. Now im kinda hoping it was a 2D Fight scenery.4) Im kind of guy that always take attention to the details. Some 3D-CG Scene doesnt have mouth movement.. even though the character is talking / at dialogue[Summary]Im kinda dropping the point for this Anime from Solid 9 to 8 because of the Animation and the ending story that kinda rushed. Otherwise it was really a good ride and definitely deserve Season 2! 5) There's also some character balancing.. between serious, moe, try-hard scene.

For some reason the title of this anime, is but a small part of it. Its not ""Spider reincarnated"" Its ""entire classroom reincarnated."" So we get their bland stories too and introductions and with that it takes up just about the same amount of screen time as the main character does. Now thats all fine and dandy if they actually used that time for something meaningful, the main character of this show takes 15 episodes just to progress out of a cave because theres too...much screen time on these other reincarnated characters that just talk about useless shit for half the episode then we switch back to the spiders horrible cgi pov. They do that for all 24 episodes, not even joking. And guess what the best part is? The spider and the others dont even meet. And somehow the final episodes of the anime youd expect better animation but the cgi gets worse. A lot of things unexplained and skipped over for a 24 anime episode that im not going to bother explaining here. The only reason i watched it all was because i kept thinking the story was going to progress the next one.

While the MC looks OK for the most part, other monster designs look downright awful and the 2D is average at best.Another issue is the pacing! Despite being set for 24 episodes, it somehow manages to feel...rushed, skipping out on several important character moments.Overall, I still give it a 7 out of 10.While everything else is mediocre, the story and characters manage to carry this anime. rushed, skipping out on several important character moments.Overall, I still give it a 7 out of 10.While everything else is mediocre, the story and characters manage to carry this anime.', ""SPOILER WARNINGHoly crap, this anime felt like it went on for a very long time, it felt like One Piece for me, but comparing it to One Piece is the worst thing for me to do. It started great during the first cour, but then just nosedived towards the second cour.The plot of the anime is somewhat confusing, however in simpler terms, it's another isekai that focuses on two stories for the price of one, both eventually will merge into one, kind of like Sai's picturebook from Naruto Shippuden, but once again, comparing this anime to the spider anime is the last thing I'd do....Kumoko's story was intriguing to watch since she started weakly, but as the show went on, she became an overpowered protagonist just like the other isekai protagonists. At first, the human story was decent and evenly balanced, but towards the second cour, they focused too much on the humans' side, this is an anime about a spider. Nobody cares about the sideline characters.The story focused on a spider by the fan name Kumoko who reincarnated to survive in a cave-like dungeon while treating the world as a video game. After pulling through many deadly enemies to reach the goal of escaping to the surface, Kumoko realized that gets targeted by stronger enemies such as a demon lord, but in the end, joins up with them. The humans' side is like Fire Emblem Three Houses, which started with an academy phase, then a war phase. Many of the students reincarnate as noble figures, while training to use magic, the tension between reincarnations gets stronger. Eventually, it leads to a war breaking out between two empires. Although both stories combined were confusing, it's soon told that it takes place in two different timelines, making it even more complicated than it already has been.The characters were not terrible, but at the same time, some were likable while some were annoying. The central character, Kumoko carried the show with many comedic moments, and seeing her losing more of her sanity was hilarious to watch while rooting for her to succeed and make it to the surface. The fact that she's a talking spider makes scenes even more comedic since it makes her even more expressive than others. The humans, however, were a hit-and-miss to me. As the anime went on, I realized that they were all just not in their right mind, and I can't tell what they want to achieve. For example, the central human, Schlain should've received some character development, but in the end, was just a wannabe protagonist when he's not. Just seeing the human side of the anime was the worst, we wanted to see more of Kumoko instead of them.The music itself was catchy, with songs about Kumoko's story, while the endings were the best ones out of the entire soundtrack. The ending songs were crazy yet enjoyable to listen to as hearing Yuki Aoi sing like that brought on the craziness whenever she's voicing Kumoko. The same cannot be said for the animation as it just nosedived during the second half of the series. During the first cour, the CGI for most scenes wasn't bad, but if it weren't for the cave labyrinth, it would've been more noticeable, but it was decent enough to tolerate. The humans' side wasn't that bad, there were some nicely animated moments there, such as the fight scenes, with some odd CGI at times. However, the second cour animation got worse. Most of Kumoko's story was animated decently, but the human side was where the animation got worse, from odd camera angles to terrible CGI. The design was off in a few scenes, while the CGI was used too much and took away all the movement that they once had animated. This is the same studio that messed up Berserk, they somewhat improved since 2016, but the animation is still as terrible as before now.Overall, So I'm a Spider, So What? started great, but towards the end got worse. The second half containing bad animation and rushed plot points that we don't get to see. If they're going to do an anime with another story that's not the spider, then do it in another format.  The first cour was enjoyable, while the second cour took all the joy out of me. They even delayed the final episode because of production problems, but they still had issues with the quality of that episode. I would recommend this series to watch for the isekai genre, but if you disliked Berserk in 2016, then this series is not a good match. Once a great anime now reduced to a messy web of problems.

Well, another miss. The only interesting character is our Female main character who gets reincarnated as a spider, while the other students and a teacher from her class gets reincarnated as either humans or demons, with a very small number (2 other than our main lead if I remember correctly) as monsters, but those monsters are actually with mostly our human reincarnated, so they also belong to that story.

I personally think all of those in charge of producing such creatively bankrupt show should be removed due to their complete ineptitude in every aspect of the anime except the source material's story. And yet,  the anime team deemed themselves better  than the author and changed some of the story. Small may those changes seemed at first be. They undermined parts of the story and character progression. They nosily messed up something they shouldn't have hands in while doing their actual job...poorly. Firstly, the passible art was made with the blue light filter on, making everything look disgusting and unnatural. Furthermore, the animation team phoned it in and showed slide shows for the action sequences. They heavily relied on cg to do their job instead of doing it themselves. By the end of the anime, the animation can't even be called animation at all, replacing the side shows with still images that move around to imitate movement. Secondly, the audio design was uninspired and text-book generic, even the voice actors seemed bored. The audio team, not wanting to be beaten by the art team in term of incompetency, simply searched for sounds that somewhat fit the scenarios and called it done. Hell , they didn't even bother to time some with the animation. Lastly, the writers for the anime have never written anything in their entire life. They simply don't know how show a character personality without simplistically saying it directly to the audience. In conclusion, everyone worked on this anime beside the author should all find different jobs outside of this industry. poorly.

The other half is probably the most boring story I have  watched this year. It's an interesting dichotomy to a somewhat unique presentation of a heroine and completely bland everyone else. If I could give it two scores: Kumiko's solo adventure would be an 8, the rest would be 2.So, I was frequently laughing when our heroine makes self-aware quips, sings songs, dances in the midst of all the horror or gets into arguments with the generic isekai elements. I loved pretty much...every aspect of the Kumo story line, from how she wins fights in predictable fashion and the juxtaposition of her position in the world.However, as the two story lines begin to merge and we get a bigger picture of the general situation, the anime begins to drop off in quality significantly. I already suffered through the reincarnation elements that are all too well known to isekai fans. So, when we move away from our heroine's origin story, it becomes far less fun.The animations leave a lot to be desired, as many have mentioned. The CGI is fine, but it's very outdated and kind of whatever. The main character has some very fun animations, but there are scenes (looking at you final battle) that are bizarrely bad.The soundtrack is fun, I particularly love the ending song in the first half of the anime sung by Aoi Yūki herself.So overall, I think it's a very fun watch if you can tolerate some run-of-the-mill story lines of guys who don't give up when facing adversity and the like. Also, you have to endure the late 90s CGI as well. every aspect of the Kumo story line, from how she wins fights in predictable fashion and the juxtaposition of her position in the world.However, as the two story lines begin to merge and we get a bigger picture of the general situation, the anime begins to drop off in quality significantly.

There are some plot points that are not fully explained, nor easy to interpret, but as you continue to watch, the story comes together.The fusion of two-time lines was wonderfully done, and was confusing enough, yet simple to understand once the pieces were aligned.While the story was somewhat slow and a little mundane, I could see a four-year old girl (and maybe me) enjoying Kumo Desu ga, Nani Ka?. One comparison I...would draw, is that her voice reminds you of Asta at the beginning of Black Clover, unbearably unique yet it grows on you.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? does not leave you with the usual depression or excitement you feel after an anime, but one of wonder. I have not felt this weird feeling in my chest after watching any anime. One that motivates me to watch the second season, or whatever they release afterwards.The isekai moments were the usual, nothing insane, other than the time aspect I mentioned earlier. Anime's that receive 10/10 for me would ones that cause me to jump out of my chair with excitement and swing at the air, to fight the demons that reside in my heart. This anime was not special in the ways the fight scenes were animated, the characters were thought out, or the plot conveyed. The impact or the feeling of wanting more, craving more, created by this anime is hard to describe, but the feeling of pressure on my chest reminiscing this anime is one I have never had. would draw, is that her voice reminds you of Asta at the beginning of Black Clover, unbearably unique yet it grows on you.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? does not leave you with the usual depression or excitement you feel after an anime, but one of wonder.

It is less so in execution. It becomes convoluted and almost boring at certain points. I never thought I'd say that about an anime where the main protagonist is an arachnid.The core idea here isn't bad. Having the protagonist reincarnate into a monster instead of a human has been done before, but not exhaustively. Combine that with an entire high school class reincarnating together, layering dynamics from their previous lives with their current ones, and you have two interesting plot lines. Sadly, they never really merge together cohesively.Jumping back and forth...between time periods is confusing until you realize what's going on. What's happening in the past ends(the spider doing her thing) up being much more interesting then the present, which feels like a slog just to set up a huge conflict. Said conflict is not even close to being resolved after 24 episodes, leaving the audience with a cliff hanger I presume is meant to be explored in the second season. Personally, I feel very unsatisfied with this conclusion at the moment.The characters are yet another point where this show misses the mark. Save for the protagonist, most of the characters are bland and uninteresting. And it shouldn't be all that hard to make them interesting. They've been reincarnated into an entirely different world, have things like magic, have changed races, ages and even genders. There is plenty to work with there. Instead they all end up being generic isekai characters.Other than Kumoko, the only relatively interesting members of the cast are Fei and Katia. Like Kumoko, Fei reincarnates into a monster and we see some of her regrets regarding her previous life. And then there's Katia, who was born as a boy but reincarnated as a girl. The storyline regarding accepting her situation doesn't really go anywhere, despite the potential being there. I regard her as another missed opportunity.As for Kumoko herself, it's a mixed bag. She's likable, if a little over enthusiastic. She tries her best to stay positive despite her bleak situation, albeit with a heavy does of sarcastic. Her character rides a thin line between entertaining and obnoxious, and bounces back and forth between one or the other. With that said, she is still very much the highlight of the show.Now for the art... Be warned that CGI is utilized heavily here. It isn't awful, but it can definitely be jarring at times. I'm guessing that this was due to budget constraints. The art is also fine. It's not horrible, but it's not necessarily good either. It's mainly just meh.Overall, it's an interesting concept. If you can get past the boring bits that constitute as haphazard world building, it's not terrible. But it's never truly enjoyable unless Kumoko is on screen. between time periods is confusing until you realize what's going on.

For example, I rated this show a 4, but if the story did not include the parts with the humans, it would be an 8 or higher. That\'s about it, a comment I saw on an episode put it a really good way, ""the...humans part of the story is aggressively uninteresting"".

The storytelling is very reminiscent of Baccano, shifting back and forth between two differing Point of Views. It can be confusing at times, but things start making sense as more information is revealed later in the story.The story itself was serviceable, with the various training arcs Kumoko goes through being quite fun as she finds herself in more precarious situations each time. She often encounters opponents with higher stats than her, and must try to outwit them even from disadvantaged positions.The anime becomes a bit of a chore when it...transitions towards the perspective of Kumoko\'s classmates as they are not as well characterised as her and end up putting a wet blanket over whatever fun the viewer was having with Kumoko. The story also ends just as the ""Evil"" Faction\'s motives are about to be discussed and Kumoko starts to get involved with the main plot.All the characters were generic besides Kumoko and whoever Kumoko interacted with, as well as the teacher who had some character development towards the end.The animation in this anime is middling at best. Extensive use of CGI during some fight scenes made them look like a PS2 cutscenes, while some moments which involved many projectiles on screen were animated quite appropriately.I think this anime is worth the watch even if just for the MC alone, as her antics never fail to amuse. transitions towards the perspective of Kumoko\'s classmates as they are not as well characterised as her and end up putting a wet blanket over whatever fun the viewer was having with Kumoko.

However it is made very difficult to watch later on in the series because of some very obvious conflicting design choices.

If it was just another cookie-cutter isekai I probably would've given it a 6, as everything from music to the animation to the character designs are painfully generic, except for the cgi monsters, for the most part they looked alright as far as cgi goes, and I liked kumuko's designs more as she evolved......but failing your premise this badly knocks it down at least 2 pegs. but failing your premise this badly knocks it down at least 2 pegs."", 'Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?I am a spider, so what?Another isekai straight from an infinitely huge pile of isekai.Now, what does this isekai do to stand out and win over the audience?The answer is, he has a lovable chaotic spider in Kizuna AI format.

The only thing I liked about it is that the characters had a healthy amount of mistrust and thus didn\'t blindly say ""okay, I believe you"" to everyone.The protagonist, on the other hand, was a running laughing stock, in the sense of being a combination of a self-confident combative personality, an introvert, and a comedian at the same time.

There are two different moods and vibes going on and I don't like it.

Probably will drop"", 'Conclusion up front, so as to not waste your time:The supporting Characters with whom you spent roughly half the running time of the anime are all infuriatingly boring, empty shells. The animations are below average at best and hideous at worst. The plot has one neat revelation but relies on said shells to be effective. The protagonist however has a unique, upbeat yet egocentric personality and is great to watch. If you ignore everything but her, you can have some fun with this.Detailed Review:There is not much more to be said about the animations other than the fact they are riddled with bad CGI.The supporting...cast is the most basic collection of fantasy stereotypes one can think of. There is the obligatory ""Hero"" who wants to save everybody, because his job title is ""Hero"". You have his good looking sidekicks who like and support him all the way. The envious idiot who wants the glory of the hero title is a douchebag and also exists. The cute little elf girl who, naturally, is the teacher of the students as she always has everyone\'s best interests in mind. One could go on.Incidentally, the ""Isekai"" scenario is irrelevant when applied to this group because nothing is done with it. There is no character development and you don\'t see them struggle with anything significant. The ""Hero"" was the nice guy in his world and is essentially that here as well. His sidekicks where his friends and are now. The douchebag was and is one still. The bully girl is now the dragon pet and made an instant one-eighty in terms of personality because of course she would and no one bats an eye. Their stories are uninspired and predictable, every time I see them I am beyond bored.The Plot moves towards an interesting revelation but it never feels like the ensemble of extras actually get a say in it. Bones are thrown in their path and they simply follow them. That would be fine if they were treated as side characters with limited screen time, however, said revelation relies on this bunch, so you spent essentially half of the entire anime with this uninteresting cast of personality templates, which, frankly, seems poorly planned.The protagonist, ""Kumoko"", is the only redeeming factor of this anime. She is an enthusiastic, joyful oddball despite the fact that she is reborn in her lonesome and in immediate danger. Or maybe she is because of that? Her previous life\'s story is not particularly original, but what the past urges her to do now is. This spider girl is driven by a self-centered desire that stands in stark contrast to her cheerfulness and is simply enjoyable to watch.If you are intrigued by ""Kumoko"" you can give this a shot. Whether it is worth it or not is debatable, although I don\'t think this anime deserves the fairly high rating it sits on now. I sure had my fun watching ""Kumoko"", but was left frustrated at the wasted time seeing the adventures of picture book heroes as well as the grisly animations. The author writes a good main character and has a nice idea but fails to give said character the support he needs and forces his idea to work instead of tying it in organically.

My review is not going to go full in depth on the show, but I wanted to talk about a few things.  The show really drew me into the world (surprisingly).  I thought this would be another anime I would drop after a few episodes, but I am glad that I didn't, and actually plan to read the manga and LN, as I have heard that the anime cut out some character development.  The reason that I have to give this...show a 8 (I almost gave it a 7, but it made me laugh, which is actually hard for an anime to do for me), which I greatly wish I didn't, was because of the animation.  If you don't know, some of the anime was outsourced to another company, and it was so bad, that episodes had to be completely redone, up until some of the later ones, where there was not enough time, and only some scenes were redone.  The cgi for the spider and her fight scenes were really well done, but once the people began to be animated in cgi, it took a nosedive in quality.  I want to reiterate, most of the cgi was GREAT, some of the best I have seen, but towards the end, the quality got much worse. I hope that the studio will not make the same outsourcing mistake as last time, as I think if they hadn't maybe I would have given this a score of 9.  All in all, I highly recommend watching, but be prepared for some cgi tomfoolery towards the end. show a 8 (I almost gave it a 7, but it made me laugh, which is actually hard for an anime to do for me), which I greatly wish I didn't, was because of the animation.

Yeah to be a spider or not to be is the everlasting question in this show.I am very torn with this anime as on one point I love the hyper OP brainless story of our little Spider. After reading and enjoying the manga I was really happy to see that it held up to it in the anime. Love her joy of leveling up and just living as she please.But I was really confused about the really boring parts of the students as they didn't show up in the manga even once so took me a while to understand...that it was just some sidestories in the LN made into half the plot. Always groaned when it switched over to them as their story was just bland.So overall I really enjoyed the spider part of the show but the other kinda made it frustration to watch.Still enjoyed it and will keep reading the manga hoping for a season 2 if it ever gets one. that it was just some sidestories in the LN made into half the plot.

Brianna Knickerbocker as the VA and the two opening songs.Everything else about this is mediocre at best. The animation, the camera angles, using too much 3d characters, the screeching jp VA in the ending songs, revealing the identity of the a character too early. They even changed many aspects of the story from the novel for no reason.I\'ve read 11 volumes of the novel so far and they\'re really good. And this is a mediocre adaptation of it by people who don\'t care about the story. ', ""It's possibly a cultural thing in Japan to be derivative of your predecessors in an effort to outdo them. Since this series is the grandchild in a lineage of isekai novels, starting with Tsukimichi, and then Reincarnated as a Slime, I feel this author tried way too hard to differentiate itself from its inspirations, creating a really ambitious story and even more complex method of story telling (non-linear, intersecting timelines), but its execution was rather poor.If this was a western series, the TV adaptation would have no issue with telling the story differently, but since this is Japanese, the anime is just an advertisement for...the light novels/manga, and the lack of care displayed in the production issues the anime suffered really demonstrates taking your already invested audience for granted.But even without attributing malice to ignorance, the story just had a habit of overstaying it's welcome, and I'm not just irrationally hating the human side of the story, but even with the spider's monologuing, and although her voice acting is generally charming, left going for too long, the high pitch noises became really grating.I will give the studio credit for making original opening/ending music for the show, even though I enjoyed the second half's music better. The spider's story was generally entertaining, but ultimately, the pay off just isn't sweet enough for all that you had to sit through for its resolution.I would love to give the author another chance if they decide to write another story after this, but since this one was self-published, it would have truly benefitted greatly from treatment/mentorship from someone more experienced overseeing it.Final Score (starting from 10, counting down)-1 Poor integration of side story/characters-1 Spider's main story drags on in some spots, I found myself spacing out or turning down volume when actress got too loud.-1 convoluted plot-2 Poor animation*** 5/10 *** the light novels/manga, and the lack of care displayed in the production issues the anime suffered really demonstrates taking your already invested audience for granted.But even without attributing malice to ignorance, the story just had a habit of overstaying it's welcome, and I'm not just irrationally hating the human side of the story, but even with the spider's monologuing, and although her voice acting is generally charming, left going for too long, the high pitch noises became really grating.I will give the studio credit for making original opening/ending music for the show, even though I enjoyed the second half's music better.

Nevertheless, the other parts of the story were annoying, even if they hold some parts that really explain what's going on. However, it was boring and lengthy. I only watched the parts that really had me hooked, which, obviously, was Wakaba's parts. So the story itself was fair aside from the increasingly boring parts that I totally skipped. The art was nice, although the female demon lord character was weird in certain areas. I will only watch for Wakaba, but other than that.. Would I really recommend it as a whole?

(or So I\'m A Spider, So What? as it\'s called in English) is one of the better isekais I\'ve seen to date.Story9/10The isekai has a genuinely cool and unique setting I\'d love to see more of. The main character, Kumo, gets reincarnated in a RPG-like world, but unlike other anime where it\'s usually at the very least a humanoid character in a generally safe area, she\'s instead a tiny spider who has just been born into one of the most dangerous places in the world. This is immediatley an intense stuggle for survival...for her as she has to survive against the labyrinth\'s many dangerous foes. She thankfully retains her human memories and knowledge of being a gamer, the latter which becomes especially helpful as the world actually functions with RPG-like rules, coming with levels, skills and even holographic screens to view the information regarding them on. Slowly, Kumo goes from the most inconsequential mob to a most terrifying arachnid.This is an INCREDIBLE way to do an isekai in my opinion, and even after Kumo goes past the point of raid boss, the story manages to consistently apply the ""there\'s always a bigger fish"" principle and make things tense, while incorporating any skills or abilities that Kumo has gained very well. When she eventually finds herself overshadowing the smaller beings around her, it\'s funny to see just by how much she does.Now there\'s actually a second POV the anime takes: Turns out the entire school class Kumo is in was put into this world, and unlike Kumo, they\'re generally among the humanoid type. These parts of the anime are much more of the generic sort, and while it still manages to hold my attention with some high points and worldbuilding, this is where the low points tend to be.The anime manages to merge these two POVs pretty well, and while Kumo\'s perspective is much more memorable, the other isn\'t especially bad either. It also keeps some questions in the air, such as why the class was reincarnated in the first place and how this world actually works. While there are definitely some low points, the isekai manages to keep it high for the majority of the show, and it shows us a peep at the potential of the darker side of isekai. Love it, I want more.Art6/10The art isn\'t bad for the majority of the show, it\'s just not very outstanding. I would\'ve given this part a 7 or 8 if there wasn\'t one particular episode where it just gets real bad.You know how there\'s a lot of people complaining about CGI? There\'s a particular episode in the end of the first season where I completely understood why.It was used in a boring or even confusing way, and just doesn\'t stand up at all, and let me re-emphasize this, AT ALL to the rest of the entire show. That particular episode fortunately was the only one I was actually groaning through the majority of it, and while it ended with a decently high note I NEVER want to watch that crap again. Please, don\'t make me watch that. I don\'t want my brain to die again.Sound8/10It was pretty good. There were no awkward moments regarding sound as far as I remember, and both the OPs slap (and MY GOD THE ED IS GREAT).Regarding voice acting, Aoi Yuuki reminded me of just how godly hers is. As the voice of Kumo, she manages to sell her entire personality as an eccentric gaming nerd with flying colors. I already knew her from other works such as her acting in Fate, and she\'s just as great here as she is in that.Character8/10Kumo is easily the best character in the show, and maybe even in isekai anime in general.Her former self is depicted as a shy and quiet individual who just sits in the background of the class for all of the time.However, you might remember I said earlier (if you didn\'t skip it) that she\'s a nerd.In her thoughts is where shit gets crazy.She\'s goddamn entertaining and adorable.Kumo\'s mind is almost the exact opposite of her outer self, and since this is where we get pretty much all of her dialogue, it NEVER gets boring. She likes making jokes to herself regarding the world around her, she has a weird yet surprisingly reasonable way of thinking, and her past as a gamer makes her a great fit in the RPG world she finds herself in. However, when things get dire for her (and that\'s very frequent), her intellect and creativity carry her to unimaginable levels, allowing her to (barely) overcome it, and it gets better the more abilities she has to work with. She\'s the kind of person you could give a toy mallet to and somehow find her defeating Godzilla with.As she gets stronger however, she gets somewhat bored. While she never puts the need for survival aside, her increasingly large skillset and power make the other monsters mostly a joke for her. When she finally manages to get out of the labyrinth, the dynamic shifts from battle for surival to exploring the world and helping out where she can. However, the humanoid species in the world get a lot less from leveling, and as the raid boss that she is at that point, she can solve most problems regarding them just by breathing on them. While it gets considerably less intense, it still manages to hold up due to Kumo\'s personality and the One Punch Man style situation she\'s now in, and there are still plenty of moments where she\'s actually threatened.The other characters are more of the generic type, and while I don\'t really dislike them, I wish they were better. They tend to fall into cliches like the chosen one, evil rival and overprotective teacher. There\'s one character in particular I wish they did more with: One of the girls is a monster just like Kumo, and she actually bullied Kumo back in the former world. She feels guilty about this, and wishes to find Kumo in order to apologize to her. While I think this is a neat setup, her motivations get put more and more on the sideline until she\'s basically just a dragon supporting the hero character, and she doesn\'t do enough to really justify liking her for me. I have not read the novel, but I really hope this gets better in any potential later seasons. As they are, Kumo\'s classmates are generally just forgettable, and that\'s unfortunate.Enjoyment8/10While Kumo\'s classmates would get a 5/10 in terms of how enjoyable it is to follow them, Kumo herself is easily a 10/10. She makes the anime so enjoyable to watch and her parts never got boring.In terms of story, there\'s some real potential here. Aside from the unique setting, there\'s intrigue in the mystery the world provides, and the story is told in such a way that makes it gratifying to find out certain things that would be revealed more explicitly later. I hope the story expands on this in later seasons.Pretty much all of the boring stuff falls under the parts that do not involve Kumo (and my god does the one episode I talked about earlier really grind my gears), and while I wish it was more consistent, I can\'t complain too much. I really enjoyed the show in general and if there were a season 2 I would binge all of it on the spot.All in all, while there are some parts that aren\'t too good, in general Kumo\'s broken back after carrying the show to Pluto and the unique take on the isekai genre makes this show a must-watch for me.

Can you watch it and enjoy it? Yes, sure, you can. But does it deserve the 8-10 scores some are giving here, trying to equal it to some of the greatest works of animation ever done? No, of course not.It...is an ok anime. Another over-the-top ""reincarnation into a weird creature"" anime like ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"", but it lacks the heart of that other show. Mainly because the main protagonist doesn\'t really have any friends and that makes the show just be a long grind of enemies.The plot is all over the place. It seems it can\'t decide if it wants to be a fantasy or a videogame anime, if it wants ""gods"" or ""administrators""... then even Mecha\'s make an appearance... seems the show doesn\'t really know what it is.The story is ok, but the first 15 episodes don\'t expose the story well. After that it gets a bit better once pieces start falling into place. But by then it took so long for the hero to start meeting some people that most of the audience will be lost by then.Music, animation, fight-scenes... all average, not really worth commenting on. Yes it uses some CGI, but I don\'t like to use that as an excuse. There are plenty of shows that use CGI where combat feels impactful, but this one doesn\'t. It feels like the director said ""that slime was a success, so try to make something similar"" and the studio rushed this one out.That\'s about all i can say. is an ok anime.

In a world with slimes can absorb everything to become OP, where demon misfits with eyes able to destroy anything become OP, or an elder liche who has a staff made of literal world breaking magic become OP, or a demon lord immune to ALL magic that can enslave people become OP, there exits a simple spider with a simple dream:  To just survive....Not to conquer the world, not to get a big tiddie harem, or to save it, but just to survive and get stronger as a result.  This creates Nani ka?\'s biggest charm and where it succeeds while most fail.Instead of creating a power fantasy where we see a character automatically become One Punch Man in another world and every Dick and Jenny lick the toes of said protagonist, I\'m a Spider, So What? actually makes our heroine earn every skill and ability she has.  What you effectively have is the greatest David vs Goliath story told in anime, where ridiculous matchups are made awesome and surprisingly exciting.  Ever wondered if a spider could beat a snake?  How about a chimpanzee?  What about a mother freakin\' dragon?  Such fights I\'d expect in a comedy like Is This A Zombie, but they work surprisingly well in this fantasy/Isekai about a spider.That ends the highlights... Now it\'s time to discuss the black elephant, or should I say the dumb humans, in the room.  The perfect power progression of this show aside, my 9s and enjoyment of 10 end in a 6 because, in a show where you have a tiny spider overcoming the most devastating of opponents, with an actual endearing personality to boot, you have an entire subplot focusing on the wimpy ""Hero"" and his allies.  I literally felt myself get sick whenever I was drawn away from Spider Girl\'s antics to nearly entire episodes focusing on a boring, generic fantasy anime WITHIN my awesome monster anime.  I mean, the show had something incredible, but it lacked so much confidence by it DARING to have an Isekai protagonist earn their OPness it had to include something normies would drool at.  I can guarantee everyone giving this show scores below a five focus on this pedantic subplot, and I can\'t blame them for it.  However, I love seeing monsters triumph over impossible odds and sticking it to the cruel, dumb, naive humans, so I consider this anime at least tolerable.  My enjoyment is strictly a 10 by me skipping all the human parts and seeing what antics Spider Girl is up to.I honestly think ALL Isekai fans should watch this show, especially creators who want to draft their own.  It perfectly shows how to create power progression in a series without making the show boring.  It\'s Overlord Season 1 in all its glory, maybe a little better...

The first few episodes were enjoyable regardless of me not really caring about the shun and other humans. The CGI was bearable at the start but does it goes downhill real fast, the last few fight scenes actually gave me eye cancer. The movements are so ass, the robots are turbo ass. The pacing is also absolute garbage. The original light novel has 16 volumes and by the end of 24 episodes we are almost at the ending already?? HUH???

However there are very clear and hard to ignore flaws with the show that really drag down the show.Starting with the things that were good about the show I have to say the main character is truly the thing holding up the show. The vocal performance given by aoi yuuki is amazing as always and shows the feelings and personality of the character so well with all of her major and minor inflections depending on the situation. The slow grind to get all the skills that make her able to put up...a fight against monsters and the proper use and combination of them that let her win against strong odds is honestly something that most isekai anime screw up or just ignore in favor of one or two overpowered abilities. However that\'s really all I can say this show does because most other things are done a bit poorly.Unfortunately where the show falls flat is mainly the other characters and CGI. Starting with the other characters I think they\'re relatively flat, annoying and one dimensional. With Shun being a very generic do gooder with no depth and a very strange obsession with his brother, and a huge \'\' I wanna be a hero"" thing that\'s just straight up childish. Unfortunately the other characters are so bland that I can\'t remember their name so that should tell you enough here. One character is just there to be the bro who got reincarnated as a girl and its funny until you realize that\'s just it, another one is just a religious fanatic who has very little and very close-minded dialog and only goes on about religion good and bad thing bad. The rival character is just an asshole, that\'s really it he\'s just a privileged wannabe and is arrogant and unlikeable in every way. The teacher is just a loli with secrets and the little sister wants to turn this anime into incest. There\'s also this dragon girl who has a little bit of character but it isn\'t really used in any way so it\'s just wasted. Overall the characters are bad except our lead.Now for the CGI... it\'s bad. Bad CG doesn\'t necessarily ruin a show but it definitely can drop a score down by 1 or 2. A show with good CG can look amazing (eg. demon slayer, AoT, beastars, etc.) However here it is just poorly utilized, doesn\'t even try to blend in with the setting and overall is the clunky mess you expect from bad CG. There are even bits where it looks like you\'re watching at 30fps. That being said the 2d animation is pretty decentThe sound design is also pretty terrible with generic effects for explosions and environmental effects that sound 2 decades old, footsteps and movement sounding very inconsistent with an example being a large beast sprinting at the MC and it sounding like they barely carry any weight. I could honestly make more believable thud sounds walking in my apartment. The main character walking sounds are like ceramic clacking, some magic sounds like eggs hitting concrete, and those are just the things that pop into my head at this moment. The foley effects are just weak in general.The story is mediocre. MC is stuck in a dungeon trying to escape while the demon army wants to invade the humans for no particular reason. It\'s standard, it works meh.In conclusion,  6/10 and Kumoko deserves 5 of those points for being able to carry a pretty bad isekai to being enjoyable at in its highs and tolerable in its lows just because you know she\'ll be back on screen soon enough.OP: bland, no personality, lame song, nothing exceptional about it.ED: Absolute banger, kumoko\'s personality shines and the VA definitely does a great job showing it. The lyrics also have a good bit of meaning but unfortunately spoil a lot of her skills she\'ll get so look them up at your own discretion.TLDR- 6/10 great MC, fun journey with level ups, bad characters, bad cg, lame sound design, meh story a fight against monsters and the proper use and combination of them that let her win against strong odds is honestly something that most isekai anime screw up or just ignore in favor of one or two overpowered abilities.

It\'s not really a lighthearted story, but it\'s not super serious either. Its overall tone balance is close to Re:Zero, especially with the protagonist who is constantly switching between comedy and mental torture. I enjoyed how they actually explored why a world would have video-game-esque features, like levels and skills. That usually gets brushed over in isekais.However, the production value was fairly terrible, especially the last episode. This is probably the least important part of an anime in my opinion (I liked Arifureta even though it...also didn\'t have great art). But these problems become more noticeable when the story isn\'t interesting -- like when the other students were on screen. The main human character was bland as sand, and his most defining trait, his love for his hero brother, isn\'t really justified by the little flashback the show gave us. We\'re just told he loves his brother instead of thoroughly shown his past interactions with him. I would have rather have had more focus on the brother, or on Wakaba\'s classmate who used to bully her.I really appreciate what the author was reaching for with the split storytelling, but it honestly didn\'t add much to the show for me besides being a gimmick. Using the ""human"" story as the serious one and the ""spider"" story as comic relief just made the humans seem boring. If the characters in the human story were more interesting I think it could have been a masterful way to tell an epic tale. Unfortunately they just aren\'t for the most part.That said, this is definitely a better than average isekai for me. I\'d put it just above Death March to a Parallel World and just below Konosuba.

It turned out to be have the makings of an epic series, so long as sequels don\'t mess things up, with a little bit of the feel of Gurren Lagann, Tensei Slime, Overlord, and Danmachi combined. There is a bit of a grotesque element to it but is balanced out by the lightheartedness of the main character.Some people won\'t like this because the storyline is convoluted and also jumps between two chronologies without any introduction.

There's a slightly larger amount of time we spend in the dark cave before the heroine becomes overpowered, and I kind of liked that slow evolution. The spider is great, and stays funny, even if they don't change much and shrug off stuff that would leave anyone traumatized for life (that's fine, not every anime needs to be gritty dark and realistic).But once in a while, like basically every other episode, you jump...into a different storyline about... I dunno, cardboard characters. Maybe those would have more personality? It's so bland that even *I* noticed, and even a minimum amount of story/personality is generally good enough for me.

A classroom full of high school students are mysteriously transported to a fantasy world, where they're given new names, new appearances, and even new families. Rather than dying and being reincarnated as a teen/adult, as with most isekai protagonists, these particular characters start from the beginning, and grow up properly (not that we really ever get to see this.) What's more, they all remember their lives on Earth.Like her classmates, Kumoko was also summoned into this new world, but UNLIKE them, she was reborn as a monster spider!Kumoko is what saves the anime for me. She's charming, witty, funny, and...the battles she fights in an effort to level up (yes, this world has the game mechanics of abilities, job classes, and leveling up) are quite creative. She could easily carry a single cour all on her own.Unfortunately, this is where the anime takes a nosedive, barreling straight into the ground. The story diverges into two separate timelines: one follows Kumoko from the time of her birth as she wanders through the caves that make up a large portion of her world, and then to the surface. The other one follows the majority of Kumoko's classmates in their day to day lives, and this is where things fall apart. I really could not care less about her other classmates. Their half of the story is by and large boring and forgettable. I really couldn't tell you any of their names.Because of this split method of storytelling that hardly ever overlaps (both because Kumoko is largely subterranean, and because her story takes place several years before her classmates' portion), the events are largely separate, and really don't give you the chance to familiarize yourself with the world they live in, why they're there, what they're supposed to be doing...We get practically NOTHING, in twenty-four episodes. That should have been more than enough time to give us at least a rough idea of these core concepts.The worst part is, the classmates' portion of the story had potential. Some of them get reincarnated as different races, and one even changes sex. There's also the interesting detail that, even though they all still have their memories from their previous lives, not all of their personalities remain the same as they were. For example, one girl inexplicably becomes a religious fanatic determined to purge the world of anyone who has a certain ability.But instead, we get what seems like random scenes slapped together in only a vague order, with no rhyme or reason for what's actually going on. None of the characters get developed, both in their former lives on Earth, or in the new world.Kumoko, on the other hand, is completely different. In her previous life, she was a quiet girl who kept to herself, and was often bullied. As a spider, she becomes much more outgoing and confident. I appreciated that, even though the change happened VERY quickly, rather than gradually.And then we have the other part of what I disliked about this anime. The art. The monsters that Kumoko finds herself fighting are all 3D, and badly-done 3D, at that. As another reviewer said, they look like something out of the PS2 era. Kumoko herself is also rendered in 3D, but she, at least, was done well.As the anime draws to a close, the human characters start turning into 3D models at random, with seemingly no rhyme or reason for why (the only thing I can figure is budget constraints, so quality took a hard hit.) Other characters find themselves completely frozen, so the animators didn't have to worry about adding in movement. Corners were cut, hard, and it shows. The last four episodes or so were painful to watch, especially since the spotlight gets handed over to the classmates' part of the story, and Kumoko is relegated to a side character in her own anime.One thing I did quite enjoy was the discrepancy between the cute version of Kumoko that we usually see, and how she truly looks from an outsider's POV. To them, she isn't the adorable little spider with big pink eyes and cute little horns. She's a terrifying monster who is probably out for their blood.I really only finished this anime thanks to Kumoko and her shenanigans.

So good, that I picked up the manga because I wanted to see more.Maybe I shouldn't have done that because it ruined the Anime for me. Mostly because the stappeld on story about the other classmates looks now worse then before.Why you might ask? Well in the Manga it does not exist. (yet)The Story about the humans was already quite boring. I see they try to do some Game of Thrones stuff with intrigues and whatnot however this does not work with stereotypical harem charakterisation.You might notice that I dislike the Human Charakters quite a lot. I dislike them so...much that I force myself not to skip their parts.I noticed the timeskip between the spiderstory and the humanstory quite early. And all the red-herings that where added where also very noticable.

That comes never up again.Endword: The manga only imporved over time and I hope that this also applies to the anime, however there are signs.... I realy love my little spidergirl, don't ruin her...Also I ignore the human/classmate story parts, skip it, it's worthless junk.Edit:I finished the series and I have to correkt some things.Story:-Spiderpart gets from good to mediocre-Humanpart gets from bad to extremly annoying.Art:Later parts becomes extremly bad. 2D art is very lacking and they added quite bad 3D parts. Also there are more and more cuts where I could not follow any fight.Characters:-Spiderpart is just a bit worse-Humanpart .... whoever came up with them should never work at any creative job ever again.

If it doesn't get a season 2, then consider the rating a 5.The main character Kumoko is literally a living meme.  I enjoy her internal monologues and I think the game elements are decent as far as game elements go.  There are times where she survives when she shouldn't, noticeable plot armor is noticeable, but it is fun.  That's what the show is meant to be, fun.The B side...story with Shun and friends is slower on the buildup, and at times downright boring, but it does make me appreciate the time with Kumoko even more.  Shun and Co. is where the plot progresses, mostly.Art wise; there is some noticeable CGI, but it's not the worst I've ever seen.

In the end, the anime was a fun enough watch but overall pretty medioce especially if you\'re familiar with the source material.StoryThe anime\'s storyline was surprisingly well preserved considering how many switches in POV there are and how far apart these events take place time-wise. I don\'t think that was easy to pull off because it could have become very confusing, very quickly. So I\'ll give them credit for the storyline\'s adaptation. Even though some events were changed...or merged or left out, it was still more true to the original work than I had expected. That said, compared to the novel I do feel as if certain events progressed much quicker and that inevitably lead to loss of depth and nuance.CharactersWhat very much bothered me at first was the drastic change in perceived personality for Kumoko, the titular spider main character. The voice actress they chose for the role really didn\'t do it for me, and the over-the-top humor lines seems forced. In general, for all characters in the anime there is much less nuance, less character development and everyone seems to grow much stronger in a very short amount of time without working too hard for it or having to endure much suffering. In the novels you can really feel the hard work that Kumoko, for example, puts in to survive. In the anime it feels much more like a given that she\'ll win against whatever threat she\'s fighting now. When she\'s in a tough situation she\'ll make a joke and wins or survives by what feels to the viewer like a deus ex machina. In the novels this feels much less the case. In any case, characters and humor were far less effective in the anime than I had hoped. Let\'s not get started on the bland and dull human main character.VisualsThe 2D animation was mediocre at the best of times, and the 3D CGI was absolutely horrible. Especially the important battles fell flat because of it. That\'s all I\'m going to say about that.AudioThe soundtrack was forgettable while random sound effects such as shooting webbing and the sound of impact in combat were actually pretty decent. I didn\'t particularly care for the voice acting for any of the characters. And that\'s rare, because in most series at least one character stands out in that regard.Overall I did enjoy my time with the series. I\'ve been looking forward to it for a while now and I hope we get more. Do we need more isekai series?

I get what the author is trying to do, they are trying to create world building outside of where the anime takes place most of the time, but by doing this they completely kill all enjoyment when you realize you will be spending the whole episode with the generic Isekai characters.Episode 17 is a prime example of this as it completely feels...like the pace of the anime comes to a grinding halt just so they can expand on the generics. Whenever the humans become the focus I really have to try my hardest not to skip.Basically if the cut out the humans and focused on the spider this could have been on par with something like That time I got Reincarnated as a slime. It could have easily been a 9/10 story wise but the generics bring it down to a 6.As for the art, I find it kinda hilarious to think about as the spider's cg was really well done. It can look strange at times but for the most part they did a good job. Some of the monsters however look horrible. Its clear that if the monsters would not reappear but they needed a large number of them they used the cg to make things go along quicker. Still for single monsters and common occurring monsters they look good. On the other hand when we follow the generic Isekai group everything feels bland. Switching from the full CG protagonist who looks really good to the generic group feels off putting at times. It could be better but right now its like a 7.Characters like mention before are mixed. You either have the generic group which are like a 2/10 character wise or we follow the protagonist who is like an 8/10 character wise. It also doesn't help that the MC from the generic group is way even beyond generic and that there was clearly a better MC we could have followed. If we instead followed the one seeking power it would have been a better dynamic story wise. Overall its like a 6/10 character wise with it probably being a 7 or 8 if we didn't have the generics.Then we have enjoyment. Basically what I said before. If we didn't follow the generic group my enjoyment probably would have been a 10 because when we follow the spider MC it is very enjoyable to watch. I hate that I have to put it at a 6/10 but the generics brought down my enjoyment so much.Overall the anime is a 6/10.

In this regard, it's kind of like a fusion between Arifureta and Slime Tensei. Basically all of my problems with it come in the last third of the series.Spoiler warning aheadThe first 16 episodes of the series strongly hint at the idea that we are watching a origin story on how the protagonist becomes the main enemy of the series (Demon Lord) that the heroes ultimately face in the future,...only to backtrack on that in ways that I think ruined the story's uniqueness.The series really likes to play with misdirection, as well as how she's perceived by others versus how she perceives herself and the rest of the world (seeing herself and the heroes as chibi characters).The prospect of seeing the rise of an enemy that fundamentally views things differently than everyone else would have been a really interesting idea to explore. The fact they abandoned that idea and have her become little more than a lackey for the actual villain completely ruins the story for me.Side note: the animation in the initial episodes is pretty strong but continually gets worse over time, especially in that same last third - with the final two episodes consisting almost entirely of Berserk (2016) levels of trash CGI.Overall a decent enough way to kill some time, but plenty of other isekai adaptations do this better.8/10 for the first 16 episodes, 5/10 for the final 8 episodes. only to backtrack on that in ways that I think ruined the story's uniqueness.The series really likes to play with misdirection, as well as how she's perceived by others versus how she perceives herself and the rest of the world (seeing herself and the heroes as chibi characters).The prospect of seeing the rise of an enemy that fundamentally views things differently than everyone else would have been a really interesting idea to explore.

In the manga they've mentioned the other reincarnated students all of twice. Never showing them, only alluding to them. I also only read in English, so I'm sure the source material in Japanese is further along. The manga focuses solely on the MC's story and how she has to survive as a low-rank spider, with death...and doom lurking around every corner. Great, but really short-sided which becomes glaringly apparent as the story progresses. So, good on the anime. 8/10Art: I personally have tried getting past CGI, especially with all the great CGI shows out there- BeastStars Land of the Lustrous, etc... but CGI most certainly doesn't do this show the justice I feel it deserves. I understand the need for it, though, and won't gripe at an actual anime adaptation of something I enjoy, so 7/10.Sound: It does a great job of creating the overall mood for the [sub]story, MC the spider, which is mostly supposed to be comical. More on that in a bit, but the running gags are heightened and the short quips are emphasized. Conversely, I don't think the OST does much for when the MC is in serious danger. The music allows no real tension to last more than a few scenes, which is disappointing. 6/10Character: Now, this is my real gripe with the show. The voice actress/adaptation of writing. I can forgive CGI, poor sound track choices, and even a frayed plot. But, for the love of God, please pick a different voice actress or give her a better script. Literally either, preferably both. As aforementioned, the whole point of MC's story is to be comical. Albeit dark comedy, we're supposed to find the comedy in this unfortunate spider's journey of survival to be relatable or at the very least witty. It's not. All jokes are delivered flat, and her rambunctious nature is really blown out of proportion. She's screaming every other second, and ramping up punchline after punchline that is hitting so far below the mark it's cringey to watch. 4/10Thus drops my enjoyment of the show to a 6/10. Overall, it has potential. If they can stick to a coherent plot, that really does have enjoyable layers, and allow the MC's intellect to shine for more than a few frames a scene, they can end this season off on a high note!

The main character ""Kumoko"" is a very interesting and diverse character that is absolutely hilarious to follow. Her combined sense of satire and dark humor is what initially drew me into the show. The plot is also very nice as the story is about a whole class of reincarnated students rather than your typical 1 isekai mc. The timeline of the story is somewhat confusing at first but after a few episodes in, you start to notice the clues that they try to drop. An interesting and...unique way of story telling that I personally enjoyed. The voice acting is godly, number 1 credits go to the Kumoko\'s va, Aoi Yuuki for doing an absolutely stunning job as a crazy funny and goofy spider that we all love. I do believe she also sang the EDs which were all banger.Now, after all those positives, let\'s get down to the worst of the worst of this show. It\'s not perfect by any means and there are other flaws which I won\'t go into detail as personally I do not find them to be very significant. But the CGI is something I cannot stay silent about. While I understand the need for CGI to save time and money, when done correctly, CGI can be a game changer. Example is UFOTABLE and their brilliant usage of CG and regular art to combine and form magnificent scenes. This show was the complete opposite of that. While I was cool with the CGI on Kumoko and even some monsters, they took it too far when it comes to everyone else, especially the humans. I mean I should\'ve expected it from a show that did the Berserk abomination but I was just so disappointed. The show would have been great 9/10 or even higher if it wasn\'t for the CGI. Art was nice but damn thing was ruined by the constant usage of CGI even at times where the characters don\'t even need to do any movement.Overall I think this show is a definite watch for those who want something new and fresh out of the isekai genre. Or if they just want to watch the daily struggles and goofy monologues of a derpy spider, than this is up their alley too.

Art was nice but damn thing was ruined by the constant usage of CGI even at times where the characters don\'t even need to do any movement.Overall I think this show is a definite watch for those who want something new and fresh out of the isekai genre. Or if they just want to watch the daily struggles and goofy monologues of a derpy spider, than this is up their alley too. Just try to get through the CGI...though it is understandable if you can\'t.', 'As is often the anime has potential but completely fumbles the ball leaving you frustrated and empty:Mid-season the story shifts focus from the intriguing features of itself, actively skipping the biggest points of interest, just to force you to watch a 3 episode battle between 10 cardboard cutouts talk and hit each other on repeat the whole time saying nothing. The ""ending"" episodes feel rushed, which is wild considering 5 episodes of runtime is spent on an equivalent of a bucket of gravel having a sidequest, which could be summarized in half an episode. There are over 12 main side characters and aside...4 the rest just breathe. Several times someone pops into existence for a couple of seconds to never contribute to the story again as the same dialogue gets recycled each time. You could melt the entire side cast into 4 characters and you\'d still not have enough lines and actions to have more than one describable character, they\'re just that paper thin.If MC didn\'t narrate her each breath the majority of the show would be silent. Most of the show is long stretches of describing what someone is doing out loud once in a while broken up by info dumps. Thus the pacing gets completely wrecked both over all and in fights.The art quality isn\'t great to begin with but manages to sink into the deep ocean where light shan\'t be found, somehow wasting the animation budget on the most inconsequential scenes and using mostly static images for the most important battles in the story. I could write a dissertation on how ugly the show is in all visual aspects of it.The sound design is non-existent, and the outros are actual noise.I wouldn\'t watch this because you might actually get interested in the premise and end up sorely disappointed when it\'s yanked from under your nose.

(probably not) On the other hand, the light novels for this series are certainly worth reading, as they rival some of the best isekais with good content, and world-building.Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? is a story about a girl who when isekai'd, wakes up as a spider. It's a foreign concept, but the show elaborates on this concept and builds an intriguing world and environment for the main character to interact with.The show has two stories: The human side: A generic isekai; and the spider side: an all-out battle shonen. The spider side is infinitely more...entertaining, but at least the human side provides some world-building and acts as a foil to the events going on for the main character, Kumoko.Now onto the problem. (Preface: I don't hate CGI, I hate bad CGI)Overall the story is good, however, the animation itself is not. The anime itself suffers from a heavy reliance on CGI that is poorly done, and the final episode was even delayed due to the first draft of it being so bad they had to do it over. (The second draft was probably the best episode of the series) The fight pacing and camera were all over the place, and at points, I would have rather had them use a still frame than the CGI that was in the episode. The animation that was done, however, was inconsistent. Some episodes were okay, and others were very wierd. It's very obvious that multiple different groups worked on this project with very little cohesion between them. entertaining, but at least the human side provides some world-building and acts as a foil to the events going on for the main character, Kumoko.Now onto the problem.

He only cares about his pride and doesn't even think for a moment about what is actually right and wrong, if what he knows is actually the truth.Most of the episodes focused on the humans were just...boring, they felt like a waste of time. boring, they felt like a waste of time."", ""I haven't read the manga, but i watched the anime and honestly i feel like it was an absolute missed potential. This anime shows pretty decent signs of competent writing and world building but ultimately turns out to be a hot garbage. It's starts as basic isekai story, if you haven't guessed it already from the cover. Here are problems qith this anime:Story:A really good start but ends up being an absolute mess. The main protagonist story is actually very competent but then they add a human and elf side of the story. That part is annoying, filled with pot holes and the characters...are doing things that are absolutely unnecessary.  They also add snips of their pre-reincarnation life which makes no sense to me. Nothing from that life and the events in the actual isekai story line have any connection. What they used to be, doesn't effect them in anyway in this story except for two characters: the protagonist and a teacher/elf character. They also lose focus time to time and forget about the central story. If they jave only focused on the spider protagonists, the story would have been actually good.Character: I found not even a single character is likeable. Every single one of them is extremely one dimensional and has literally no growth, including the protagonist. One dimensional characters do work in light hearted stories, but they add some mix of dark and seriousness to it, which left me in a conflicted feeling.Art: art was decent in quality but basic. some of the CGI scenes were ugly but most of them were passable. character designs are absolutely basic. Each character is designed with little to no inspiration. They look like background characters of a any low budget isekai anime. but they were drawn with some care. Majority of the action scenes are CGI mixed with a few sakuga. Monster designs are actually pretty competent.world building: actually this is one of the only few saving grace of the enemy that didnt make me give it less score. World building is pretty decent. skills and leveling, relation of different monster and other habitants were well explined. This few flares of competence makes me believe the anime story had outer influence on top of the writer.I believe they could have made it a very enjoyable anime if they only focused on spider. Stories around the spider is actually decently written and competemtly presented. but with the rest cast of character being unlikable, unexplained and uninteresting, flushing out their story plays a detrimental role to the anime. They attempt to add some edgy dark humour coupled with a few body horror (although i unfortunately watched the censored), but i found them stale. through out the time i was watching anime my face has been blank and expressionless.

Great"" and proceed to check it out, but some how the first few episodes are actually good! Well buckle up because there are some issues that will soon appear.Story:Some how I\'ve gotten this far and have only enjoyed the scenes where our favorite spider waifu Kumoko have appeared. The way the story is told is so complicated that you kind of stop caring about the shit that\'s going on in the background and only care about our favorite spider friend. This story...is told in 2 timelines and I\'m not gonna lie, trying to understand that there is 2 timelines at first is really hard because they seem like they tie together and then they don\'t. But if you don\'t understand what\'s happening then I\'ll put it like this; The events that taking place regarding Kumoko are 15 years in the past, Where as the events that take place with the rest of the class is the ""present"". This has led to so much assuming and other bullshit that you really don\'t know and don\'t care what happens next unless it\'s something retaining to Kumoko. This anime should really just be called I\'m a spider half the time, because it\'s only half the time that we actually get to see Kumoko. The ""present"" story line is just way too basic and over done that it\'s not worth my time explaining it and your time reading it. Kumoko is really the only saving grace of this anime, and it sucks because we only see her half the time. This story would be 8/10 for me if it wasn\'t for shitty basic isekai bullshit that occurs in the ""present"". So my final rating for story is 6/10.Art:Well its seems like a budget anime. The hand drawn scenes are nice but there is a ton of CGI used. I\'m not the person who gets upset about CGI, so I really don\'t care. I think it\'s a great way to get episodes out on a budget, as long as it\'s not over used or over done.Sound:Openings and endings are great songs!Overall sound effects are either funny or kinda over used. Again I\'m not really picky about that shit so it\'s your preference.The score/ost is again kinda basic. It\'s your typical isekai anime.Characters:Kumoko is great, unique and has so much character that you can quite literally break her down into multiple characters(Wink Wink).But aside from that everyone else just seems like your usual Isekai tropes.There is a dude who thinks he\'s powerful and limitless because he was reborn in a video game like world.There is the dude who got lucky and was born into royalty, but also is strong hearted like a hero.(He also has someone to look up to who dies)and the blah blah blah it\'s basic isekai tropes.Enjoyment:Again the main story, I really couldn\'t care about. The only thing keeping me from dropping this isekai anime is Kumoko.

An interesting title with an interesting premise, and a promising future. To be frank, when I first heard of this anime, I was not really that interested in it, but that changed as I got to be acquainted with our main nameless character, often called Kumoko by us viewers. Unfortunately, for the most part, the rest of the anime did not live up to expectations, but I did enjoy at least some of what they gave me.Story: 4Giving the story a 4 here, because as a story, it makes sense. A class of students is randomly reincarnated, most as...magical students of differing status in a magic school, but one as a Spider in a random cave somewhere, creating two separate storylines. In a world filled with Demons on the brink of war with humanity, our main characters are caught up in the crossfire and must survive. Interesting enough premise, but for the most part executed atrociously. There are a lot of moving parts to the story that do not mesh well together, and a lack of emphasis is placed on it because most things are told to us rather than shown, creating a lack of interest.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSThis is not helped by the introduction of the separate timelines. When we find out that Kumoko's story takes place 15 years before everyone else's, it throws everything in the story into disarray. Who does what becomes confusing, characters motivations and characteristics no longer make sense. Characters we thought had just appeared in the world knowing nothing about it, we now know have spent 15 years in it. Their lack of knowledge on certain subjects makes no sense, and their personalities remaining as if they were high schoolers yesterday also hurts the story.END OF SPOILERS END OF SPOILERS END OF SPOILERSFor the most part tho, the story... works. It keeps a general interest, even though it's not that interesting with the way it's executed, but that is in part, mostly due to our next topic.Characters: 6Now we move onto Kumo Desuga's biggest strength and biggest weakness; its characters. Fortunately for the show, Kumoko, our main character, is a very likable and interesting protagonist. Expressive and funny, she entertains us throughout any bit she is in, despite being in arguably less interesting circumstances than every other character; while the other reincarnations are trying to detangle government conspiracies, fight demons, and become powerful warriors, she is trying to find her way out of a cave with a spider's body. She makes funny jokes, comes to conclusions in interesting ways, and uses her intelligence to overcome the obstacles in front of her. Everything she does is flooded with her character unbelievably well, making her, genuinely, the only reason I was able to get through the show because every other character in the series is substantially worse than her.When I say every other character is a bland, distasteful cardboard cutout, I mean it. Motivation, interests, dislikes, backstories, you name it, the characters were missing it. All of the other characters lacked characterization and because of it, everything the characters did, every decision they made, lacked any weight. Shun, our secondary main character had to be the worst. Typical Gary Stu trying to do the right thing just because. And don't even get me started on the other main cast who, to be honest, I can't even think of character traits for cause they were unbearably uninteresting. Most of the time they were on screen they baby-fed us plot, while characters acted out and did dumb things for no particular reason to create conflict. Any seemingly interesting characters we saw got barely any screentime. Only one main character gets a moment of characterization, but it's about 20 episodes into the show when I already didn't care about them. It was honestly god awful, and it didn't help that they were always on screen when Kumoko was not, making me dislike them more than I already did. This was a huge blow to the plot, because not only was I watching something uninteresting, but I was watching characters I didn't like do uninteresting things. An extra episode could've been given to spend more time with the characters to make us like them more, but alas...Art: 4This was Kumo Desuga's second-biggest weakness. To get the first thing out of the way, the designs for most of the main cast and any other human-like species were pretty mediocre. Aside from a few, like Aria's, Sophia's, or Fei's, none were really memorable. The monster designs were a lot better, but even they were hurt by our more important matter; the directing. The directing, In this show, Has to be some of THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN. And before you make assumptions, it wasn't the CGI. In fact, the CGI was the only good part of the animation. Any time that the anime was 2d animated, it was always directed terribly. Characters were often cut off in weird camera angles. Walking shots would be weird, and backdrops often dismorphed. It would annoy me to no end every time someone would be talking and out of nowhere another character would move in front of them covering their whole face, which I HOPE was not a way to save budget from animating mouths, which almost never lined up with voice lines by the way, and the reflection shot... If I had a dollar for every time someone's face was reflected in an object for like 20 seconds, I'd have like 30 bucks, which is too many. and the fight scenes... oh. They were terrible. Every 2d animated fight scene looked like they were just slapping comic book frames and random color splashes together and hoping it looked animated. And the CG animation, while a lot better, was not good, especially when they animated 2d and 3d at the same time!? Like Why!? If you had just done 3d animation the whole time, I would've been okay with it. Every time CG was in a 2d shot, it looked terrible. And not to mention, during any fight scene that didn't involve Kumoko, I could never tell what was going on; characters would be in one shot, and then not, and then they'd be right behind one character, then 20 feet away, and then someone would be on the floor and in the air at the same time? It was tough to watch. But at least the Kumoko fight scenes were good. 4, moving on.Sound: 4Not much to say here. The sound design was terrible. Music was unmemorable, can only think of a few of Kumoko's ost's that I actually liked, but a lot of the rest didn't fit the area or mood well. Also, I could probably find 70 to 80% of the SFX they used on free stock media websites, which would probably explain the lack of sound effects for pretty much everything. Clothes jostling, footsteps, attacks, and for even just nature, there was nothing to be heard. Was a lot of empty noise. Voice acting did the best with what they were given. Kumoko's did by far the best, but she did better than everyone else cause she had more and better lines to work with, so...Loved both openings and endings tho, the endings especially. Kumoko's voice actor sung both, and she did a stellar job.Overall: 6Giving the overall show a 6. I liked half of the show, the half that Kumoko was in. She really kept me entertained, made everything she interacted with interesting, and kept me invested. The rest of the show... not so much. So Kumoko gets 5/5, everyone else gets 1/5 so 6/10 baby. Wanna recommend this show but I wouldn't get your hopes up. magical students of differing status in a magic school, but one as a Spider in a random cave somewhere, creating two separate storylines. In a world filled with Demons on the brink of war with humanity, our main characters are caught up in the crossfire and must survive. Interesting enough premise, but for the most part executed atrociously. There are a lot of moving parts to the story that do not mesh well together, and a lack of emphasis is placed on it because most things are told to us rather than shown, creating a lack of interest.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSThis is not helped by the introduction of the separate timelines. When we find out that Kumoko's story takes place 15 years before everyone else's, it throws everything in the story into disarray. Who does what becomes confusing, characters motivations and characteristics no longer make sense. Characters we thought had just appeared in the world knowing nothing about it, we now know have spent 15 years in it. Their lack of knowledge on certain subjects makes no sense, and their personalities remaining as if they were high schoolers yesterday also hurts the story.END OF SPOILERS END OF SPOILERS END OF SPOILERSFor the most part tho, the story... works. It keeps a general interest, even though it's not that interesting with the way it's executed, but that is in part, mostly due to our next topic.Characters: 6Now we move onto Kumo Desuga's biggest strength and biggest weakness; its characters. Fortunately for the show, Kumoko, our main character, is a very likable and interesting protagonist. Expressive and funny, she entertains us throughout any bit she is in, despite being in arguably less interesting circumstances than every other character; while the other reincarnations are trying to detangle government conspiracies, fight demons, and become powerful warriors, she is trying to find her way out of a cave with a spider's body. She makes funny jokes, comes to conclusions in interesting ways, and uses her intelligence to overcome the obstacles in front of her. Everything she does is flooded with her character unbelievably well, making her, genuinely, the only reason I was able to get through the show because every other character in the series is substantially worse than her.When I say every other character is a bland, distasteful cardboard cutout, I mean it. Motivation, interests, dislikes, backstories, you name it, the characters were missing it. All of the other characters lacked characterization and because of it, everything the characters did, every decision they made, lacked any weight. Shun, our secondary main character had to be the worst. Typical Gary Stu trying to do the right thing just because. And don't even get me started on the other main cast who, to be honest, I can't even think of character traits for cause they were unbearably uninteresting. Most of the time they were on screen they baby-fed us plot, while characters acted out and did dumb things for no particular reason to create conflict. Any seemingly interesting characters we saw got barely any screentime. Only one main character gets a moment of characterization, but it's about 20 episodes into the show when I already didn't care about them. It was honestly god awful, and it didn't help that they were always on screen when Kumoko was not, making me dislike them more than I already did. This was a huge blow to the plot, because not only was I watching something uninteresting, but I was watching characters I didn't like do uninteresting things. An extra episode could've been given to spend more time with the characters to make us like them more, but alas...Art: 4This was Kumo Desuga's second-biggest weakness. To get the first thing out of the way, the designs for most of the main cast and any other human-like species were pretty mediocre. Aside from a few, like Aria's, Sophia's, or Fei's, none were really memorable. The monster designs were a lot better, but even they were hurt by our more important matter; the directing. The directing, In this show, Has to be some of THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN. And before you make assumptions, it wasn't the CGI. In fact, the CGI was the only good part of the animation. Any time that the anime was 2d animated, it was always directed terribly. Characters were often cut off in weird camera angles. Walking shots would be weird, and backdrops often dismorphed. It would annoy me to no end every time someone would be talking and out of nowhere another character would move in front of them covering their whole face, which I HOPE was not a way to save budget from animating mouths, which almost never lined up with voice lines by the way, and the reflection shot... If I had a dollar for every time someone's face was reflected in an object for like 20 seconds, I'd have like 30 bucks, which is too many. and the fight scenes... oh. They were terrible. Every 2d animated fight scene looked like they were just slapping comic book frames and random color splashes together and hoping it looked animated. And the CG animation, while a lot better, was not good, especially when they animated 2d and 3d at the same time!? Like Why!? If you had just done 3d animation the whole time, I would've been okay with it. Every time CG was in a 2d shot, it looked terrible. And not to mention, during any fight scene that didn't involve Kumoko, I could never tell what was going on; characters would be in one shot, and then not, and then they'd be right behind one character, then 20 feet away, and then someone would be on the floor and in the air at the same time? It was tough to watch. But at least the Kumoko fight scenes were good. 4, moving on.Sound: 4Not much to say here. The sound design was terrible. Music was unmemorable, can only think of a few of Kumoko's ost's that I actually liked, but a lot of the rest didn't fit the area or mood well. Also, I could probably find 70 to 80% of the SFX they used on free stock media websites, which would probably explain the lack of sound effects for pretty much everything. Clothes jostling, footsteps, attacks, and for even just nature, there was nothing to be heard. Was a lot of empty noise. Voice acting did the best with what they were given. Kumoko's did by far the best, but she did better than everyone else cause she had more and better lines to work with, so...Loved both openings and endings tho, the endings especially. Kumoko's voice actor sung both, and she did a stellar job.Overall: 6Giving the overall show a 6. I liked half of the show, the half that Kumoko was in.

The rest of the cast however has neither jokes nor much in the way of emotional arcs going for them, making their plot mainly about the show's overarching mystery (which I won't go into details about in this review).Having two separate plotlines that don't really intersect also makes the show feel a little disjointed; it is very much like two shows in one, with the two plots varying pretty widely in tone. Overall, this would be a really good show if only the characters in this group were as consistently fun or had as much personality as the nominal protagonist. Unfortunately, they all play their respective archetypes very straight.Kumoko, for her part, is a protagonist that spends most of her story alone, with no one to talk to and no real relationships to other characters, which makes her own side of the show's storytelling inherently difficult. Aoi Yuuki plays the character with extreme heightened intensity, often motor-mouthing or screaming through her lines; basically, she's played as a joke side character, but she has most of her scenes entirely to herself. It's mostly a good performance, but some will definitely find it more grating than endearing.Visually, this show is a bit all over the place. Kumoko's own design and animation are great, but the world she inhabits is often muddled or bland. The character designs are not particularly inspired; this show definitely suffers from the tendency to make characters visually bland when their personality is already bland. Like a lot of generic-fantasy isekai shows, the art here doesn't really do much in service of the storytelling, which is a shame. The quality of the animation is a bit all over the place, especially when it comes to various kaiju-sized monsters in the show that look like they belong in a different anime entirely.All this is to say that in spite of these flaws, this show is often funny and has a genuinely interesting plot with satisfying reveals and left-field twists. But it relies mostly on making the viewer wonder what will happen next.

The main character is the only thing of interest in this show. I liked the idea that she becomes worshipped as some sort of deity, but she can be excessively annoying.

The universe for this story is incredibly compelling, gritty, and has a cruel realism to it that highlights difficult ethical problems in interesting ways, and the full story has character growth to fit that backdrop.

I watched the anime first and really liked it, then I read the light novels, and now I’m re-watching the anime. My second impression is that they made a lot of concessions to the details in the writing of the anime that make a...lot of difference.

This is a masterpiece.The anime starts with Kumoko realizing that she became a spider. It's quite fun but also not that amazing in my opinion. Plenty of other isekais start the same. And they're always fun in the beginning, until they're not anymore.But what I really like about this anime is the parallel between Kumoko's life and her classmates' life. I saw many reviewers dislike the scenes of Kumoko's classmates. Well, I beg to differ. The contrasting scenes between Kumoko's life and her classmates' life emphasize the hardships that...our main lead has to go through. It's unfair but it is what it is. Those scenes also kind of explain why most of her classmates stay idealistic and naive, different from Kumoko who has to abandon morals in order to survive. They get reborn as a prince/nobles/whatever, so it's understandable why they see the world through a rose-colored lens.The people I find most interesting is their teacher (i forgot her name) and that boy whose brother is a hero (i also forgot his name, sorry). They're both hypocrites, to be honest. But to a certain extent, I sympathize with that boy. Holy shit, his family got murdered, he's betrayed by his brother, the person behind the murder of his family is his former classmate, and his old best friend betray him. If I were him, I would certainly lose my shit. My opinion of the teacher, however, is a bit conflicted. I can understand her wanting her students to be safe. But the method she choose isn't the best. On the other hand, watching her students trying to kill each other makes me sympathize with her sentiment.The plot twists are also the most amazing element of this anime. They're so subtle and it didn't feel forced at all. Instead, you start to question yourself. The series indeed never trick you. You just assume things based on what you see.Overall, I think the buildup of this anime is amazing. It starts out just like any other isekai but the story is just mindblowing.

But is it wildly entertaining and have some very well rounded features to its world? Yes.This show was not at all what I expected when I first picked it up, and only at the behest of my brother who insisted we watch it together. Honestly, it was a lot more fun than I expected.The first superficial point of critique I want to address is the animation / CGI. It\'s by no means horrendous, but it definitely doesn\'t help - especially in the last four episodes of the series where...it arguably mattered the most. There are some major animation flaws that should not have slipped past. From piercing wounds that look like they were made in paper, to the lifeless looking faces and animatronic movements of CGI characters, this show has its on screen problems. Stack that on top of the needless amounts of panning in on faces and doing close up shots of characters, and you have something that makes you feel off just by looking at it.Fortunately, this show has other features that Make it actually worth watching. For one, the world has that game aspect to it. Now, that\'s not exactly revolutionary, as it\'s pretty much a standard feature of isekai. But what this show does is it actually gives you a good reason for that System to exist. It ties in with the world at large, and even becomes a central point of the plot. Not many Isekais actually take the time to explain why they have skills and levels and stuff in a convincing way.The story ends up being pretty interesting, although, not nearly as deep or meaningful as other shows. Turns out this world is bound for destruction, and the system is basically in place to suck the life out of the people living there in order to keep the world alive. So what does our reluctant hero decide to do? Save the world, of course... by committing genocide. It\'s very much an anti-hero story, where the protagonists are ruthless and willing to go to any means to get things done. it\'s a refreshing break from the ""I\'m a boy scout goody-two-shoes"" Saitama level heroes isekai usually hucks our way. It\'s also refreshing to see the protagonist start with a leg down in the world and getting plopped in as a weak ass little spider and in the most dangerous place in the whole world at that. Little Spider has to grind away and pay in blood, sweat, and tears for the powers she acquires. Battles are not won so much based on her powers but on her tactics and strategy - again a refreshing break from the One Punch Protagonists we usually see.There\'s also a good bit of reversal in this series, both obvious and subtle, like how the guy with your stereotypical isekai protagonist Deus ex Machina powers is pretty much a side show in this series. Or how about the main character being a crazy talkative goofball on the inside but lacking any social skill at all and thus being cold and silent on the outside. It corrects a lot of problems I have with isekai in general, and presents an entertaining story about a reluctant hero taking the most logical and effective route toward saving the world.In the end, my problems are almost entirely visual. The story may seem odd at first, but the more you learn about the world the more said oddities begin to make sense. So I actually like the story. But whoever animated this did not do a quality check on the final product. Yeesh: I give it a 7 it arguably mattered the most. There are some major animation flaws that should not have slipped past.

Battles are not won so much based on her powers but on her tactics and strategy - again a refreshing break from the One Punch Protagonists we usually see.There\'s also a good bit of reversal in this series, both obvious and subtle, like how the guy with your stereotypical isekai protagonist Deus ex Machina powers is pretty much a side show in this series. Or how about the main character being a crazy talkative goofball on the inside but lacking any social skill at all and thus being cold and silent on the outside. It corrects a lot of problems I have with isekai in general, and presents an entertaining story about a reluctant hero taking the most logical and effective route toward saving the world.In the end, my problems are almost entirely visual. The story may seem odd at first, but the more you learn about the world the more said oddities begin to make sense. So I actually like the story. But whoever animated this did not do a quality check on the final product. Yeesh: I give it a 7', ""Every turn this anime takes is a left, yet you never end up where you think it would go, but not in a bad way.The premise is interesting and it's fun when it's being executed but there are some lulls in the story. The magic/power system is also inconsistent and kinda hand-wavy.Overall I would say the plot is a 7/10, some good plot twists and revelations.The animation is a 5/10, middle of the road, the 3d models are pretty good looking and the fights are well choregraphed but the inconsistency in the lighting and the stiffness of the character's movements and expressions...leaves some things to be desired.The dialog is a 6.5/10, the MC's dialog is always good for a laugh but the last episodes have a little to much dialog from the secondary characters that takes away from the fights. leaves some things to be desired.The dialog is a 6.5/10, the MC's dialog is always good for a laugh but the last episodes have a little to much dialog from the secondary characters that takes away from the fights."", ""So I started with the show knowing it would mainly be based around the spider.   Quickly I watched it feeling a lot like other Isekai's especially reincarnated as a slime.   It was generic, it was done before, there was nothing new about it really even how there were different levels of skills, they just extended it, and robbed the pokemon evolution idea but were lazy on how different many evolutions were, and added more layers to try and not make it look too quick.So at this point, i was already starting to think, just another of them, then we hear how...is a class full of people, and most have become and are weak, for being human, as better of being a monster, who would more likely to be slane by masses of humansWe add two Sophia's alive as baby and adult as well which made the reincarnation system even more stupid and the idea of immortality for the spider, and the ability to lay eggs to permanently re-hatch.   When your OP already, you just think, this is getting dumber.Add the administrators who are gods on top and their control of skills, and you start thinking, this show ain't that great,    If they had just played it as gods, and led people different ways, or explained the situation, etc, would have been one thing.   Creating a system for no one to touch you, and you intervene and no gods react was just stupid.Then we add the ending which trumped the stupid as mechas appear etc and modern technology, and you just think if they kept to fewer ideas, the show could of been good.    It had some great comedy, some interesting fighting, and a range of monsters.    It still kept some secrets despite the taboo skill, but everyone being friends and walking off into the sunset, no matter what they did, kinda seemed lame and more designed for girls, especially with the two strongest girls.It was ok to watch and easily watchable, but it was nothing but a derivative pile, of what everyone else has done, with a bit of reincarnated as slime-type humor when rimuru had no major form.   Art was very good at stages, the sound was fine, character development was poor as had 26 characters to explore and hardly knew they even existed for many episodes.So i am being generous with a 5, as floats between 4-5 for me/ is a class full of people, and most have become and are weak, for being human, as better of being a monster, who would more likely to be slane by masses of humansWe add two Sophia's alive as baby and adult as well which made the reincarnation system even more stupid and the idea of immortality for the spider, and the ability to lay eggs to permanently re-hatch.

It started out alright like any other isekai anime, but turned out to be a letdown. Despite being a series that is titled around ""being reincarnated as a spider in another world"", the worst part of the series... is that there isn\'t enough of THAT.Half the story is split for the spider protagonist and half of it is spent with another cast of main human characters and they just... aren\'t interesting. While you can tolerate them initially, as the series goes on, you eventually dread every episode they\'re on screen and just hoping to go back to...spider MC.Of course, not to mention the production issues with this show... while perfectly fine initially, as the series went on, it just became obvious they were running out of budget and there was just more CGI... janky ones at that. And ironically, that CGI was usually on the human side of the story, so whenever you were experiencing the human story, you had worse art and worse story!Fundamentally, I feel like this series has a lot of potential and could\'ve been great--the MC is crazy interesting and I think the most interesting part of the series. However, it\'s unfortunate that she never gets enough screen time, and it goes to show that when you try to make a cast of side characters take up as much screen time as the main character, it just doesn\'t go well (at least in this case... I\'ve seen stories where it could work). spider MC.Of course, not to mention the production issues with this show... while perfectly fine initially, as the series went on, it just became obvious they were running out of budget and there was just more CGI... janky ones at that.

I've been reading the manga, and it gets even more wild than the show so far) It more than makes up for in personality. The one thing that matters the most to me, is characterization, and the main character is so much fun that her portion of the story was more than enough to make up for the (pretty boring in my opinion) second plotline. I did not enjoy the second plotline...aside from the times where it referenced the main plotline, which i must admit, was pretty cool. I did end up skipping a bit of the second plotline, so I cant claim that I am fully informed, but the second plotline does actually end up getting pretty wild at the end, so I guess it itself isn't all bad. aside from the times where it referenced the main plotline, which i must admit, was pretty cool.

Go watch Highschool DxD, story and visuals are way better.Story: 3/10 | Getting reincarnated as a spider was something new, but the story itself was wayyyy too shallow.Sound: 1/10 | Feels like at some point they just completly gave up on sounddesign, the fightscenes are flat, there's barely any sound. I kid you not. Imagine a dragon running through a cave, what do you expect to hear? Correct: Ton of bass, stomping, echoing, dust and rocks falling from the ceiling. But insted it just...sounds as if your neighbours doggo runs through their yard.Visuals: First 12 episodes 5/10, last 12 episodes 2/10 | Maybe it was due to corona, but the studio just switched to cheap looking renders, the fight scenes are more than repetitive, the CGI looks sloppy, colors just don't match aswell as the framerate switch from CGI to animated. I'm really disappointed to say the least after what I heard and read about the anime.I'd like to dive deeper into the story, but most of the times they just skip a lot of the deeper story segments. Not gonna lie, but the show was a waste of time imo. Could have been done better in 2 or 3 seasons with way more background and work on the visual and audio side, but ay, it is what it is. sounds as if your neighbours doggo runs through their yard.Visuals: First 12 episodes 5/10, last 12 episodes 2/10 | Maybe it was due to corona, but the studio just switched to cheap looking renders, the fight scenes are more than repetitive, the CGI looks sloppy, colors just don't match aswell as the framerate switch from CGI to animated.
